Perhaps my experiences are colored by a long lifetime of loving this game, but I have never found something that interests me more, that I can just sit down and play a few hours of and craft a life-story for my character, an entire persona. It's simple really, you are a pirate and the wide open world of the 1600's Carribean is yours for the plucking. The graphics are out of date, the controls are simplistic, and your crew will always get upset no matter how many famous pirates and ships you sink, steal, or scuttle. You can't win, mainly because there is no victory condition. You can save your family, you can get married, you can become the deadliest and most notorious man on the high seas, it's all up to you what you do, who you become, which beach you get marooned on, I love it, I've lived years loving it, I can't recommend this game enough.

You have this sort of "drive" to get a VERY good ship. So naturally, "Size Matters" kick in. You take your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sloop, attack a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ galleas and voila you think! Your ship can now house 32 cannons with a 200 man crew (I believe.) So you take your Galleas, you name it something like "Josephine" and drive it around. You keep your sloop with you or discard it, perhaps even sell it and you feel like Captain Jack Freaking Sparrow. Then you go into a tavern and the lovely barmaid informs you that there's a War Frigate out to kill ya, so you capture that. You now have 50 cannons, possible 400 crew, cargo hold of 128 ton and feel invincible. Then you drive your ship around and feel like the King of the World. That's how it usually is, and seems to be how most people play this game.\n\nIt's the wrong way. You start out, you take your Sloop and find a War Canoe. They can be found amongst the savage natives of the Caribbean. You board it with your sloop and acquire it. The next thing you do is to go into town and sell your cannons and your sloop. And everything that's not food. You wont be needing it. You have your War Canoe. You then go to the tavern and recruit the 48 people wanting to join you. Voila, full crew. And you have your War Canoe. The War Canoe is in fact the best ship in the entire game. "But Sir, what about when the English deploy a Ship of the Line to take me out?" You board it. They shoot at you? Well guess what, I hope your Mother taught you how to weave, for you'll be weaving your way around the cannonfire into the Ship. You board it at once the fight starts. If it's too much for you or you take a hit or two, you're in the fastest ship in the game. Turn around, sail away. Nothing can catch up to you. Oh no you wont have cannons, who needs it? Sugar, spice, goods? With your crew of 50 whatever you plunder from the ships in gold is way more than what you'd normally be due. You take your War Canoe, which you'll name something like "Arrow" or "Emma" and ram that thing into whatever comes your way. It's the best ship. Here's why:\n\n-You can bypass ship battles. This means more gold for you. And I personally found them tedious\n-Boarding is more manly\n-Your ship is the fastest in the game. Get a quest to escort a Governor from Mexico to Florida? Takes you 4 minutes.\n-Hunting some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that keeps your family hostage? Like hell he can outsail you.\n-Smaller Crew means fewer mouths to feed, and more gold for you when you divide the plunder.\n-With a big ship, you'll either shoot something dead while taking damage or see them board you without difficulty. Why be the prey?\n\n10/10 game would make my own War Canoe.","December 28, 2015","true","3.3"," 245 of 262 people (94%) found this review helpful 178 people found this review funny","94","245","262","178","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/3920/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","If you’re an older gamer, then you are more than likely familiar with Sid Meier’s Pirates. It was one of the first games to give you truly open-ended gameplay – you were free to sail under any flag, change allegiances, be a merchant or a pirate … the Caribbean was an open sea for you to explore. The gameplay was pretty straightforward, but it had an engaging quality to it that would cause you to lose yourself in the game for hours on end. Now the game has received a much overdue update and its basic design has withstood the test of time – the game is just as much fun as it ever was, if not more so.The premise of the game is simple: you’re a young buccaneer captain out to make your fortune on the Spanish Main. You’re also out to avenge the capture of you family and rescue them from indentured servitude, but it is really up to you whether or not you want to pursue their rescue. The game will rate your performance more highly if you do, but you can certainly simply concentrate on becoming a feared pirate and leave your family to fend for themselves. The game does not oblige you to do anything.Politics plays a large role in the game as it did in the Caribbean in the 17th Century. The four nations vying for dominance in the region constantly shift allegiances and move in and out of states of war. As an enterprising captain you need to take advantage of this and always be on the look out for new opportunities.The animations are detailed and you’ll see your sails react to the wind as you tack or come about, the wake kicked up by your ship, and even dolphins who come to play in that wake. While sailing the seas you’ll encounter other ships and as you approach you’ll see the flag of their nationality and the ship’s class. Battles on deck are abstracted to a sword dual between you and the enemy captain. You can select a rapier, long sword, or cutlass with which to fight, each of which is a trade off to some degree between speed and defense. You have three attack moves to choose from and a defensive move to counter each.The cities in the game are for far more than sacking. As you sail the Caribbean you’ll see the relative size of each city and be able to tell its relative wealth from the condition of the flag that flies above the town.When in town you have several locations that you can visit. Each town also has a shipwright who can repair your battle damage, buy your captured ships, or in some cases provide upgrades to your hull, sails, or cannons to aid your ship’s performance in battle. Speaking of treasure, it wouldn’t be a pirate game without buried treasure. At the lower difficulty levels maps are always complete and well-marked and it is simply a question of going to the right location and picking up your prize. At higher levels things get a bit trickier as you often have to make do with map fragments and must search for specific landmarks like an arched rock or a clump of dead trees to find the buried booty.Overall Pirates has that hard to pinpoint addictive quality to it that will keep you coming back. Hours will disappear as you strive to complete one more raid or get your next promotion. It’s a magical quality that’s missing in most games, and one that will keep you coming back to Pirates as other games come and go.","August 22, 2014","true","10.1"," 267 of 292 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","267","292","2","8"

It would be most accurate to describe this game as a collection of mini-games combined into a single experience. There's the land battle mini-game, the ship-combat mini-game, the dancing mini-game, and the fencing mini-game, all connected together by a sailing overworld. I hear a lot of people like the fencing and ship battles but dislike the land-battles and dancing. I liked all of it. And I don't often play musical rhythm games, either.\n\nI'll admit also that playing the whole game has a certain amount of nostalgia appeal for me as well. I played the original in the form of a demo when I was a kid, never got the chance to play the whole thing.

Added it to my steam queue figuring maybe I'd play it when I had nothing better to do. Fast forward a year later and lo and behold, I had nothing better to do, so I booted it up on a whim. I figured it would be a monumental waste of time. This was half right, however not the half I was expecting. This game is somewhat repetitive, sure. But it is deeply satisfying, and it took me a while to figure out why. You can play all kinds of naval war simulators, or sword battle fighting games that are much better than the mechanics of this game. But this had a depth come out of these simple mechanics that made the game a really cool experience. Moreover, this game fairly effectively makes you want to pursue non-combative game play. I'd never given much thought into wanting to dance in a video game before, but it was probably the most fun I'd had in a game, and it wasn't just the novelty. It's easy to make yourself feel like your character has a vested romantic relationship with the woman he is wooing and want to succeed in impressing her with your awesome button pressing skills.

After a mutiny that put you at the helm of your own ship, you and your pirate crew arrive in the Caribbean to find fortune as you seek to avenge your family from those that did it wrong.\n\nPros: Every tropes you ever saw about pirates are there: build your reputation and ranking with the four European factions, while also dealing with the clergy, the natives and the pirate community, compete against the most notorious pirates in history while using pieces of maps to find their buried treasure or the lost cities of gold, do ship-to-ship combat against raider, merchant, military or other pirate vessels, flirt with the governor's daughters by impressing her in the ballroom. The game is easy to pick up regardless of difficulty level, navigating, ship-to-ship combat and swordplay are simple. 27 different type of ships sail the sea, any of which can be captured, each with different storage and crew capacity, optimal wind angle, speed and turning speed. Ship-specific upgrades are available at various ports, capturing ships might get get you permanent specialists for your crew, a variety of items can be purchased in taverns. The graphics are bright and colorful and animations are smooth.\n\nCons: The graphics are showing their age. Sid Meier's Pirates! borders on the casual game, as it's basically a collection of multiple mini-games: fighting, dancing, ship-to-ship combat, swordplay, city sacking, all mini-games with little depth. City conquering strategy is extremely simplified, and the game lacks any realism of the hardships of being at sea. Capturing ships will become repetitive after a few playthrough. The map is always the same, varied only by the chosen timeline or occasional city conquest of a rival European faction.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nOverall, this is a fun game, and that's all it aims to be: fun. It isn't a seafaring simulator, it isn't an action sword-fighter, it isn't a trade simulator and definitively isn't a strategy game. If you're looking for a nice, easy and fun game worth its price, then I'll recommend you give Sid Meier's Pirates! a try!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","January 6, 2015","true","60.9"," 67 of 79 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","67","79","4","1"

It's also one of the very few pirate games I've ever played, so I dunno if my review will count for much.\n\nSurprisingly addicting open-world pirate game where you can go out and do random stuff, like rescue your family from this villain, go treasure hunting, attack other ships and/or settlements, acquire goods from one port and selling it at another port (trading), and even wooing (and eventually marrying) a random daughter of a govenor. There's fun mini games (although lots of people hate the dancing one) and you basically play until you grow too old to continue pirating. Keep watch of the morale of your crew at sea or they may end up deserting you!\n\nOnly bad thing I found with the game is that the main character whom you play as doesn't look manly enough for my liking, and while I like the dancing mini-games, it tends to go on for too long. If it was a shorter mini-game, it would've been much better.","December 8, 2013","true","7.6"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","45","47","0","2"

However, I still have no idea what the main objective is besides the fact that you're a pirate looking to save his family (that much is clear from the intro). As far as I know you don't have to follow the main quests or any of that really, you can just plunder riches or charm governors daughter until retirement.\n\nAfter about 3.5 hours, I'm still not bored with the pirate life.

You can get some info and supplies from that port and then you're off to sail around the Caribbian.  The ship controls feel fantastic, working with or against the wind, and there is strategy in what type of cannon shot you fire, round to damage a hull, chain to damage the sails, and grape to take out crew.  You also need to buy or raid supplies to keep your crew from a mutiny.\n\nCONTROLS:  Steering your ship and firing the cannons is very satisfying.  However the UI and map screens are clunky and seem like from an age prior to when this game was released.  The QTE cut scenes are obnoxious and repetitive but they can mostly be avoided altogether.\n\nSTORY:  You play as a young pirate who is trying to rescue his family and defeat some marquis villain.  This is a sandbox game so you’ll be creating your own story for the most part.  There's no way to customise your character other than your name and some stat bonuses (1 perk at the start and others with items), but you can captain any ship you can get your hands on and deck it out with upgrades.\n\nGRAPHICS:  The main graphics look Caribbean and still mostly hold up today and are certainly functional, but the cut scenes look dated.  You have to use your imagination a bit.  The highest screen resolution is 1152 x 864 and no widescreen.  It looks ok though, and there are ways to force the resolution if you want.\n\nPERFORMANCE:  Ran smoothly for me and I didn't encounter any problems.\n\nSOUND:  Excellent.  The sounds of the waves, creaking of the wooden ships, and shouts of your crew are some of the first things that come to mind thinking of this game.  I’m not a fan of the Simlish spoken dialect though.  The music is fitting and sets the cartoony pirate mood well.\n\nREPLAYABILITY:  Replay doesn’t get any better than this game.  However I haven’t actually finished the story yet, it's just fun to sail around and do your own thing.\n\nSIMILAR TO:  I don’t know, the Sims 2 mixed with Grand Theft Auto 1 and Port Royale?\n\nRECOMMENDED PURCHASE PRICE:  I don't see this on sale often but $10 is reasonable.\n\n\nSid Meier’s Pirates\nFiraxis Games 2004 (remake of 1987 original)\n\nRATING:  75/100","July 29, 2014","true","11.4"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

It is not, by any means, deep, but it's still enjoyable to mess around with.  You play the game as a pirate in the Caribbean pre-Johnny Depp.  You can play the game during various historical settings which basically have the effect of changing how much variety there is in terms of the different national factions.  The later you set the game, the more likely you'll see major French, Dutch, and English ports.  By contrast, in the earlier settings, it's far more Spanish-dominated.\n\nThis can have an effect on how you play the game.  With more factions, you have more ability to behave like a true pirate, sinking or taking vessels of various factions, and then doing the same to whomever they're at war with (and they're always at war with someone...).  When it's just the Spanish, you have to try playing a minigame where you sneak into the Spanish port, risking imprisonment.  Speaking of the minigames, they're generally good fun, if occasionally repetitive and annoying.  The dancing in particular can get tedious, but at least you're usually well rewarded.\n\nAs I mentioned, the game isn't particularly deep.  It's not as if you're running a wooden ship simulator.  The game's graphics are dated, but acceptable.  They were fortunately done in a "cartoony" style, so they age a bit better than supposedly cutting-edge visuals from the same era (2004), which now fall squarely into "uncanny valley" territory.\n\nAnyway, it's a good game, and usually available on Steam for dirt cheap.  You'll definitely get your $2-5 worth out of this title.","October 7, 2014","true","32.2"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","22","28","2","0"

While at first I had my doubts due to cartoonish graphics the game quickly won me over. It is a charming and addictive. The game consists of mutiple minigames (sword-fighting, sneaking into a city, dancing, sieging towns.) All of them are enjoyable even though they are really simple (not necessery easy though.) Your main goal is to travel around the carribean gaining wealth and prestige by acting as a coursair for 4 countries fighting over carribean. Additionally, you have famous pirates to defeat, family to rescue from cruel Baron SomethingSomething, hidden treasure to uncover and hidden inca temples to find. All added at the end in a score based system when you decide (or a forced at certain age) to retire.\nIt is a game I return for more every once in a while.\n\nThe only real problem with the game is its focus on using numpad, which you probably don't have if you play on laptop.

You won't believe how much fun it is.\n\nMost of the game is played in a top-down mode where you control a ship that can travel between ports buying and selling goods and engage in naval combat with other ships. Wind speed and direction play a role, but you can generally travel into the wind without the need for tacking. Your ship has up to three weapons which target the enemy ship's hull, crew, and sails. There are about 10ish ship upgrades, which you can buy at specific ports. You can capture extra ships and build a fleet, but you only ever control the flagship and the remaining ships just add extra crew and cargo.\n\nThe rest of the game consists of a number of minigames and dialog trees.\n\n- There is a sword fighting minigame that plays like a very basic fighting game. You mainly play this against enemy captains to capture their ships.\n\n- There is a dancing minigame where you must react to a sequence of quicktime events in order to win the hearts of maidens. This is not much fun and is the worst part of this otherwise excellent game.\n\n- There is a buried treasure minigame where you walk about on land looking for buried treasure.\n\nYou need to divvy up your loot with your crew periodically, at which point you lose your fleet and most of your gold and crew. You'll advance via the items you acquire and your quest progression, but much of the rest of your possessions will come and go over the course of the game.\n\nThere is a plot about rescuing your kidnapped family, but this isn't really a story-driven game. Most of the actual gameplay is about capturing ships and searching for treasure.\n\nYaar!\n\nView my other reviews here","May 21, 2015","true","18.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

The different ships are quite interesting, though I haven't yet found a giant grand frigate or anything yet, it is still quite captivating. The various quests add depth into the game, and you will find yourself dueling for the win, litterally!\n\nThe only drawback to all of this that I have found is the wind. You may find yourself going quickly in one direction, and slowly in another, while your crew may be near starving, or you are badly in need of repairs, or you're out of crew members. Also, some of the fights that i've done are quite annoying, as the computer will block your strike, and counter several times in a row, effectively leading to a loss.\n\nAside from that, this game is great, and captivating for anyone who enjoys the era of being able to plunder the royal navies, or capture ports for another country.

However there is a time limit as you age in this game (yes you age)\n\nI have to say by today's standards, it's quite linear but for a game of it's age, I must say it certainly stood the test of time, and if you have some extra cash leftover, pick it up, simple clean fun that's just good for a casual gaming experience.\n\nI'd recommend it for sure, but only if you'd like to try something casual for a change. 6/10","October 17, 2014","true","13.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","11","15","3","0"

The game play is simple and fun. You are a pirate sailing the Caribbean. You sail, sword fight, capture ships, woo maidens, and dig up buried treasure; all while trying to locate and save your long lost family. No two game plays are alike, and I've never encountered another pirate game quite like this one... Lord knows I tried.\n\nBecause I am 6, my Pirate is the notorious captain Tite Hassole. Captain Hassole is a proud duke in the Spanish armada, until it suits him. He then raided the city Margarita about 3 times and turned it into the Dutch Port of Margarita, because reasons. Tite was also a bit of a player and while he would beat a hasty retreat from any plain governor’s daughter, at least 6 times, Tite Hassole gave all the crew's money away to get a ring for a lovely lady or two.\n\nA constant issue for me is the repetitiveness of the sword fighting, and to top it off I'm not that great at it. It becomes essential to know how to sword fight well, especially in the late game, but I never got over my "smash slash really quick" routine.\n\nAll in all a solid game, well worth the money and real nostalgia trip for me.","November 28, 2015","true","63.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","0"

It's incredibly male-centric, you can't play some rockin pirate queen and romance the mayors of towns or their sons - and that's a shame.\n\nThe game could use some basic mod tools to open it up for a new generation - especially since a ground-up remake is unlikely.\n\nSTILL - the gameplay itself is perfect.

Most of the main mechanics of the game have been copied over the years as flash games and freemium mobile games, but the 3D graphics and minigames in this version make it worth a few bucks if you like that sort of game. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but at $2.50 it's a good pickup and you're sure to get a couple of hours of fun out of it.\n\nJust as a side note, this game really wants you to use a numpad. It literally BEGS you to do so. I have been playing without, and while a little clunkier it isn't awful. The game has an onscreen numpad that you can click on to achieve the same effect. However, the game does turn on NumLock without telling you, and since my laptop keyboard doesn't have a NumLock button, I was very confused when my "p" key started typing "*". I had to pull up the onscreen keyboard to turn it off.

While this 'new' version is well over ten years old it's still such a wonderful and exciting game that only a pirate game of the highest caliber would be able to take it's position as Admiral of the fleet.\n\nWhat makes this such an incredible game is the sandbox aspect of it. The player can really pursue just about any path that pleases them. Would you like to honor your selected nation by protecting its cities from invasion, boosting its economy by plundering other nations trade goods, and making the seas a place feared for anyone that doesn't fly your flag? You can. Would you like to cast all allegiance aside and plunder the nations of their gold and goods? Go to it. Want to become a master dancer, have a wife in each corner of the map, and become the Romeo of the high seas? Your ship awaits. If you want to create a massive fleet of warships and attack towns you can do that as well. Sid Meier's Pirates is truly one of the most incredible sandbox experiences available, incredibly replayable, fun, fast, engaging, and the best pirate game available.\n\nHighest recommendations for anyone that enjoys this period of history, pirates, nautical adventures, and ballroom dancing.","March 21","true","18.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The audio and the visuals suit the game well and the addition of cut scenes enhance the games charm.\n\nWhile it may be nostalgia that draws me to this game, I still heartily recomend it.

As soon as you hit Swashbuckler however the game becomes a torment where everything from wind, your crew and even your family hates your guts and wishes to destroy you.\n\nThe final difficulty however isn't even mentioned by most players who can give you hundreds of strategies for Swashbuckler but not a single for Rogue. It really is just better to forget that this difficulty even exists. It will test your limits as it rips every shred of humanity from you until you're either begging for mercy or some kind of robotic killing machine of the colonial seas. No matter how good you are on Rogue the swordfight with the final boss in his fortress has been designed as a testing protocol for T-800 units instead of being a game for actual human beings to complete.\n\nOh and good luck with the dancing minigame.","March 28","true","74.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","5","7","7","0"

The only down side to this version compared to the original is that it seem to be to easy to just hang around one corner of the map/caribian and still get most of what you need - so unless you have the urge to get to all areas, then it is to easy to get caught just repeating the same area.

The ship mechanics, including the speed of wind and speed based on what type of ship your using. I have spent maybe 12 hours ignoring the main quest and just pillaging gold and plunder of the spanish main. Im not saying that the main quest is bad, but its pretty repetitive most of the time like "Defeat this guy, then this guy will give you a map to your family and do it all over again". It is a lot of fun but the strong point IS NOT the main quest. I definitely play it for plundering ships, raiding towns, defeating historic pirate figures such as blackbeard, and finding lost treasures. I sometimes find bugs where even though the wind is fast the ship that the sails are in perfectly good condition still go extremely slow. The fun pirating system, plunderin, and raiding alike I overall rate this an 8/10 if the main quest were not that repetitive i wouldve rated it like a 9/10.\n\n","June 17, 2015","true","13.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Well then we have the game for ye matey!\n\nGeneral: Sid Meier's Pirates!(I will refer to it as SMP! from now on) is a... pirate RPG... I guess? You take command of a young pirate and sail through the Caribbean in a strategy-ish POV. Your goal is to rescue your family from the clutches of gang of evil spanish dudes without dying. Now dear reader you will say well of course you shouldn't die that is quite obvious. Well it is not, in SMP! you only have a limited time to plunder until you are too old for the sea. That means be quick and find as many unique items that will prolong your life as possible.\n\nVisuals: SMP! looks due to it's sunny style and perspective quite good even for todays standarts.\n\nAudio: The sounds are not always synced with what is happening but are not bad enough for you to generally notice.\n\nOpen World: The World feels incredibly alive as the differnet nations go to war, cities change their owner and missions are not as static as in other games.\n\nGameplay: In SMP! you there are 2 kinds of missions, the ones that are directly tied to the story and side missions. Both however sometimes randomly collide as the Baron that kidnapped your family has also kidnapped your fiance.  Long story short: everything that you see in the world is something you "can do" and all of those activities are worth it, the Seas have tough spots and it all feels very alive. (Almost) Nothing that has to be triggered the old-fashioned way in a wacky sunny-pirate setting that reminds me of movies like "Mutiny on the Bounty".\n\nStory: While in itself the game offers a decent revenge story, the way the missions work make the game drag on.Basicly you hunt down those corrupt spanish guys to get information on the location of your family members(that look just like the day you lost them). However you will have to repeat this hunt multiple times to get to one of your family members. This is probably the only major problem the game has and even that is not that bad since there is more to do besides the Story missions.\n\nFinal Verdict: Alive happy-go lucky Pirate awesomeness. SMP! is one of my favorite games and I can only recommend buying it especially if you like Pirates.\n\n~Captain AndGeo","August 8, 2014","true","9.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

This is probably the best pirate game there is right now, and yes I've played ♥♥♥ Creed's Black Flag (And adored it)\n\nThis game may be a bit old but it's aged like a fine wine. I thought it was just sailing around and raiding ships, but there's so much more. Tavern brawls, winning the hearts of governor's daughters, fighting historical pirates: It's even got frickin' stealth missions when you try to enter a town that belongs to a nation that doesn't much like you. There's even this mini RTT like mode when you raid a town which I enjoyed a lot more than I was expecting to.

That's mainly because not only can you do the quest but also you can engage in politics and economy which is also interesting because some of the locations are not fixed in the game; every time you play it they spawn in a different place.\nAnother plus is that graphics as well as music are very pleasant.\nI'd greatly recommend it as a game that helps you relax after a busy day.","January 31","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The previous a simple dialog choice of polite conversation, flirting or marriage offers was replaced with a complex dance scene, which increases in difficulty based on skill level and attractiveness of the woman in question.

In doing so you get the chance to captain a ship in the golden age of piracy and plunder and pillage to your heart's content! That is, if you don't care for every nation sending their best to hunt you down. But let's face it, you only need to worry about that on the higher difficulties.\nMost of the game is spent sailing your ship between ports, and doing whatever you feel like doing in the process, whether that be pillaging traders, hunting pirates, obtaining proffesional and eventually noble ranks with one of four nations (or all of them if that's how you swing), trading (stolen) goods, finding treasure or romancing the governor's daughter. It's all there and ready for you to sink your teeth into.\nSome of the more exciting features include ship-to-ship combat, swordplay, dancing at the ball, besieging cities and of course spelunking. Although the naval combat is the most prolific of these, you'll likely also find a lot of enjoyment in besting the finest pirates ever to sail in swordplay and then digging up their buried treasures just to spit at their watery graves.\nAs far as story goes, it's alright. The backstory gives you just enough to set out after the villain (whose name I shan't attempt to spell out for the sake of my sanity) and try to rescue your remaining family. Finding your family is like a treasure hunt in itself, only with a different kind of reward at the end.\nAll in all, this is probably one of the best games I've ever played, regardless of genre. I might be slightly biased, since I used to own a physical copy of this game before Steam even existed, and played it so much that it eventually was scratched beyond salvation. Still it's a testament to its entertainment value that anyone would play it that much. And now I've got it on my computer once again...\nWell, reality is overrated anyway. So long everybody! :D","February 7","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"YOR MATAL!" your pirates cheer after you capture a ship, whatever the hell that means (bless Sid Meier and his knack for inventing cutsey and timeless phonetic languages for all of his games) and your fist pumps and the gold flows.

Your sloop, Revenge, is nimble and reasonably well gunned, and your pockets are light, your crew hungry for trouble. You have been to a town to recieve a letter of Marque from the Spaniards, the British, Dutch or French (did I miss anyone?) and now you course across the great blue expanse in search of bountious adventure.\n\nWhat ho! Dread Pirate Roberts has just issued from a port hidden amongst some jungled sand bars and he's telling you to watch out? Have at him!\n\nLaunch flurries of cannonballs, but make sure you don't get stuck in dead air! Wheel around to dodge his projectiles while you try to maneuver your guns into position to hit his hulk - will you go for the ship's hull with cannoballs, go the masts with nunchuck-like chain-shot, or try to thin out his crew with grapeshot across the decks?

I picked it up during a weekend sale based on reviews by some of the other steam users. I couldn't believe that so many people enjoyed a game that's essentially for kids.\n\nSid Meier's Pirates! puts you in the role of a buccaneer who had his family kidnapped by your traditional "evil noble". You sign up with one of four major empires--England, France, Spain or Norway--and sink ships, conquer cities, raid caravans and fight off rogue pirates. As a naval leader, you rise in rank from a simple privateer all the way up to the commander of the royal navy. You outfit all of the ships in your fleet and engage in sea battles for ultimate supremacy of the Caribbeans.\n\nSid Meier's Pirates has a surprising amount of depth for such a simplistic game. It has political elements, economics, resource management, sword duelling and...dancing. Yes. There is ballroom dancing in Sid Meier's Pirates. Let that sink in for a moment.\n\nI think it has something to offer for everyone. However, there are some downfalls. The difficulty quickly dies down as you amass larger, more well-armed ships. The various game aspects become repetitive after the 8 or 9 hour mark, and the campaign--which is quite short--can be completed with almost no difficulty, especially after acquiring the Duke's ship. There is a lot to do, but it can be done in a short amount of time. I finished the game and most of the quests in about 3.5 hours. So, while it is a good game, it doesn't exceed its financial value in any way. You get what you pay for, plus a little extra.\n\nPROS\n++ Expansive map with a lot to do.\n++ Amazing ship battles; very engaging and fun!\n++ Many different activities and side quests to complete apart from the campaign.\n++ SWORD DUELLING!\n\nCONS\n-- Limited story elements.\n-- Main campaign is shallow and easy to complete.\n-- Not much replayability once the quests are done.\n-- The ballroom dancing. Blech. As a guy, that was cringeworthy.\n\nOverall, the game is worth about a 7.5/10. Definitely a good game and worth the money.","March 20","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Take on the evil Spanish, greedy Dutch, slimy French, or perfidious English for fame and fortune. The progression system is truly great. Your life is split up into voyages the dength depending on how fast you can accumulate gold and how much crew you have. After each voyage you split the loot and get to increase or stay at the same difficulty, at higher difficulty you get to keep a larger share. You also get slower as you age which increases difficulty in some aspects of the game.\n\nThe attention to detail is also substantial. Every faction has their own feel to them and they send out ships of their own with special missions that affect which nations are at war, the wealth and size of towns, their defence and even their allegiance. You can intercept or guard these ships to affect wether or not their mission will be successful.\n\nIt also feels that there is nothing missing, and I was surprised at how many different things you could do. You could just trade, or you could fight a war, and everything in between. Sink ships or capture them, loot towns in land battles and install a governor of your liking, woo ladies in every town and even marry, search for treasure, lost cities, captured family members and love interests. There are lots of different ships with different stats, pick which suits your style best or keep a fleet so you have many options. Upgrade your ships and buy rare items to boost your own stats. Even the sailing is a mini game in itself as you try to make use of storms and wind to get where you want faster. As I said there's so much to do but nothing is hidden in some obscure corner that requires reading a manual to experience.\n\nMy personal best thing with this game is that there are never any "fetch quests" so common in other rpg's, instead you are totally free to do whatever you like. Once you have captured a criminal there's never that annoying unnessecary return trip to turn him in. Raising your military rank is done by simply helping your nation in any way you want. You don't need to talk to someone first, just declare what you have done to any governor and he'll promote you accordingly.\n\nThere are a couple negatives though. No ship can sail very well against the wind this means the game can slow down from its otherwise fast paced tempo. This is also not very realistic as some of the ships in the game sailed better than this. The tretirement occupation you get is also kind of breaking the immersion as even though you are a duke with thousands of acres of land and plenty of money you may get something like farmer or innkeeper just because you didn't get revenge, found all family members or got married. Otherwise a flawless game.\n\nIRemember how civilization has the mantra "just one more turn" this game although not turn based gives you the same feeling: There's always just one more thing you need to do before you can save and continue later.","January 30","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not by graphics or gameplay mind you (though land battle is a **JOKE**), but because control configuration is a total pain in the ♥♥♥. Numpad keys just do not work at all for me in the game (yes I tried numlock). There seems to be a 2 second delay or so where I have to hold the key down. Tried modifying the INI file setting numpad to QWEASDZXC, but apparently the A and D keys are hard-coded for zoom or something so my ship zooms in and out constantly. They're not in the INI file. Tried use auto hotkeys or whatever the software is but apparently this game reads directly from the keyboard rather than let the software (OS?) handle it, or however that works, I'm not too sure as to where hotkeys come into play. Well, whatever, it's pretty fun given that you can get it to work with your numpad. I had to use the mouse, which is OK if you're playing on casual difficulty but if you're playing on the hardest difficulty you absolutely need to use the keyboard.\n\nOne cool part of the game is that it has actual pirates in the game (blackbeard, for instance), albeit they are only there in name and graphics, not in personality or dialogue. One annoying part of the game is that only these pirates and yourself can be considered the "top ten pirates." So no random pirate can make it on the list. It really irks me, I think it's a terrible software design pattern to hard code the entries in the list rather than let the game evaluate the list itself. Another thing I don't like is how you're automatically set to #10 pirate of all time at the start of the game, even though you only have a handful of gold. It just makes me cringe.\n\nBut yes still fun. I love how the "beautiful" ladies are the ones with the big chests while the "average"/"ugly" ladies are the ones with flat chests. Mind you I'm not calling these ladies beautiful for the size of their package, it's the game itself that calls them beautiful. There's not enough polygons there to really associate an attraction to. Anyways, I wonder how that would go down if this game were rereleased with that same feature.","February 2","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Pirate Games as interactive audiovisual entertainment are almost, to me, an ascended form of art, and one sorely lacking in the modern industry. I have on more than one occassion been heard to utter "The perfect video game has yet to reveal itself, and in truth we know little about what it will look like when it does, save that it will categorically and undoubtedly be an Adventure RPG about Pirates"\n\nFolks, Sid Meier's Pirates! is not that game which I describe.\n\nBut it comes so damn close it can smell the soap that game used in the shower this morning.\n\nThis is the key from which all future great pirate games were wrought and its influence can be felt in many of the newer pirate titles. Sid Meier's Pirates! is a true masterpiece of design and implementation. Right from the off you can side with the English, French, Spanish or Dutch and get to work plundering booty and sinking trade vessels. The whole experience is knit together with some fantastically well integrated minigames: dancing with the Governor's daughter is something you feel a drive to be able to get right; you feel proud of finding a swordfighting style that's right for you, there's a sense of power and achievement from attacking and sacking ports with your pirate army. It's honestly amazing that this diverse a range of game genres (Fighting game, rythmn game, turn based strategy, real time sailing) can fit so fluidly and perfectly into one title, but they do, and it's beautiful. An absolute must buy, despite the antiquity.","December 21, 2013","true","16.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You may disagree with my opinion.\nSid Meier's Pirates! is an old game, but still a good one.\nFor starters, the map is huge. There are many, many settlements which means many, many ships. More ships means more conflict, which makes for a more fun game.\nThe duelling system is good, however after about 10 duels or so it becomes mind-numbingly repetitive, and you just end up choosing the rapier and mashing 4 all the time.\nI like how there is no "best" ship - sure, the massive ships have a huge hull capacity and they can therefore carry more guns and more crew, but the massive ships are very slow whereas the smaller ships which have a smaller hull capacity and have less cannons are much faster and they can dodge their way out of ramming and situations with superior ships.

There is a bug where when you go back onto your ship (when you have gone onto land) with the spyglass still in use, your ship moves ridiculously slowly and the spyglass is still there, meaning you have to go through the incredibly tedious process of turning around at 0.000000001 knots and landing again, then putting away the spyglass and getting back on the ship.\nAnd there is very little variation in the gameplay so after one or two playthroughs it becomes extraordinarily boring.\nHowever, while it still lasts, this game is worth buying.

I bought this for like $2.50 when a sale was going on. The game is DEFINITLY worth at least $10.00 though...\n\nGoods:\n-Open world partly on ship, very little on land, some forced minigame, easy UI for movement.\n-Fun missions.\n-You get the sense of accomplishment for doing practically anything but losing.\n-Treasure maps are an entertaining game dynamic.\n-Take over literally ANY ship and use it as your own.\n-Raiding towns is fun.\n-Player items actually make a difference in a variety of aspects of the game.\n\nNeutrals:\n-Gameplay dynamics and reward increments revolve around difficulty.\n-Dancing can get more difficult as difficulties progress, and having to press 1 of 8 options in the fraction of a second based off of your partner's gestures is not very simple.\n-Crew is hard to keep happy unless all you do is what pirates would do even though the game gives you the ability to be 'good'.\n-Graphics match their time.\n-Winds heavily effect movement around the map.\n-You only retain your flagship when you give the crew members their cut.\n-Some ships will not engage in ship to ship warfare and instead will follow windward right into you and force you into a cinematic minigame.\n-Only about 6-8 ship upgrades.\n\nBads:\n-Sometimes can be very repetitive.\n-Sailing down certain inlets can cause the game to continually ask you if you would like to anchor.\n-The Spanish own the entire south half of the Caribbean. (Not really as bad since it is pretty historically accurate. more difficult attacking vessels without upsetting the Spanish).\n-When escorting another ship, another WILL spawn and attack you at some point on the voyage.\n","June 28, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

By this time, you are a young boy, who manages to escape imprisonment. 18 years later, you are a fully grown man, who decides to sign up on a ship (of your choosing). You decide whether to join crew with the Spanish, the Dutch, the French, or the English. Either way, you later mutiny against your captain with nearly the rest of the crew. After defeating the captain, the crew elects you captain. You are then allowed to do whatever you wish.\n\nBe that fighting for a certain nationality, being a Pirate and attacking everything in sight, raiding towns, attacking merchant ships, trying to rescue your long lost family, defeating the 9 best pirates in the game (Blackbeard, Henry Morgan, Stede Bonnet ETC) or just doing whatever you feel like doing.\n\nThe game may take a bit of time to get adjusted to, but in the end, the amount of enjoyment and fun you recieve from playing this is just amasing! So overal, I HIGHLY recommend getting this game, especially when its on special sale thing (like the Steam Summer Sale ETC).","February 22, 2014","true","80.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Double or nothing he says for the girl as collateral, Wanting to bang out as many chicks as possible before the redcoats end my reign of terror I of course accept and walk away with a new wench. She proceeds to tell me she is looking for her husband, a naval officer who went missing, and If i was a decent man I'd help her. I proceeded to shut her down and make her train my sailors to bring morale up. A year goes by and I'm at another tavern; a man comes up to me and tells me that I own his wife and hes been looking for her all this time, would I part with her out of a sense of lost romance and love? I of course decline because this isnt a charity, he offers 10,000 gold, I accept. Its 4am and I log off, when I retern my coffers are filled with 1,000,000,000 Gold.

(Cartoonish graphic style, silly voice sounds, and ballroom dancing) being the main drawbacks. However it's still a great game. I wonder if it's not time for another remake of this timeless classic? With modern realistic looking graphics, expanded trading system, professional voice acting, and a darker more sinister plot and overall feel. THAT would make it AWESOME!

Most of the orginal gameplay was still there, basically the same ship combat, basically the same melee (3 attacks, 3 parries/evades), The "new" stuff like added items, new settlement types, new city-combat all added to the gameplay in a good way, the dancing maybe not so much though.

It lays out a basic backstory with optional follow-through, but otherwises allows the player to run wild in the 17th Century Caribbean. At times, however, the game can be a little too hands off in terms of direction (explanation of game and world mechanics and parts of the "storyline"). The controls can a little confusing at first, and I would really recommend a number pad if using a laptop but a mouse is a good alternative also (I've used both and found that while the mouse is more convenient a number pad makes the game much easier to play). Overall, this game is easy to get a hang of quickly and you'll have a fantastic time pirating your way across the high seas.","December 26, 2014","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It uses the same engine as civ4 and overall does a pretty nice job. You'll love it whether you've played pirates before or not.\n\nThe sea combat is great, land combat is ok, but drastically improved over the original. Duels are a tad too scripted and easy but get the job done.\n\nThe dances mini game for wooing potential mates is kind of annoying but it works ok. What doesn't work and what sucks in this game is sneaking into cities. It's a really slow stealth crawl through town and very hard to find the building you are looking for. Dreadful, just try to avoid sneaking around. As in all the other pirates games search for lost treasure at times can be really difficult but it shouldn't be too easy right?\n\nOverall I had a great time trying to collect everything in one playthrough. It's so open ended that once you collect everything there isn't a ton of point in replaying but it does have replay value if just like the gameplay.","February 24, 2015","true","37.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aasha/recommended/3920/","aasha","Aasha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aasha/","111 products in account","I enjoy this game from time to time. It's a slow paced pirate game - achingly slow when it comes to sailing (there are ways to speed it up, but even when maxed speed it's achingly slow when you sail against the wind) where you basically sack towns, fight and collect ships and more or less do what you'd expect in a game based on pirates.\n\nThe ship combat I like the most. It's all about nailing the enemy ship(s) hard enough to cripple their ability to fight back without doing so much damage that you sink them (lest you say goodbye to the loot on their ship - or the ship itself if you wanted to capture it for your fleet) all while taking into account angles and wind direction to keep your ship moving.\n\nThere are a good number of ships but once fully upgraded they fall into 2 basic catagories:\n1. Big ship. Holds a lot of health, crew and cannons.\n2. Small ship. Dodges everything much easier with small size, fast turning, and fast speed.\n\nOnce you collide of course there's a boarding sword fight scene - the ship battle being to widdle each others' crew down before boarding or get the other to surrender. The more crew you have the more time you have - if one crew defeats the other before the sword fight you're in is over the winning crew takes the win. There are a couple of options for swords but they don't change the experience very drastically unless on higher difficulties. After the fight the winner takes the loser's ship (they'll either sink it or add it to their fleet).\n\nThere's a few other things to the game too. Sailing and ship battles tend to take up almost all of the time I spend playing. The battles are not soul draining though - unless one ship runs and the similar speeds result in the chase going on about a literal minute or two of almost no stimulation (I prefered small fast ships because they cut out the speed problem more often than big ones). There are a few other parts though. Minigames as part of the game progression more or less; ballroom dancing with govenors' daughters to raise reputation with them, sword fighting resembles a combinarion of "Paper-Rock-Scissors" and Flash Cards, hide and seek style treasure hunting where you collect map peices and use them to find where to go, and city seiges which feel like turn based Overhead strategy game.\n\nThe overhead city attack is actually a little fun too. Your crew make up 3 unit types. Officers, Pirates and Buckaneers. They play very simply. Officers and pirates melee attack like chess peices that all only move 1 space each on the board (with officers being stronger). The buckeneers can shoot from several spaces away for much weaker damage. Attacking from the back or sides deals a lot more. Diving into cover helps against their guns. Also the more one unit gets into a fight the weaker he is due to moral dropping. That's about it to the strategy. There are no buildings to create or making more units or anything. The enemy does have a pretty varied amount of unit types though (protip: If the enemy has horsemen go straight for a forest tile. Those suckers are OP outside of them but get cut a third of their strength in forests. If the enemy has indians get out of the forests).\n\nYou pretty much do these things over and over. There's really no plot or story other than a little intro scene (well technically you hunt down family, but it's not very focused on). It's a reletively fun game when just chilling and wanting to pimp up a ship. I won't lie though... the slow parts are painful.","March 7, 2015","true","111.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can also invade cities and take them for whichever country you choose, build up your rank and personal glory.  Your notoriety as a pirate also goes up as you become more successful, its fun trying to get up the "Most Wanted" list :)  You can even go after the governor's daughter to make her your own :)\nGreat addition to any library, especially if you want a simple quick game to be able to jump into for a short time while waiting on hold to complain to your internet provider.

You are free to make your choices and shape the world in any way you see fit, and that is what I call a true RPG. Which brings us to what I believe is the strongest point of this game, the hability to provide an amazing interaction with the game world, even if you don't realized as you do, as every action brings a reaction somewhere. If you save the merchant ship from the pirates, your allies may prosper, but that very pirate ship that you sunk will be a hard hit in the pirate community. Or, if you are to become the most fiered pirate of the seas, you might find that your pillage is bringing cities to decline.\nThe other mechanics in the game do not present any remarkable point, but been able to have old school ship fight is quite amusing, as well as deciding your batles by your favorite method of combat (ship/sword fight). The graphics and sound are alright and there is no plot, you make your own history.\nThis game deserves a 10 for the great interaction mechanic it carries even being decades old! Definitely a gap to be yet filled.","December 26, 2014","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In this game you can experience the exciting world of the 18th century Caribbean, filled with notorious pirates like Blackbeard, buried treasure, and devastating storms to blow you off course. There are two basic ways you can play the game: You can plunder every single penny from every single person, or you can obey every law there is, and befriend the governor of every town and city on the map. And, of course, you can be somewhere in between. This game has one drawback I will mention: you must have a number pad on your keyboard to play it. Almost everything from sailing your ship to the swordfighting minigames requires the number pad. Aside from that limitation, it is a great game. Not too difficult, but not too easy. I recommend that you purchase this game and try it out for yourself.

It brings a romanticized view of a century of piracy to gaming, yet avoids Treasure Island clichés like parrots and peg legs.  You'll find a lot of light comedy in the presentation of the game, too!  However, the overall gameplay is quite sophisticated.  Unlike games such as Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, you have to know how to sail with the wind to your advantage.  The size of your sword, ship, and crew matter tremendously as you conquer the West Indies, as well as the hearts of colonial governors' daughters.  You may find yourself chasing ships for game days on end only to lose it to the wind, so you have to be good at assessing situations and using them to your advantage, else the enemy does the same.  Surprisingly, these elements do not detract from the gameplay, but instead add a level of interest and challenge that draws you in further.\n\nI'd give it a 9.8out of 10.  It's not perfect, but it's damn close.  My only concern is technical issues (performance), as the game did not run optimally on my system due to the game's slightly antiquated nature.  Even so, the fact that the game IS so old (and this one was a remake) stands as testament to its fantastic ability to entertain.  Any PC gamer should definitely give it a try.","May 17, 2014","true","65.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's easy to pick up and play yet there's a lot of complexity here too. From bounties to allegiances to trading there are a lot of things you can do here yet you can also just sail around capturing ships & pillaging.\n\nThe main thing I like about this is the fact that no matter what you do you never feel bored. You never run out of stuff to do, and you're always accomplishing stuff. Goals can be challenging but they're never so impossible that they get too frustrating. This is a great title that will challenge you and even if you fail at a challenge it never punishes you for it. It gives you many chances to come back later when you're more prepared for it.\n\nAll in all one of the best games I've ever played, and certainly one of the best pirate games ever.","May 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game allows you to do pretty much all that stuff without the terrible consequences! Seriously though it is a fun, light hearted, ADDICTING game that I absolutely love.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lasain/recommended/3920/","Lasain","Mother/Radio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lasain/","288 products in account","If ye be looking fer' Pirates, you surely found them with this scurvy old title. Clean as a captain's spyglass is the play of the ships and friendly enough fer' lads and lasses of all ages ta' enjoy. Ye be starting with a measly sloop and the entire Carribean be at yer' call. Chase after ye lost family or sack some french ports and marry the Governer's daughter. Pirates be as timeless as the sea herself, an' for just 10 pieces of eight, she be right for the remembering. Yar.\n\nHorrible attempts at pirate talk aside, this is by far one of the best games I've ever enjoyed playing. I can remember back when Sid Meier's Pirates had just been released how many endless days were spent sitting in front of my computer screen playing the wars between England and Spain. It's got a special place in my heart.\n\nThe game plays out as an open-world sandbox where one is free to pursue the noble goals of taking down the top ten most notorious pirates of the carribean and sacking ports. Or if one is feeling a bit less like fighting they can play the relatively simple merchant game of buying goods in one port and sailing them to another for profit. There is the ever present staple of pirate tales where buried treasure maps can be found. Also this portion of the game around your entire family being kidnapped and you needing to rescue them, there's that. However Pirates never directly forces you to do anything. It is a sandbox in the truest sense, at least under all of that water. Ships can be upgraded at the different ports and while learning the map comes naturally you won't be stuck going to the same 4 ports over and over (Unless you choose to, that is.)\n\nThe combat element plays out in one of four ways. The naval battles between ship and ship feel crisp and polished even despite the game's age. While rudimentery in some ways, ships bombard eachother with broadsides of roundshot, grapeshot, or chainshot. Once enough damage has been dealt or if taking the ship is the goal the ramming of the two ships together will start the swordplay. Swordplay consists of three attacks, three dodges, and one taunt. While basic it is entirely about timing and plays out fairly well. There is a turn-based strategy portion to sacking a port with a landing party but my strategy in this has always been to simply bring more men. The only place where the game falls short is in it's Stealth selection of sneaking into a hostile port. It's not bad, but it does feel a bit slow and very repetitive.\n\nOut of all the games I've played or purchased on steam through either my own library or familyshare, this one is by far the best Game-Per-Cash value. At $9.99 it's nice to see a familiar old face pop back up and give me hours of good natured fun. I can't reccomend it enough.","April 29, 2014","true","27.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VGAddict/recommended/3920/","VGAddict","Syntax Error","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VGAddict/","177 products in account","Sid Meier has made many games with clever tactical depth, but is not so swollen with rules, so that anybody can jump right in. Pirates! continues the tradition by being a game chock full of strategy, but is highly accessible.\n\nThe game is a sandbox. You can go anywhere, and do anything, within the Spanish Main. Generally, you plunder ships or towns, and get promoted by friendly nations. There are plenty of other things to do, too.\nTasks you perform have an associated action oriented mini-game. You'll be ship-to-ship battling and swordfighting a lot. I like most of these games, though your mileage may vary. Many people have mixed feelings about them.\n\nAs far as management goes, the game cuts out micro-managing. The action just keeps flowing. The typical mundane busy work of hard-core strategy games is kindly removed here, in order to get to the good bits. There are plenty of strategic decisions to be made, but you get to think in a sense of what you WANT to do, not what you HAVE to do.\n\nCertain things are a little tricky to get used to. Sailing East is much harder than sailing West. Your crew slowly becomes restless over time, forcing you to pay them off and take a few months vacation before going back to sailing.\n\nAfter you get to the ripe old age of about 35, your health starts to decline, and you might have to retire before too long. This takes you to an amusing detailed report on your post-pirate life. Hopefully you are a Governor instead of a Pauper!\n\nThe graphics and sound are cartoony. Everything looks like it's from a Disney/Pixar movie, and the voice acting is done in jibberish, like in The Sims. Subtitles are in English, though. The cartoony feel is not bad, but is sometimes just a little TOO campy.\n\nThe controls are a bit strange. While you can use a mouse, you're better off doing the mini-games using the numpad. It's a little awkward at first, but you get used to it fairly soon.\n\nPirates! is one of my all time favorite games. Two thumbs and a wooden peg-leg up!","March 13, 2014","true","150.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You start out as a young guy with a small crew and ship. Years ago an evil pirate breaks up your family leaving you alone and now you're matured you set out on the Caribbean. From there you choose to follow the storyline of getting your family back OR disregard that and lead the life of a stereotypical pirate.\n\nGameplay is a little limited BUT there's a lot of paths you can go. By paths I mean you can choose which time period to live in, choose what life you want to lead, choose whom you ally with (or be a total pirate), a great selection of ships (all customizeable), your personal skill sets. The limited part is that for most of the time you'll be doing the same thing: get a  ship, go plunder other ships, sell items, get gold, talk to people in the town. There's some side things like rescuing people, helping a country out, collecting treasure maps but generally it's the same thing regardless of which path you go.\n\nThe visuals are very colourful and beautiful. Although the game is old the visuals have a style that still looks good and not dated. The sound is great. The music, although limited to a few key tunes, is very pirate styled and pleasing.\n\nSo in short although the game is somewhat limited in what you can do it doesn't get boring over time! That's because it is quite immersive, aesthetic, controls well and is just fun! Beautiful graphics and audio and good controls ensure this game doesn't feel dated.\n\n7/10","March 3, 2014","true","31.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To be honest I didn't expect much at first but after getting into the game after an hour or so, I was hooked.  The game is simple in nature yet complex to master, as are many of Sid Meier's games.  The pirates theme is masterfully directed and the story, while lacking, doesn't need to be there in the first place.  You create your own story.  Become the most vile Pirate to ever sail the seven seas or be a noble sailor for one of the nations colonizing the area.  Seek revenge solely on those who took your family or loot and plunder everywhere and everyone.  This game is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.  Though it may be a bit clunky and awkward at points, it adds to the charm of the game.

Your family is taken for ransom, you grow to be a teenager and you are ready to set sail to try to free your enslaved family from the evil Colonel.\n\nOr you can say SCREW THAT, IMA GO PLUNDER SOME SHIPS!!! You are free to do so :)\n\nThis is a pirate-sandbox game. Similar to the newly released Pirate Game, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. You can follow the storyline and set free your enslaved family, or you could go out to sea and plunder, get yourself married to a governer's daughter, gather the ships of Blackbeard, Black Bart, and Captain Morgan, upgrade them to their highest, THEN go out and rescue them. This is what I like about Sid Meier's games, its got good sandbox engine to it. The Carribean is HUGE, you could sail for hours and maybe not even get 100% of the content done.\n\nThe Melee combat is fluid, but a little TOO easy. Just counter when the button flashes, then attack. The ship combat is fun as well, although its very trivial if compared to Black Flag. If you wish to go save your family and THEN take down famous pirates, feel free to do so! It is important to note that you should not split your loot until you feel you are ready to do so, because you will lose some ships and loot and you need all the loot you can get since upgrades and items are expensive, but it makes it so money HAS a use at least. Unlike Black Flag, this game requires you make an effort to keep your ship in good condition and your crew happy, if your crew gets unhappy, they will abandon you. You dont want that.\n\nAs I said, the Carribean is huge, but honestly in this game, Its kind of TOO big. Black Flag has a function where you can initiate Travel Speed and get where you need to go faster. This game only has half and full sails, and even then, if you dont follow the wind direction, your not gonna get anywhere in the next 5-10 minutes. It should also be worth mentioning that you do NOT have any sort of waypoint system in this game. You have to navigate your way around, which can be a bit difficult, but if your patient, you'll start getting it.\n\nSo, is this game good? Yes! This is for you if you absolutely love the Golden Age of Piracy and want to experience it in a way.","February 22, 2014","true","15.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamMil/recommended/3920/","AdamMil","Adam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamMil/","240 products in account","Sid Meier's Pirates! is a surprisingly fun and deep simulation of being a ship captain in the Caribbean during the glory days of piracy. You're not limited to being a pirate. Although the game doesn't explicitly say so, the simulation of the four major powers and two minor powers operating in the Caribbean is quite complex. There's a real war going on, and all of it happens by sea. Although invasions happen over land, troops don't get into position to invade unless they're transported by ship. Many troops don't get paid and people don't get fed unless their wages and food arrive by sea. The economy is primarily based on sea trade, and blockades occur. Warships must be built and sailed where they're needed. And governors and other important people move around by ship.\n\nAll this means that there's a rich environment for you to play in, and many possibilities for how you want to play. You can, of course, be a pirate and loot the treasure ships of all the wealthy nations. You can serve a nation as a legitimate but independent privateer. You can pretend to be part of a nation's navy and go to war on its behalf, attacking targets of military importance and earning the appreciation of the nation even if you don't get much money out of it. You can even take part in land-based invasions and try to conquer cities, either for the benefit of a nation - territory really changes hands in this game - or just to loot and pillage. Or you can be a peaceful trader. The lesser powers, pirates and Indians (i.e. Native Americans), have their own agendas which enrich the environment further.\n\nBesides the sandbox gameplay, you have several concrete goals: rescue your family, acquire wealth and fame, woo beautiful women, find hidden treasure and lost cities, bring villains to justice, and defeat the top pirates in the Caribbean. There are also minor quests that allow you to act as a law enforcer (or turn a blind eye to crime in exchange for bribes, if you wish), and mini-games such as breaking into enemy towns, dancing (which is quite fun), and both real-time combat at sea and turn-based combat on land.\n\nThere's a lot to do, and for the most part it's all well-designed. There are five difficulty levels, allowing the game to be enjoyable for all players, and several eras you can start in and skills you can specialize in, which increase replay value. The game's main shortcoming is that it's too easy, because it helpfully auto-saves before anything bad happens, allowing you to simply reload your game and retry. This diminishes the importance of many gameplay elements, such as breaking out of jail, upgrading your character, and maintaining multiple ships in your fleet, and leads to excessive risk-taking while dampening the thrill of success. The game really needs an Iron Man mode. (Thankfully, a mod to add one exists.)\n\nAnother potential problem for some players is that the game doesn't have much of a tutorial, but the manual is good and worth reading.","February 23, 2014","true","75.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Stick with me here though: what makes classic nintendo games great, is that they are simple enough for a newbie to pick up and enjoy but also evolving with enough depth to grasp a hardcore gamer. THIS IS THAT TYPE OF GAME and what makes Pirates! so great as well. Start out as an apprentice -each time your crew is unhappy, divide the plunder to start refresh and jump to the next diffculty level. The game really progresses from each tier of diffculty nicely til your at the most difficult level and you are like wow, how did this game get to this point, it was so easy at first.\n\nThe graphics still hold up too!\n\nPlay this now!

You start out as a young guy with a small crew and ship. Years ago an evil pirate breaks up your family leaving you alone and now you're matured you set out on the Caribbean. From there you choose to follow the storyline of getting your family back OR disregard that and lead the life of a stereotypical pirate.\n\nGameplay is a little limited BUT there's a lot of paths you can go. By paths I mean you can choose which time period to live in, choose what life you want to lead, choose whom you ally with (or be a total pirate), a great selection of ships (all customizeable), your personal skill sets. The limited part is that for most of the time you'll be doing the same thing: get a  ship, go plunder other ships, sell items, get gold, talk to people in the town. There's some side things like rescuing people, helping a country out, collecting treasure maps but generally it's the same thing regardless of which path you go.\n\nThe visuals are very colourful and beautiful. Although the game is old the visuals have a style that still looks good and not dated. The sound is great. The music, although limited to a few key tunes, is very pirate styled and pleasing.\n\nSo in short although the game is somewhat limited in what you can do it doesn't get boring over time! That's because it is quite immersive, aesthetic, controls well and is just fun! Beautiful graphics and audio and good controls ensure this game doesn't feel dated.\n\n7/10","March 3, 2014","true","31.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Try this at hardest or second hardest difficulty for the only decent challenge.","October 13, 2013","true","50.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's only $10.\n\nThis is a remake of an absolute classic of a game. You play as a pirate/privateer, sailing around the Carribean. You have abolute freedom of action. Capture Spanish treasure galleons? Loot cities by land battles? Sail whatever ship you can get your hands on that suits your playstyle, from fast light yacht-things to enormous slow galleons bristling with guns.\n\nYou sail your ship around the Carribean, using the wind to get around. When you attack ships, you play the "ship fighting" minigame. When you board an enemy ship, it switches to the "swordfighting" minigame.\n\nThe polish that went into this is enormous. The minigames are fun and engaging, and seamlessly tied together by a greater scope and context. You want to win that swordfight because you'll capture that fat merchant ship full of loot, not because the game says "ok, this next bit is a swordfight".\n\nThey don't make 'em like they used to.

This time, you have better graphics, more advanced swordfighting sequences and more options for everything. You start the game off by leading a mutiny on a merchant vessel. From there on, you can decide whether you want to avenge your family by defeating the Marquis de Montalban, defeating all the major pirate captains in the Spanish Main, accumulate vast amounts of wealth through trade, marry a governor's daughter whether she be sexy or ugly, or if you want to attack merchant ships, plunder seaports and instigate a brand new war. The choice is yours! My only complaint is that you can't customize your character: although he does age, you always have to be the Orlando Bloom type of character.

Favorite being Uncharted Waters: New Horizons on the SNES.  This game is entirely based in the Carribean.  Starting the game up you choose what type of pirate you are going to be by picking a skill.  After that you pick your nationality.  You can choose between Spanish, English, French, and Dutch.  The Spanish seem to have the most ports and cities so I'd consider them the easiest to start with.  You work your way up the pirate ranks by finding buried treasure, defeating notorious pirates like Blackbeard, and trading goods between ports.  It's a great game and worth the price in my opinion.","August 5, 2013","true","45.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unlike alot of these reviewers, i had not played this before, i walked into this game completely blind. So, the fact that theres no nostaligia involved here, my review is for those who have never played or heard of this game before. Theres no tutorial or manual to speak of, but to be honest this game dosnt really need one. Its an rpg, so if youve palyed previous rpgs like me, you'll have a basic understanding of what your doing. If you havnt played one before then this would be an excellent first choice. So, your thrust into this open world pirate game with nothing but a back story, which i might add is not narrated in the slightest. In fact, i think the reason theres so much content in this game is because they didnt do any voice acting AT ALL. Theres just mostly grunts or the wooing of ladies for "dialog". But besides the lack of voice acting, the game is damn near perfect. There is SO much to do in this world. Without any spoilers, You have to save your family, become a top notch pirate, track down criminals, defeat pirates based off of real life ones such as Captain Kidd and Black Beard, pillage ships, raids towns, dance with the ladies, ship battles, fleet managments, sell plunder, buy food stocks, get unique items, upgrade your ship, get special crew members, conquer cities in a board game like rts mode, search for buried treasure, get promotions, gain land, ect. And thats probably half of what there is. At this point im only 10 hours in the game and i have already done all of that, and there is just so much more to do. If your a fan of pirates or Rpgs, GET THIS GAME AND GET IT NOW!!! It's only 10 dollars for so so SO much content, and the replayability is off the charts!

It plays out like a fast paced board game crossed with an enthusiastic child's fanciful imaginings of the piratey life: all of the highs and none of the lows. It's such a breath of fresh air to play a game that doesn't try to saddle you with a heavy "Hollywood" cinematic story. The encounters are entirely under your control in true sandbox style and you venture through a series of minigames at different locations to obtain information about the placement of notable people, treasures, and upgrades, with each task being fun and easy to grasp.  There's a wealth of things to do with the only drawback being repetition sets in too early; you fight the same pirates, perform the same battle actions, talk to the same placeholder figures over and over again. Give it a shot.  It's fun and frivolous and you'll definintely be entertained.","October 15, 2011","true","32.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

There's plenty of other goals to pursue; find buried treasure, defeat infamous pirates to become the most feared in the Caribbean, track down wanted criminals and collect their bounties, escort ships carrying peace treaties (or betray the nation you're helping and destroy them - war is more profitable than peace for a pirate after all) or just attack everything in sight and amass as much loot as you can.\n\nA game won't last forever - your pirate starts the game aged 18 and as time passes in the game he will age and eventually be forced into retirement. If this game has an overall "goal" at all it's to have the highest score you can at the time you retire.\n\nThe game has difficulty levels; on every playthrough after your first you can choose between them - first time starting a new game, you're forced into the easiest difficulty, though there's a way to change it once you get going, too.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't feel like the game has much replay value. The minigames (with the exception of ship battles) are repetitive and shallow and I was burned out on the game before I'd seen everything it had to offer (I completed the "main quest", went after all the named pirates and then lost interest). The harder difficulty settings feel more frustrating than genuinely challenging, too.\n\nStill, I got 25 hours of fun out of this game for £6, so I'd say I got my money's worth; I recommend it.\n\n","April 26, 2015","true","25.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feelmeup/recommended/3920/","feelmeup","F E E L S","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feelmeup/","85 products in account","A classic. One of my favorite games of all time.Personal overall rating: 9/10\n\nI've played this game for almost 9 years now! Just got it on my computer a few days ago and, wow... It's so much better. I first played it on Xbox, then psp, then got it for my 360, and now have it for my computer. Of course, this is the best version of the game. ALL HAIL THE MASTER RACE\n\nOPTIONS MENU:\nThe Video settings has 9 options. Picture Gamma, Water Detail, Object Detail, World Detail, Resolution, Shadows, Advanced Lighting, Trillinear Filtering, & Shaders. It's an old game, most computers will be able to handle it with the settings turned up relatively high.\nThe Audio Settings has a Master Volume slider, Music Volume, Sound FX Volume, Dance Music Volume, and a 3D Sound Driver toggle.\nThe Modify Ship's Sails and Flags option changes your ship's flag appearance and the logo/crest on your main sail. There's 6 crests/logos for your sail. 1.Dutch: Greater Coat of Arms of The Netherlands, 2.English: St George Crest, 3.French: Royal Coat of Arms of The Kingdom of France, 4.Indians: Tribal Tiki Logo, 5.Pirates: Jolly Roger Crest, 6.Spanish: Coat of Arms of Toledo.\nThere are 5 flags, the Flags are 1.Dutch: Orange flag with a green xing emblem, 2.English: White flag with a red St George cross, 3.French: Blue flag with a gold Flour De Les emblem. 4.Pirates: Black flag with a white Jolly Roger. 5.Spanish: Yellow flag with a black Royal Lion.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nIt's an old game. It's not exactly pretty. The game looks best while you're out sailing. There is noticeable aliasing, mushy textures, and choppy animations. The water refelction is decent. The explosion effect during ship battles when cannonballs make contact and when ships explode is awesome. It's the game's strongest point graphically. The way the colors of the sea blend together is nice as well.\n\nSTORY:\nThe story is kind of weird. An evil Spanish nobleman (the Marquis de la Montalbán) interupts a dinner party consisting of you and your family. Your family is in debt to him. When you see him, you immediatley know he has bad intentions, so you bolt passed him through the door. He takes your family. They become slaves. You survive on your own for the next 10 years. You begin your young adulthood joining a faction (Dutch, English, French, or Spanish). You serve on a ship where a cruel captain is in charge. Tired of being abused and insulted by the captain, you and your mates rally up and form a mutiny against him. You boot him from the ship, and take charge. You're the captain now, and realize this is the perfect opportunity to find your lost family.\n\nPLAYING THE GAME:\nSailing is a ton of fun. The feeling of adventure you get from cruising the sea is so satisfying. Playing a game that isn't the same copy paste recipe as every other game in itself is extremely satisfying. There's open sea adventure, epic ship battles, duels, city invasions, sneaking through hostile towns, treasure hunting, pirate hunting, and the wonderful ability to do whatever you want. Live the pirate life your way. You can gain new items for your character like dual pistols and some well crafted swords. You can aquire new ships and give them upgrades. You can even name your ships as well as your character of course. You'll be addressed by your character's name by the other people in the game. They address you by your surname, so when creating your character make sure you name them by their last name. Anyways but yea, that's the game. You build up your crew, and become the deadliest pirate to ever live.\n\nPlease try the game. It's cheap, it's fun. You'll enjoy it. Please just try it. Yea it has it's flaws, but for what it is it's pretty much perfect.","May 8, 2015","true","39.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love this game, my wife loves it, my kids love it, even my father in law played for hundreds of ours.  It's appropriate - and fun- for all ages.\n\nThe combat is simplified, easy and very satisfying - the story is simple and satisfying, the graphics are still beautiful and compare to many modern indie games out there.  Actually now that I think of it, this was one of the first non dungeon rogue like games to come out.  Every game is different and you never know where the seas will take you.\n\nHighly recommended and we'd love to connect with other Sid Meier's Pirates players out there!\nHere is my wife and I playing what we call a thirty minute pirate game\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBZzpCnTo3w","January 31, 2015","true","28.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It looked a little dated, and not much content. I do like ships and pirates and trading and after I got the game in a humble bundle i decided id give it a go. This game is wonderful. You start out as an apprentice level sailor with the que's flashing during fights and dances so you dont fail. Then journeyman comes around and the que's are gone and you have to see the movement of the person your fighting or dancing with to have an idea of what your defence/dance move should be.\n\nAt first i thought it was dumb that you could only battle one ship, but that ship you have direct control over and it would be difficult to control more, and relying on AI to fight with you brings in risks of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ decisions.\n\nOver all, this game is really worth it. i would have paid the 10 bucks in full if i knew what i was getting into","January 27","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I purchased this game initially off the Xbox Marketplace and enjoyed it thoroughly on console, when I saw they had done something of a revisting of sorts I was excited and pleasantly rewarded with an even better experience. The only thing I wish is that they'd make another one with more options for your character and perhaps a more in-depth combat system.

I bought it on the day that it originally came out, and spent actual DAYS playing the game, only stopping to eat, bathe, and go to the bathroom. I don't think that I slept more than eight total hours in that first week, and my name was known, loved, and feared throughout the Caribbean. More so than in any other Sid Meier game before or since, I was completely engulfed by this game to the point of addiction.\n\nThen, you know, life (and other games) happened.\n\nSo, flash forward a few years and I saw that it was on Steam. How well did it hold up? Would I fire it up, laugh at the dated gfx and gameplay, never to play again? Would it be like I'd never stopped playing and find myself engulfed into the game again?\n\nI downloaded it last night, and have already racked up seven, almost eight hours. Gfx and some clunky and (now) counter-intuitive gameplay aside, I still love this game and thought it was absolutely worth the $10 to buy it again. It's just as fun as I remembered, although I do confess that I still hate the dancing portion of the game! Absolutely recommended!\n\nMy only REAL gripe is with the sound. It's not that it's dated, it's just that when you're playing the game, you have no choice but to either turn off the sound altogether OR you're forced to listen to the same... jaunty... pirate... ditties... again... and... again... and... Imagine being forced to listen to the sound of a dentist's drill or your favorite child's death rattle on infinite loop - this is the quality of the music. While you can go into the system properties and turn off the music, that's only the music for cut scenes and the like - the in-game music is tied irrevokably to the sound effects, so no cannonfire, no sound of the wind... unless you're willing to listen to monkey-grinder music.","March 12, 2015","true","15.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I really don't have much to criticize - perhaps the lack of a proper story. But what the game has to offer (which is sailing around with ships, battling others, duels, sieging cities and many other things) is really good.\n\nAnd unlike Assassins Creed 4, there is actually kinda realistic morale element where your crew can revolt when you're too long at sea, or you're not very succesful pirate.

If you look at it from an objective PoV, this is just a collection of repetitive minigames (there's a swordfighting, which is basically a rythm game; Dancing, which is literally a rythm game; Theres a siege which has some strategical options but basically coes down to "more troops win"; And a naval battle which becomes somewhat boring as you realize the AI is really dumb at it). On the top of it all is a fairly simple resource management system (basically, have food) and "get from point A to point B" system which is a slog, especially if you are travelling from west to east.\nThis doesnt sound too good now, does it.\n\nSo why is this game so good? I played the heck out of the original about 20 years ago on a Commodore64, and again about 10 years ago when this version came out.\nAnd yesterday I bought the Steam version and I just wanted to fire it up for a while to see how it runs, and then somehow I played almost 8 hours straight without even moving from my chair or noticing the time.\nDuring that 8 hours, I\n- raided countless ships\n- Always showed mercy to the lads who wanted to come aboard\n- became the most notorious pirate on the entire spanish main\n- Found Blackbeard's legendary buried treasure between a tree with a dead man hanging and an Inca temple\n- Sacked Havana twice\n- elected a dutch govenor there\n- Found out the new govenor's daughter is actually beautiful\n- became pretty good at pressing buttons while dancing\n- I fenced with her fincée\n- Then I rescued her from captivity\n- and married her (which turned out was a pretty bad idea since traveling from Havana to anywhere is actually a slugfest)\n- I found two of my long- lost relatives\n- kicked the ♥♥♥♥ of Evil Baron Raymondo a dozen times\n- defeated the long-standing enemy of my family Marquis Montalban (who is now my cabin boy)\n- and found the legendary lost city of the Incas.\n\nSo there you have it. I think the strongpoints of the game is the athmosphere, living the pirate dream, and all the stories you make up for yourself. The game has a really vibrant world and the sandbox frame lets you fill it with your own stories. And of course there is that "just lets dig up this one more treasure then I'll go to sleep for real" vibe.\n\nTow remarks at the end, one: For some reason the FPS drops if you fire with anything other than normal cannonballs.\nSecond: I can kinda recommend this game for kids. There is some non- depicted killling during battles, but there is no violence or gore during swordfights. Also there are some big blossoms but no nudity. The atmoshpere is bright and the game is simple to play.","March 20, 2015","true","10.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The graphics are still not too shabby and the game itself is great but you cannot select widescreen resolutions in the menu and so you will end up with a 4:3 windowed game.\nEven worse is that the game somehow disables numpad on startup. As a result(?) the keys won't work altough the game is relying on numpad for controls heavily.\n\nI would really like to see the developers adding widescreen resolutions and real Windows 7/8/10 compatibility and a fix for the numpad problem.

If that isn't bad enough, to click on some buttons you'll need to click outside then for them to work. It gets very frustrating to play this way.\nIf you don't apply the resolution fix, you get stuck with 4:3 aspect ratio resolutions and using this with widescreen, everything will get stretched.\n\n\n","January 29","false","0.2"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

I suppose everything will have it's lovers and haters. Count me in the latter category.\n\nI typically love Sid Miere's games too. NEVER have I run into more outdated controls in my life. Even playing it at moderate difficulty levels I found this "game" to be more stress-inducing than a flight being canceled at the busiest airport while being forced to take two final exams in chemistry and 16th Century Literaure all at the same time.\n\nCONS:\n\n- The AI will generally always counter your sword attacks, while countering it's own requires PRECISE timing or else.\n\n- Adapts and speed up dance challenges, to the point where the odds of winning are slim to none.\n\n- You'll generally ALWAYS be placed upwind in ship battles, making manuvering nigh impossible. Meanwhile, AI ships will dance circles around you\n\n- The winds tend to blow extremely fast in one direction (west in my experience) making travel in the opposite direction very tedious and time-consuming.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Immersive, the general atmosphere is great\n\n- The music is simple but lovely\n\n- Fun, when the difficulty is balanced [usually never] (even at lower difficulties it's an imbalanced game)\n\nAll in all I can't say I enjoyed my time with this title. In fact, I believe it gave me muscle cramps due to the stress it induced. I'm glad I only spent $2.50 on it during a sale, but I can say it was $2.50 wasted\n\n","January 6","false","27.9"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","3","16","0","1"

The concept itself is good, but the game becomes very repetitive and the play balance on harder difficulties is completely bonkers.  Late game on Rogue difficulty I lost a ship to only three hits, when fighting other ships of the same type I would hit them twenty times or more before they would sink.  The AI gets special abilities like attacking you on the strategic map, and the late "quests" of endgame are simply finding and fighting the same guy over and over again until you get a map to go and fight him again in some place in the middle of no where.\n\nAnd while the game has a lot of "mini-games", man of these are simply not compelling.   The game has a lot of content but all that content is ultimately light on depth, and despite playing the game to its conclusion and getting a Fame score of 106 my "victory" was little more than a page of text.  Why not a simple cinematic?\n\nIf you get it cheap, play it, then go on to something with more enduring quality and depth.","June 19, 2015","false","29.1"," 28 of 71 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","28","71","0","2"

I guess I wanted to raise a pirate fleet and take over the seas, micromanage the ships and crews and had combat be a bit more interesting than this. No fast travel either.

It was meh.  I think nostalgia clouds too many minds on how wonderful this game is.  It's not bad, it just isn't all that special. There isn't a real storyline (they kind of make a basic quest of finding your family which isn't very exciting) and maybe that would have spiced the game up for me.  I love a good story.  It just throws you in there and you just start living the life of a pirate captain which is great if you don't like being shackled to linear game play.  Felt like a chore going back and forth on the map at a snail's pace and I just wasn't having fun.  I gave up after realizing how many times I had to trek back and forth and I didn't want to waste my time with it.  I feel like this would work as a casual game on a mobile device that you could play for a bit, put it down, and pick it up later.  The dancing sequences are annoying, the sword fights are all the same and get boring, and trying to catch the wind in your sails was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.  I feel there are more engaging choices out there.","September 19, 2015","false","6.3"," 14 of 44 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","14","44","0","1"

The fun part is mostly due to open-world sandbox play, with no scripted gameplay, you can just sail around and do what you want. The good is pretty good. The bad is absolutely a deal breaker, though. The dancing thing with the governor daughter is impossible on the PC. I played this to death on the Xbox with no problems but this stupid PC version gives you 1/10th of a second to respond to the dancing bullcrap which made that part of the game unbelievably frustrating--on par with the buggy SM Railroads. The ships get stuck on land masses and LAUNCH like a rocket out of ports so you have to hit pause every time you leave a port. ANNOYING! In summary, it's too buggy and annoying for repeat play. the old Xbox version of possibly iPad version are better choices for this game. This PC original is not worth playing.","April 24, 2015","false","10.0"," 10 of 46 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","10","46","0","0"

Im giving it a no just because the ratings are too high. See, it is a great game for its time. But theres a few annoying parts. It cant be called an adventure game because you are restricted to the caribean and you do not feel like an adventurer. Not the improved 'uncharted waters' I hoped for. The challenge is too wimpy at first- get your attack speed up and mash buttons in duels to win every battle- then becomes too hard. But most annoying of all there is no tutorials. I have played this long and became #1 pirate, and dont know HTF dueling (the main thing in the game) even works, the controlls seem to suck. Dancing seemed impossibly hard. Granted I am playing as adventurer captain (hard difficulty) but that stuff should have been explained by the time I finished my 6th pirating carreer. You cant really customize your ship. And trading stinks, you really cant make any money at it. For the record I do recommend it anyways if it is on sale.\nSome things I find quite great is the ship to ship battles take a lot of skill, and has quite a lot of depth. And when you attack a town the game turns into a nearly full strategy game.\nIf I or anyone else could mod the game for even a few months, it would be great. But as is it just slightly below wonderfull, just a collectors item from another time.","March 21, 2015","false","13.4"," 19 of 73 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","19","73","0","7"

I would boil it down to a physx issue, but I don’t think that technology even existed when Pirates was released. Basically what would happen is that when the wind blew a certain direction, any fabric on screen would stretch to infinity and obscure 60-70% of the screen. The next issue I had was that for some reason the primary method of control (awkwardly using the number pad) straight up did not work. I tried a different keyboard as well as an old PS2 board and neither allowed any of the diagonal buttons to register.\n\nI’m not a computer genius or anything, but I can’t imagine all the technical problems I had running the game being anything more than driver issues and modern operating system changes. If you have an older XP system I bet this game is amazing, from the little bit I suffered through, there was so much awesome content.

While you can build up a fleet of ships, this is mostly for maximizing your cargo capacity, and not really for getting increases in combat bonuses (at least as far as I could tell). You can only ever bring one ship into battle, which kept the gameplay very light.

It has a great storyline where you have to save your family, and get revenge on this guy who split you apart from your family. You can also find lost cities which will give you at least 100,000 gold. You can marry a governer's daughter. What I usally do is raid a town. I only raid towns if the governer's daughter is not beatiful rating, or if the town belongs to the Spanish. You can betray the country you pick, and maybe even wipe their city's off the map.

Captain. Reynaldo was a French Privateer raiding English and Spanish shipping he came to amass a small fortune in prizes and plunder he soon became famous and took on more crew, but soon things changed for the worse the French made peace with the spanish and the English merchants were all too scared to sail home. with the money stoping he soon took to darker pursuits, buying strange medicine from a myterious man in a backroom of a shady for 6000 Gold the men soon became worried for their captain, but more so for the loot. the spending was rampent, 3000 gold here a few thousand more there. soon the fortune he had spent years building was well deminished he resorted to outright Piracy to keep the crew in line. he started spinning tales to governors daughters dancing with them hoping to lead them on for more money to buy "exotic" and "mystical" items, but the crew finally agreed it was time for Mutiniy but just as it happened they suddenly came under fire, an English Pirate Hunter masking itself as french. the Crew returned fire a round of chain shot destroyed the main sail and the English promptly surrendered, a large amount of gold was plundered, and the Crew Mutinied taking the Gold and the Captains ship leaving him stranded on an Island.\n\nThus the final score is 10/10 would buy strange medicine from a mysterious man in a dark backroom of a Shady tavarn.","November 2, 2015","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, it's probably one of the most fun games I've ever played. You get to live the fantasy of being a pirate...not with all the realities of wasting months of your life on the sea and all the infections that come with that, but you get to fire cannons and have sword fights on deck and raid colonial fortresses and dance with the governors' beautiful daughters. There is plenty of variety in what you can do in this game. If you're tired of capturing ships for profit, go take an outpost for your favorite nation; search for buried treasure; play the main story line; hunt down famous pirates; get captured just so you can have fun sneaking out of jail. This game never gets boring, and the difficulty levels are sufficient to either give you a leisurely stroll through the Caribbean or a truly gripping fight at sea.

There's a main quest to follow, but you can ignore it if you'd like. There are lost cities to discover, treasure to be unburied, towns to be sacked! Work your way up to the number 1 pirate by defeating famous pirates (including Blackbeard!). It's a game of revenge and adventuring, but even a taste of romance as you dance your way through all the governor's daughters. Literally dancing, because there's a dancing minigame.\n\nOne thing I particularly enjoyed about this game was the combination of real-time and turn-based strategy. Most of it's real-time, but oftentimes if you sack a town, you'll have to pit your pirates against their soldiers in a fun turn-based game (the only time that isn't the case is if your number of pirate greatly trumps their number of soldiers; then you'll just have a sword fight with the Captain of the Guards).\n\nIt's a fun game with several levels of difficulty, plus you can start at different time periods, which will also help decrease or increase the difficulty of the game, so replayability is high.","January 28","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can work for either English, French, Dutch or Spanish - or even for all of them if you time your actions well. There's constantly changing basic economic and political system where player's actions do affect on the bigger picture as well. You can sail, capture ships, fight pirates, trade, do missions, dance with governors daughters and so on. There's many goals to fullfill and many ways to play. Because there's different eras to choose from and the world is open, dynamic and reactive the gaming experience does change lot. There's also different difficulty levels which do have effect. Game's replayability value is quite high and you can get it cheaply, especially on sale.\n\nTechnically speaking I have been playing this game for something like 30 years from it's early versions on Commodore 64.

It's cities burn as people dig through the ashes or else cower under the new governor's you've appointed whom now reign over the new dominions of your country. A great host of men have gathered beneath you, grumbling about being packed like sardines in their triple hammocks but still, eagerly awaiting their share of over one hundred thousand in newly minted Spanish doubloon's. The Spanish, whose military has so spectacularly failed to halt your onslaught now watch in disarray for the dark smudge of smoke on the horizon, a precursor, heralding the terror to come. For the greatest pirate ever to sail, has come to visit and even though the bounty on his head has climbed 'ten thousand, thirty, fifty thousand doubloons?!' still nobody would take them, for none cross....you!\n\nI've been playing this game for years now, it's my every now and then game where I'll play one or two careers.
