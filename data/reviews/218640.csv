The setting, the story-telling, the opening cinematic -- everything about its thematic texture is just so sadistically appealing.\n\nUnfortunately, the product that the trailers, the game descriptions and even other reviews prepared me for was not the product I got. I expected a demonic sandbox chock full of whimsically creative murder. Instead, I got a mediocre Hitman clone with exactly one (absurdly specific) solution for each murder.\n\nThe game teases you with all of these awesome powers straight out of The Omen: telekinesis, mind control, pyromancy. But you can really only use them when the game feels like it.\n\nI would be fine with the restrictions on your mayhem if the game provided some semblance of direction. Instead, you're left to aimlessly wander the game's massive mansion, searching for the tiny, sometimes pixel-perfect item you need to proceed.\n\nThe best example of my frustration was a mission where you had to off your family's beloved butler.\n\n(SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS)\n(SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS)\n(SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS)\n\nThe in-game prompt informs you that it's winter, and it would be a terrible shame if the ancient old goof slipped and fell.\n\nAlright, fair enough -- I probably have to create some ice, huh, Lucius? Let me just grab one of the dozens of interactive cups dotting the mansion, and we'll be off.\n\nWait, what's that? I can't use any of the cups on the sink? Well, then... how am I supposed to get water, bro? Oh, you mean I need a water bottle, because that's "less suspicious?" Okay, fine... Are you gonna maybe give me a hint about which of the mansion's 20+ rooms would be a good place to start? No? Great...\n\nSo, the kitchen then? Nope! The servants' quarters? As if! My bedroom, you say? Oh, you've gotta be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me, Lucius. It's in my bedroom? The very start of the level, which you purposely led me away from via the in-game objective marker? The furthest possible point from where you gave me my mission objective? Fine, Lucius. Fine. I'll go get the ♥♥♥♥ing water bottle.\n\nNow I've probably got to just dump it on the ground by the doorway the butler's sure to walk through while attending to the Christmas lights, right? Oh, that's not right? Of course it isn't, Lucius. Of course it isn't. Instead, I've got to find the one incredibly tiny spot in the middle of the courtyard (the mansion's biggest room) where you want me to put it, don't I? Whatever, Lucius. I don't care enough anymore.\n\nOh, now the butler's taking his sweet time coming outside, huh? Not like he's supposed to be attending to the family during Christmas dinner or anything. Can I just wait for him to have a stroke, Lucius? No, that would be too easy. I'm guessing from your minimal exposition that I'm supposed to tamper with the Christmas lights to get his attention, huh? Fine, let's get to tampering.\n\nNaturally, I assume you won't let me use my telekinesis to pull down the lights. That would be too easy. And also fun. Too much fun for your liking, Lucius. So, what then? Do I need to find some misplaced tool in the farthest wing, only to backtrack to the fuse-box in the next room and fry the circuit breaker? That seems like something you would do, Lucius.\n\nDon't argue with me -- it absolutely does sound like you, Lucius. Okay, fine then -- what do I have to do, buddy?\n\nAhh.... I have to turn off the Christmas Lights via a barely visible light-switch? In fairness, that's also just so you Lucius. So completely you.\n\nThere. I turned off the light-switch and now the butler's coming out. Oh, good! He slipped and fell! But, wait... he's still alive! So, I've got to finish him off... Oh, now you let me use my telekinesis, Lucius? Finally, when it's too late to matter?\n\nYou truly are a generous god, Lucius...\n","February 15, 2015","false","2.1"," 277 of 300 people (92%) found this review helpful 151 people found this review funny","92","277","300","151","9"

The story is in the same vein of the classic horror movie, The Omen.  The game itself mixes together a number of elements from different genres and the outcome is a pretty novel and entertaining experience.\n\nThis game is frequently called a "sandbox" game, and it certainly is.  The whole game takes place in a rather small little "sandbox" that takes the form of a wealthy senator's manor.  But I feel the game is more accurately described as an adventure game that handles like a 3rd person stealth-action game in a tiny sandbox world.\n\nThe game is quite short, (maybe 4-6 hours*), broken up into 18 levels.  In each you solve an adventure-game-style puzzle to murder someone for your father, the Devil.  The story itself is mediocre, but it is told well.  And there is admittedly very, very little content to the game.  Altogether, however, the flow of the story and the length of the levels mesh well into a game that creates a good atmosphere and paces itself perfectly to keep you entertained; so it ultimately feels pleasantly short-and-sweet.\n\nThe graphics and sound neither take away nor add any value to the game.  I experienced no crashes or glitching whatsoever in my playtime.  The controls and interaction are intuitive and work properly.  Everything makes sense as you solve puzzles to beat each level, and there are various in game methods to get hints/help.\n\nThe game is short and entertaining, and worth a playthrough if you would be into what it offers.\n\n*I have a high playtime because I idled to earn an achievement.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 5, 2014","true","49.2"," 238 of 254 people (94%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","94","238","254","14","6"

There's no hesitation, no complex explanations, no hedging of moral bets, or offering a suggestion that the game's victims kind of had it coming. In the game's opening minutes, the player is asked to lock a maid inside a walk-in freezer overnight, for no other reason than because the devil tells them to do it.Lucius is a singularly bleak and nasty experience, its only "redeeming" characteristic being the utter straightforwardness with which it treats its darker subject matter. Not only does the game refuse to shy away from depicting the horrifically violent, it lavishes attention on the atrocities, showing them in slow motion from dramatic camera angles.A third-person adventure game based loosely on the film The Omen, Lucius lets players control the titular character. This nefarious six-year-old spawn of Satan murders everyone foolish enough to come onto the grounds of the family estate.The game is broken up into nearly 20 chapters, each one themed around Lucius killing someone in his house without drawing attention to himself. To accomplish these violent ends Lucius has access to a variety of powers, including telekinesis, mind control, and spontaneous combustion. The game manages to find a wide variety of clever and gruesomely creative ways to employ these powers, but it's important to note that all the cleverness is on the part of the developers—there is no experimentation allowed, and each kill must be performed in a specific pre-scripted fashion.At times, this can make the game feel like it's on rails as the player moves mechanically from one kill to the next with only the barest context offered by cut-scenes. While the brutal murdering goes smoothly enough—in fact, most of the levels can be zipped through in just a couple of minutes if the player knows what to do—there are other aspects of the game that are downright rough.Two key stealth sections are far more difficult than they ought to be because the game never clearly expresses what its rules of stealth are.Even worse are the game's ill-conceived boss fights. There aren't many, but at certain points in the game Lucius is exposed, and has to kill a foe not through guile and trap-laying, but by throwing fireballs at them. The controls are a little wonky to start with, and in these sequences they completely fall apart.While the question of whether it's a good idea to put players in the role of a dead-eyed mute psychopath is open for debate, it's undeniable that Lucius's developers have captured the feel of their inspiration perfectly. There are missteps that keep the game from truly excelling, and the story is serviceable at best, but Lucius provides a unique horror gameplay experience.","December 20, 2014","true","35.6"," 193 of 209 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","193","209","10","2"

I know it was released in the '70s but it had some sequels (and a remake in the 2000s) and it was a unique film so you probably remember it.\n\nLucius, in essence, is the video game version of Omen. You take control of a 6-year old boy who, wait-for-it, is the son of The Devil. Now, the goal here is to eliminate people one by one in the household where Lucius lives. This is quite the manor as daddy is some famous politician who is preparing for the upcoming elections. So, the house is full of maids and other servants - offed one by one without anybody having a clue.\n\nAnd that is the point here. We cause accidents. Pick up items, combine these items and get rid of the evidences or make sure those point to another person. I like how the breadwinner of the family and his wife slowly go mad as they have no idea how these people died or for what reason. Between the almost 20 chapters we get to see many cutscenes with some decent voice acting. A detective gets involved and decides to really find out what goes on with the family.\n\nAnyway, I do not want to spoil it. The game has very nice graphics and memorable music. I like how the effects change to indicate a different time of the day or different season. This is good as it brings us change and running around in the same house does not get boring. Different rooms / areas of the house get into focus in each chapter and it is not uncommon that the season itself has a role.\n\nLater on the game starts granting us abilities such as telekinesis or mind control. To be honest setting people on fire was a bit too much - after all this is an adventure game. I think they should have just stuck with the stealth / adventure approach but for some reason they added this spell to spice up the gameplay a bit. In fact, the ending sees two ways of solving the game: there is an action as well as a puzzle-oriented solution.\n\nThe game has some flaws, though. For instance, in some cases I really could not find out as to what I needed to do. Lucius does hint at the next task (you have a journal which regularly gets updated with his notes) but they are not always very helpful. Oh well, just grab some guides then and complete the game like in the old days with the point-and-click adventures, am I right?\n\nI am a bit perplexed to see many negative reviews stating this game is mediocre at best. I think this is a nice little game and a must-have for the adventure game fans or those who like the idea of playing an homage to Omen.\n","March 25, 2015","true","15.5"," 83 of 90 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","83","90","5","0"

Games have changed and advanced, many scores are based on replayabilty, the scope of the enviroments, and freedom of variation in how to go about things. That's all superb standards to go by today, in open world/sandbox games. However, there is something to be said about restriction in games. With freedom of choice can also come a certain stress, and a sense of incompletion. There's the time and place for both, naturally, but some times there is something soothing and satisfying about playing a game the only way it's meant to be played.\n\n"Lucius" is about exploring your surroundings and figuring out how the puzzles are solved. Sometimes the solution is far fetched, sometimes ridiculous. But all in all, there's some sort of logic there.\nI enjoyed this game far more than I probably should have. I liked it's simplicity, the house and garden, the idea of it all. Granted, there was much more potential behind the concept that was left unrealised, but for what it was, I enjoyed it.\n\nShiver Games tried to respond to peoples objections and critique to this first game somewhat in the sequel, which I can't speak of as I haven't played it, but, it did seem like that game have fallen apart in them trying to do so. It was probably more somewhat what they wanted the first "Lucius" to be; being able to have access to a variety of tools to make death traps, lethal situations and weapons to off any number of roaming NPCs at any given point. From what I've read and seen though those ambitions resulted in a broken game with great potential. The more complex, the more wrong things can go.\n\n"Lucius" has its fair share of bugs and limitations. But it also has a great idea behind it, and for me personally, finally getting the kill I was going for was surprisingly satisfying, as was achieveing "good boy" status by doing mundane chores around the house.\nMy guess is, if you get some self therapy by say, doing the dishes or painting the fence, you might enjoy this game.

As you play you may recall such movies as The Omen, The Shining, The Exorcist and Final Destination, among others. Also, if you like Hitman and Death to Spies series, then this game is definitely for you.\n\n\nAnyways, I believe that Shiver Games is onto something here. This could easily be made into a movie. You play as the son of devil who wants you to harvest souls for him by killing people, or by rather making it look like freak, deus ex kind of accidents. You live in a huge manor along with a congressman (your fake father), his family and about a dozen of staff.\n\n\nYou play through 18 chapters (even though four separate chapters are molded into two missions, so it's essentially 16 chapters).The game may take you at least 6 hours to beat if you don't use any help online (which I quite often did).\n\n\nThis game requires your utmost attention, there are no abstract objectives as to what you are supposed to be doing. You have to read between the lines. You have to use your Ouija board and your notebook to try to figure out who is the next target. It may take you a long time to figure out which tool to use and on whom. After the sixth mission or so, you get access to the rest of the manor and you can pick up items that you are going to need for the rest of the game, making the job easier later on.\n\n\nYou also get to do around 7 menial chores to increase your behavior level in order to get three presents from your parents.\nAs far as the killings go, well some of them are absolutely atrocious and were it not for the somewhat mediocre engine, they could look even more gruesome. The ambiance is awesome, the soundtrack is outstanding, the voice over decent enough (by male actors mostly, I found female voice acting weak).\n\n\nOne thing that bugs me is that Lucius doesn't speak, although they admit to that in the game itself.......There are also numerous crosses spread throughout the house that are nailed to the walls. These crosses take away your abilities of which there are 4 (telekinesis, pyro-control, mind control and forgetfulness spell). So you have to turn them upside down to be able to do your black magic tricks.\n\n\nThe story and the pacing of the game are amazingly well put together, the "freak accidents" get more and more, well, freaky, and the detective investigating the murders narrates the entire story with a small preamble before each mission. Your parents also start getting suspicious to the point of them being scared of you, so every murder has an effect in the game. This kind of story telling sucks you in to say the least.\n\n\nThe last buggy mission coupled with some graphical glitches like (people warping ahead or you getting stuck in doors) was slightly annoying but it wasn't anything game breaking. In the end, I feel that this game needed slightly more polish.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is definitely an adult game, made by a confident studio. If the religious Right had GTA in their cross-hairs for all these years, then I would not be surprised if this game got the same treatment. That would be awesome so the game could get more publicity resulting in more sales. So please don't forget to support this new and bold Indie Developer, this IS a PC-exclusive after all.","November 27, 2013","true","78.7"," 116 of 143 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","116","143","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrFrogAddMe/recommended/218640/","DrFrogAddMe","Dr. Frog ☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrFrogAddMe/","500 products in account","Lucius is loosely based off of the 1976 movie “The omen.” The game revolves around a 6 year old boy, who kills members of his household to please his father; Satan.\n\n\n\nAs far as the story goes, Lucius, the devil's son, murders members of his household, making them look like accidents. The Devil approaches you once in awhile, to congratulate you, as well as provide useful abilities or to demand better sacrifices. Over time, the means to kill your target, become harder and more arbitrary. After killing most of the live-ins, you will progress to start killing family members, leading up to the final chapter.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay revolves around checking notes, listening to people, doing chores on occasion, and finding a way to kill your target. The player will always be in the same house, and never leave it, becoming boring over time. The house, overall, has a creepy feel to it, fitting properly into the story, however becoming dull rather quickly. The player will spend time in three main areas of the house, with a lot of unexplored areas.\n\n\n\nThe art style, although aged at the time of this review, is still present; dark, creepy and mysterious. The sound and music in Lucius come across perfectly, trying to add to the creepy atmosphere. The Voice Acting is well done, by most of the cast. Some characters are more convincing than others but no character really stands out as a “Bad sounding character”.\n\n\n\nThe game can be confusing at times, with the ingame hints being extremely arbitrary. The game isn't overly linear, making the game a tad harder to progress, and may be frustrating. With hundreds of hints and walkthroughs online, makes completing the game very easy, however if you are the type of gamer that refuses to look things up online it may take a long while before you complete all the chapters. I Myself only looked online when it came to the final “Boss fight”.\n\n\n\nLucius did a lot of things right:\n\n\n\n\nThe sound and voices in game is solid\n\n\nThe cutscenes are gruesome and fantastic\n\n\nThe achievements are rather easy, if you plan ahead\n\n\nLucius is an enjoyable character\n\n\nLucifer is the best sounding, and most interesting character\n\n\nThe kills are satisfying\n\n\n\n\nLucius does a few things wrong\n\n\n\n\nMassive map with spread out objectives\n\n\nCan be very glitchy\n\n\nCan be boring if lost or confused\n\n\nMay be frustrating to some players\n\n\ncan be to easy or to hard depending on skill level\n\n\n\n\nOverall, lucius is a good game, it has its bugs and problems but can be very enjoyable. I killed almost 10 hours alone just playing the story, and i still got over 70% of the achievements by accident. Is it worth the $10.99CAD pricetag? That depends on if you enjoy either hunting achievements or are a fan of the genre. Although different from “The Omen” it's still very similar and fans of the movie will most likely enjoy it. Pick it up on sale sometime and give it a play.\n","November 3, 2015","true","9.1"," 66 of 75 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","66","75","9","1"

The graphics are fairly well done (in my opinion) and you have the option to customise the controls to suit you. As for the voice acting, there's not much to say. They did a good job and they worked well in the games setting. My only real issue (though it isn't much of one) would be the lack of an option to save. If you got caught, you had to start the level (next murder, they appear to save after each one) from the beginning which can be a hassle if your PC dies on you or you need to attend urgent business. Overall, I'd say it's a decent and well-done game by Shiver that I suggest buying if you like bloodshed as there can be some pretty surprising and nasty deaths along the line, all organised by one little boy.

There is so much of unused potential it is sad. The basic idea is great but the execution is sadly lacking in almost every way.\n\nYou could think that in Lucius you will be placed in an open playground that lets you experiment with using environment for your intentions while there will be dynamic reaction of other people on your actions. But that is completely wrong. Instead of that you are forced to kill your victims in one and only exact fashion. No place for creativity or multiple ways to do that.\n\nAnd the game is so unpolished. There is a load of bugs and glitches from the smaller (items in characters hands tend to move awkwardly during cutscenes) to really problematic (that can force you to repeat the whole mission). I can overlook some problems but there are just to many of them to be such benevolent with Lucius.\n\nAlso the core gameplay mechanics are poorly designed. For example you have paranormal abilities which you can use to manipulate others. To use them you have to switch to them...but then you can't use anything (open doors, search through drawers etc.) as that is also a separate ability. Or later in game you get a chance to conjure fireballs but when you begin to cast them the effect will cover your sight and you will not see what's ahead of you. There are also some "stealth" missions where you are forced to do them over and over again (and there are really long loadings) until you learn how to go through them step by step.\n\nWell, Lucius is not a good game. But it is not so horrible as it can sound from my words either. The story is actually ok, the slowly deteriorating mental state of your family is for the most parts well done and the voice acting is nice. But the game has so many gameplay issues, bugs and other things.

This allowed you to explore the various rooms and grab objects ahead of time.\n\nThe item combinations made practical sense in how they were used together to accomplish objectives.\n\nPut batteries into flashlight check. Put clip into gun. Check. Use poison on food. Check.\n\nThe real challenge is finding items themselves, since you have the entire place open to you from the start. The map is useful since it identifies the locations with silly drawings. It helps you navigate a bit more to places you think the items are even if its not always obvious.\n\nNote: If you do chores you can unlock items that give you hints and show locations of items also making the game much easier to get through.\n\nCharacters\nThe  progression of character development occurs only to the dad of the antichrist, grandfather, mother and the detective. The characters could have been fleshed out better and maybe have some leave its only natural to flee when death occurs that frequently at any place you live/work at.\n\nProgression of Power\nAt first hes just a kid who has to hide his powers from the adults since they are great threats to him. As the antichrist grows stronger throughout the game adults cease to be the threats they once were. At this point he notices he doesn't have to hide his powers anymore from the family because hes grown strong enough to fight them even when exposed. This gives the game a great sense of progression.\n\nLinear But Complex\n+ Non-linear level design\n- Linear Deaths (Not much replay value)\n\nWhile clearly the level design is not linear, the way and place you kill them is always the same. The variety of ways you have to kill your family/servants makes up for the fact you can’t kill a particular person in many ways.\n\nThe story would require a lot of alternative branches to address it if it was done the other way around. For example in the start when you kill off the lady by using a fridge to change her temperature and give her a attack, they mention it in the story. This is done a lot of the family members and really contributes to the frustration of the detective you really feel this guy is always two steps behind you and always trying to catch up.\n\nKeep in mind that means there isn’t much replay value to be had here. In a sense you will probably replay maybe 1-2 times, or max 3 if the story interests you enough. Though that is different from person to person of course.\n\nChores missed the point\nDoing all the chores does not contribute to how the characters think of you. Having you do chores to look innocent while also getting bonus items to help you progress the game would have made a great combination of both character progression and reflection.\n\nQuiet is Substance\nHonestly I am not a big fan of quiet characters especially when they are the main characters. In this case though given the premise of the game it actually works in its favor. When you see this kid never talk to his family or the servants it really comes off as creepy, and this is also noticed by the in game characters also. Later in the game they will reference that you don’t talk at all etc. Overall, I think it was actually a good choice.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, I would say this game is pretty good in executing the progression and idea of the antichrist. It seemed the developers picked progression of characters over variety of ways you could kill off a character.","May 2, 2014","true","28.2"," 60 of 75 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","60","75","0","0"

The games premise is just that, kill everyone for Satan, expect the ways you have to go about doing so are quite different and unique, the main gameplay mechanics feel like a mix between classic Hitman trial and error with it's environmental deaths. Where combining found items with environmental hazards usually result in a entertaining death cutscene and no suspicioun cast upon Lucius.\n\nNow the story isn't great, the voice acting is hammy and weirdly paced making it sound like sentences are being stitched together from totally different actors and the animations aren't detailed either. Some of the characters are interesting enough, for example Lucius' grandfather is a hard man who has something to hide and his motives are shown throughout the game and give an interesting look on the family's rise to power and occult ties. The mother slowly losing her mind lead to some interesting ambient dialogue like her asking Lucius to brush his teeth in a loving tone then immediately telling him to bug off because he's creeping her out, it's more than likely a bug but humorous none the less. As far as visuals are concerned, they're entirely fine for the most part, there are moment's when the game can be quite beautiful and others when it looks like a scene from a cut Deadly Premonition level.\n\nThe flow they achieve between making the game challenging but not making it frustrating looking for obscure items and solutions to problems are troubling, far too often I had to look up a FAQ on what obscure non related item I needed to complete a task that could have been simply completed another, far simpler way. That also brings out how the limited the game actually is in it's structure and openness to the player, Dante's Mansion, the games only location, is large and sprawling with countless rooms and corridors but most aren't used frequently or at all.\n\nAs a closing thought, I did really enjoy the game, the absurdity of the kills and the way the narrative tries to justify 20 deaths in one house as accidents so the detective working the cases doesn't have to call the FBI, is dumb fun, and entertaining. I would recommend anyone who is a fan of the older Hitman games and likes using the environment to kill hapless victims to try this game out, you mind fun for a good weekend of kill all for the glory of old pop Satan.\n\n+ Environmental kills are fun and interesting\n+ Graphics are nice in spots and the location is mostly well designed\n+ Interesting idea and premise\n+ Powers can lead to interesting gameplay mechanics\n\n- Story is a little dumb, and stretches the players disbelief far\n- Voice action and animations are lackluster\n- Puzzles/Kills can be far too obtuse and can lead to frustration\n- Limited in it's scope and options to the player\n\n7.5 out of 10","August 11, 2014","true","5.3"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","34","37","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/recommended/218640/","scares","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/","666 products in account","Game name: Lucius\nGame score: 8/10\nReviewed by: Wolf\n\nIn Summary...Lucius is a third-person adventure game that follows a boy's murder spree after his 6th birthday in 1972. Roughly based off the movie The Omen, Lucius gains satanic abilities after he is visited by Lucifer, who reveals that he is in fact, his real father. After this information is revealed, Lucius prepares to do his bidding, which is kill everyone inside his huge home, Dante Manor.\n\nAfter murders begin to unfold, residents become wary of what's happening around the estate, knowing they're going to be next. With a memorable hook and interesting story filled with satanic powers, murder, lore and more, Lucius delivers the same experience as The Omen gives off.\n\n\nControls:WASD - Movement\nMouse - Look\nLeft click - Interact\nQ - Notebook (chore list as well as mission hints)\n1-5 keys - Switch ability\n\nGameplay:Although linear, Lucius is entailed to only work toward killing a certain character which only allows him to explore certain areas of the estate. Yet, by level 15, you've freely unlocked the whole place with no restrictions. It seems far off, but you should mainly focus on the story rather than wandering off to explore areas that come before needed. (There is an achievement for finding the secret area before chapter 7, which is very easy to do during the night scene).\n\nLucius is equipped with 4 powers by the end of the game: telekinesis, mind control, memory erase, and combustion. With these, you will be able to find was to harm your enemies as well as do various other tasks (like chores). Cliche to the story, Lucius also becomes weak and cannot perform when a cross is present, so he must flip it over (super chiche).\n\nThe game does get buggy at times which is why I only gave this an 8/10. The models sometimes clip into each other and also stretch out when the conditions are right (example: clipping into an object being closed while you're still moving). There's also a neat-o bug present when using the tricicle, which allows you to glitch out of the building and explore the area outside the map. It's kind of neat to see what's out there.\n\nGraphics:Graphics are limited to 1080p in-menu, but can be adjusted to your native if you wish by editing the config file found in your documents folder under Lucius. There's also settings to set all the way up to very high (ultra) which makes everything better contrasted and increases motion blur as compared to the high setting. I've never recommended anything lower than medium if you're playing this game, as low setting makes your game way too bright and severely dulls it out. If anything, lower end systems should play this at 720p medium settings (just be sure you at least meet the minimum recommended specs or you'll have a very bad time.\n\nIn game, I was able to maintain a constant 60fps at 1080p Ultra settings, with occational dips at possible area loading points (the map is fairly big, yet not like Battlefield map size, just big) down to around 45-50fps. Scenes is where it gets bad, since at times when high rendered assets are splashed onto the screen, making the game drop down to 20fps at times. The issues are still being fixed, even after the dev team has released another game even, they still continue to update this game.\n\nGame Balance:The only intruding aspect about this game is when you're supposed to be asleep but you're wondering around the area at night. If you're caught you will have a game over (until you gain memory erase).\n\nOtherThe game is still being actively updated and fixed (even just recently they fixed the achievement "I'm addicted" to where previously you had to be in-game and not alt-tabbed out and play 40 hours. Now it's based off Steam time.\n\nFinal Rating:8/10\n\nIn Conclusion:I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed The Omen or enjoys stories such as this. It's truely a unique game, and has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest indie games (in my book). The game is often on sale for very cheap (original is $10, sales make it under $2, and various sites have done giveaways (which is how I got 20+ keys) so it's very easy to get).\n\nPlease feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations.

That is Lucius, a horror-focused action adventure.\n\nSo, the idea is great; a free roam game where you get to kill people like in those famous horror movies we've all seen. You'll be using items and powers to kill off these people. It's not all that straightforward though. You have to solve little puzzles to complete objectives. And every time you complete one of these objectives you're one step closer to killing a certain someone.\n\nBut it's all executed in a mediocre way; the inventory is cumbersome to use, but manageable. The 'stealth' missions are terrible; there's no way to see where a certain character is so you'll bump into someone frequently. And sometimes the hints you get just aren't clear enough, which results in you doing the wrong thing. And when it's Game Over you have to start the mission all over again (including sidequests).\n\nIt's an interesting idea though. And I would love to see a(n improved) sequel someday.\n\n[Rating: 65/100]","October 28, 2012","false","7.4"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","45","57","0","0"

Your quest is to kill everyone in the house, 'cause you need human sacriface for your daddy, some guy who work in the "underground". If you want to be a hero, and not a villian, this is not the game for you.\n\nThe story isn't bad at all, its actually pretty nice. Sure, it takes some forced ways into the story, and you clearly see them, but they won't bother you much. At least, it didn't bother me, it actually made the game much more interesting.\nThe ending isn't also bad, but it left me with a feel of uncompletionist. Probably was too fast.\n\nThe gameplay works fine: you have to collect items around the house to complete goals to kill people and make the homicides looks like accidents. Sadly the difficulty goes to insanely hard that "I don't even know what to do" to "this is so easy that even a 6 years old kid whould do that". Did I mention you're a 6 years old kid?\n\nThe music it's pretty fitting, but it gets repetive real soon. And expecially sometimes it bugs out, like it disappear or change theme out of nowhere and you don't know what's goin on, even tho' nothing is goin on.\n\nThe graphic its "meh": there ain't no good facial expression, and the lip sinc its all broken, but for some reason, the ambiance looks awesome, and the gore works fine.\nIt seems the creator couldn't put in some good face flexes.\n\nI've encounter some bugs and glitch along the game, and sometimes they made me restart the mission. For exemple, I opened the journal during a cutscene, and the game freeze. Couldn't move. Or in a cutscene, I was riding the tricicle before that happened, and Lucius was flying around.

I am a huge fan of the hitman franchise, puzzle games, and being an edgy powerful spawn of satan that can manipulate people and burn ♥♥♥♥ with his/her mind. I expected this to be an open ended puzzle game with many solutions to every mission (offering replayability) that slowly worked up to a Carrie-esque climax when your power reaches an apex.\n\nThis was not the case.\n\nReasons:\n1. Every mission can only be solved one way. Past the 7th mission, [almost] every mission is solved by simply manipulating people to kill themselves. Most missions are either too easy or pseudo-difficult by not allowing you to use your satan given powers for unexplained reasons. Some missions are so unbelievably easy that it can take quite a few minutes to figure out because you need to take a moment and stop thinking creatively.\n\n2. At your most powerful, a priest with a looped cliche voiceline "The power of christ compels you" can "game over" you in the matter of seconds. Same goes for a man with a fire extinguisher. Aparently, satan's child can be killed by a swift whack to the face with a fire extinguisher. Oh and god forbid satan's son got surrounded by fire because OF COURSE you can't walk through it. Same goes for locked doors.\n\n3. The game does not play smoothly. In order to open a door, you must have the "hand" ability equiped instead of any of the other powers given to you. Every action just enables another animation/cutscene. This makes you feel separated from the character entirely and everything feel like a chore. Might as well actually get off the computer and pace a large ♥♥♥ mansion looking for some super glue... the graphics in real life are better.\n\n4. There was absolutely no attention to detail. The developers were obviously very lazy as they did not fix/add simple things. Uncomfortable pauses in voice acting, clipping, glitching, dull gore, the list goes on. One of the most lazy moments: When people see you using a power, you are spotted and it's a game over which makes sense but at one point, a person who is trying to kill you knows that you are a spawn of satan and you can still get a game over by them seeing you use a power in order to defend yourself. I suppose the developers simply forgot to remove this feature at this part in the game. This is probably because it is near the end and none of them could actually bring themselves to play this far.\n\n5. The story is  The Omen  how original!\n\n6. The side quests are so dull the developers didn't expect anyone to actually do all of them. Well guess what ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I did. I did all of your boring side missions. I did them because they unlocked items in game! However, this is only true for the first three or four chores. After this, the developers couldn't come up with any more easter eggs/items to use. Imagine doing a tedious side quest in an RPG only to be prompted with "No more awards available" after you ran Dr.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥head's Bread all the way to Fort Shimbles!\n\n7. Even the achievments are lazy.\n\n8. Finally, the developers were lazy which completely makes the game unenjoyable.\n\nThe moral of the story, don't give these lazy ♥♥♥ devs even two dollars of your money because they may possibly devote their profits toward ruining another good game idea!","February 8, 2015","false","8.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","4"

The concept is interesting, since it's kinda like reverse horror, but unfortunately the execution is poor.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much just murdering the people in the house in a certain order and in a pre-determined way and watching a cutscene showing the murder. After the murder cutscene you get a new cutscene, which usually involves a detective, who is put on the case after your first murder. The game could have easily been a point-and-click game, because you just look for items and after using the right items you watch the murder commence.\n\nThe game let's you free roam around the fairly big manor between the murders, but there isn't much to do aside from some "fetch quests" called chores and looking for items needed in future murders. After doing enough chores you get some items, of which 2 just give hints for the murder puzzles and the last one is a tricycle. The tricycle let's you move around the manor a bit faster and also let's you use a glitched staircase to get out of the house.\n\nAfter each murder you get a new superpower or upgrades to the ones you already have. The game has 4 superpowers: telekinesis, mind control, memory erase and combustion. You will need all those superpowers for the murder puzzles and while you can use some of them for other purposes, they're not really fun. The combustion power is also used in the boss battles the game has and also in some extra mini-game, which seemed to involve priests chasing you (a child) with crosses in a dark forest. I didn't like the boss battles or that mini-game at all, because the combustion power isn't fun and felt a bit clunky to use.\n\nGraphics-wise the game looks pretty good for an indie game, but the devs decided to occasionally use some post-processing effects, which actually made the game look a bit uglier. The lip-syncing seemed to be a bit off, but it didn't really bother me. The voice acting ranged from pretty good to quite awful. The game also has a pretty badly done sex, which looks quite funny as a result and there's some frontal 3D nudity as well.\n\nThe story and dialogue is pretty bad and the ending was probably one of the worst endings ever.\n\nIt's a pretty bad game, which could have been so much more. I wouldn't really recommend playing it unless you want to experience some pretty funny glitches. The game is pretty short (took me 5 and a half hours to complete), so it's not like you'd waste a lot of time.","December 4, 2013","false","7.1"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","33","50","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/218640/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Lucius is classified as an adventure game, but I feel like it deserves its own genre: Murder simulator.  You play as, essentially, the son of the devil and stealthily murder people one by one.  It's a twisted concept that is pulled off very well and is surprisingly fun.\n\nStorytelling isn't this game's strong point as it isn't written or acted very well and seems to take a second seat to the gameplay.  In a normal adventure game this would be a problem but here, gameplay is the focus.  Otherwise it does have a similar structure to other adventure games: picking up various objects from the world, combining them, and discovering ways to use them to accomplish your current goal.  Lucius is a third-person 3D game though which is unusual for the genre.\n\nThe main drawback of this game is that it can be very difficult to figure out what to do to progress, especially in the later chapters.  The mansion is quite large and the game generally only gives you vague clues about where to go and rarely what you actually need to do there.  You end up with a lot of useless items in your inventory which confuse things even further.\n\nFor the technical aspect, the graphics aren't very good and it requires a surprising amount of power to render them.  Loading times are surprisingly long for the graphical quality but not long enough to make the game annoying to play.  The engine also has a constant persistent stutter like the Gamebryo engine that seems to be impossible to get rid of.\n\nIf I had to sum up Lucius in two words, I'd say "delightfully twisted."  It's great fun despite the technical issues and poor writing.","February 25, 2014","true","52.0"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/218640/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","Despite its ups and downs, I think overall it’s a good game. If you just remember that it is a game and it would have been really difficult to give it the kind of freedom you might have been expecting, that is.\n\n(I tried to keep this one fairly short but alas, that just didn’t happen. Prepare your attention span!)\n\nI meant the above in the sense that this game tries to give you an “open” feeling to it, as if it’s not linear and you are wreaking havoc at your own expense. But when you get down to it, it is linear. It’s quite closed and it’s more of an organised chaos then just plain ol’ chaos. Given that, it’s still a very enjoyable game. I would consider this game still quite indie, so that makes me think even more that for what resources they had or what they were capable of with a small team, they pulled off a really decent game.\nBecause of how the gameplay is laid out, each chapter you’re given a new target and in ways it kind of felt like more of a puzzle to figure out what you had to do with them rather then you plotting your own devilish plan. Which I still found quite fun.\n\nThere was a few times I really had no idea what I was supposed to do. Especially at the beginning when you get past the early stages of the game where parts of the house are blocked off and you can’t roam around as much. When the game stopped leading me to where and what I was supposed to do and I was finally able to access the whole house, I wasn’t sure on how it was supposed to work. Can I pick them off in any order, do I have to do them in an order and if so, what is the order, or what? Well, after wondering around for a long time completing chores of which I wasn’t sure of why I was doing either, I finally figured it all out.\nSo, if you get something similar I’d just say stick with it, it all becomes clear as you go. My state of confusion didn’t last too long and in all honesty I can be dumb as hell sometimes.\n\nIn terms of story it was interesting. I wasn’t really sure of where they were going with it or how the whole thing was going to conclude but I was eager to find out. It’s nothing too profound or life changing but it was definitely not predictable or disappointing.\n\nThe English voice acting in this game is a little cringe worthy at times. It’s not horrifically bad but you can tell there is no Academy Award winners amongst the lot. The worst in my opinion being the stereotypically drunk Irish janitor.\nWith that said, I don’t think this game is primarily English. So I can see how the English voice acting might be a little lacked if they were focused mainly on another language.\n\nMoving onto graphics. The graphics are pretty decent and I think I would say that “scenery and general surroundings”-wise is where its strengths are at. The AI and character models however are not the best. I got a very “Garry’s Mod videos before Valve Source Filmmaker” feeling off of it at times. I might be over exaggerating a bit there. I think it’s just the expressions and slight glitches to the models that gave me that feeling. The AI is very robotic, the characters wonder around the house replaying a laid out routine (which I guess they have to on some level, seeing as certain characters need to be “lured” to a certain place and you can only do that by waiting for them to lap back around to where you need them). They also shout the same sets of dialog at you whenever you get within a certain radius of them (doesn’t even matter if there’s a wall between you, you WILL get yelled at through walls).\n\nJust to moan about the characters that tad bit more and bore you all to death when it’s not really necessary because I actually like the game, I am going to mention the lack of… well… character… that I felt from our little man Lucius.\nThis isn’t something that bothered me all that much but I thought it worth mentioning.\nI love the concept of playing as a slightly younger character. “Among the Sleep” Is what I’m going to be comparing to. Among the Sleep was a game where you played as a toddler and the child like mannerisms and little gestures and what not in that game really impressed me. You walk, talk and generally act like a toddler. You run too fast? You’re poor little baby self will fall over.\nMaybe this wasn’t the best comparison to use seeing as the obvious age difference with the two characters in the two games. A 2 year old Vs. a 6 year old is hardly the same. But I kind of felt that the fact Lucius is so young and therefore it being so disturbing him being so sadistic, wasn’t emphasised enough. I kind of felt like I was just playing as a midget adult. Which, I guess you could argue he isn’t like a child at all and maybe that is the point? But, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if Lucius had more “demon child” like characteristics. Especially given that your character doesn’t speak, mute characters usually need something to show their character in others ways then just talking. Or maybe I am just over analysing!\n\nIn terms of achievements this one is very doable. I played through the whole game and ended up going back for some achievements (which is easy to do seeing as there is a chapter select included). I’m currently at 97% and in honesty the last two I need are baffling as too why they’d even add them in.\nThe last two are for playing the game for 20 and 40 hours. Now, I’d say I must have played through the game one and a half times. With that I’m at 9 hours at the moment. Now, with some simple maths you can obviously see that you’d need to play the game a nonsensically amount of times to actually get the 40 hour achievement. I know it’s titled “I’m addicted” but I think I’d actually feel genuinely worried for anyone that played a game about a demon child murdering people that many times. I think I’ll just idle for these last two! Other than that though, it’s an easy 100%.\n\nEDIT: I have found that with the two last achievements, you cannot idle the game on the menu screen! You actually have to be in the game for it to work! (Hence why I have 72 hours on record, not just the 40 I need. Took me a while to notice it wasn’t working) I thought this was worth mentioning for any achievement hunters out there.\n\nAll in all, despite me moaning and droning on about certain things, I would say this game is great and well worth a try. It’s something a bit different and unique. It also has a sequel of which I think I’m definitely going to be trying out. If you’re looking for something fun and mischievous to play then this one is a good place to start. Overall I got a very positive feeling off of this one.\n\n\nTL;DR: Quite linear, interesting story, kind of cringe English voice acting, decent graphics, alright characters, an easy 100% and generally a lot of fun. Definitely try it if you’re looking for a bit of mischievous fun.","September 6, 2015","true","72.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","13","15","3","4"

Think Hitman, but if you were a satan-spawn and had much more restricted, linear gameplay.\n\nFirst off, I want to make clear the fact that I really enjoyed the game and played it to completion, however, I have a very specific reason why I have given a "do not recommend" rating - which will be explained below. Suffice it to say that I do not support certain types of developer behavior/gameplay mechanics when playing games.\n\nI had the pleasure of having this game gifted to me by one of my very generous friends, and he wanted me to review it once I had a chance to play. Thanks again!\n\nIf you enjoy devil/demonic themes, graphic violence and death scenes, and being the son of Satan, than you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good - the detail in the character models and background (ex: rooms of the mansion) are well-done. The music and sounds are good, and the BGM really matches the gameplay and themes - adding to the atmosphere set by the game. The story is okay, but nothing too fancy - you are a demonic child and must kill people to satisfy your father, the devil.\n\nThe controls are simple and easy to learn - the tutorials are always quick and helpful. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, the most difficult aspect of the game is probably figuring out the specific ways to kill your targets. To remedy this, you can unlock the music box, which is infused by Satan and will show you "hints" whenever you activate it. In order to unlock this useful item, you must complete almost all (you can miss/ignore one) available chores in the game. Examples include throwing out the garbage, cleaning your room, and finding your mom's missing earings.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is decent - each chapter requires you to kill someone in your mansion. Admittedly, the regular mansion setting may become boring, however, the game compensates for this by progressively unlocking more parts of the house to be accessible. When you begin a chapter, both your map and journal will help direct you to your target. Usually, you will be given good hints in your journal regarding the next steps to kill your targets. Again, if you find yourself having trouble, work to finish off your chores so you can unlock the music box.\n\nAs a devil child, crosses weaken your powers, so you must turn any crosses upside down to negate their effects. As you progress through the game, you will unlock new powers, like telekinesis, mind-erase, and combustion. Tutorials are provided by Satan whenever you receive new abilities. You can fail chapters by revealing yourself - which occurs if you use your powers (primarily telekinesis) within sight of others. Something I liked about the game is how you can do things that make subsequent missions much easier - usually by reducing time. For example, if you like exploring and picking up all available items, you will probably pick up an item that will allow you to progress through a future mission without having to double-back into the house. The house is fairly large, and the map helps a lot in orienting yourself with the landscape.\n\nAt the end of the game, you  have one of two routes to select, which changes the type of boss battles you face - I don't believe this changes the ending . The ending is a bit anti-climatic, but the overall journey and cutscenes are pretty good. A number of the death scenes are fairly graphic, so that is something to be aware of if you are particularly squeamish. There are 20 chapters, allowing for a variety of death types and related puzzles. There is also a  peeping tom segment where you watch a maid taking a bath (you see breasts and some bush) .\n\nFor achievement hunters, achieving 100% is not that difficult, however, there are two extremely ridiculous achievements - one requiring 20 and the other 40 hours of playtime. Note that this DOES NOT mean idling time, but actual game playtime. From what I've read and experienced, you cannot leave the game running with the menu on, or even stand straight. Some people like to have the W (forward) key held down so the character is always walking. Another silly achievement is cycling (unlocked by doing chores) for x miles because the achievement for sprinting x miles can be completed within one or two playthroughs. I have a big problem with this style of achievements because it is essentially gametime mining - and I absolutely HATE artificial-game-lengtheners. If you take your time with the game and do two playthroughs to  try both ending routes, when you could just as easily load the chapter and select the other option , you could PROBABLY stretch the gameplay to ~10 hours.\n\nThe two achievements require 20 and 40 NON-IDLING hours. I find that absolutely ridiculous, given the amount of time it takes to complete the game. As an avid game reviewer, I just cannot accept or support this type of behavior. If these achievements were removed, or reduced to reasonable hours, then I would immediately switch my "do not recommend" to "recommend." Even if you are not an achievement junkie, I cannot encourage this type of gametime farming - because I know there are always people willing to 100% complete a game.\n\nIf you like role-playing as the son of Satan, wrecking havoc on your family household in the name of evil, then give this game a try.\n\nRecommend, but DO NOT support stupid game design practices as seen in the achievements.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","November 19, 2014","false","6.0"," 88 of 159 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","88","159","4","20"

Now if the baby was born on 6-06-06 and the game was set back in the day just a bit further than what it is now (60 years lol), it would be freakier.\n\nIt's nice to play the bad person for once in a video game, that is what makes Lucius refreshing. The music is creepy enough to set the tone of the game and the controls are easy to use. There is no reset to default in the keybinds, so be sure you want to rebind keys before procceding. Some of the quests can be quite confusing. "What do I do?" is the most used question I have asked myself throughout this game. You are not really given hints on what to do or where to go until you do them and your notebook is updated. Thanks notebook, where were you before I did this or that?! Satans notebook bites.\n\nMan, I am one evil, little 6 year old murderous brat, it's great. Another creepy thing is, when writing this review my text was spazzing out all over the place.

The goal is really simple: In each chapter (there are 18), you have to kill someone in a SPECIFIC way. Even better, you're all isolated in a big manor in which you can explore in every chapter as you wish (mostly). There's not much to do in this manor except the goal of each chapter and some optional chores (to be a good boy ;) ) but it's still fun to explore every corner of this giant place every time.\n\nThe main problem with this game for most people is that you don't get to choose how to kill this person. You have to find some items, put them (or interact with them) at specific places to achieve your goal. For me, it's not a problem. As long as you're okay with that, you'll like this game very much !\n\nEach murders are not extremely hard but I wouldn't say that they are easy. You'll have to think about everything and listen to different conversations to know the locations of different items that might be useful for this muder. You also have access to a notebook in which there will be clues as you progress in the murder. The clues are sometimes very specific and sometimes hard to understand but it makes the charm of Lucius. Take your time and think about it.\n\nAlso, as the son of the devil, you'll have supernatural powers to help you kill people without being detected by the other members of the manor. These powers aren't use enough in my opinion and it would have been usefull to work more on that to have more ways to kill people.\n\nFinally, if you like horror games that doesn't always take you by the hand, you'll like that. Just know that there is only one way to kill each person so see this game as a puzzle in each chapter and you'll have a lot of fun !\n","June 21, 2015","true","4.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

You are pretty much the antichrist as a child and you kill people to please Lucifer and get stronger whilst not letting people find out about your real identity. The game is set up on a huge victorian-style mansion, with a lot of rooms to explore and designed in a way that it doesn't feel repetitive or confusing at all.\n\nThe gameplay kind of mixes a sleath-ish style with an old-school game where you have to really search the rooms, collect objects and use them intelligently to complete each chapter. In fact, this game reminds me a lot of older games in the sense that it looks rather rough but presents an amazing gameplay experience.\n\nThe soundtrack and voice acting were rather bad. The voice acting seems to be rather desynced with the model's mouth movements. It really seems as if the game was poorly dubbed from another language other than english. The soundtrack is rather repetitive and very uninspiring.\n\nThe achievements are the best part of this game. They are rather easy to get but can be missed if the player doesn't pay attention. The only bad achievements are the "I like this game" and "I am addicted" ones, that the devs added to try to stretch the gameplay time. Fortunately there is a guide that teaches a method to work around them.\n\nOverall this is an amazing game that is very underrated.

The reason I was interested in this game is because of the obvious: you're the son of the devil and you kill people. However the story doesn't really go beyond this (just the brief musings of the detective at the end of a chapter). You barely, if at all, get to know any of the people before you kill them. When there's no personality or character development with the characters then there's nothing felt when you kill them. I could forgive this if the ways that you setup the deaths of people weren't the very definition of linear. This too could be forgiven except the steps you take to setup the deaths are also very unintuitive. They aren't even puzzles; it's just a process of figuring out what weird way the developers want you to setup the next person's death. There's almost no thought or intelligence involved on your part.\n\nAnother thing I was interested in, like most people I'm sure, are the deaths themselves. Considering this game was supposed to have earned an AO for Adults Only rating from the ESRB (refused to avoid complications with release) I was a little disappointed. A couple of them are gruesome sure, but they've got nothing on some of the fatalities in the Mortal Kombat games (which are rated M for Mature). There is a kill that Lucius himself gets to personally make, but I was highly disappointed when we don't actually get to see Lucius do it. One minute he's standing there, and we know what he's about to do, but the next he's done it and we saw nothing. Boo!\n\nYou are slowly given 5 different powers to make these deaths happen. They can also level up in power when you make a new kill. Only problem is the concept of leveling them up is absolutely pointless because there's only 1 way to setup the death of a person and you are always at the right power level to do it. You don't get to use certain powers when you think you could either, because again there's only 1 way to make the deaths happen.\n\nPros:\n+Voice acting was decent or better, especially Lucifer's.\n+The basic concept.\n\nNeutral:\n+-A couple of the deaths are cool. Most are forgettable.\n+-It's pretty easy to get lost; a minimap would've been nice. At least there is a map and a marker telling you where your kill target is located.\n\nCons:\n-The story lacks any depth beyond the obvious, and the characters themselves are given no time to develop or have much of a personality so that when they do die we the players don't care one way or the other.\n-Figuring out what to do next is part luck and part tedious searching of rooms and objects to find the right thing to interact with.\n-Completely linear death setups that don't allow creativity of your mind powers or anything else.\n-Mind powers have no depth despite being able to level up.\n-The graphics are pretty poor. Could be forgiven but the animations are also lacking which doesn't help the already lifeless characters.\n\nDespite all this I am interested in the sequel and the promise that it corrects some of the issues here like linear deaths.","February 5, 2015","false","6.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

Born on the 6th of June, 1966 (you can do the conversion), Lucius has the honor of being the anti-Christ and all the light-hearted responsibilities that come with it.  Visited by his dad on Birthday number six, Lucius is tasked with carrying out the whims of his father:  murdering all the inhabitants of Dante Manor.\n\nThe game is comprised of nine separate chapters.  Each begins with a voice-over and a notebook entry on who your next target is, and concludes with a grisly homicide and a follow-up visit from Satan to grant Lucius new powers and to bolster old ones, such as telekinesis, combustion, and mind-control.  While many of the kills are creative, entertaining, and sometimes morbidly funny, what the game often requires of you to reach that moment of satisfaction often results in frustration.\n\nAs an anti-hero six-year-old Satan spawn, you’re quite the amalgam of bad-♥♥♥ and unsuspected hitman – but without much motive or directive.  Each kill requires you to piece together sporadic clues to determine what items or tools are necessary to manipulate your target or lure them into places they might not otherwise go (such as face-first into a stove top element to light a cigarette).\n\nFor those who enjoy all aspects of the discovery process, clicking around in different environments and ultimately finding what you’re looking for can be rewarding – although the emotion I frequently experienced was exasperation.  With little feedback that you’re on the right course, the game can quickly stop being fun. Because of each mission’s strict requirements, the intended payoffs act more as a relief to pent-up frustration for finally getting it right.  There was nothing more disappointing than going into the kitchen and being unable to pick up the butcher knife.  The mission requirements are often unclear, as almost the entire mansion is free to roam from murder one.  Further, there is no initial tutorial on the sequential nature of your murderous imperatives, so you’ll need to start clicking early, often, and indiscriminately.\nWhere the frustration often comes in is when you’re desperately trying to find the next required item to trigger the next scripted sequence or dialogue, so you can in turn use that clue to get down to business.  The Manor is highly-detailed, huge and pretty much unrestricted in accessibility from the beginning.  This gives you room to explore, but sometimes finding the necessary tools necessitates a click-fest of drawers, cabinets, and items lying around, until you find what you need.  The game is plagued with some annoying glitches, clipping problems and hit detection, breaking the flow of the narrative (like characters getting stuck, objects flying around mysteriously and unpredictably after manipulating them, or the camera auto-moving to a 1st-person perspective when near a wall, which is quite jarring).\n\nGraphically, the game isn’t ugly, but a lot of the colors are washed out, the lighting is unrealistic and interferes with other sources (like the outside light interacting with ambient light), and the animations are jerky.  The cutscenes are entertaining but suffer from poor camera placement and direction.  Subtracting from the presentation are the unacceptably long load times.  This compounds frustration when occasionally you’ll fail a mission because someone may have seen you wielding a screwdriver that you had no business wielding, or overtly using your telekinesis, drawing attention from those around.  There are no waypoints, so if you fail, you’re back at the beginning, but first you’ll be staring at a load screen.\n\nThe in-game music features some fun, weird, bugle-filled atmospheric tracks, sometimes employing the cellos, violin crescendos, and orchestral choirs that are common of the horror genre.  Sadly, the music is often on short loops, and can get annoying or simply feel out of place during parts of the chapters.  Speaking about out of place, the game’s voice acting is B-rate at best, suffering at times from a poorly-translated script and inadequate direction.  This was especially disappointing due to the game being heavily story-driven and reliant on verbal or conversational cues that felt detached.\n\nDespite the game’s ambitious premise, its many shortfalls overshadow the things it actually does well.  The murders are always a treat.  Coupled with Lucius’ deadpan death-stare and the ludicrously lavish and ridiculous ways in which targets reach their bloody ends, there is often a sick, dark humor that pervades the game. This is also apparent among the surviving residents and workers as they’re picked off one by one, slowly slipping into depression or insanity, and little Lucius just stands there, taking in all the madness, while still conducting his everyday business of putting away his toys and brushing his teeth (these are sadly further nuisances – chores – that break up the narrative but add to the hilarity).\nThe entire game takes place at Dante Manor, an enormous, sprawling estate with dozens of rooms to explore, drawers to rifle through, and objects to steal for your nefarious ends.  While the ultimate demise of each target is often original and unpredictable, reaching that moment typically mimics a “Take object A to manipulate object B to get target C to do task D”.  As such, there is little freedom in getting to the end result.  This is not a sandbox game and does not follow the open-ended format of, for example, the Hitman and Manhunt series – but that difference isn’t necessarily a flaw, as it serves a purpose by bolstering the narrative.\n\nLucius can be engrossing, charming, and even darkly funny. Sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, inconsistent atmosphere, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives. If you enjoyed The Omen series (which this game generously borrows from), then you might find something to like in Lucius. Its unsatisfying ending, that despite leaving many questions unanswered, at least leaves the option open for a sequel that is perhaps more refined, tighter, and better-executed.\n6/10","July 21, 2014","true","6.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It started off & was decent, third person sandbox game in a limited environment, a focus on solving puzzles & murder, playing as son of the devil. Oh how I was wrong.\n\nAfter the first 2 or so murders though all novelty started to run thin, a character would say something in passing to satan-child, devil tells you to get souls, proceed to go through specific path to kill the person. On the way you can do various chores with your powers, pick up blocks with telekinesis, steal underwear from a maids room to wash it etc.\n\nGraphics were decent, better than I expected but not amazing. The story was interesting to start but became boring fast, not as fast as the story decayed though. I won't spoil but by the end it just decided to wrap things up too rushed & uninterestingly, while hinting at a sequel I hope won't come. About half way through it just became a chore to play, there's no way I'm even going to bother with the achievements I haven't got.\n\nAlthough I hate comparisons, some people like them so here we go. With the (very) limited sandbox & single choice murders, you could mistake it for a portable version of Assassins Creed. Happy? No, nor am I as that was a bad comparison but the game made me unhappy I bothered with it, so get used to the disappointment if you're going to buy it.\n\nCons:\n-Limited interactivity with game world\n-Poor controls\n-Poor story\n-Bland gameplay\n-Too scripted (might just be me, prefer choices & options in a game like this)\n-Over the top murders, we're talking the sort little Timmy dreams up only to find his mum being called in by the teacher to send him to psychiatric help, all the while imagining all the ways they could both meet a gruesome fate\n-Bad ending\n-No replay value at all, unless you want achievements\n-Nudity used  50% through to try & entice the player\n-Everything else in the game\n-The price, $20 is WAY too much for it, I'd even say the $5 I paid for a bundle with it was too much. If you see it at $2, grab it & be numbed for 5 hours\n\nPros\n-Graphics ok for indie game\n-Powers were cool, not enough to do with them\n-Good concept\n\nSo the tl;dr, interesting concept, really poor execution. If you're swayed by nudity, you can peek on a maid, if you want a decent game then go elsewhere. Maybe if you're 10-16 this will be good, otherwise it's too...forced feeling.","August 11, 2014","false","4.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Its puzzles are often meant to be solved by sending you on a linear path from clue to clue, but that path can be broken by the fact that it's a fairly open world. An NPC might send you to a specific room and the game might expect that you pick up a certain item from it and infer from context that it's to be used in this chapter. But if you picked that item up 5 chapters ago, you might be struggling to make that connection, and instead scour the room for ways to use any of its other set pieces. Some mechanics are clumsy, there's a bit of pixel hunting, and the logic stringing puzzles together can be weird and opaque. You should play the game with another person or a guide to help hammer through it.\n\nAll that said, Lucius is pretty fun. For all its kludginess and opacity, it still lets you murder everyone in the house in exchange for rad powers from Satan, and there's a simple joy in running throughout the mansion inverting all the crosses so you can live like a tr00 kvlt six-year-old of the bitter frozen necrofrost. If only you could wear corpse-paint like the band Immortal to let the normals know where you stand.","March 1, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You live in a large mansion, with maids and butlers that make your life easier.. in different ways than intended.\n\nNormally maids and people of service are there to clean or fix, or even get you things when you are too lazy to grab them yourself. Not for Lucius, these servants are souls waiting to be reaped for the hellfire home you call hell.\n\nBut of course you are just a child with weak powers, you can not just reveal yourself, that would mean certain death and prolong the rebirth. No, you will do this silently and as if accidents have befallen your estate. What better way to absorb the poor souls of innocent men and woman then by "accidently" killing them?\n\nThe gameplay isnt very linear sometimes, so that can be frustrating for some people, me included. I found myself looking at guides to find certain items or to find out where I need to go next. The mansion you are living in is also massive and complicated at first, really confusing you more than needed.\n\nThe deaths are fun, giving a sense of accomplishment when you kill someone.\n\nYou can break stuff, mind control people, erase their minds, use your mind to move objects and burn people alive.\n\nAbout 5 hours of gameplay if you play it to finish, not including achievements or general exploration.\n\nI'd say give it a shot, and if it gets too complicated or annoying just pull up a guide from the steam overlay or on your phone for ease of access.\n\nPersonal Rating: 3.5/5","December 22, 2015","true","5.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

If you like context dependent "find the magic pixel" games wearing the disguise of a puzzle/stealth game then this is perfect for you. WHO WAS THIS MADE FOR? Omen fans? Were people really clamoring for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and contrived plots? How about broken stealth segments that rely on repetition with little to no indication of where enemies are? I can not emphasise enough how terrible this game is.\nYou play Lucius, the antichrist born through the machinations of your grandfather who made a pact with the devil to gain power and money. Now you have to go through a mansion and kill people as offerings to Satan in an effort to increase your power. This is done by finding little items hidden throughout the one location in the game and using them to engineer traps or situations that you can influence through your satanic powers that end with someone dying. I guess it's a good game for... snuff enthusists? The payoff to solving the puzzles is a gruesome cutscene sometimes followed by a new power to use that are highly sensitive to context. There's no experimentation, no alternate paths, just a set puzzle with one often obscure conclusion. God help you if you don't know where to get an item that you need to solve a puzzle. It'll usually be tucked away, some colorless chunk on the washed-out palate that you need to click on. Speaking of items, there's an inventory where you store particular items that relate to the story but there's no differentiation between the items you can pick up and the junk that is strewn throughout the house that you can just pick up and HOLD. Sometimes you'll even need to just pick up the items you can't put in your inventory! The house, which is the only setting, is featureless and huge. You can run around up and down stairs, but if you turn a corner too fast or make some minute adjustment with the camera you're going to get lost. Every room and every hallway looks the same, but after about 4 hours of playing I stopped having to refer to the map every 10 seconds.\nThe characters are all terribly stiff archetypes capering around and delivering lines through terrible voice acting. Not many lines were recorded, so expect to hear repeated dialogue a LOT. Another part of the story is told through what seems to be the diary entries of a detective named "McGuffin" (hilarious) but I have NO IDEA why these segments were included. Who cares about what some detective is doing when that isn't the focus of the game at all? Why make that a thing? There's no mystery being solved for the player. You know EXACTLY what's happening because the 10 minute intro sequence spelled everything out for you. No tension is built through this parallel exposition and no new information is gained. It just turns into a boring sequence of people jabbering at each other, faking emotion while delivering tired and predictable lines that usually pan out like this:\n"I'm a detective who can't figure out why people keep killing themselves."\n"Something weird is going on and the my upcoming election can't handle the scandal if the public gets wind of all these people killing themselves in my home."\n"I know. It's so WEIRD though."\nNow repeat that between every one of the 18 chapters.\nThis game was boring, frustrating, contrived, cheap, brought nothing new to the experience, had shoddy controls, barely any mechanics, and was a genuine pain to play.

Doesn't worth to be picked up, unless on a very big sale.\n\nLucius has a very good story, decent graphics and amazing voice acting, though the bugs, glitches and the limited gameplay ruins the chances for an entertaining experience.\n\nBeing the son of Lucifer, he does have quite a few paranormal abilities, still, making his tricycle drive for a few seconds after he gets off it and eventualy crush half of it into the floor - is definetly not one of them. Same with Lucius walking through  closed doors and getting into places where he is not supposed to be. Noticed this once in the middle of the game, and once again at the very end, when you're supposed to kill your father in the burning house, somehow i walked through the front door (which was locked) and could't manage to get back inside after trying for a half hour, ultimately being forced to restart the game. Yet, this is all pice of cake. The most annoying glitch in this game are the hints. It's not enough that they are kind of unclear, but sometimes they appear after you already completed the task, leaving you in the most complicated missions without no clue what to do. As for example there is a mission where you must kill one of your maids and the only hint is "she is doing laundry". After i spent about 2 hours trying everything that came into my mind, i finally gave up and decided to watch a walkthrough where i found out that i'm supposed to use telekinesis to pick up an iron from a top shelf and drop it into the washing machine, then start it. By doing this you'll brake the washing machine and leave the maid without an occupation, then she'll decide to take a bath giving you the opportunity to kill her. How the hell was i supposed to know this ? And guess what ? After i broke the washing machine i got the hint that i should do so...\n\nWhat i hated the most was the limited gameplay. The history was already written for you. You can run around in a huge house, interact with the people you find, but you can't choose which one to kill, or at least how to kill him. Each crime is to be commited in order, and by the specific methods, even the special powers that you have can be used just on specific missions, specific people or objects...\n\nI would recommend to skip this one, unless you get the occasion to pick it up on a very big sale (at least 80%) just for the heck of it.","February 2, 2014","false","42.1"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","3"

LOL Yep, in this game you play as the son of the devil. It is heavily influnced by the 1976 classic "Omen," and that honestly is the only thing that initially attracted me to this game. It's a third person mystery/adventure game where you explore a huge mansion and find creative ways to kill off the help. You do not play a hero. If this game has any heros at all, it's the detective and your clueless parents.  The chapters of the game are divided into each person you kill, and with each murder, your satanic powers are increased. You get such skills as mind control, combustion, and memory erase. You can move things with your mind and set people on fire, but you can't be seen because you don't want to draw suspicion. The story is progressed through very good cutscenes told between chapters and the game has a lot of atmosphere. The story reaches it's climax during a very cool exorcism scene, but man I've never played a game where I wanted the character I play as to loose so bad. It's a very interesting twist that honestly, I wasn't totally comfortable with. But it was original, unique, and very interesting, with great controls and a neat open world mansion to explore. So if you don't mind taking the role of a devil child and knocking off helpless people for Satan, this might be your cup of tea.

Lucius (even his name is evil) is an extremely rare phenomena of a character; even though he is the main character and you play as him, he is the single most horrifying part of playing this game. Obviously there are no jump scares since you are the one in control of him, but what is terrifying is how easily this fictional child brings out this dark evil personality from the player.\nThe core of the game is a point and click murder mystery with the awesome twist that you’re the “bad guy” and your goal is to not get caught. The mansion that the story takes place in is a bit confusing when you first started, and the map is pretty unexceptional, but after the first couple chapters you’ll quickly get a hang of how it’s all laid out. Some of the optional quest objectives can be a bit tedious but the main missions are relatively easy to work your way through without feeling hopelessly stuck. The atmosphere is perfect, starting out peaceful and opulent then progressively sliding into emotional turmoil and fear.\nLucius is absolutely incredible and I would recommend it to anyone.","December 1, 2014","true","43.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact he is driven from the human number of the Beast, "666", and it is your goal to carry on some devilish fun. The game has very detailed graphical visuals that surround the setting of a Mansion where the boy does his evil deeds. If you are into some puzzle solving killing fun, this may be the game to enjoy those fantasies and desires.\n\nWhat are the positive things about this game?\n\nWhile playing this game, you will immerse yourself into a house full of family, staff and house guests who will live throughout their last days while you prey upon them. There are plenty of rooms to expllore and things to move or take for your goal needs. Once you play for an hour or so, you will feel like part of the family. There will be different missions/goals to achieve during the day or night, while others are awake or asleep. Rain, snow or sunshine will not keep you from killing. Just, do not get caught.\n\nWhat is the negative things about this game?\n\nThis game is linear oriented to the variety of ways to kill your target. There is only one solution for each goal, which can be very fustrating. (For example: You can easily squash a bug, spray it with poison, or catch and release it. In this game, you can only spray the bug with poison.) This game would be better if their were alternative ways of reaching your goals. Also while playing this game I have encounter some game glitches, bugs and crashes. The game have crashed while loading the next part of the game. I also encounter a glitch while traveling down or upstairs, the NPC characters would either push your character off the stairs or get you stuck between them.\n\nWould you recommend this game?\n\nYes, solely becuase of the orginality of this game's design. Although this is a very linear game, I find it ammusing to try to leave clues about you being the killer throughout the game. (Such as leaving toys or other objects to appear in the cutscenes when not needed. I had many laughs with it)  **There is no playback value to this game, except to have fun and cause mischieve.\n\nBE A VERY BAD BOY !!!!!","June 4, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I didn't decide to stop playing, the game is just so buggy. Half the time I can't play because it glitches so much. On top of that, the whole game is very linear. You just find items and use them on the objective. (ex: find screwdriver, click stove, wait. Find lock, click on freezer, wait.). Theres no path choices to branch onto. It's not a sandbox type of game like you might believe. You have one way you can do something, and no choices about it. Even the powers cannot be used freely, your pretty much told exactly when to use them. The most side missions you can do is to do your chores for money.That usually involves picking up blocks and putting them in a chest.\nAnother problem is the voice acting. It's pretty bad... and Lucius himself lacks character. I know hes possessed, but he doesn't speak, he doesn't show any emotion or character at all. He just walks around doing what the objective says.\nOverall, its not a horrible game, but its not worth $10 either. Especially with how buggy it can be.

The whole "kill everyone, hail satan" aspect is pretty fun and the murder puzzles are logical but complicated. For each puzzle there is only one solution, you have no room for creativity. Also many of the puzzles require certain objects that aren't very obvious. If you can't remember where something is or you don't know what you need to find, you're screwed until you read or watch a walkthrough. So i wouldn't recommend this game to someone who rages or gets frustrated easily because it will probably be annoying for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy murdering the people who fed and raised you for 6 years of your life (virtualy of course) then you should definitely buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigbadwolfok/recommended/218640/","bigbadwolfok","Silver Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigbadwolfok/","514 products in account","Become the son of the devil and be his deadly weapon in this interesting graphic adventure that reminds us of classic horror movies such as The Prophecy or Rosemary's Baby. Innocent, formal, introvert... but also cruel, machiavellian and very powerful. Lucius has proposed himself to satisfy his father's needs by offering him a true blood bath.\n\n\nLONG VERSION\nLucifer has a lot of ways to make presence, and one of them, the deadliest one, is to incarnate all of his evilness in the body of an innocent child. Who would suspect that this innocent 6-year-old is guilty of a series of violent murderers? Nobody. We'll know about that since we're going to control this evil child ourselves, this evil child called Lucius.\n\nThis graphic adventure proposes something as interesting as being the son of Satan and having as an only objective to eliminate the people that's in your house. Stealth, exploration and some minor puzzle are the basics of this interesting yet kind of irregular adventure.\n\nNot everyday you get to be Satan's child and neither you get to become in a lethal killing machine under the perspective of a graphic adventure, that's why Lucius turns out to be a really attractive game. However, Lucius is a excessively linear adventure that doesn't allow you to go out of the current task made by the developers.\n\nAt the beggining of every chapter, in which we'll have to get rid of some tenant in particular, the game gives you freedom to explore your parent's mansion (not your actual parents of course) and find out the best way to kill the innocent -sometimes not that innocent- person that the devil wants. What happens? It doesn't matter how much we run around the mansion, there's only one way to kill every person so at the end you'll just end up doing what the devs want you to do at their own way.\n\nI don't criticize this decision for being limited, because being honest you have to follow a really strict script to murder the way Lucius does. However, I think that this is wrongly executed because we're talking about a graphic adventure way too simple, we can't talk to anyone and there aren't challenging puzzles, the only thing you're going to need is to figure which materials you need to kill a person... without knowing how you're gonna kill him/her.\n\nSometimes Lucius will play his cards in the best way possible, barely guiding you to the victim through NPC's conversations or with subtle clues added to his notebook where he also writes his thoughts. But in other times we'll also walk from room to room trying to realize what we have to do to kill our objective. And as you can imagine, that almost spoils the game experience.\n\nThere are great ideas behind this, the need to always act normally so nobody will get suspicious of you, or the ability to use demonic powers -mind control, telekinesis, etc.- and these will not work if you have crucifixes or priests nearby, without a doubt this game has potential. But like how I told you the action is really limited and not even this powers help to break that monotony.\n\nAbout the story, this part is also not as good as it could have been, it shows some details that I really liked, for example, the execution of most deaths it's incredibly brutal and gory and other details not as good such as the simplicity of it's narrative or how hollow the characters are.\n\nLucius recreates with great precision the home of a powerful american senator in the 70's including themes such as corruption, sexual scandals, satanic cults, etc. I also liked how the murder of the tenants make everyone else feels, getting more scared and paranoid every month, almost at the point of madness. The design of the house is really well made and after some hours you'll feel like in your own house, even if you don't you'll have a useful map with the location of every room.\n\nUnfortunately, the graphics in this game are also not that good. The design and the 70's style of the house are the most important thing to stand out. But if we talk about character models, the result is quite discreet. You can say the same about the robotic animations or the almost null expression on their faces.\n\nNow talking about sound the game makes an amazing work, The OST is really good and it reminds us of classic horror movies as the ones mentioned in the beginning, also helped by some choir melodies.\n\nSHORT VERSION\nA great idea not so well executed. That's how you can see Lucius, a graphic adventure that's not at the level of some others. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the game concept but far away from being devilishly fun to kill innocent people it turns out to be a really not inspired and very limited task, It's not a bad game and of course not a bad graphic adventure but it could've been a lot more.\n\n\nPROS\n\n-The great atmosphere\n-The possibility to play as the bad guy for instance\n-It's like playing a classic horror movie\n\nCONS\n\n-Way too limited\n-The characters don't show any expression on their faces\n\nGAMEPLAY: 7\nGRAPHICS: 6\nSOUND: 8\nINNOVATION: 7\n\nFINAL SCORE: 7","February 28, 2015","true","52.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

First off, this game plays very similarly to Hitman: Blood Money - you're basically tasked with killing people and given absolutely no help as to how to go about doing it.  The big difference is that with Hitman you had total freedom to explore your environment and try to figure out one of the many ways you could take out your target.  In this game, the developers give you exactly one method of execution that you can't deviate from, and are expected to figure that out with only the vaguest of hints in your notebook - and by vague I mean not in any way helpful 75% of the time (in fact, many times the hint didn't even show up until I had already finished the task).\n\nTo make things even worse, you're expected not only to figure out the convoluted methods of killing the person, but also finding the various tools and items you'll need to complete the task in the sprawling mansion where the game takes place.  These items could be anything and anywhere, they could be something you need to collect or a device you need to interact with, and no help is given to locate them - you basically have to wander around aimlessly until you your tiny cursor happens to land exactly on the item in order for it to highlight.  You also have to be within a few feet of it for even that to work, which ultimately turns every chapter into a gigantic pixel-hunting nightmare.\n\nYou're given the choice of two final battles - one with a fire symbol and one with a puzzle symbol.  I chose the fire one and ended up in a ridiculous boss fight, of all things, which was followed by a complete non-ending.  The developers clearly wanted you to choose the puzzle ending, but by that point I was so over the whole game that I couldn't be bothered with even trying to play it - I just watched it on YouTube and saw that it was much more developed with several clear nods to The Omen.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, as I loved The Omen, and essentially getting to play as Damien was a great idea.  The few killings that were straightforward enough to be completed without too much frustration or walkthrough help were a lot of fun.  Unfortunately too much of the gameplay was just an exasperating mess, and so I can't recommend it.  If you really want to play through The Omen and don't mind frequent walkthrough checks, then you could pick this up in a cheap bundle.  Otherwise you'll definately want to skip it.","September 7, 2014","false","8.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Both the visuals and voice acting are surprisingly good for this kind of game. The story and characters are alright and it is beyond charming riding around a tricycle in your fathers mansion plotting a sinister murder. The execution isn't perfect though. The point and click adventure style part of the game works for the most time alright however there are some far fetched puzzles and some annoying item searching in there. There are also some stealth missions in the game which would work surprisingly fine if the game didnt restart the entire map every time you got caught. This dumb save-system drags down every single part of the game but it is especially noticeable in the stealth missions. There are also some action-based missions in the game which are quite awful. I would still recommend the game to anyone interested despite its flaws simply because its concept is so unique and entertaining. So if you find this game available for a cheap price, go for it!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Visionhunter/recommended/218640/","Visionhunter","Visionhunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Visionhunter/","201 products in account","An interesting game by a studio that dared to try something different. The final result is a rather linear, buggy experience that mostly has you running around a huge mansion hunting for clues or interactable objects that have to do with your current target. You'll mostly end up finding items you will need in later chapters, but you get to keep the items for later anyway. This makes the later killings much easier than the earlier ones, since you almost always already have a clue as to how you can use items A or B that your found 2 hours earlier for this.\nNot all solutions are particularly straightforward. Sometimes the clue you need is dropped in a single line at the start of a cutscene and is then never repeated again. ("Fetch us some [X] and turn on the [Z]!") Other times characters will not shut up and will give you one hint after the other. ("There's a CRUCIFIX in our BATHROOM!" *wink wink*)\n\nThe game is strongest about halfway through, when you've gotten used to the controls and the layout of the manor, and you're starting to experiment with your new powers. The later kills and especially the finale involve some sort of time pressure element, which was very unwelcome.\nThe finale itself is a buggy mess. The game crashed twice and bugged out three other times during the final 5 minutes of gameplay, all at seperate unrelated moments.\nIt's nice that you got to choose from two different finales, though (action or puzzle), but in the end neither was much of an enjoyment.\n\nGet this game on sale only if you think you'd enjoy playing the antichrist riding around a giant manor on your tricycle, mostly hunting for clues and objects. Otherwise, don't bother.","November 5, 2015","false","6.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","4","6","3","0"

I like the atmosphere of it, but it's not really anything new I guess.\n\nThe gameplay is the worst, it's lazy and annoying, the puzzles often don't make sense and are super linear, sometimes you need to find that one special thing that wouldn't be really that special in real life, like you couldn't use anything besides a special 'water bottle' to carry the water without being suspicious (like empty bottle of wine, for example, which you can carry around anyway without anyone thinking you're doing something weird); you find a lot of things that are used in the future, so they're actually pretty redundant and confusing earlier in the game. Sometimes the future items are turned off and you can't use them before they're needed, even though they're still there contributing to the overall noise (it's an annoying inconsistency, especially after you learn that the thing is non-interactive). In other words, a typical point&click hunting for items and even a little worse.\n\nThe powers feature wasn't used to its full potential. Power levels are redundant and don't really matter in the game. You always get the level up after you progress, but you don't really feel that you're more powerful than before. You just can do stuff like telekinesis longer, that's all (and the plot-based uses of the power are just cut-scenes anyway).\n\nThe last fight in puzzle mode was more like chaos than puzzle, I ended up being "bugged" to death several times (I even tunneled through the wall so I ended up running in the outdoor) and got "detected" (even though everyone in the room already knew I'm the devil child) because devs hadn't apparently planned the feature I used (telekinesis on the chandelier before killing the second priest). One time I froze the priest somehow and couldn't finish the part because nothing else happened or could happen. Also, some of the things I needed to do weren't logically connected or would be just redundant in the real world. Like getting hit by a chandelier is not enough to die, the victim needs to contemplate life by looking at stupid head sculpture to stand still, even thought he does stand still anyway because he's under my influence. FFS.\n\nDon't buy it, just watch "let's play" on YouTube for the atmosphere.","November 1, 2015","false","9.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","4","6","3","0"

In actuality it's simply an un-optimized puzzle game which rewards your frustrated attempts to lift an object across the room for more than 3 seconds with another unsatisfying useless power in the next chapter. The game itself had so much potential but the improper coding and limits of what you can and can't do with your powers was highly annoying. Think you're going to make awesome use of your mind-control powers to have a little fun with your victim before the big kill? Think again, you can only do anything useful with your mind-control if it relates directly to the step in the puzzle you're trying to complete right now. Think that piano is going to stay in it's proper room and on the floor? Expect to see it flying through the hall ways like a drunken pilot! Even chores will sometimes not complete once you've done all the steps required, forcing you to restart from the last save point.\n\nI can't believe this game even made it to a sequel with how many problems the current game has but I'm glad it did. Maybe on the next one they'll have all the bugs worked out and actually make this a fun game somehow. Until then I wouldn't spend $10 on this game, let alone $20.

I should not be feeling like my own brain is beginning to melt inside my skull to the point that I actually thought on the level of insanity of the developers.\n\nA walkthrough is pretty much required for this game and I'm told that if you just want the story you can watch a movie called The Omen and save yourself the time.

The reason I start by saying this is that all I've been seeing, here on steam, is people complaining about the controls. So, how does the game feel is a good question. The answer, to a non-traditional keyboard and mouse player, is pretty well, there are a few moments later in game where I needed to use my right hand to hit number keys as I used my left hand to control movement, but other than that no probs.\n\nAnother thing is I see people saying that the game is a buggy piece of bleep, and though that is subjective most people take that as a warning sign. I'm not going to say this game is the most polished thing ever but it sure isn't what people are making it out to be, and I did encounter a few bugs such as my journal not updating halting progress, and I got stuck on some clutter behind the bar. Sure that sounds bad but a simple restart of a checkpoint and you should be good.\n\nThen on to how it looks, and I'm fully aware this is personal opinion but I think this game is stunning, the animations in cinamatics aren't the best but they're on par with some AAA games I've played.\n\nSo to story then, I suppose if you couldn't gather this from everything to do with the game you play Lucius a spawn of Lucifer (the Devil) and you're killing everyone, in a Hitman-esq playstyle mixed with evil powers. It's like a mix of the Shining and the Omen, and thats a really good thing. And the game offers alternate endings which all wrap the story up well. Heads up if you are Catholic or Christian and are easily offended you may want to pass on this one.\n\nAs my first real pc game I thought this was a very good start, and for the price of 20 bucks I feel (pardon this horrible phrase) that I really got my moneys worth. So check this out guys, ya just might like it!","June 10, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Playing a precocious child by the name of Damien Dante, you have to kill people. Why? For the glory of Satan of course. This game is pretty much just The Omen: The Videogame. You have to figure out how to kill people without getting caught. The only problem is there is just one person per level that you kill, and there is only one way to kill that person. So it does not play like a sandbox murder simulator, it plays like an adventure game. That means it is boring. Even rudimentary skills at rpgs or adventure games will make this one far too easy. But still, it was fun. With the exception of the 20 hr and 40 hr acheivements, that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when I can, without cheating, complete the game in 6 hrs.

It's not particularly a horror game, but it can be a little bit creepy at times and a lot of the deaths are pretty brutal. The game is mainly puzzle based and I think that the puzzles are quite easy, the only difficult part about it is probably locating the items. Everything graphically is good and it presents the game well in an appropriate style. I liked the achievements in this game, it really felt like I was progressing and it was quite motivating, I also liked the fun extra achievements too. However there were some problems with the game; there was a lot of laughable glitches concerning the character models, slow loading, a few crashes here and there, some freezing for a few seconds and bad lip syncing. I don't know if these (excluding glitches) were only exclusive to me though. Overall it's a nice, short game with a consistent theme, nice puzzles, nice graphics, a great soundtrack, well executed atmosphere. I recommend Lucius, especially if you like puzzles, looking for stuff, satanic stuff, murder and achievements. :)","January 9, 2013","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story itself could take you anywhere between six to twelve hours of gameplay to beat depending on how well you fair in puzzle games. It does focus a lot more on puzzles and stealth, but has it's action moments. This game is definitely worth a pick up and play when you are bored.

I managed to get 55 of the 58 achievements in under 10 hours, while also finishing the game with both endings. The remaining achievements were the running one, which I did while getting the laundry chore done (got lost enough! hehe) which I managed the following day within a half hour, and the other two were the time-based achievements (play for 20 hours and play for 40) which I'm still on my way to getting.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable game, though don't expect open-world, it's very scripted. This doesn't take much away from the experience though, and there is a great amount of enjoyment to be had from engineering the needless deaths of those around you.\n\nTop story (though the acting/script could be better) and worth paying attention to, it does however give you the option to skip the cinematics (which I only used once I'd seen them already and was doing replay for achieves or random fun).","April 5, 2014","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also the story following the seasons and years also. The only thing I hate is some of the difficulties in the game are a little hard to get past, and the build up to the end of the story and having a crappy climax.

I HATE doing the same thing over again, even just backtracking, but I had no problems here.\n\nAnother common complaint is the linearity, but the way you have to kill them is often the logical choice. You're supposed to cover up your kills, so the game just letting you shoot everyone would bore as well as defeat the point.\n\nIt falls down at the final part/ending, it's a bit awkward, but overall it's a fun, quick game. While some things aren't amazing (voice acting, cutscene animation, music use), it should be noted that this unique game came from an independent developer from Finland, so I give them leeway, it's all still fine. Best of all, they actually care about their players. I'm reviewing their final, polished version. When there were noises that the finale was disappointing, they made a thread on Steam and asked for feedback and if people'd like an alternate finale, then added one (it's a bit better, but at least they tried).\n\nSo go, be that creepy mute kid who follows people around on his tricycle down hallways.

In the vast Dante Manor there are many individuals to choose from while keeping the good-boy attitude not to raise suspects.\nWhile murdering members of your family and their servants, you will be asked to perform chores like brushing your teeth, tidy up your room, finding objects etc. These chores will slowly award you special objects.\n\nAs you kill people, you will strengthen your evil skills and gain new ones.\n\nI will not spoil much of the game itsel as it's a continuous surprise.\n\nMy advice is to purchase this genre-defining game!","September 6, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought this game in promise of a sandbox type serial killer game but this is not the case. Instead the game tasks you to kill specific Help around the house and it is your job to move things around and set up the perfect kill. As far as the sandbox experience goes, you can move seemingly random objects around the house and place them anywhere.\n\nThe game places you in the shoes of a seemingly innocent six-year old boy as he is celebrating his sixth birthday. Just so happens that this boy is not your average kid, he happens to be a literal spawn of Satan. Or Lucifer obviously implied by the developers naming the kid "Lucius". Lucifer wants souls and it is your job to give it to him. One day every month you are tasked to kill employees and family members who reside within the house. Every kill challenges you with intricate puzzles, easy or not depending on your skill level (I finished the game in seven hours). The story is not ground breaking, just your typical murder mystery manor. But it is pretty amusing to watch the mental health of your family members deteriate as they try to figure out who is commiting the murders. Towards the end, you are given the choice of what type of ending you want. Action or puzzle, given for players who like puzzles or action, or both.\n\nOverall this game is really good and i would definitely recommend this game for my friends.","August 26, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game, you play the title character, a young boy called Lucius who happens to be the son of the devil. This is quite a departure from most other horror titles, and the effect it creates means that 'Lucius' isn't really a horror game at all, as you're implicit in the planning of all the atrocities committed throughout the story. The fact that it probably won't scare you doesn't mean that you will find it unenjoyable, though.\n'Lucius' takes the form of a puzzle game, and a few action sequences are spread throughout the title; bear in mind, though, that the action isn't sufficiently frequent to appeal to someone who dislike puzzles and strategy. If you choose not to rely on walkthroughs (which, I admit, I did on a handful of occasions), you'll be spending a considerable amount of time riffling through drawers, shelves, rooms and cellars, looking for the various objects necessary for the completion of your mission. Your mission, invariably, is to eliminate the multitude of inhabitants and employees of Dante Manor. As you have the physical capabilities of a normal eight-year-old boy, you won't be relying on machetes, sledgehammers or firearms for your kills; instead, you have to use your environment. This complements the puzzle-based nature of the game, as, on occasion, the main challenge of your mission seems to be knowing just which weapon you should use.\nIf you've seen 'The Omen', you've undoubtedly already drawn a handful of parallels between this game and the film. Whilst the acting talents of performers like Gregory Peck and Mia Farrow are sadly unreplicated in this uncannily similar game, you'll surely find enough interaction - whether object- or person-based - to immerse yourself in the world of Lucius and Dante Manor.","August 29, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That is, until you get the supernatural powers and start forcing things. Just don't expect all the different ways, only one solution to each puzzle.\n\nThis puzzle game's design is simple, but it does it perfectly and doesn't ask you to follow insane logic that only the designer understood. The story is fairly interesting, I give it about an average rating.

I HATE doing the same thing over again, even just backtracking, but I had no problems here.\n\nAnother common complaint is the linearity, but the way you have to kill them is often the logical choice. You're supposed to cover up your kills, so the game just letting you shoot everyone would bore as well as defeat the point.\n\nIt falls down at the final part/ending, it's a bit awkward, but overall it's a fun, quick game. While some things aren't amazing (voice acting, cutscene animation, music use), it should be noted that this unique game came from an independent developer from Finland, so I give them leeway, it's all still fine. Best of all, they actually care about their players. I'm reviewing their final, polished version. When there were noises that the finale was disappointing, they made a thread on Steam and asked for feedback and if people'd like an alternate finale, then added one (it's a bit better, but at least they tried).\n\nSo go, be that creepy mute kid who follows people around on his tricycle down hallways. Otherwise you're missing out.","December 13, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is awful, with clunky movement and action scenes slowing down significantly making it very difficult to play. There's not any adaptablity to how you carry out the murders, which makes the game rather dull and most of the time I checked a walkthrough guide because it wasn't always obvious how the murder was carried out (or who you were supposed to kill). The cutscenes are badly voice acted (but I suppose when you are evil and have a name like Fabius, over-acting might be acceptable).\nMy game also crashes repeatedly - most notibly when you drop something.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/218640/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","A pretty off-the-wall game that wasn't exactly done well. At first I had some problems with the game, and I even posted about a bug which got fixed in a quick response. But despite the developer's response showing that they cared about the bugs, it does not mean that the game as a whole was made into something that great.\n\nDespite how evil the premise is, I was looking forward to the game. Sadly, it wasn't executed as well as I expected it to be. It seemed cheaply thrown together into an over-the-top B-movie format. I genuinely think if the game had even more work done on it, it could've been a higher-level game than it is now. And according to many reviews, the sequel to this was made even worse, disappointingly.\n\nI would've liked if the story was actually more serious and if the characters weren't as silly. The gameplay as a whole isn't necessarily horrible, but many things are really easy or quick to do, and nothing got exciting at any point in the game. You can even get half of the items needed in the game just by running around and picking things up right away. I got through multiple "missions" really quickly because I had picked up all of the items needed for them earlier on.\n\nThe fact that the "missions" simply mean "Go pick up item X / Go to room Y / Use random skill" goes to show how cheaply the game is done. Yes, as I said, I understand the premise, but playing the game didn't really do the idea justice. Besides that, the graphics were nothing special, nor was the voice acting (and lip sync didn't exist really). All in all, a rather lackluster game that I wish was made better.","February 14","false","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I went in expecting little, but I honestly enjoyed the experience.\n\nThe game kinda reminds me of Hitman in a way, especially Blood Money, since that game allowed you to kill some targets to look like accidents and that is what you do in this game. That is, until you get the supernatural powers and start forcing things. Just don't expect all the different ways, only one solution to each puzzle.\n\nThis puzzle game's design is simple, but it does it perfectly and doesn't ask you to follow insane logic that only the designer understood. The story is fairly interesting, I give it about an average rating. If you like Telltale games or anything else that falls into that catagory, than you'll enjoy this game.","December 15, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game, at it's core, is basically a puzzle game with a superficial veneer of third-person "open-world" adventure gameplay. Unfortunately, the puzzles are so linear yet obtuse as to be neither fun nor rewarding. There is only one acceptable solution for every puzzle, and there are hardly any hints to be found. When I actually solve one of the puzzles on my own, it's usually by falling ♥♥♥ backwards into the solution. Often times, it's so frustrating to try figure out what the game wants me to do, I have to resort to walkthroughs for help. It is a very rare occurence when I get a "lightbulb" moment where I can actually clearly see A leading to B leading to C leading to the kill. It's enjoyable when those moments do happen, but they're few and far between. The reason why I'm recommending this game at all is due to its great story, unique premise, and high production values. At times it's an interesting experience, but it's not very fun to endlessly look around for tiny inventory items amidst a sea of things that can't be picked up.","March 29","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are no jump scares or neither will this game make you ♥♥♥♥ your pants.\nBut it is indeed horrofic, full gore, blood, and brain tissue. This is the story of a seven year old boy who bruttally murders anyone in his path, using most of the time stealth and satanic powers by making his victims look like a suicide/accident death. Example (Lucius will be): Locking someone in a freezer, forcing someone to put their head in a lawnmower, dropping icicles on people, or taking control of someone and making them jump off a roof. There are about 17 deaths and each are horrific. The map is beautiful and heavily detailed and the sidequest are fun and usefull. The story is captivating. I reccomend this only to people who can think outside the box and can solve puzzles without rage quitting. You can cheat if you get stuck using community guides, because the game is worth the story, but do not abuse it too much otherwise you are not immersed into the world of Lucius Wagner.\n\n\nThe game is a little pricy if you do not find beautiful graphics with great detail a bonus. So this game is a must have in your wishlist to wait fo it to go on sale. I picked up the game for 5$ very much worth it....a little too worth it.","February 22, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Levels are fairly structured, though sometimes it can be easy to miss a certain detail and figure out what your next step is. You get several powers to use in the game, but realistically speaking, you will only use them each a few times.\n\nI think there's room for a lot of potential here, some expansion that builds onto the story and lets you use your talents a little more creatively.

(Mom walking in place at a door when the door is locked)\n-It is very linear in most aspects, ie: you can't do certain things unless you check your journal first, even if the update in the journal is a conversation you are in the middle of having.\n-And a minute problem, I think the "Devil" could have looked better.\nAlthough it's many issues, I do still like the game.

There isn't much plot to the game (it's your generic Satanic horror movie story about a little kid being the anti-christ), but it's still sufficiently creepy to keep you intrigued to the very end.\n\nUnfortunately, it is a rather short experience (I logged about five hours for my initial playthrough). Levels are fairly structured, though sometimes it can be easy to miss a certain detail and figure out what your next step is. You get several powers to use in the game, but realistically speaking, you will only use them each a few times.\n\nI think there's room for a lot of potential here, some expansion that builds onto the story and lets you use your talents a little more creatively. But for what this game is right now, it's worth a playthrough.","March 30, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are no jump scares or neither will this game make you ♥♥♥♥ your pants.\nBut it is indeed horrofic, full gore, blood, and brain tissue. This is the story of a seven year old boy who bruttally murders anyone in his path, using most of the time stealth and satanic powers by making his victims look like a suicide/accident death. Example (Lucius will be): Locking someone in a freezer, forcing someone to put their head in a lawnmower, dropping icicles on people, or taking control of someone and making them jump off a roof. There are about 17 deaths and each are horrific. The map is beautiful and heavily detailed and the sidequest are fun and usefull. The story is captivating. I reccomend this only to people who can think outside the box and can solve puzzles without rage quitting. You can cheat if you get stuck using community guides, because the game is worth the story, but do not abuse it too much otherwise you are not immersed into the world of Lucius Wagner.\n\n\nThe game is a little pricy if you do not find beautiful graphics with great detail a bonus. So this game is a must have in your wishlist to wait fo it to go on sale. I picked up the game for 5$ very much worth it....a little too worth it.","February 22, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First off, the gameplay is just boring, outside a few stealth and combat sections this game has nothing exciting to offer as far as gameplay goes. The puzzles are sometimes nice, but mostly uninspired. The story is what kept me finishing the game, in the end I felt that it had more potential, but was still fine.\nWhat really annoyed me though is the lack of life from most of the characters, if you can even call them characters. They have no personality, not even a glimpse of it, which would be fine if we didn't spend like I don't know, 75% of the game killing people like that. I mean as a hellspawn wouldn't it be much more satisfying to kill people who are good and have things to lose? It's more devilish, you know. Sure, everybody has something to lose, but why should we care about these people? Some of them are considered annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s by Lucius himself (let alone me).

The tools can be collected at any time during the game even if you don't need them for that murder.\nAs a reward for you're sacrifices you get paranormal powers that will help you kill more people. Powers like Telekinesis which isn't quite precise, mind control which is only used after everything else was prepared for the murder, mind wipe in case you get caught and a fireball for the boss battles which ware not enjoyable.\n\nFor the things this game gets right one thing one thing will annoy you a lot, that is the speed of the game. The tutorial is extremely fast, but after that it takes ages to figure out what to do, sometimes it's obvious, sometimes you get so stressed you look at a walkthrough just to get past that part (and whenever I need help outside what the game provides, it ruins the experience). Also the fact that the game does not have any checkpoints or save system outside the start of each chapter, if you make a mistake you go back to the start of that chapter.\nAnother thing that I think the game could do without are the stealth levels and to some degree the boss battles.\n\nA rather unique game, it mostly reminds me of the first Black Mirror game, a horror adventure game that was also slow, that had difficult puzzles and that also had a plot about the devil needing sacrifices for power. If you like adventure games and are looking for a horror story where you get to do the killing, this is the game for you, just be patient on the ride.","December 2, 2013","true","8.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You play as, essentially, the son of the devil and stealthily murder people one by one. It's a twisted concept that is pulled off very well and is surprisingly fun.\n\nStorytelling isn't this game's strong point as it isn't written or acted very well and seems to take a second seat to the gameplay. In a normal adventure game this would be a problem but here, gameplay is the focus. Otherwise it does have a similar structure to other adventure games: picking up various objects from the world, combining them, and discovering ways to use them to accomplish your current goal. Lucius is a third-person 3D game though which is unusual for the genre.\n\nThe main drawback of this game is that it can be very difficult to figure out what to do to progress, especially in the later chapters. The mansion is quite large and the game generally only gives you vague clues about where to go and rarely what you actually need to do there. You end up with a lot of useless items in your inventory which confuse things even further.\n\nFor the technical aspect, the graphics aren't very good and it requires a surprising amount of power to render them. Loading times are surprisingly long for the graphical quality but not long enough to make the game annoying to play. The engine also has a constant persistent stutter like the Gamebryo engine that seems to be impossible to get rid of.\n\nIf I had to sum up Lucius in two words, I'd say "delightfully twisted." It's great fun despite the technical issues and poor writing.","May 14","true","7.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Daddy likes souls so he asks Lucius to go kill people for him. He rewards Lucius with special powers that make him an even better killer.\n\nLucius shouldn't get caught, of course, so he makes murders look like an accident or frames someone for them. This means that each murder is a mini puzzle for which Lucius uses items he collects throughout the mansion and his special powers to 'solve the puzzle' and kill the target without getting caught.\n\nMeanwhile, the story in the game is about the adults in the house: a bit of background for each target, how they react to the murders, the police detective investigating the deaths, etc.\n\nFor me, the puzzles were neither too hard nor too easy, so I found the difficulty perfect. At the start of each chapter, you are pointed to your target either via your note book or via the in-game map. Sometimes you may feel a bit stuck because you don't know what is expected, but when you look at the clues (you can get a cryptic clue from Daddy in your room, but you should especially look at the items you collected and at your notebook) the solution always comes to you because it makes sense.\n\nLucius' special powers like telekinesis and mind control are explained very well by Mr. Lucifer and they make the puzzle solving a lot more fun than your average 'point and click' adventure slash puzzle game.\n\nThe options in the game menu are:\n- adjust resolution, adjust graphics details (low, medium, high or ultra high), toggle full screen, toggle Vsync and adjust gamma\n- adjust sounds and music volume\n- toggle 'invert mouse' and adjust mouse speed\n- re-bind keyboard keys or controller buttons\n\nYou should expect to get about 5 hours gameplay. About 7 hours if you don't rush and hunt most of the Steam Achievements. On that note, I should add that two achievements are absurd i.e. 'play the game for 20 hours' and 'play the game for 40 hours'. This means running the game as your active window, so running it in the background doesn't count. This is such an obvious and cheap way for the devs to try to get higher numbers of playtime for their game in Steam. Moreover, these two achievements appear to be bugged for me because the counter for both is still at zero.\n\nAll in all, I had fun playing this game and would recommend it but only when it's on sale at -50% or better.","May 8","true","13.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Read at your own risk.\n\nLucius is a murder centric puzzle game where you play as the titular Lucius Wagner, a child of Lucifer. The premise of the game is rather interesting. Lucifer visits Lucius in a dream and bestows him the unholy mission of garnering the souls of people around Dante Manor. This is done through rather unintuitive and lacking puzzles.\n\nThe story takes place in the painfully large Dante Manor. From nearly the very beginning of the game, most of all of the manor is open to you. With the mechanics that exist in the game, this is NOT a good thing. It does not reward exploration (save for the aptly named "Explorer" achievement). Furthermore, the puzzle solutions are extremely unintuitive and, quite frankly, boring. At several points, there shows potential for many possible ways to kill the chapter's target, but as the game requires deaths to be the ones laid out for you, it does not help at all (for example, one kill requires you to set someone on fire, but simply setting them on fire does not work. You have to douse him in gasoline and then setting him on fire will allow the kill.). More than that, the way some of these events transpire, it will severely test your suspension of disbelief (if you were to light a ciagrette at a stove, would YOU stick your face into the stove fire?) and the game simply can't be taken seriously.\n\nEven worse still, this game at one (potentially two) point(s) tries to hopscotch between puzzle and action game. The controls and camera for this game are already pretty clunky as is and making it into a third person action game with a terrible camera does not help the game's case in the slightest. Lucius also suffers from having quite a few bugs (several things can go wrong during some chapters and will force you to restart the chapter) and collision issues (getting caught on nothing comes to mind).\n\nOther bugs that come to mind are broken achievements. Some achievements do not work at times and can cause potential frustration.\n\nAll in all, this game is NOT worth your time or money. I got it on sale for 75% off ($4.99 instead of $19.99) and I still feel like I got ripped off.","July 30, 2014","false","5.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Nothing like the multitudes of choice you get in a good Hitman game, lets say which is exactly what this game should have been like(Hitman as a Devil child with Super-natural powers). Instead you get to click on objects and wade through the terrible designied interface system un till you connect the dots metaphorically with some object(s) which are pre-determined to then finally allow you to kill some sterotypical house dweller in some very sterotypical pre-determined ways. Note PRE-DETERMINED, this felt more like a puzzle game to me than some crazy/inventive sandbox killing fun as an Omen child clone.\n\nIt's not worth even an hour of your time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/recommended/218640/","goldenkitten","Goldenkitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/","627 products in account","Whether you might find Lucius worth picking up can quickly be deduced by whether the basic concept sounds like it could carry a game for you. Playing as the son of the devil you utilize a number of psychic powers and everyday household objects in specific situations to orchestrate a series of unlikely and over-the-top “accidents” (murders). Does that sound fun and like something you could do for 6-8 hours? Then come on board. But if you’re expecting it to be more than that, or if you were hoping for a sandbox experience that lets you decide how to use those powers then you probably won’t get what you want out of it.\n\nIt’s of great importance to note that Lucius is less Bully/Saints Row and more Monkey Island/Myst…just…with more murder. Yes that’s right despite appearances this is for all intents and purposes a real-time, fully 3D, point-and-click adventure. Things are rarely action oriented, instead forcing you to locate a number of items and utilize them in the correct location alongside a host of generic powers such as telekinesis and mind-control to arrange your targets untimely demise. Essentially being your average adventure game puzzles wrapped up in a macabre aesthetic.\n\nThis wasn’t a negative to me, but if you were hoping to be let loose in a world where you could unleash your powers on a whim in any way you could dream of you’ll be disappointed. In fact, it’s quite the opposite with a few exceptions and if you use your powers outside of the areas they’re allowed you’ll likely receive a game over. Since part of the story is remaining undetected and making the murders look like accidents or shifting the blame on to someone else you’ll lose the game if someone catches you lighting things on fire with your mind or the like. There’s some leniency there and it’s not so strict as to be aggravating, but it does limit what you can do. Even in the areas you’re meant to use your abilities you have to figure out the exact way the developers intended for you to use them to solve the puzzle and cause the murder. Again this will be a negative for some, but on the opposite end it does allow some of the murders to be really excessive and over the top since you can cause things you could never have orchestrated on your own.\n\nIt does however highlight one of the big problems I have with the game. Some of the powers feel pointless and you can really see this when some of them are only used once or twice in the entire game. For instance a power you get later in the game is pyrokinesis, the ability to create and control fire with your mind. At first this seems really neat but the game quickly comes up against its own wall. Since you’re supposed to be stealthy and subtle there really isn’t much use for this ability outside of two places where it’s shoehorned in. And of course using it anywhere else immediately gets you noticed and get a game over. Telekinesis and mind-control are used rather frequently, but otherwise the other powers feel throw-away and serve little purpose.\n\nThe secondary game mechanic is the occasional stealth bit. Usually you get to “hide in plain sight” by virtue of being a child. But a couple missions call for sneaking around the house after dark. These are pretty simple as long as you keep your wits about you and watch the patrolling guards’ flashlights. This also shows off another useless ability in the form of “memory erase” which is supposed to be there to quickly make people forget they saw minor things such as you wandering around after dark or levitating objects. You can use it only a few times a mission but it’s more than enough to make the stealth situations criminally easy, and even then I had to use it a grand total of one time. Still these sections have some very nice lighting and are quite ambient.\n\nThere are some sidequests in the form of “chores” such as taking out the trash, doing laundry, and helping people find valuables they misplaced. Yes, that really is as boring as it sounds but it serves an interesting point in that it makes you look like a normal child. As the game continues on and more-and-more people die everyone begins doubting each other, especially you. But if you keep up the act of appearing normal their reactions are less extreme. I don’t know if they figure you out if you don’t do the chores since I always did them, or if their dialogue just changes, but either way it was a nice touch. Bonus points for you getting “gifts” for doing enough of the chores, though only one in the form of a tricycle that lets you move around faster is of any real use.\n\nAesthetically the game is very nice. From an actual graphical stand-point it’s an average looking game, being neither great nor terrible. But a Gothic Victorian setting with a very carefully crafted and detailed house to explore makes the graphics themselves a non-factor, as the architecture and degree of detail present is fun to look at regardless. A muted color scheme, hazy filter, and a perpetually dreary skyline punctuate and bring the macabre, grim setting to life. This is laid against the backdrop of some rather creepy old-timey Vaudeville inspired music that fits the setting perfectly.\n\nMost of the games bugs are graphics based so I’ll stick them here. The game doesn’t have any truly game-breaking bugs but it does have a host of minor hiccups like characters teleporting a few feet, physics enabled objects getting stuck and “stretching” across the screen, characters getting hung-up on doorways, and some funky hit-detection. Again nothing game breaking, but some atmosphere breaking stuff to be sure if that’s enough to turn you away from buying it.\n\nStory-wise things work but are nothing special. Did you ever want to play the Omen as a game taken wholesale? Well that’s what you’re going to get. Though at times it seems like the game can’t decide if it wants to be The Omen word-for-word, or The Omen with some parody tossed in. For the most part it’s played completely straight but a few scenes and characters seem like they are there almost as a joke. Not a “Ha ha” laugh out loud funny joke, but a sort of pervasive dark humor. Some might enjoy this but for me it felt out of place because most of the game takes itself so seriously. Additionally the ending feels rushed, it comes out of nowhere and is more than a little underwhelming. I got enough fun out of the rest of the game to forgive it, but the last few chapters feel like they had half of the time and work put into them being shorter, easier, and not requiring nearly the same level of mental thought to solve the puzzles.\n\nOverall I enjoyed Lucius and I think there’s a lot to come here for. But the game isn’t without issue both from a design and technical standpoint. If you come in expecting a game where you get to cause some over-the-top murders from the role of son of the devil you’ll probably be entertained by what you get, but if you’re expecting a revolutionary experience or some unknown gem of a game you’ll likely not find what you wanted.","February 22, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Some solutions are harder, some are smarter, there's a fine line between freedom and story in what could be called an Adventure game, because it all boils down to you living a story and having no impact to the main events.

Gameplay is very reminiscent of the early 'Hitman' series in which you pull off murders (making them appear as accidents) in order to reap souls for Satan. There is so much more to this game and a lot more forward-thinking than anything in the 'Hitman' series. Planning is key along with some "just the right time" scenerios to allow you to fly under the radar for some time. Pull daily chores like cleaning your room, which you can do via telekinesis as you gain unholy powers as you progress; help out the mechanic or gardener or kill some charming employees, friends, and family members.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/recommended/218640/","goldenkitten","Goldenkitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/","627 products in account","Whether you might find Lucius worth picking up can quickly be deduced by whether the basic concept sounds like it could carry a game for you. Playing as the son of the devil you utilize a number of psychic powers and everyday household objects in specific situations to orchestrate a series of unlikely and over-the-top “accidents” (murders). Does that sound fun and like something you could do for 6-8 hours? Then come on board. But if you’re expecting it to be more than that, or if you were hoping for a sandbox experience that lets you decide how to use those powers then you probably won’t get what you want out of it.\n\nIt’s of great importance to note that Lucius is less Bully/Saints Row and more Monkey Island/Myst…just…with more murder. Yes that’s right despite appearances this is for all intents and purposes a real-time, fully 3D, point-and-click adventure. Things are rarely action oriented, instead forcing you to locate a number of items and utilize them in the correct location alongside a host of generic powers such as telekinesis and mind-control to arrange your targets untimely demise. Essentially being your average adventure game puzzles wrapped up in a macabre aesthetic.\n\nThis wasn’t a negative to me, but if you were hoping to be let loose in a world where you could unleash your powers on a whim in any way you could dream of you’ll be disappointed. In fact, it’s quite the opposite with a few exceptions and if you use your powers outside of the areas they’re allowed you’ll likely receive a game over. Since part of the story is remaining undetected and making the murders look like accidents or shifting the blame on to someone else you’ll lose the game if someone catches you lighting things on fire with your mind or the like. There’s some leniency there and it’s not so strict as to be aggravating, but it does limit what you can do. Even in the areas you’re meant to use your abilities you have to figure out the exact way the developers intended for you to use them to solve the puzzle and cause the murder. Again this will be a negative for some, but on the opposite end it does allow some of the murders to be really excessive and over the top since you can cause things you could never have orchestrated on your own.\n\nIt does however highlight one of the big problems I have with the game. Some of the powers feel pointless and you can really see this when some of them are only used once or twice in the entire game. For instance a power you get later in the game is pyrokinesis, the ability to create and control fire with your mind. At first this seems really neat but the game quickly comes up against its own wall. Since you’re supposed to be stealthy and subtle there really isn’t much use for this ability outside of two places where it’s shoehorned in. And of course using it anywhere else immediately gets you noticed and get a game over. Telekinesis and mind-control are used rather frequently, but otherwise the other powers feel throw-away and serve little purpose.\n\nThe secondary game mechanic is the occasional stealth bit. Usually you get to “hide in plain sight” by virtue of being a child. But a couple missions call for sneaking around the house after dark. These are pretty simple as long as you keep your wits about you and watch the patrolling guards’ flashlights. This also shows off another useless ability in the form of “memory erase” which is supposed to be there to quickly make people forget they saw minor things such as you wandering around after dark or levitating objects. You can use it only a few times a mission but it’s more than enough to make the stealth situations criminally easy, and even then I had to use it a grand total of one time. Still these sections have some very nice lighting and are quite ambient.\n\nThere are some sidequests in the form of “chores” such as taking out the trash, doing laundry, and helping people find valuables they misplaced. Yes, that really is as boring as it sounds but it serves an interesting point in that it makes you look like a normal child. As the game continues on and more-and-more people die everyone begins doubting each other, especially you. But if you keep up the act of appearing normal their reactions are less extreme. I don’t know if they figure you out if you don’t do the chores since I always did them, or if their dialogue just changes, but either way it was a nice touch. Bonus points for you getting “gifts” for doing enough of the chores, though only one in the form of a tricycle that lets you move around faster is of any real use.\n\nAesthetically the game is very nice. From an actual graphical stand-point it’s an average looking game, being neither great nor terrible. But a Gothic Victorian setting with a very carefully crafted and detailed house to explore makes the graphics themselves a non-factor, as the architecture and degree of detail present is fun to look at regardless. A muted color scheme, hazy filter, and a perpetually dreary skyline punctuate and bring the macabre, grim setting to life. This is laid against the backdrop of some rather creepy old-timey Vaudeville inspired music that fits the setting perfectly.\n\nMost of the games bugs are graphics based so I’ll stick them here. The game doesn’t have any truly game-breaking bugs but it does have a host of minor hiccups like characters teleporting a few feet, physics enabled objects getting stuck and “stretching” across the screen, characters getting hung-up on doorways, and some funky hit-detection. Again nothing game breaking, but some atmosphere breaking stuff to be sure if that’s enough to turn you away from buying it.\n\nStory-wise things work but are nothing special. Did you ever want to play the Omen as a game taken wholesale? Well that’s what you’re going to get. Though at times it seems like the game can’t decide if it wants to be The Omen word-for-word, or The Omen with some parody tossed in. For the most part it’s played completely straight but a few scenes and characters seem like they are there almost as a joke. Not a “Ha ha” laugh out loud funny joke, but a sort of pervasive dark humor. Some might enjoy this but for me it felt out of place because most of the game takes itself so seriously. Additionally the ending feels rushed, it comes out of nowhere and is more than a little underwhelming. I got enough fun out of the rest of the game to forgive it, but the last few chapters feel like they had half of the time and work put into them being shorter, easier, and not requiring nearly the same level of mental thought to solve the puzzles.\n\nOverall I enjoyed Lucius and I think there’s a lot to come here for. But the game isn’t without issue both from a design and technical standpoint. If you come in expecting a game where you get to cause some over-the-top murders from the role of son of the devil you’ll probably be entertained by what you get, but if you’re expecting a revolutionary experience or some unknown gem of a game you’ll likely not find what you wanted.","February 22, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I can keep going on and on about this game. It's so freakin' awesome! Simply be a kid of 6 years old and murder your family and friends around it! Funny and cool. The graphics are not that good, but it will have to do.\nThe game is about Lucius, the 6 years old kid. The story is about him, he is the devil's son. At the 6th day of the 6th month on his 6th birthday (or let's say: 666) he becomes evil. His first kill is the old maid, which we don't care about, since she had too much icecream (you'll get the joke when you play it).\n\nOne thing creeped me out the most, since that the graphics aren't that good, the face of the people don't show any emotions, not that much at least. For Lucius this is even worse, his black eyes, looking through your skin, no emotions, only pure evil.\nThe game is not scary at all, but his face scared me.\n\nThe only spoiler I will make is that there are 2 different game-ends, you'll have to pick the one you are attracted too.\n\nIt's no open world, that's the saddest thing about the game, you can not leave the house/garden. It's actually a really small map which you can walk in. Luckily you'll get something better later, to move around.\n\nI recommend this game to all of you. If you like to play the bad guy some time, then this is it. Murder your family and their friends for fun, nobody expects the kid to be the killer! Watch out for some signs though, they make you weak.\nFor a decent price, for me at least, it's great. Though, it's only singleplayer, so it still might be too expensive.\nIf you buy it: You're awesome, Have fun!","May 19, 2014","true","17.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It was released October 26th 2012. The game is set in the 1970’s and is a horror adventure game.\n\n\nGameplay 6/10\n\nI enjoyed the game play. I walked into the game blind so I didn’t have any expectations. It’s in third person. You move with the usual WASD keys. The game is linear so you don’t have much choice in what happens. But, it’s got a nice story to it. Only thing I really disliked was the way they implemented the third person cam without the option of a first person view. It got awkward in some instances trying to kill someone. You also don’t talk the entire game. So, if you like silent protagonists, Lucius(character) is for you.\n\n\nMusic/sound 5/10\n\nThe soundtrack for this game really helped set the mood for the things you were doing. It really helped in the immersion of the game. I’m not sure what other people thought about the voice acting. But at certain times it was nice and other times not so much.\nCreativity 6/10\nThis story was rather nice, I liked it. All through the game the story is nice; the narration between chapters is done well. But, the one thing that broke me was the ending. Left so many questions unanswered. Other than that it’s a normal adventure game.\n\n\nGraphics 8/10\n\nThe graphics are nice considering this is an indie game. The fires are decent, though with my testing on lower graphics they’re a bit blocky for the poor low end computers out there. Not pretty. But, on the highest setting they’re fine.\n\n\nReplay Value 5/10\n\nThe replay value of this game isn’t much. But, if you want to kill a few people while following a decent story, I can see you coming back to this.\n\n\nEnjoyment 8/10\n\nMaybe I’m a sadistic person. I really enjoyed finding out how to murder the people without getting caught quite fun.  I had a blast with the death cutsceens as well.\n\n\nOverall 6.5/10\n\nThis is a decent game. I recommend it to anyone who likes linear adventure/puzzle games. It has a satisfactory story and you get satisfaction for killing the people. Just don’t expect an over the top ending, it leaves you with questions.\n\n\n\nReferences.\nR1 = http://shivergames.com/\nR2 = http://www.lace-mamba.com/\n\nPlease comment, I'm always looking to improve!","January 18, 2014","true","8.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The "Story" portion of the game which takes you from start to finish is very linear.  But I found a lot of times I was content to use the house as a playground for Lucius's powers instead of always immediately targeting my next victim.  The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius. Bottom Line: definitely worth getting, if it's on sale.","December 23, 2013","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can keep going on and on about this game. It's so freakin' awesome! Simply be a kid of 6 years old and murder your family and friends around it! Funny and cool. The graphics are not that good, but it will have to do.\nThe game is about Lucius, the 6 years old kid. The story is about him, he is the devil's son. At the 6th day of the 6th month on his 6th birthday (or let's say: 666) he becomes evil. His first kill is the old maid, which we don't care about, since she had too much icecream (you'll get the joke when you play it).\n\nOne thing creeped me out the most, since that the graphics aren't that good, the face of the people don't show any emotions, not that much at least. For Lucius this is even worse, his black eyes, looking through your skin, no emotions, only pure evil.\nThe game is not scary at all, but his face scared me.\n\nThe only spoiler I will make is that there are 2 different game-ends, you'll have to pick the one you are attracted too.\n\nIt's no open world, that's the saddest thing about the game, you can not leave the house/garden. It's actually a really small map which you can walk in. Luckily you'll get something better later, to move around.\n\nI recommend this game to all of you. If you like to play the bad guy some time, then this is it. Murder your family and their friends for fun, nobody expects the kid to be the killer! Watch out for some signs though, they make you weak.\nFor a decent price, for me at least, it's great. Though, it's only singleplayer, so it still might be too expensive.\nIf you buy it: You're awesome, Have fun!","May 19, 2014","true","17.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Slowly introducing you to the game mechanics and drip feeding new abilities, but then the game never really goes anywhere.\n\nA few levels in and the mansion opens up, but then most of it is pointless space with the occasional hunt for an object in one of the rooms. I feel it would have been better to restrict each chapter to a certain area, but admittedly this would feel constrained.\n\nThe solutions themselves range from pretty straightforward to bordering on the illogical. Additionally there is only one way to solve each murder and sometimes feels like guesswork to deduce the intended method (clues can be obtained using an unlockable item).\n\nOne for adventure fans to pickup on sale, otherwise avoid.","November 6, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Why don't the game let you decide what do you want to do with that person way to die?\n\nI still recommended this game to you that haven't played the game.

And yeah, some of it was easy, but a couple of things were really really hard - you can't get caught with anyone spotting you doing anything suspiciuous - one particular mission was in the dark but the whole house was awake with flashlights and walking around; I must've redone it fifteen times before figuring it out a different way. 55 is too low a meta score.

The details are actually really pretty, however, I just think it could have been executed better- especially for a $20 game.\n\n*Hours to complete: On average, 5 hours.\nJust the play through you are able to complete with in 5 hours. After you complete the whole game, there are extra achievements on steam you can do which will take you to about 10 hours total to complete everything.\n\n*Story line: 7/10\nI love the concept of this game. It's about a young boy, Lucius, who is Satin's soul collector basically. Your goal is to kill off everyone living/working in the manor you live in with out being suspected. You have special powers to help you along the way. The rating is because it's unique and I like the concept. The only thing I wish was different was there was more of a background to the story or something. It just felt like something was missing the whole time I played. Maybe it was just me, lol.\n\n*Game play: 9/10\nI LOVED playing this game. It's definitely on the more challenging side. It holds your hand and walks you through your first killing, but after that it's up to you to figure out how to kill everyone else. You do get a quest journal that gives you hints as to what you're supposed to be doing but other than that you're left to walk clueless around this huge manor trying to figure out how to kill the next person. (there are always walk throughs if you get stuck) I won't give away too much, but a lot of the killings had me VERY entertained. Plus, I decapitated a persons head with a lawn mower. 10/10 right there. I was left wanting to keep playing after the game ended. Which by the way, the ending is by far my favorite part. You get to decide on how you want to end the game, an action approach or a puzzle approach, definitely a bonus in my book. Just means you get to play the whole game all over again JUST to play the second ending. The ending is the most challenging part of this game. It's basically your "boss battle". The only reason it didn't get a 10/10 for this topic is because I felt like it was a really short play through. I mean, 5 hours is a long time. I just wished for more. Maybe that's why they made a second one.\n\n*Price: 6/10\n~~(7/7/2015) As of today: $19.99\nSo basically.. Is this game worth it?\nYou're getting 5+ hours of entertainment, a good story line, a good play through, with decent animations and graphics. I honestly think this game should be a little lowered price, especially with the fact that there is a second game priced the same. I feel $10 for this game is worth it. If you can pick it up on sale, it's 10/10 for this topic.\n\n*Over all:\nI recommend this game if you like:\n> Difficult games\n> Strategic/detective games\n> Killing characters\n> Quick play through games\n> Steam achievements","July 7, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The concept behind Lucius is a good one - you are a demonic child whose purpose is to sacrifice souls to Lucifer in exchange for power - but the execution is lacking. Rather than allow you to do anything on your own accord, Lucius plays out more or less like an old-school point-and-click adventure. Every event is coded in advance and the only thing expected from you is to follow the exact steps laid out by the game. There is no creativity of any sort, only trial and error.\n\nWorse than that, the game is plagued by numerous bugs. The engine is poorly optimized and it's not uncommon for characters to clip into walls or objects to melt into the environment. The lighting is completely bonkers. Certain achievements don't trigger properly. The sound design is abysmal. Rather than put together a soundtrack, the developers downloaded a bunch of royalty-free "horror" tracks and shoved them to play during the game without any sense or purpose, often completely ignoring what's going on. Get used to the atrocious "chase scene" music from the tutorials to barge into the cutscenes that follow, even if that cutscene is a peaceful Christmas dinner.\n\nLucius is a game that tries to sell itself on its concept, but doesn't treat it with any kind of care. It feels like the developers simply pushed out the game, caring more about how much money it makes than whether it's actually any good. A shame, because a strong concept like Lucius could benefit from a developer who isn't completely apathetic toward their creations.","November 29, 2013","false","7.1"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

I would not call it an open world or sand box game. So as long as you are OK with that, then I would really recommend this game.\n\nThe art style and atmosphere are really good and so it is just like playing and re-creating the old Omen films. It is a really good original experience. Each chapter is a puzzle, who to kill and how. You get more and more powers but you can't use them any way you want. Each murder has to be done in a specific way using a specific object or specific power. It can be frustrating wandering around trying to find a specific victim or a specific object. As there are little or no checkpoints, if you make a mistake it is game over and back to the start. So some chapters are just really repetitive trial and error.\n\nBut on the good side,  as there is a different solution for each murder, the game is always varied and the final cut scenes are so silly and gruesome that they always make you laugh.","December 16, 2014","true","43.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Absolutely!\n\nLucius was the first game that I ever purchased for Steam in 2012 and have continued to love the same since then and would highly recommend this classic to those who even just enjoy the gore-factor alone (let's get this straight- GORE from a 2012 game which shouldn't deter the squimish). I have honestly enjoyed playing through this game and watching as my actions create grief amongst the family, sending members into insanity, anxiety, and paranoia as you get away with murder upon murder through fifteen chapters.\n\nMy only issue with Lucius is the directional issue of the game itself, sometimes glitching and resulting in a level which is impassable which has happened a few times which I picked up items before the actual time that I needed them- or had no idea what I was doing in the level at all due to minimal direction. Other than that (and some slight issue with controller support) there are not many negatives to Lucius than sometimes rushed story/chapters and a semi-cheesy plot that parallels the Omen. Not to mention how uncanny Lucius' model is on top of the fact that he does not speak ( which is fine since the awesome voicework of the rest of the cast makes up for it compeltely with emotional delieveries of lies! ) and some slight animation lackage ( which I'll give leaniancy to since it is a 2012 game )\n\nAll and all, I would definately recommend this game to anyone who has had the hankering to be the murdering Son of Satan!\n\n","May 3","true","5.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuVoG/recommended/218640/","QuVoG","QuVoG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuVoG/","60 products in account","Story:\nTo start off, you're Lucius, the son of Lucifer. You're born in a rich family and only found out the truth about your true origin when you turn 6. Throughout the game, you murdered members of your household with several interesting methods to gain more powers, such as Telekinesis, where you can move objects or tinker with certain machinery with your mind.\n\nPersonally, I felt that the story is very interesting as most games that we play usually put us in the shoes of a "I want to save the world and protect my friends" kinda protagonist. However in this game, we play the "fk u, fk u, and fk u" kinda guy, where you simply don't give a ♥♥♥♥ of the fact that you're just a 6 year old plotting to murder your entire household.\n\nGameplay:\nSimilar to most sandbox games in areas such as where you can go around the manor and break stuff, explore around, talk to people, cycle around in the tricycle that was given for being a little good boy, but with a very huge difference. You can only kill someone in a set particular way. There's no other way around it. Nevertheless, it is still very interesting to witness the several different ways the game wants you to witness for the murder of each member of the household. However, due to the fact that you can only kill someone a certain way, the events and objects that you have to trigger or obtain can sometimes be fustrating to figure out yourself without looking at guides.\n\nAchievements:\nAll the achievements in the game are pretty easy to get. You simply have to look at guides while playing the game to make sure that you do not miss any, otherwise you have to replay the chapter that gives that achievement. However, if you want to achieve every single achievement from this game, I felt that it is pointless to try due to the fact that the last 2 achievements requires you to play 20 hours and 40 hours respectively. As mentioned before, the game only allows you to kill someone in a certain way. There's no flexibility in the amount of ways that you can kill someone, thus not giving any fun out of replaying the game again so that you can kill someone using another method. To add on, you can complete the game in 7 hours and you cannot afk in the game to achieve those 2 achievements. You would have to be "playing" by moving around, and only that will make the game record the hours that you have played.\n\nGraphics:\nWatching the gameplay of this game on platforms such as YouTube or twitch  may cause some people to think that the game requires a very good graphic card to play, I have a NVIDIA NVS 5200M graphic card, which only allow me to run the game on low settings, but it still looks really good and it runs with a very decent fps of more than 60. It is still a plus if you have a good graphic card to play it on a higher setting though.\n\nPrice:\nIs it worth buying the game at full price? Well, $10.50 to entertain youself for more than 7 hours on average sounds pretty decent in my opinion. My call? Yes, buy it regardless whether it is on sale or not.","May 7","true","8.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's a neat concept for a dark and morbid puzzle/adventure game. It's a less-than-subtle homage to the 1976 film 'The Omen'. In it you play as the titular Lucius, a 10 year old boy to whom Satan (who looks and sounds like a poor Jack Nickelson impersonator) reveals is the antichrist. You're tasked with killing the entirety of the household, including your surrogate family, in ways that draw no suspicion to you, or your satanic nature.\nAsside from an entertaining concept the acting is probably the best thing about this game. Watching your family lose their minds over the inexplicable deaths tormenting them grows more and more harrowing as you progress.\nUnfortunately, that's where the praise ends. This game is a technical mess. Objectives are unclear, gameplay is stifling, the sidequests are boring and the glitches are rampant.\nI spent a whole hour on one of the early missions because you cant use your satan powers when in direct line of sight of NPCs. After looking it up in a guide it turned out I had to stand behind a small, suspended rack of meat about 2 feet away from where I was standing. On the plus side, i found out if you walk lengthways into a door while it's opening or closing, it'll slingshot you outside of the map, allowing you to get a better sense of the houses layout. Later in the game you can unlock a gun and mind-wiping abilities, but aside from the tutorial, I found no place to use either of these for the whole game. Another sidequest reward is a Jack-in-the-box, the function of which I was never able to figure out, but it had a limit of 2 charges of whatever it did. This was my reward for spending half an hour gathering socks from around the house and putting them into the laundry bin, one by one.\nDespite the open world, it becomes quickly apparent that there's only one way to complete each mission. Ideally, a game like this would involve forethought, strategy and precision. Instead it's just trial and error see-what-this-thing-does.\nFor the finale of the game it takes a stark departure where you are suddenly just throwing fireballs at people like the fantastic four. It feels like the core gameplay just gave up.\n\nOverall, Lucius is a neat concept but the execution feels rushed and incomplete. Can't recommend.","January 8, 2014","false","9.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Overall Lucius is a very fun horror game. Now first the atmosphere is great. The entire game takes place in a mansion which is really confusing to navigate but theres alot of stuff to see and explore another thing thats really cool about this game is to figure out the ways that you need to dispose of enemies. You keep a journal which tells you about the victim and his or hers weakness which sometimes helps and sometimes doesnt. The game also has some illogical puzzles but just minor stuff and thats pretty much it. And plus this game takes inspiration from the Omen so you can practiclly say its Omen The video game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathMetalMarine/recommended/218640/","DeathMetalMarine","[AwayCuzExams]DeathMetalMarine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathMetalMarine/","454 products in account","A really cool game that I believe was inspired from The Omen movie. You play as Lucius, the son of Lucifer. Lucius was born June 6th, 1966 (666 incase you haven't figured it out lol) into a family where his grandfather was worshiping and offering sacrifices in a hidden chamber all the way since his kids were young (Lucius bio father and his brother), which is the reason the family is so rich.\n\nThe game starts when Lucius and his family are celebrating his 6th birthday when Lucifer visits him in a vision and points him to kill the maid. After he's done it, while Lucius is sleeping Lucifer visits him in his dream and teaches him a new skill. And that's basically what the game's all about, killing people and learning new abilities to use to kill people marked by Lucifer, until the end where you all the choas happens (won't spoil it) and you leave the manor as an innocent young kid and taken away by the detective after the fire that was burning down the manor.\n\nYou can do many things other than solving puzzles and killing people around the house like tricycling around the manor, annoying people, messing around with your abilities, getting detected and then erasing the memory from those who saw you use it, doing chores for your parents and people who work at the manor which gets you some gifts like the tricycle, music box and a boad game.\n\n- Graphics: 6.5/10 but it really isn't that important to me.\n- Story: 8/10 It was entertaining and fun.\n- Gameplay: 7.5/10 Could've been better.\n- Price: I got it off BundleStars along with a few games in a bundle for $2.49 and it was totally worth it. If you don't like the full price, just wait for it to go on sale and get it along with Lucius II.\n\nFinal score: 7/10. Good and fun game.","September 16, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While the concept looks good on paper, execution wise the game goes only halfway.\nWhether intentionally or not, it's pretty humorous going around as a little kid and messing things up around the manor. The character himself never talks throughout the game, which is pretty creepy and is even made reference to at one point in the storyline. The abilities you are able to use are cool as well, like mind control, telekenisis, and even fireballs! (although you can only use that ability at specific points, mainly scripted events).\nUnfortunately that's where the positives really end, the storyline of the game is pretty bland and not very in-depth. Not that long into the game you'll start to get somewhat bored of it and would rather just go back to your own evil devices. The cutscenes (which I'm pretty sure use the in-game engine) are god-awful, ranging from out of touch lip syncing, wooden voice acting and PS2 textures. Another thing is that actually figuring what to do next is a challenge in of itself, most of the time you'll be wandering around the manor, bumping into different rooms and accidentally finding important items. The worst part is if you fail on a mission, you have to start the ENTIRE mission all over again, which mainly happened for me during the stealth sequences in the game. The worst kind of Trial and error.\nOverall, this game is only really worth getting if it's at a low enough discount (75% or above) and even then save it for when you don't have anything else to play. It's not worth the wait or hype. Again this is my opinion, if you have a different view and enjoy this game wholeheartedly then that's great! :) But for me, it was a mediocre experience.","June 28, 2014","false","5.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In Lucius however, there is only one way and you need to wander around and figure out how to set this specific trap with specific objects, which later on can be ridiculously vague. Resorting to a walkthrough is a certainty in some cases.\n\nThe game has about 16 missions for you to do and the first third of them are almost spelled out for you. So between being shown what to do and then being very vague, there isn't much fun to be had. The game is surprisingly linear for an open world game.\n\nThe story had me interested, but the game play wasn't worth a play through, especially at 20 bucks.","October 27, 2013","false","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sui_mach/recommended/218640/","sui_mach","Suicide Machine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sui_mach/","1040 products in account","I guess, seeing trailers a lot of people may get an impression that Lucius is something like sandbox killing game... a Hitman game with demonic powers. Sadly - it's not.\n\nIn a game, you play a role of Lucius, a young boy, who - thanks to his Grandfather's occult involvement - posses demonic powers. Each month, he's visited by Lucifer himself and each month he has to kill a new target.\nIt's an interesting, if not slightly controversial concept, which should have allowed for wide spectrum of possibilities. And even first 3 of the chapters show a fair amount of potential that this game should have used to maximum.\n\nWell, the main problem of the game is that - there are no alternative solutions to a problem. After 5 or 6 missions, you realize that - even though "the playground" is getting bigger and bigger - the concept and possibilities the game gives you stay exactly the same. This essentially makes the game just a shallow adventure game, where player's task isn't to find the best way to kill a target, but finding a way that developer's designed.... even if it doesn't make a lot of sense. And so - in later levels, you're running back and forth, through a gigantic mansion, trying to find that one object that you need to finish up your task, only to find something that is as big as rock or battery(!). This alone wouldn't be so bad, if the game gave you enough hints on what you're looking for or what you have to do, but that isn't a case.\n\nNot only that - the game sometimes doesn't even fallow the rules of "smart level design" and places many objects that you have to use in shadows and badly lighten places - the type of places, where a player is least likely going to look for them. I remember being stuck in chapter 10 for good 10 minutes, only to realize that objects I was looking for were hanging on the wall - the only place in the entire the room, that was in the shadows. Finally, the design on a mansion itself is extremely confusing and it's going to take good few hours, before you're going to learn where to go, to not run in circles.\n\nFrom all of that, you may get an impression that I completely hated the game. That isn't the case. When everything was going fine and I had any idea what to do, where to find it etc. - the game was fairly entertaining. And storyline - even though, idea behind it felt flat on its face after 7 chapters - kept me interested enough to keep playing till the very end. The number of achievements also helped quite a bit, making me feel rewarded even for the most minor of tasks.\n\nWhen it comes to graphics - Lucius looks decent. It's more or less something that I'd except from a game of this calibre. There are few textures that don't look right and few places in a house, that feel empty, but it isn't anything game breaking. Character animations sometimes look a little stiff - especially facial animation could use some work. There are also some weird problems with optimization, where a framerate drops in some areas for no obvious reason, but - once again - because it isn't really an action game, I don't consider it a major problem.\n\nLucius also has a decent music. Although, by the end of the game, you'll hear each of the tracks way too many times. Sound assets are good and fitting for the most part. Voice acting however is a mixed bag. I've played an English version and I personally wouldn't say that for the most part actors are doing a bad job. It's more of a case that script they had to work with and lines they had to deliver aren't very good. It's also obvious for me that in many places, they weren't given enough directions on how should they play their roles, which results in some hilarious conversations in few parts of the game.\n\nBottom line - I'd avoid Lucius for the price of 20€ or even 10€. However - with 75% discount, I could recommend it to people that like adventure games or simply don't mind checking walkthroughs. It's a 6-8hrs long mediocre game, that sometimes shows its potential, but at the same time - is flawed with problems.","November 25, 2013","false","8.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

On the technical side I've experienced numerous glitches and a few crashes. In-game the inventory and 'mission log' are very awkward to use, and the map is broken. The game offers little support for your objectives. As it has some puzzle elements this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the game has such tight grip on how a specific objective or 'kill' has to be executed that some kind of support would be nice. The fact that the game's kills are largely scripted doesn't even bother me that much. The main frustration lies in the fact that you have to carry it out exactly as the game wants you to. For instance, halfway through the game you are tasked with carrying water outside without gaining any suspicion. As all but one character are in the same room this could have been as easy as taking a bucket from the laundry room, filling it with water and carrying it outside without bumping into any NPC. Instead, the game wants you to go to a very specific room and take a very specific object to carry the water around. Unfortunately it doesn't end there. Some of the more interesting sections have you sneaking through the mansion at night. As some of the NPCs are still awake you have to take care not to bump into them. However, as the game is rather unforgiving in this, such sequences quickly turn into trial and error. In the game, you use specific powers such as telekinesis and mind control to achieve objectives. A downside is that simple things like picking up stuff or opening doors are treated in the same manner, meaning that this form of interaction also has to be selected from a hotkey. This became frustrating when I spent five minutes trying to open a door but wasn't able to do so as I still had telekinesis selected as active ability. When using a power such as telekinesis or mind control you have to aim extremely careful for it to take effect. Towards the end, this became so tricky that I had to go to the options menu to considerably lower my mouse sensitivity. The game has some annoying invisible walls (or rather 'fences') placed around some objects which obscure your ability to toss fireballs past them. A plus side is that this is one of the very few games where you play a true villain (not just an antihero) and that the atmosphere is very nice. It is just pitiful that the game is so poorly executed.\n\nTl;dr: nice concept; bad execution.","February 20, 2014","false","7.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/curtmuffin/recommended/218640/","curtmuffin","Pancake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/curtmuffin/","435 products in account","This game makes me sad.  It's a classic story of "so much potential."  You basically play as a little devil-spawn kid (ala "The Omen") and run around the house plotting and executing the murders of various occupants in your house without getting caught.\n\nThe gameplay isn't bad, but it takes far too long to figure out what your objective is and where the things you need to achieve it are.  It would be a lot more fun if you could wander around exploring and gathering and then choose an execution method based on your inventory, rather than having to find the items for the single available method.\n\nThe other problem I had with this game was that it has far too many cutscenes which last for too long and happen too often.  It interrupts the gameplay.  At one point, you have to sneak out of your room to get some rat poison.  You have to sneak around without being noticed, which is actually a good deal of fun.  So I picked up the rat poison and expected to have to sneak back, but instead there was a cutscene that had me waking up the next morning.  One of the best parts of the old Thief game was trying to get back out after you've accomplished your goals.  No such "extra drama" here.  Just do your task and watch the next cutscene.\n\nI was very happy I was able to give this game a try, but I can't say I recommend it.  It's just too frustrating, the voice acting is poor, the characters are either unbelievably mean or oblivious, your actions are too limited, and worst of all, the story isn't compelling.","February 20, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Although it is quite twisted, I wouldnt class it under a horror genre.\n\nThe good:\n\n- Generally speaking, it's a really fun game.\n- Good amount of play time, it took me 6 hours of playing to finish it.\n- The puzzles can be quite challenging and take some time (can be good for some, may be bad).\n- Involves some elements of stealth (can't get caught holding something or doing something bad, as well as not being caught running around at night).\n- Includes 'side quests' (you get chores to do and get rewards)\n- General gameplay is quite nice (other than a few bugs)\n- Key mapping is great and easy to use\n\nThe bad:\n\n- A few bugs/glitches. I had to restart a few levels due to getting stuck.\n- Storyline lacks depth, although this does not affect the gameplay at all.\n- Ending (the puzzle ending) confused me a bit. Maybe it was meant to be left open ended, but I don't think this was done well at all..\n\nDefinately recommended","January 10","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I waited for it to be released. And then it did, and the reviews were not kind. I thought I will still like it, until I started the game. 19 minutes later I wrote this review.\n\nIt was the most boring opening I have ever seen. The background music was the most uninspired I have ever heard. The voice acting was jarring at best. Stiff and emotionless. The writing lies somewhere between banal and cliche, at times unapologetically indifferent, or unapologetically dumbass, for the lack of a better word. A woman died and the police concluded it was heart attack, and the detective who just arrived concurred, stating that it was typical of women her age, before he even set foot into the house. That was all I could take before I shut down the game.\n\nControls were unintuitive. Explanations were a mystery in itself. I spent 3 minutes trying to figure out how to use a lock when you don't have a way to select it even when you see it on screen. In the previous step, the game told you to pick it up, then it instructed you to 'holster' it. Then the game asked you to use it, without explaining that you need to 'unholster' it before you can use it. Brilliant.\n\nIn the 19 minutes that I have played the game, I have probably played it for 5 minutes. I spent the other 14 waiting for the game to load, watching slow moving cutscenes that tells you what you already know, listening to words that hardly inspires, instill fear, or peak my interest in any way. It was more interesting watching paint dry.\n\nAlso, instead of opting for a first person perspective, the developers wanted to replicate a movie feel and go third person instead. I know, they are trying to recreate the tricycle scene of The Shinning, but ever wondered how awkward it is to control someone in-game like that? And that's not to mention how they always have to center the camera looking directly at Lucius, who admittedly looked creepy in the game. It's a wonder then, how no one suspected him.\n\nDo I recommend this game? No. Will I continue to play it till the end? No. Will I buy Lucius II? No. Should you play this game? Depends. If you are patient and don't care about quality as much, you may enjoy it. If you are critical like I am, you will balk at the notion that this game was even made.","August 17, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Let's take it step by step :\n\n1. Graphisms : Just a shame. Bugged af, animations are stupids, the house, the people, and more than EVERYTHING : the little Lucius is so uncharismatic...\n\n2. Soundtracks : Always the same. I only like one song of the game : the music box one. There aren't many of others, always the same the whole game, and sometimes they don't go with the situation.\n\n3. Story : It doesn't go far enough. When another character goes in the story so it can go deeper, he instantly disappears, and it's just murder over murder.\n\n4.Gameplay : Empty. You can walk, use some useless things, pick up items and use it. Half is useless. You have some spells, 5 that you will unlock in the game. You'll use 4 of them to go on, and 2 of them are used maybe 3 times.\n\n5. Time to finish the game : Most of the game is walking from a room to another. You'll need maybe 4 hours to finish the game.\n\nWell, I'm not angry from this game, this is a real analysis. This game is bad because it is bad. It had good ideas ! When I discovered the game I told myself "hum nice" but these things weren't important, and good things aren't used enough. So, sorry people, you'll need another game.","June 5","false","27.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You are Lucius, a little boy and a killer. It's like (Hitboy) ;) and movies like "The Omen"\n\nYou can open every drawer and cabinet, turn on/off every light. You can unlock 5 specials like telekinesis. You have an inventory and you can combine stuff. People talk to you and if you listen you can get infos about your next kill. If you finishes a job you get a final sequence with your kill which is mostly very violently and brutal bloody. Not for kids... but with kids. XD\n\n-Points for too lineary story. Every kill has only 1 solution. Find this solution is sometimes really hard. You have to check out the big house for every little piece you maybe need.

The story centers around Lucius, the devil's alleged son who has been asked to murder people in demonic ways. It's not combat-oriented, you just cause accidents to hurt/kill people.\n\nIt's new, but also quite bad. The story is lame, and the dialogue is drawn out and boring. Gameplay itself is excruciatingly awful. Killing random people by locking them in a freezer is not only unnecessarily gruesome, it's also not fun at all.\n\nDon't get me started on the animations and graphics. Not that it's like a bad port, but they just did a terrible job modeling the people; mouths and voices are also not in sync.\n\nOverall, a waste of my money.","February 8, 2013","false","0.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/218640/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","I first played Lucius with high expectations but it only took me less than a hour that despite the great concept and promisse of this game, it failed deeply to deliver. For those of you who don't know, basicly the premisse of Lucius is that you're the son of Satan and he speaks to you at certain times teaching you new powers/spells and when you find a certain person on your house he'll tell you that you need to kill her. I understand that some games are better done if they restrict the player options ,in order to experience a story for example, but in this case I feel like the death of each one of those individuals being scripted didn't actually helped that much. Sure the developers created on their own way for each person to get killed in order to unfold the story which takes place around you and the detective which is investigating the deaths on your house along with your family but I feel like if they allowed to each player kill those people using their "imagination", per say, and their powers it would be actually alot more fun, don't get me wrong I actually thought some of them were well made. I also felt like the game was poorly optimized because I believe the cutscenes are rendered ingame and they ran pretty poorly for me for some reason but that's maybe just something on my end. One thing I really hated was that sometimes if you wake up and you need to get a certain item in order to kill someone, if you miss your "window of oportunity", like someone goes over to that room and they can't see and you need to wait for him to go to sleep it's actually pretty boring, atleast for me anyways. Overall I can't put myself to playing Lucius until the end because I just can't take it, the concept is great but it's poorly executed as far as I see it or maybe I just don't like the game at all. Eitherways, I don't recommend this one, beware.","December 22, 2013","false","5.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

However, in Lucius you are given no choice as to how to kill your target. There is only one way to take out your target, and its usually the most obscure, annoying, and hidden way you could possibly imagine.\nWhat also sucks is how you never get to "experiment" to learn your surroundings. Walk up to some guy with a gun and shoot him? Instant game over. You dont get to see the reaction of what you have done, you just get that satisfying "GAME OVER" we all love. It is also a buggy mess,  ive had to repeat levels numerous times because a bug occured making the level unbeatable.

Lucius then begins killing inhabitants of the mansion in different ways in order to give his father souls. I was very excited to play this game, especially when I bought it on sale for $1.49, but I ended up disappointed. I felt that the storyline was very generic, and since I played with a controller, I also felt that the controls were sort of awkward, particularly when using telekinesis. One of the things I found most annoying was that the instructions on what to do were sometimes very vague. For instance, when asked to take the trash out, not only would I have to go searching for the trash, but also for a place to take it to. Then at one point the game hinted that I should find some way to mess with one of the inhabitants, but I spent 30 minutes running around having no clue how to do it. On top of that, the map was sort of confusing and the game crashed the first time I tried to change the resolution. This game is really fun whenever I know what I'm doing, but it gets frustrating when I spend thirty minutes looking for one item or place because I'm not very observant. The graphics are really good but I wouldn't spend more than $5 on this game.","May 3","false","2.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I was kind of expecting a sand box-y style horror game where I would be given mission(s) and could choose to fulfill them however I wanted, what I soon discovered was that this is more of a point and click adventure game, where they expect you to follow very specific rules and paths in the game. On top of that, the graphics suck, they are kind of outdated, like Grandtheft Auto 3 graphics and even on good hardware seem to have issues with frame rates.\n\nQuite frankly, it's a massive disappointment.\n\nIt would have been amazing if I could go about killing the people in the house, how I wanted, with multiple endings and murders, but that just isn't what this game is like.\n\nWhat's even more annoying is at the start of each mission, they usually give very, very vague hints and that's about it. I don't expect a puzzle to be handed to me, but when all you give me is like, "I don't like this person" and that's it, it can become incredibly difficult.\n\nThe AI is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to say the least. During the tutorial the characters mother spent the entire time simply walking up against a locked door watching me do the entire thing without saying a word.\n\nit's not even remotely close to a "open world" when not only are rooms locked off if you have no buisness being in them, but there are extremely specific guidelines for each mission you have to follow. If this were an open world, I should be able to kill the people, howeverr I want and this simply isn't true.\n\nIn short, a friend bought this game for me for Christmas and I am so very glad I didn't spend money on it, it's a waste of time and money. I feel bad my friend wasted money on this title. The developers had a real award winning idea here and they just wasted it with lazy design and production.","January 7, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

Given that the game tends to retail for $19.99 this title is way over priced given the average game design, wildly fluctuating difficulty, laughable lip syncing, and sub-par voice acting, I simply can't recommend it otherwise.\n\nPROS:\n- Essentially lets you play through a game simulating Damien from The Omen\n- Decent sized map to keep things interesting\n- You can earn a surprise gift by doing most of the available chores that pays homage to The Shining and The Omen alike (though it adds little practical use aside from the easter egg reference)\n\nCONS\n- Very specific target demographic, I think most would be unhappy if purchased\n- Game is VERY short and could be completed in under 5 hours if game objectives were clearer\n- Regular price is absurd for the content offered\n- Gameplay is limited and will lose many players' interest\n- Story is very shallow and essentially follows the general storyline of The Omen series\n- The difficulty curve is all over the map.  Some parts of the game are exceedingly simple while others have you running around in circles wondering what you're doing wrong until you give up and look at a walkthrough.\n- 2/3 of the gifts given for performing the tedious chores are simply avenues for hints which end up being necessary when the game's solutions are unclear and annoying\n- Although there are 2 different endings, this adds practically no replay value\n\n","February 3, 2015","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find it kind of buggy and hard to control Lucius at times - which may just be my computer's fault - but overall I like the style, story and idea of the game. You get to play as a (very small but deadly) villian. You get to have Satan as your teacher.  You have an open mansion to explore and discover.  And you also get to slowly ruin your parents' lives as you cause an omen in their home.\n\nSimilar to a point and click game but your given other powers that don't only include picking up objects or shutting off devices etc, but the ability to use telekenesis and mind control and also combustion. You can only acquire your kills in specific ways, you cannot choose the way you kill people.  It can be puzzling at times but the map normally guides you around the house and your journal gives you hints at what to do next.\n\nI bought this while it was on sale for $1.99 and I'd reccommend it at that price.  It's entertaining and keeps you going.  I've been waiting forever to get a hold of this game for cheap and now I'm looking forward to see what Lucius II will be like.","February 3, 2015","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks great, and after five hours I only experienced one glitch. My only real complaint is the initial unforgiving nature of the stealh bits, but it's later rectified by a skill you get.

No? Me neither, but I'm sure you're familiar with the trope of the eerie creepy son of Satan character arc that can be portrayed in some of Hollywood's most frightening films. Now, instead of playing the hero one would think they would be, you play as LUCIUS the hell spawn himself and roam about innocently your parents manor, using your new found powers to end the miserable lives of all who reside there.\n\nThe game itself has a wonderful concept, BECOME the horror, and while it may sometimes be delivered poorly due to some level breaking bug or the fact that you're spotted once and then you have to start ALL over again I still think it accomplishes what it sets out to do.\n\nNow, this isn't a action game, sort of. There are parts that heavily rely on action, but the majority of the game is spent in the puzzle world. Think of it like Hitman and your run of the mill puzzle game clash heads. Safe to say, I definitely enjoyed the puzzles (IE Murders) a lot more, action was too clunky and felt like it was tacked on.\n\nAnyways 7/10 Would try again.","February 4, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I assumed it'd basically parrot back a bunch of snarky remarks from the film and follow the same [Oddball Character Introduced > Conflict Arises > Oddball Not Such A Bad Guy > Oddball Makes Friends > Oddball Gives Up > Friends Rescue Oddball > Everyone Falls In Love With Everyone] plotline that every other Adam Sandler movie has followed. But the creator gives the story an interesting twist! (Except the ending. Your Uncle Tom has sex with everyone in the mansion and then the game ends, so that's kind of the same.) But in this game Adam Sandler actually plays a role other than Guy With Fart Machine! In this game, Adam Sandler is Malcolm McDowell. First, the conflict arises. Your jerk of a Dad, like, wants you to rule hell and stuff. But instead of being all, like, "BUT DAAAAD I DON'T WANNA RULE HELL! I WANNA PLAY WITH MY FART MACHINE!" Adam Sandler's all like "This works for me. Killing idiots is fun. Does this humanitarian gesture come with a dental plan?" Then comes the part where Adam Sandler WOULD prove he's a good guy. And then, this is crucial now...he's NOT a good guy. He starts killing people and they, like, want to be friends and stuff because he's got, like, a moonpie face. But Malcolm McDowell Sandler is like ADAM SANDLER DON'T NEED NO MAN and like stuffs people in light sockets and stuff. Oh my god it's so cool. And your grandpa's all like FAMILY BONDING IS IMPORTANT and Adam Sandler's like I AIN'T NO GRANDPA'S BOY and guts him like a saggy skinned old fish. Then would come the part where he would give up because the cops and church are like "I've never really been able to actually CONVICT anyone of a crime, but...process of elimination tells me that you must be the killer since, like...errbuddy ded lol" but does Adam Sandler give up and wait for his friends to save him? NO. Old Sandler might, but McDowell Sandler's crazy like a fox! He's all like GET IN THAT LIGHT SOCKET. And then the devil's all like BRO...I RESPEK YOU and then the game ends and you're, like, funny like Adam Sandler, but also not a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIn conclusion; this Adam Sandler is cooler than real Adam Sandler. So if you don't like Adam Sandler movies, that's ok because this one's better. If you do like Adam Sandler movies, but also liked The Happening, then this is good too because New Malcolm Sandler also has these, like, tree powers than let him tell disco fans and college kids to put their faces in woodchippers.\n\n8/10 Needs more Adrian.","November 24, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game does show the kills in detail, so if you don't like gore (even if it is mild gore)...you may want to reconsider.

It is a nice change to be playing the bad guy. You play as a child possessed by the devil who goes round systematically murdering everyone. The gameplay is mostly puzzle based, you search the house collecting objects that you can use to precipitate the horrific death of your next victim. There are a couple of stealth missions which are quite annoying but they are only a minor part of the game. It is not the most polished looking game. The characters fall a bit too much into the uncanny valley, which works for the creepy child protagonist but is not that great for the others. And it appears they never got round adding in an animation for how the child gets his tricycle up the stairs so he just rides up and down the stairs. These are minor complaints overall it is fun, gruesome and has a good story.","July 16, 2014","true","48.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole story is situated in one huge manor, and there are many cutscenes before and after "murder", so besides enjoying great "puzzle-solving" game-play, you also have a feeling like watching a movie, pretty sick movie about demonic child. Every death is unique and requires time to figure out how to manage it (some are quite tough).","July 24, 2014","true","49.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After this, the player has a few seconds to wipe the mind of the person who saw them, using the Mind Control-ability. Failing to do this in time results in losing the game and having to restart by the nearest checkpoint.\nLucius can walk/run around relatively freely in the manor and garden, although some areas are locked until further story progress is achieved.\nSpread around the house are many Christian crosses (the family must be very religious, considering the number of crosses!). These crosses have a negative effect on Lucius, as he can't use his powers near them. This is solved by turning the crosses upside-down.\nBy performing some small side-missions like taking out the trash or sort laundry, the player keeps up the appearance of a being a good boy and will also unlock some bonus gifts - including a tricycle which makes navigation of the manor a lot faster.\nThe player has an inventory where usefull objects found in the manor are stored for later use. Objects are usually used by clicking on them and then clicking on the place where they are supposed to be used.\nThere is also a map, for easier navigation of the big building.\n\nStory:\nWhen Lucius was born on the date of June 6th, 1966, nobody expected him to be anything other than a normal little boy.\nHis childhood, spent in the luxurious manor on the private estate of his father, a U.S. Senator, was as normal as every kid's young years, excluding the extreme wealth of his parents.\nThe night before Lucius turns six, the Devil appears in his mind and identifies himself as Lucius' "real father".\nThe Devil tasks his son with aiding the powers of evil in killing all members of the manor, collecting their souls to help the Devil get stronger.\nLucius kicks off this evil masterplan by murdering every member of his household, including staff, in order to obtain his father's vast fortune and make use of the political power associated with his name. The more people he kills, the more powerful Lucius will become.\nA police detective is investigating all the strange deaths and gets more and more baffled and confused by each strange death.\nAs the police gets closer and closer to discovering the dark truth, Lucius must harvest the remaining souls of the manor and keep his true nature hidden, before he is revealed...\n\nMy opinions:\nMy thoughts when I first saw this game was "Is this a game-version of "The Omen...?".\nAnd that thought may not have been so strange. Although Lucius has no confirmed connection to it, the game reminds a lot of the 1976 classic horror-film "The Omen".\nIt has borrowed most of the main plot outlines:\n1. Both works tell the story about a cursed boy who turns out to be the son of the Devil.\n2. Both works feature a rich and socially esteemed couple with one child, living in a manor.\n3. In both works, the boy in question has supernatural powers and uses them to kill people or cause problems in general.\n\nWith this said, I don't want to risk sounding negative; I love The Omen and thus liked this game for the similar story.\nAlthough this game has its flaws (minor bugs/glitches and bad voice-acting), my overall experience was positive.\nAlthough basing most of it's story and gameplay around a 40 year old movie, the game felt like a fresh idea and something worth trying out.\nThis turned out to be true, although I felt that the game was a tad short and could have had a deeper story.\nAlso, for being a horror game, I didn't find it particularly scary. The characters and events were pretty boring, and not very surprising, but the ominous musical score created a fitting sense of dread and succeeded in making some parts of the story quite creepy.\nEspecially sneaking around in the manor at night, with rain pouring down outside and thunder roaring felt really good.\n\nI will recommend this game to fans of The Omen and fans of Horror-games.\nEven though they lack any sort of official connection, I would also recommend watching The Omen before playing the game.\nThe stories are entirely different, so you won't have any spoilers by watching the movie first. :)","August 15, 2014","true","42.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
