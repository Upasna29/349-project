For all the interesting gameplay mechanics it has and the general enjoyment of other games from RPG developer Aldorlea Games, there are enough problems to warrant a skip for anyone looking to try out yet another fantasy-based RPG.\n\nWe all know the problems with RPGMaker. That software has allowed anyone with a will and a few hours to spare the ability to pop out a carbon-copy clone and put it on Steam, to the detriment of the genre as a whole. While I generally enjoy (and even love) Aldorlea's output, 3 Stars definitely ranks as one of the lowest in terms of enjoyment-to-grinding and the storyline.\n\nIt's not actually mentioned anywhere on the store page, but the game is a prequel to the Laxius Power/Laxius Force series, which were the first games released by Aldorlea back in the early 2000s. Those games had the same three characters, but were generally a lot more mature in their storytelling (for instance, characters swear, have sex, get married and lose their loved ones), even if they're incredibly dated because of the early RPGMaker graphics/blocky character models.\n\n3 Stars takes place years before the series, and has a god named Ozur kill a witch so he can find 3 prophecized leaders because of "reasons". At the same time, protagonist Random Pendragon sets out from his home on an adventure and meets Sarah (an elf) and Luciana (a enchantress), who learn about Ozur's plot and work to stop him before he can do any more damage to the world.\n\nThose relationships and camaraderie found in the Laxius games doesn't translate to this prequel. Random and Sarah spend the majority of the game pointlessly bickering and sniping at each other, while Luciana just sticks around seemingly to keep things from escalating further. There isn't a whole lot of variety to the characters you meet, and the plot itself feels less like a coherent story and more a series of random setpieces on the way to the final showdown.\n\nThe biggest problem I faced is twofold. For one thing, Aldorlea's RPGs have a lot of items and useful gear that are easily missed due to being hidden in secret rooms (see the Millennium series for a greater example of this), and if you don't have the requisite guide, you're pretty much out of luck. Secondly, there is no in-game map to track where you are or where you're going, and considering there are points where you have to backtrack long distances to complete a quest (and the level design is linear), it can become extremely frustrating to figure out where you're supposed to go. That latter point nearly put me off the game for good.\n\nHowever, I never actually finished the game. I got to a point just before the final battle where I was stuck in an area with few to no supplies, facing enemies who had a major difficulty spike and were wrecking my party easily. Faced with this problem, I quit the game and never went back.\n\nThat's not to say it's all bad, though. The battles are generally engaging and varied (despite an overreliance on enemies dropping status conditions on the party), there are a lot of interesting gameplay mechanics like the bond with your other party members strengthening depending on how long they stay in the active group, and there are some amusing setpieces during the late game.\n\nIn retrospect, however, I don't see a lot of people really getting invested in this one as much as some of Aldorlea's other games (and this is coming from someone who put 27 hours into this game).\n\n3 Stars of Destiny exists more as unrealized potential than an enjoyable prequel. You'd be better off trying the Millennium series for this kind of RPG action.","August 10, 2015","false","26.8"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","41","49","2","0"

This game looks like it would be the same, but do not be deceived, it is not. I tried to give it a chance, but the dreadful characters, the nonsensical way of doing things, the constant "poisoned/tired" cycle, the fact that you do not heal up when levelling up (wasn't that a thing once ?) and the way your characters express emotions in conversations (*chuckles* ? Could you not just have drawn a different portrait to show the emotional state of the one talking ? And while I am mentioning portraits..why do they look so weird ?) are quite off-putting.\n\nI've spent 3 hours in the game and this is what I experienced story-wise in wall of text form :\n\nIntro : Some God gets summoned to the home of a  witch. She tells him that there are 3 stars and he should suck out their bodily powers. The God is not convinced, but the witch throws out some valid arguments and he realizes, that sucking their bodily powers out is probably a good thing to do. He then kills the witch, but *chuckles* had forgotten to ask the witch who the stars were. That's why he's gonna create some sort of trap to catch them. End of Intro.\n\nYou are a guy with a serious attitude problem and have to bring some stuff to your parents. You meet an elven girl in front of your parents house, which leads to a conversation in which you express your dislike for her for no particular reason.\nShe then vanishes, you deliver the goods and decide to go look for her. You find her in a bathing suit and argue with her some more. You get attacked by the pond spirit. The elven girl helps you defeat the evil pond queen, which apparently was mad, because you saw the elven girl in her bathing suit. The elven girl vanishes again. You are going home.\nYour chameleon pet is missing and you're off to find it. You do find it and fight elves,who were apparently also mad that you saw the elven girl in her bathing suit. The elven girl helps you out and vanishes after some more arguing, but she is telling you to meet her in some cave.\nYou now know that she is your neighbour or something and you ask people where that cave is. You go to that cave. You meet her in the cave in a bathing suit, you argue with her. You fight a dragon with her. She vanishes again after more arguing.\nYou learn about some sort of trial to get enrolled in some sort of magical school for which you need a partner. You are called to visit your parents, who make you team up with the elven girl for that said trial. You both argue.\nYou are off to the trial, flipping lots of switches and meeting a living flame, which constantly says PEEKABOO. You kill a ghost. You let the girl touch the crystal, because your guy does not like pink. You finish the trial.\nYou have to duel 2 other guys to win the trial for good. You are the winner.\nYou are supposed to be taken on some sort of convoy to the school town, but your hero decides that he'd rather walk there on foot all by himself for no particular reason. You and the elf argue.\nYou are off to walk to the town, being pursued by the guards who were gonna escort you to the town, which you then proceed to kill. You narrowly escape, despite having killed them (at least I did, since they kept bumping into me over and over in an endless cycle of combat until they were gone for good)  and the girl breaks her leg. You argue.\nYou break into a witch hut and acquire something to help the girl's leg. You are being surprised by the witch, who is understandibly unhappy that someone broke into her hut. You kill the witch with no remorse. You help the girl out and there's more stupid banter.\nI quit the game.\n\nNow if any of that tickled your fancy, then go ahead, you will probably have fun in a grindy, weird way just like I put up with it for a while. But eventually you will realize, that matters do not seem to improve at all and you begin to question, why you're not playing one of your other 100 games instead. Or even one of the old SNES rpgs. So many choices, why would you go for this ? WHY ?","June 5, 2015","false","4.0"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","45","57","8","0"

Very similar to the likes of Aveyond which I finished a couple of months ago in that it is a party based RPG.  There was nothing really special about this game. All very samey throughout.\n\nI did find myself getting bored towards the middle of the game. You obviously need to spend a lot of time grinding levels in order to equip certain items you find in the game in order to progress past a certain boss, and it became quite tedious to grind on random spawn monsters when they rarely occur. This is a setting you select at the start of the game. If you want my advice, choose the option which will get you the most monster encounters, because you will need them\n\nThe text based dialog is also quite bad. All of the sentences seem so awkward to read out, and the games tries too hard to be funny when it quite clearly isn't.\n\nYou aren't missing out on much if you skip over this game. I will give it credit, it is a good length, a full playthrough took me 10 hours, but I would not recommend it at full price.","July 2, 2014","false","14.9"," 91 of 141 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","91","141","3","2"

I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for something fun and simple to play, while still having enough of a challenge to be interesting.  I found the characters charming and the interactions to be amusing and while the story wasn't amazing, it wasn't boring either.\n\nPros:\n+Nice selection of party members with different skillsets to appeal to any sort of playstyle.\n+Really lovely artwork in the battles\n+Character interactions are amusing and charming and you definitely can see some growth in the main characters as the quest progresses\n+Multiple difficulty modes with choices on encounter rates to please everyone.  Also the Rush selection can be great to quickly get through easier battles.  Enough challenge to make battles fun but not so much that one feels a need to grind.\n+Lots of optional sidequests and hidden things to find.\n+Love the friendship dynamic and how having certain people together in a party for a length of time can grant bonuses in battles and give you preemptive attacks.\n\nCons:\n-A bit on the short side, story is about 20 hours of play\n-A couple of broken achievements (though dev has been responsive via email about it)  Edit: As of 4/24/2015 the game no longer has broken achievements.\n-Some of the side characters feel tacked on and get little part in the overall story.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves old school styled RPGs and enjoys the RPG Maker style of graphics.  Personally, I adore the style of RPG Maker's graphics and do not consider that a fault.  The game tells a nice simple story of some fun characters and I had a blast playing it and look forward to playing some more of the dev's other games.","November 17, 2014","true","133.8"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","34","46","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Submarine_Argument/recommended/278530/","Submarine_Argument","Submarine_Argument","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Submarine_Argument/","397 products in account","Overall I liked 3 Stars of Destiny.   It is an oldschool style rpg with a mix of interesting characters and some humor.   The combat system is solid, it has good level design, lots of secrets, challenges, and achievements. With that being said, if you do not like snes style rpgs, there's probably not much I can do to convince you to like it.  You either like this style of game, or you hate it.  Nothing I'm typing here will change your mind if you hate RPG maker games. Please do note that unlike most reviews, I have actually completed the game.  I would say it takes a good 25-30 hours on regular difficulty.  On to the details...\n\nThe characters are unique without spoiling anything.   There are some interesting ones and later in the game you get to split up the party into 3 groups so choices do matter.  There's often funny banter between characters.  Gameplay is pretty standard for an RPG.  You will need to grind a bit to get some levels, but combat is pretty fun.  Money will be in short supply until late in the game, so grinding isn't too bad or painful.  There are also achievements and optional fights that are quite challenging.  The dungeons, both indoor and outdoor are pretty massive.   There are TONS of secrets and a lot of achievements and the game has replayability if you're inclined.   You can try a speedrun, beat it on hard mode, find all hidden areas, etc.   Also, if you do decide to get the game, without being a spoiler, be sure to check out the swamp area fully.  There is a missable character and dungeon if just blast through it hastily!\n\nThe one negative point I would mention about 3 stars is the plot.  I will admit the plot is weak and somewhat illogical at times.  I would say that the later levels feel almost surrealist in nature as far as the theme of different level areas.  If Salvador Dali created an RPG maker game, this might come close to it!   Due to this, I would say that I really prefer Aldorlea's other massive RPG, the Book of Legends, over 3 stars. TBoL has a more cohesive plot and a ton of characters so I would recommend you try that one first.\n\nSo what makes 3 stars worth it if the plot isn't that spectacular?    The gameplay and characters are both good and it's a very solid game overall.  Interaction between the characters is pretty funny at times and that keeps things interesting. Great dungeons, fun combat, some tough optional bosses give it the core of a good RPG.  Add in lots of replayability and steam achievements and trading cards and it's a good buy.  If you like Aldorlea RPGs, it's solid and a lot of fun.  If you're on the fence about this one, I'd say try The Book of Legends first for a more cohesive plot.   You can also download a playable demo of both games from Aldorlea's site that will let you play the full game for an hour, just to get an idea of the characters and style.  Hope this helps!","December 18, 2014","true","33.8"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","3"

If you dont like RPGMaker Games then this isn't for you. Personally I find the full maneuverablity with the mouse, story and graphics more appealing compared to older JRPG titles which can be cumbersome with their controls (except for Kemco on IOS). It does take about a good 3 hours to get into the meat of the story and battles and I personally found it rewarding onwards from the Mt Zulle Trials onwards.\n\nThe fact that you can choose what mode (Casual to Hard) and the Encounter Rate means that you can level up and play according to your style and preferences (I prefer Casual and a Normal Encounter Rate).\n\nThe characters are younger and this is relected in the storyline which I found has an innocence and humorous/playful tone. The game is massive in scope and it is the patient gamer who is rewarded. There are many secret rooms and items scattered about. Rush at your peril. Some of these are really great items, weapons, armour, stat boosts, money and quest items which can make a big difference to the game. Explore every nook and cranny.\n\nIf you are sometimes impatient like me there are many tips and walkthroughs available on the Aldorlea website. An easy way to switch between the game and a webpage is Alt + Tab.\n\nI still have a long way to go but am loving playing this again and highly recommend if you are after a fun, entertaining and great value RPG.","April 1, 2014","true","50.1"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","33","51","0","0"

I REALLY did. but 20 minutes in and I was completely disappointed not just with the experience the game was trying to provide, but with EVERYTHING. Starting off with one of the minor characters saying "(dies)", moving on to the main character being named "Random" (Seriously? "Random"? Naming your dog "Fluffy" is more creative) to even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with the inns. The items are expensive enough already, but then to have the inns charge half of your current amount just makes the problem so much worse.\n\nThe story was bull, Random's motivation for looking for the elf chick right at the start comes off as stupid at best and xenophobic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-ry at worst. Maybe I'm reading too much into that, but that's how it came off to me, personally. Add in a VERY generic and boring story, a just as weak battle-system exacerbated by very VERY low money drops, and I quit 20 minutes in.\n\nThe absolute worst thing you can do in a game is make somebody so bored that they not only ask "When does this get fun?" but bore them into quitting and swearing never to play the game again. I'm not kidding when I say that I don't even want to get the cards for this game, because it would mean having to keep it going for over two hours. And really, that's two hours I could spend playing just about any other game I own and having a better time. Approach with high caution if you wish, but prepare yourself for a lot of disappointment.

Of all the similar games, it has possibly most secrets and the most complex and challenging battles.\nIt's impossible to get most of it without multiple playthroughs and thorough playing. Secret rooms, one-chance quests and equip, bonus areas and challenges that can hardly be done without these secret weapons and well-trained characters (I'm talking about the hardest difficulty here, nothing else does the game justice.) and so on. Rush through it, and you get a decent game. But take your time, and it's awesome.\n\nP.s. Unlike most similar games, you can't save everywhere in 3SoD - this makes it feel more "old school".

Next it presents you with a short cut-scene of an unidentified creature slaughtering a witch and BAM...puts you right into the game with a protagonist named RANDOM. At first I thought maybe I skipped the name creation or the name generator broke or something so I actually GOOGLED this and confirmed that the character's name is indeed RANDOM.\n\nWhile I greatly appreciate games that slowly unveil the story as you proceed with the game but this vague, lazy and uninteresting tale right at beginning already killed off half my enthusiasm and hope.\n\nThe game itself, as you can see from the preview, is classic bit-mapped so don't expect much from the sound effect or tracks. The maps are filled with tonnes of flora, fauna, objects and while these makes the map looks lively, it is rather annoying because 99% of the time it blocks your path so often that literally killed the mouse input feature because the path finding is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nCombats are bland because you either easily whipped the enemy or you can die trying and it simply shows static images if your heroes and enemy with no animation of any sort (Yeah...shaking the image a little is not animation!). Event when your character is dying or beat up the image still shows the same static picture.\n\nI guess this is a typical RPGMaker product which I now will steer away at all cost!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI forgot to mention that the creator of this game did built in secret areas for you to explore as to keep exploration fruitful. What I loathe is that since this game is in 2-D, it is hard to determine if the area is passable or not. You practically needs to try to navigate through every corners which is a waste of time.\n\nAnd not that I have anything with the protagonist named RANDOM but I will appreciate if the game do make a proper introduction to the character to avoid confusion.

The three main characters are Random, Sarah, and Luciana the Mage, who are destined for a great power. Fate brings them together, as an Evil God, Ozur attempts to trap the hero's and steal their power. As is usual with RPG's, the game offers a mixture of random battle encounters, as well as an environment rich for exploration. There is a short interactive tutorial to help you get adjusted to the game and the learning curve is very low.  I found the storyline to be very interesting, the characters to be funny and there were many sidequests in addition to the main quests, which were fun to do. 3 Stars of Destiny is much more of an old school RPG, and reminded me of my days playing on the SNES.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stonysensei/recommended/278530/","Stonysensei","Stonysan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stonysensei/","1031 products in account","For an RPG Maker game, it is quite solid and as professionally put-together as any classic title from some of the major companies of the SNES era.  The story is only slightly lacking, but the characters are varied and interesting, the combat is engaging and challenging, so that even in normal mode, you can't just make it through by continually selecting the attack command.  And even outside of combat, you must strategize what to equip for different areas and especially certain boss encounters, as weapons and armor that are higher costing and have better stats on the surface are not always the best options.  My only complaint, and it's not much of one, is that I feel as though the game goes into the final stretch too soon after I've gathered together my last few party members, and once you cross the threshold, there's no going back until you defeat the final boss.  This means either you'll have to grind for a few levels and to buy the best equipment for the last two or three members, or you simply avoid using them.  However, the game doesn't end with the final boss.  You get an ending, certainly, but you can keep playing, and there are higher challenges and more secrets to uncover afterward.  I personally don't like the trend of modern RPGs of making the final boss not the most difficult battle in the game.  On the other hand, it does increase replayability.  Another thing that increases replayability is that you can download three custom save games from the creators themselves, one of which adds a hardcore 'Nightmare' difficulty level, but allows you to start with the Goddess Yveen (formerly unplayable, but a large part of the story) as your party member.  Another gives you access to all playable characters in the game (except the goddess) at the beginning, all at experience level 1.  And the third save state starts you off at the beginning as normal, except for the main character being at level 55.  If you love retro JRPGs, then you will love this game.","March 15","true","122.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

These are among the very best of this style, and this particular offering is no exception. It is outstanding and exceptional.\n\nThe story in these games is fundamentally important, and this one is masterfully done. It is intriguing and very captivating with very good humor as well. It takes only a little time to find yourself absorbed in this nicely detailed fable. Characters have good depth, and the plot development is well done.\n\nScenes in the game have a great deal of nice color, and there are tons of places ready for exploration. There is a handy and nicely done tutorial for those who might need it. This one will take a little time ---- with all there is to explore, secrets to discover, and quests to complete. And, now, with this next playthrough for me, 50 Steam Achievements! ---- it will be a virtually brand new experience for me.\n\nSo, if you are a fan of this type of game and have somehow missed out on the offerings from Aldorlea, do yourself a favor and try this one (or, really, any of the Aldorlea games now at Steam). You will not be disappointed.","June 4, 2014","true","0.2"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

The music is really well done and its easy to see that the devs have put their heart into making this game same as the other games from Aldorlea games.  The great thing about these guys is that they put time and effort into making good rpgs.  Alot of people may be turned off when they see its an rpg maker game but trust me if its made by Aldorlea games they have put alot of effort into it.  Now we will get into the pros and cons.\n\nPro.\nExcelent music and Ambience.\nDecent gfx.  it is an rpg maker game so your not going to get ff13 / COD level of gfx but still really good job on Aldorlea for puting time and effort into making it look as good as it does. The humor can be a bit of a pro and negative sometimes its funny and then other times it can be a bit childish but in general I like it.\n\nCon.\nIt is made with rpg maker so options are very limited music only has a yes or no so you cant turn up or down the volume in game.  But its easy enough to do that with your sound mixer.\n\nIn the end I can say most games made by these guys are decent to very good from what ive seen. They care about the product they put out the devs seem very friendly.

If the appeal of levelling a character, while walking around some fairly lush and well-thought-out landscapes appeals to you - or indeed the simple mechanics of character levelling - then you'll probably rather enjoy this title.\n\nIf, like me however, you prefer a game that hinges on good storytelling and drama, then you'd best look elsewhere - for the plot is about as thin as a pair of aged underpants.\n\nIn a nutshell, this game is about an Orc who tries to suck powerful energy from three teenagers (no, really) - but in order to do so must lure them to an alternative dimension where he can directly interact with them. THEN THE PLOT DISAPPEARS FOR 3/4 OF THE GAME while you guide the protagonist through a series of pointless trials in order to go to a well-to-do school in a town called Rillia. A school, that even when you do manage to find it - you only attend a single 'lesson' (Go and obtain some mushrooms a-la any MMORPG you care to mention) - then you get kicked out. THEN SUDDENLY THE PLOT REOCCURS.\n\nIt's a shame, as it's at that point where the plot picks up again that the game actually starts to shine - some real JRPG elements creep in, and it feels a lot more solid - and is by far the best portion of the game, though I am not sure how many will stick around to find out.\n\nA game which shows great potential, but falls down on plot - or lack thereof.","November 14, 2014","false","23.7"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","15","29","0","0"

It looks pretty enough, even for RPGMaker, and the enemy design is competant. You have some choices as to difficulty settings, and the ability to pick the encounter rate is a nice touch.\n\nOn the other, the main character is named *ehem* RANDOM (the caps lock is how they spell it in game, I wish I was kidding) who is an irredeemable monstrosity of tropes and unnecessary arseholishness towards all the women he meets, while dropping weird 4th wall breaking references to common plot devices used in far better games. The spelling is awful, the plot is weak, the maps are confusing, and the plot is so poorly put together I question the two actual hours I put into this. This is the only review I have done where I haven't played a good portion of it, but I decided to spare myself the torture for once after learning that this game is far longer than it should be. My counter may say 14, but I genuinely forgot I had this game on when I went to sleep. The best thing I got out of this game was the trading cards, and I did that by accident.\n\nThis game is by no means offensive, but for RPGMaker which already has a bad reputation on Steam, it is yet another of why there is so much stigma surrounding it. There is definitely an audience for this kind of game and I am glad they enjoy it, but for me, I have no desire to waste any more time on this than I have to. 3 Stars is at its very best when none of the characters are talking, which is excessively rare, but I think you should take it a step further and make sure this game doesn't become a part of your Steam library.","November 30, 2014","false","14.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

What's important, and my most biggest ISSUE with the game, is the lack of, micro-transactions. I would prefer to use REAL money when needing to heal.

The unoriginality and terrible writing in this game pains me. There are achievements that are permanently bugged that they've never fixed. Even the badges look like they've been drawn by a child with crayons. The music sucks.\n\nIf you do like RPG maker games, I beg you to find something else.

It’s not just the story, it’s the game play, the range of gear and skills, the variety of strategies needed, the side quests if you choose to do them.  All of these together make an interesting, sometimes really challenging, but always enjoyable experience.\nIf you like exploring you’re going to enjoy this game.  It gives you decent rewards for going off the main path, not just chests with excellent gear and obvious items, but also secret rooms, and interesting and more challenging enemies, and the chance to recruit an extra member of the party. In short, this game is utterly enjoyable and I highly recommend it for all those who enjoy a good (though sometimes hard) puzzles, quirky characters, nice story line and classic rpg game play.","March 29, 2014","true","32.1"," 31 of 77 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","31","77","0","3"

As usual you should avoid anime lest it infect you. This also looks suspiciously RPG Maker so that's a whole other layer of funk on top of it. Also everyone knows there's only ever ONE magical wishing star that changes your destiny, going for three is just another example of anime decadence. Also probably contains panties.","January 14, 2015","false","4.3"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","5","22","2","0"

Dawnfact","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aeuxgof/","106 products in account","This is an incredible prologue to an incredible series. Thought it may not be world-famous, it certainly should be. Laxius Power is one of the most loved RPG Maker 2000 games of all time in my opinion. If you've played LP or Laxius Force, you definitely need to play this to see how the Laxius Team met. As for people who have never heard of the Laxius games, boy are you in for a treat. After you play this, google Laxius Power 1, 2, and 3, (free)  and then play Laxius Force 1, 2, and 3 (commercial) for one of the longest sets of trilogies other than Final Fantasy.\n\nThis game (3 Stars) is itself graphically superior to the LP series, and has beautiful music and nice art, as it was made in the past couple of years. Random Pendragon is one of my favorite swordsman characters, and Coryool my favorite drunk. I especially liked how the relationship between Sarah and Random unfolded.  (I played this game before I had it on Steam, so I am able to write a review even with 0 hours played)","March 30, 2014","true","0.1"," 17 of 54 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","17","54","0","0"

I have tried to keep this spoiler free as to give you guys the chance to play it without any idea of what happens however if you want to know my first thoughts as I play the game I will leave a link to a video I did on it.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/zyQri41IyEw","March 29, 2014","true","2.2"," 17 of 57 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","17","57","0","0"

I remember spending hours and hours on some of the best old school RPGs out there, and Indinera's (aka Damien) works are not exception. That's actually where my username comes from - Laxius Power, the series that started it all. I highly recommend starting from Laxius Power 1, 2, and 3 in order to get a better feel of how the main story comes around (it's free, so it's easy to google it), although 3 Stars of Destiny takes you even before then :) Basically, in chronological order, it's 3 Stars --> Laxius Power --> Laxius Force. All I can say is this: try it out! I can honestly say that I'm proud to have been a member of the LP community and play such fun and exciting games alongside so many others :)","March 28, 2014","true","34.6"," 35 of 131 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","35","131","0","10"
