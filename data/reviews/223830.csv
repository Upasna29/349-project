There were many moments that had me mumbling at my screen in frustration or outright had me getting up from the computer, going to the gym, and lifting things up then putting them down over and over again to get the angst out.\n\nIt was incredibly frustrating to have some of my wet-behind-the-ears soldiers survive a few missions and pulverize some Xeno scum, only to watch them get one shot by a well placed shot or devoured by a Reaper I didn't plan for. Cover isn't intuitive (or at least for me it wasn't) and there were multiple times I took position only to watch the alien turn, smirk at me, then plant a plasma bolt square between the eyes of one of my soldiers. Refer back to the rage and lifting portion.\n\nEventually, after epic (and possibly unhealthy) amounts of nerd rage and QQ'ing over cheating alien scum, how insanely difficult breaching UFOs is (Corvettes! I'm specifically hating on you!), and having to make aggrevating economic decisions... I learned from my mistakes (gasp!), had to learn to accept losses, and got better.\n\nI actually started using squad level tactics like hugging walls, throwing down smoke grenades if I absolutely had to turn a blind corner with no indication of what could be waiting on the other side, NOT sprinting down the middle of the street with my entire squad, then getting upset that I got sniped from a random window, making liberal use of explosives even if it meant I lost some money breaching UFOs, and generally just accepting I'm supposed to be out gunned.\n\nThe game is remarkably well paced, freakishly so. Due to the ticker implementation RIGHT when you finally have outfitted your fighter jets or soldiers with the appropriate gear new bigger, badder aliens show up that almost make your hard fought gains obsolete. One step forward, two steps back is a common theme throughout the game that makes you BETTER because you have to actually think about WTF you're doing and why.\n\nI'm a father of three, married, and I have a job that has me at work anywhere from a standard 40 hours a week to almost 60, so it took me a month to get through the game. I guess I could've used the common complaint/logic "I don't have that kind of time" or "I want something I can sit down and beat in a few days" but this was far more rewarding. Yes, there were days where after a 12 hour shift I certainly didn't come home and boot up any games, but the time invested was worth it.\n\nI'm glad I stuck with Xenonauts despite my initial frustrations and will be putting many more hours into it either by tweaking the config file or by downloading mods. I actually tried playing XCOM: EU again and couldn't bring myself to do it.\n\nIf you've made it through the wall of text (hurray!) I guess I'd split it into three categories:\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Excellently designed game that gives you total freedom, no ♥♥♥♥ty tutorials shall be thrust on you here.\n\n-The pacing is genius! I don't know how long it took them, but the game ups the difficulty at the right moment. (unless you're playing bad, then you'll never catch up)\n\n-Soldiers have no role, you determine what they do based on what equipment you give them. Have a guy with high TU (action points)? Make him your scout! Have a guy with amazing accuracy but maybe his HP is kind of low? Sniper! Found a meat shield with high HP and incredible strength, but he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn at point blank range with a fully automatic weapon? Give him a metal shield and let him be a bullet sponge! Or don't do any of those things, it's up to you.\n\n-Aliens appropriately out tech you through out pretty much the entire game. You genuinely feel an overwhelming sense of dread as you play the game.\n\n-You will take losses, but that doesn't mean you'll lose the game. You can have pretty substantial set backs and still come out on top. (kind of like how life is!)\n\n-Using squad level infantry tactics ACTUALLY works and is necessary.\n\n-Well thought out tech tree and research progression.\n\n-You can mod and edit the crap out of the game to your liking.\n\n-Music is well done and adds to the setting.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-Even on Easy this game will be too much for a lot of people. This will be viewed as an "elitist" comment, but I think that's more indicative of the gaming industry as a whole and not to Xenonaut's detriment. Nintendo games were soul crushingly difficult and only had one mode, now many games I can hand my six year old that he can beat without having to read any of the text.\n\n-Still some glitches/bugs, namely shooting through walls. It doesn't happen too often, but it can make a huge difference to how that one map will play out.\n\n-The game doesn't explain a lot of the mechanics adequately. This can amplify frustration or make it more rewarding as you progress, depends on your perspective.\n\n-Mind control late game is a bit out of whack. I thought it added a great deal of intensity and dread, but it was depressing to watch two of my colonels that had managed to survive +30 missions get possessed and murder each other. I think it's a great (and necessary) part of the game, but still needs tweaking in either lower % success rate (which you can do yourself) or a turn delay the same way Wraiths can't teleport and shoot in the same turn.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n-Graphics. Eventually they grew on me, but it was admittedly jarring at first.","July 22, 2014","true","101.6"," 383 of 394 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","383","394","6","6"

It's greatest strength is that it's X-com. It's greatest weakness is that it's X-com.\n\nIf you're an older gamer, played the original X-coms, and just wanted them to get a graphics update and maybe some mods on being able to better organise your units and maybe a few updates, look no further. You've found it.\n\nIf you don't know what this "X-com" business is about, both X-com and Xenonauts are tactical and strategic games where you defend earth from an alien invasion through a specialised organisation and squad who deals with the aliens.\nYou'll respond to the aliens by shooting down the UFOs using regular human fighter aircraft, and then landing a squad of soldiers with just plain old human guns near them to clear out the survivors. After that, you'll begin to research better technology. Laser rifles, faster aircraft to take down the UFOs, armour that protects from the alien weaponry, and so on.\n\nYou will meet several different kinds of aliens, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and figure out why they're invading. But most importantly, you're going to stop them. You're going to take all their technology and make it your own, and you will end up with several bases across the world to find, and destroy any intruders who push into your atmosphere.\n\nAs for the changes between this and X-com, they are mostly good. You have an airstrike option on alien crash sites so that you don't need to do everything or have them expire when you've been too busy dealing with other sites, though it will provide you with far less rewards than if you send in a squad of soldiers. There are new pieces of equipment, such as the shield. You'll no longer need to micromanage every last clip or laser battery in your arsenal and order the construction of small things like two laser batteries - Just keep track of the ones you bring into combat so you don't run out. There are now more involved air battles, along with air terror sites. And cover, along with range, now actually provides a bonus or penalty to your shots. You don't have to worry about this turning into a chest high wall simulator though, it works out well and you don't have to stay in cover. It's just a suggestion that increases your soldiers' lifespan. There are some others but they are mostly positive. One I'd say is slightly negative is that you can not land on a UFO and blast a hole in the ceiling to enter it as you could in the original X-com, though if you never played that game(And even if you did), you might not even notice that option isn't there.\n\nMechanics wise, it works out very similar to X-com, with an isometric view and tile based map. I've found some maps had too little vertical space sometimes but often this wasn't a big problem, the controls are pretty good, mainly just using your mouse to command your units.  It's turn based, with a world map to place your bases on and do your air battles, and a base overview where you can build out your base by modular rooms.\nInterestingly, I've found that the difficulty settings actually changes AI behavior, rather than the lazy way of just giving the AI more armour or damage. I'm not sure if it also gives the aliens more stats or makes it more difficult to get money for the player, but the fact difficulty settings actually improve the AI is something that many AAA games completely fail at.\n\nIn the end, it's X-com. It has most of the strengths of X-com, but it also has the flaws of X-com. You may need to restart several times if you're new and you might get discouraged. A random lucky shot could kill off your best soldier and send the nearby rocket launcher guy into a berserk panic state right into your own squad. If you're not used to it, you'll wonder just how long the campaign keeps going and it may turn into a game of 'whack-a-UFO' for you with slow or barely noticable progress. Or you may simply not have a clue what's going on until the aliens are already in a better position than you.\n\nEven then, it's a very good game. I would say it's worth grabbing it at some point if you want to see what the fuss is about, or because you want some more of the X-com from long ago (Without looking at Interceptor or Enforcer for now)","October 31, 2014","true","70.7"," 373 of 385 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","373","385","7","1"

Its both pleasing to the eye and has excellent clarity, all the information you need at the tip of your eyeballs and fingers to make the best strategic and tacticle decisions to defeat the disgusting xeno threat.\n\nThe gameplay is heavily inspired by the bygone days of the past, with enough updates, improvements and modernizations that streamline the drudgery of the past (like the micromanagement intense menu screens of the original X-Com that are themselves evoke thoughts of Dwarf Fortress un-modded) into a lighter area by trimming back the intensity of the learning curve (such as buying ammo, etc) leaving the player with the same amount of depth and variety without leaving newer players in quicksand googling guides.\n\nIf you're looking for a game where no one dies, aliens are made of paper and losing is impossible - look elsewhere. Your best men can be cut down like wheat by the advanced alien troops, who can at times seem to be made out of 40ft thick brick walls with angry faces painted on them.\n\nThe risk of having your best men enhances the gameplay so much more than I would have thought, I truly cared about each soldier and shook my fist at the alien menace when my important men were gunned down mere feet from the landing craft.\n\nTheres a lot to this game, and if you're still on the fence there are plenty of videos on Youtube of people playing it - go look there and you'll find some great gameplay videos for the most part!\n\nJust be wary, some of the videos are old and may be on outdated builds that have bugs which no longer exist in this release and if I do have anything negative to say about this game its that it isn't a fully polished release and bugs do crop up from time to time, the majority of which aren't gamebreaking but once in a while I've seen a bug cripple someones game despite myself not having seen one.","February 8, 2014","true","19.2"," 300 of 328 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","300","328","0","16"

This is clearly visible by the amount of games that tried to mimic its gameplay like Altar’s UFO series or UFO Extraterrestrials and XCOM Enemy Unknown to name a few. Still some people were not satisfied by the above and wanted to recreate the know experience to their liking. One such project is Xenonauts.\n\nMy first encounter with this game was not a rather positive one. I saw it at a friend. The game was half finished with tons of missing graphics and an unfinished campaign. After this experience I forgot about this game for several months until some sale on Steam and since I had some extra cash I gave the game a second chance (I’m a sucker for his kind of gameplay and own every commercially released UFO game and their clones for PC).\n\nThe game itself is almost a direct clone of UFO: Enemy Unknown though there are several differences. Setting wise, the game is set in 1980’s during the cold war. As a bonus to the game you get a free novella in a PDF format, titled “Crimson Dagger” by Lee Stephen, which serves as an introduction to the game setting and describes in detail the first human contact with the aliens (quite a nice read). Apart from the setting, the most obvious difference is seen as soon as you start the game – there is no rotating globe, just a flat map of the earth. Than again the graphic design of the game is very nice, esthetic and functional. The core gameplay is identical to the original – you start with one base, some interceptors, a troop transport, soldiers, scientists and engineers and slowly advance the story by assaulting shot down or landed ufos, researching alien tech, acquiring new weapons, armor, craft and vehicles up until the final mission when you save the earth for good. And this all works pretty well. A nice touch is the casualties counter which track the number of people killed due to alien activities and also the on map reports of various event like forest fires, tidal waves, strafing runs ets. which might help to track a ufo outside of radar range. Some people might not like that certain parts of the game are more streamlined. There is no need to buy the basic weapons or ammunition, for both soldiers and jets. All is provided free and in unlimited quantity. Furthermore, jets have a fixed set of armaments per jet type and all upgrades to weapons installed on them are done automatically after researching certain technology, also free of charge. This take a lot of base management of ones mind though it comes at a price in ingame currency. First, funds are scares and getting stuff from ufos for sale is a must. Second, loosing a country is quite easy as building a new base is expensive, not to mention the prices for manufacturing new craft, armor or weapons for you troops. Furthermore, there is no possibility of self funding your efforts by selling weapons that you manufacture as the selling prices are way below the production costs.\n\nAs for the combat part of the game, there are two types – dog fighting ufos in the air and ground combat in the form of assaulting grounded ufo, alien bases or defending cities in terror missions. The air combat is the part I like the least about this game. Its done with a pseudo radar view of the situation where a squadron (1 to 3 jets) you sent to deal with a ufo is under your direct command in an RTS like manner. You have to manage the position of your craft, range of your and enemy weapons, represented by cones projected from craft silhouettes, fuel reserves and craft health. The key it to either take out the enemy with your long range missiles or to try to get you planes in the ufo’s blind spot and use you short range weapons. If you get in trouble you can press special keys to dodge incoming fire or use the afterburners to fly quicker but use more fuel. If things get nasty, you can order your jets off the combat field and run away. All in all I’m very glad that the creators of the game gave players the option to auto resolve this part of the game. For me it’s a blessing as I really didn’t like this particular air combat system.\n\nThe ground combat, on the other hand, is done extremely well. The graphics are sharp, clean and present different types of object on the map in a way that players will immediately understand. The animations of units, both your and aliens are nicely done and you rarely have problems distinguishing units one from another. Terrain sets are varied and depict farmlands, cities (in Eastern European, US and middle east styles), military bases, forests and sub-polar regions. The alien craft themselves are varied and interesting on their own. The combat itself is done in turns using a time units system for performing actions. What is nice is that the game will inform you how many points an action costs before performing it (e.g. little numbers by the target indicator before a shot is fired) or how many time units will be left after moving a desired distance. Furthermore, a cover system is implemented, not unlike the XCOM Enemy Unknown, which has to be always taken into consideration when positioning your troops. It works by reducing chance to hit a target that is obstructed by a peace of cover, be it a bush, a fence or a fridge inside a kitchen (the game show which objects reduces the to hit chance by how many %). But its done only when you actually want to take a shot and you never know how good your soldiers cover actually is. Another interesting feature is the suppression system. Every weapon has a chance of suppressing an opponent and machineguns excel at that. A suppressed unit immediately looses all time units it currently had (especially dangerous when your soldier is suppressed by reaction fire), and on their next turn their starting time units are reduced by half. Add riot shields to the mix, which soak up damage very nicely and leave one hand free to fire a pistol or use a stun baton, and you can get a lot of combat options unavailable even in other remakes. On the down side, grenades have no primer regulation. Regular ones explode at the end of the turn while smoke or stun ones immediately after they land on the ground. Additionally, in certain situations the units can get behind object which the game engine does not make transparent. This is annoying as it is difficult to position your men to you liking or you can just “loose” them on the battlefield and not use them for a turn or two. But still, tactical combat should satisfy most of the old UFO fans. As with the air combat, there is also an option not to go and clean up a shoot down ufo and just air strike it. This way you get a fixed amount of cash, dependent on the ufo type. The downside is that you don’t get any special resources from the ufo and after performing a ground mission you always get more cash.\n\nLastly, sound and music. As for the sound design all is done OK. Every alien, weapon, action has its own distinct sound and after w few hours into the game you will know what happened just by the sound produced, which is especially important in ground combat missions. The part that made a really big impression on by was the music, especially the one in tactical missions. For some time I was looking for a good modern version of the track played on the original – this creepy midi, with a heart beat motif and loads of strange sounds accompanying it. Well, Xenonauts delivered 11 very good tracks made by Aleksi Aubry-Carlson which you can linsten  here [aleksiaubrycarlson.bandcamp.com]. Ground Combat Day 2 is the one I had looked for.\n\nAll in all I am really happy with my purchase of Xenonauts. It’s a very good take on the classical UFO formula, faithful to the original concept but still bringing its own setting and story that drive you forward to uncover the alien secrets and save the earth once more.","June 17, 2014","true","69.0"," 299 of 328 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","299","328","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/starvingpoet/recommended/223830/","starvingpoet","Starving Poet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/starvingpoet/","260 products in account","First off, air combat is great - I mean, finally - this has always been a very important part of these games and it irked me that XCOM 2012 pretty much ignored it.  Here it's way more important, plays better, and has a much better consequence spiral.\n\nI wanted to like this game - I have hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in the original X-COM games.  I've finished TFTD on superhuman ironman.  I've played a ballistics only UFO Defense... I even made my way through XCOM Interceptor...\n\n<edit>  Before we go any further, I want to add a little edit since many of the comments are critical about how I can thumb down a game even though I have 120 hours into it - The short answer is:  I should really like this game, it seems perfect on paper, but I didn't and I wanted to know _why_.\n</edit>\n\n♥♥♥♥ this game though - and for one simple reason - the Aliens always know where you are.   And this isn't the X-COM: EU type of alien squadsight where if they see one troop, they can see all your troops.   This is where if you are within range of an alien, even one that's never looked outside the UFO, it triggers a special AI.   This is the kind where if you have a wall between you and an alien, the alien will be facing you through the wall.\n\nRemember how in TFTD there would be those little closets where aliens would get stuck because of a pathing bug?  And to kill that last alien you'd have to either eat up its reaction fire with rookies or blow through the walls from another direction?  Well, this is half of the aliens in this game.  And you can't blow through the walls.  UFO breaches, depending on the layout, are either brutal or tedious.   Most of the time the aliens will just sit behind the door in their command center, full TUs, waiting to reaction fire as soon as you make a move.   And that's nothing compared to alien base assaults.\n\nJesus effing Christ - the beginning of the assault are fun - about a third of the aliens on the map will make their way to the LZ and try to push you out.  The next phase is classic XCOM - carefully make your way to the control room, removing opposition as you go.  The last phase is just mind-numbing tedium - 1/3 of the aliens in the base are sitting in a single room, barely moving so they can keep their TU high for reaction fire.  Problem is that there's something like a 60% chance that if they hit your fully armored guys, they will kill you in one hit.  They, on the other hand - take 3-5 hits, on average to take out.  Now, add in the lovely 'Dread' effect and half your team will have 30% of their TUs removed.  Just 'cause.  It's like they combined the worst parts of all the XCOM games - Alien PSI spam, Lobstermen Bullet Sponges, XCOM 2012 projectile/cover dynamics, Apocalypse AI camping - and they put it all into a single room.\n\nThen we can talk about LOS issues - they are everywhere.  The number of times I have gotten shot (or have shot) through a wall is ridiculous.  Or aliens shooting through solid obstacles from the fog of war.  Or sitting in the middle of a roof and having an alien along the wall of the building be able to hit me.  How about trying to throw a grenade over a knee-hgh wall, only to realize that you don't *throw* grenades so much as you fire them in a direct line from your chest.\n\nMoving past the map issues, the way ballistics work is just broken.   In the original X-COM, you shoot a bullet, it will fly in a straight line until it hits something (Wall, scenery, alien, back of your team mate's head) or it goes off the map.  It's simple, it worked - your accuracy percentage was your chance to hit a target at 20 tiles, that accuracy determined the size of the cone the bullets leaving your weapon would travel.   The game didn't care what you were shooting at, just put the bullets in that cone and they did what they did - whether it was boring a hole through a house or taking down a floater.  Here, you have a) a chance you'll hit the alien (XCOM 2012) and b) a chance to hit anything in the way. (XCOM 94)\n\nLet's say that you're shooting at an enemy with a LMG.  There's a bale of hay between you and the enemy, but you know that your LMG can shoot down that hay bale if you get 2-3 shots into it.  So, you force target the alien and the first 3 rounds of your 10 round burst do indeed destroy the obstacle between you and the bad guy.  You expect to see the 7 remaining bullets proceed to kill or even just supress the alien on the other side.  Unfortunately, the remaining 7 rounds just *poof* disappear, stopping where the hay bale used to be because that chance to hit an alien is determined before the first shot is made.  That's the XCOM 2012 binary hit / miss calculation ♥♥♥♥ing everything up.  Even if you have a clear path between you and the alien, the bullet will still disappear at the alien's square and you'll get a *miss* text pop up over the alien's head.  It won't continue past them on these occasions, possibly hitting the explosive barrels on the tile directly behind them, just another *poof*.  That game said you had 95% chance to hit that alien, and even if your bullet had perfect dead-center trajectory, that 5% will kick in and eat that bullet.\n\nOh, and sidenote - dread is the worst game mechanic ever introduced.","November 8, 2015","false","135.7"," 827 of 988 people (84%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","84","827","988","60","40"

Sure, it doesn't have the eye-popping 3D graphics of the current XCom games, but what it's lacking there it more than makes up for in challenging gameplay.  And by challenging, I don't mean aliens picking you apart while you hide in full cover and wonder what the point was.  The aliens here will find ways to flank you with the same type units that at other times often would hole up defensively instead.  Sometimes it takes carefully placed explosives / flashbangs / stun gas into an area just to give you a leg up vs. them.  It is also a difficult game to master in terms of having a good gameplan finance-wise.  Will you spend a pile of your initial funding on science research to get a better technological balance vs. your foe, or will build extra hangars to combat the increasing ufo assault?  How much of that funding will go to engineers to help you build better weapons & vehicles quickly enough to be of real use, and how much of it will you spend on soldiers to have enough to stop terror missions while still defending your own base?  Or I should say, 'bases', because one will not be enough, as the threat is ongoing and everywhere.  It's a fine line to walk (and I'm just talking about normal difficulty here).\n\nSo if you get distracted easily, or you're looking for a lot of gloss and entertaining Wow - factor, this game might not be for you.

By that I mean that the developers attempted to recreate the original X-Com as faithfully as possible (while at the same time improving on the classic's flaws) but had to use a different setting, considering they don't own the rights to the X-Com franchise (hence the "spiritual" aspect). What is the result of said remake? Simply put, the best X-Com game that I have ever played. Xenonauts succeeds admirably at perfecting the formula that made the original game a timeless classic, and while it does have a few flaws, it is nonetheless a fantastic turn-based strategy game. It also brings forth a very nice artistic design, and streamlines the original's cumbersome UI, thus successfully bringing the original concept into the modern era of gaming.\n\nIn Xenonauts, you act as the commander of the titular organization tasked with defending the Earth against an alien invasion set in a Cold War-era setting. The game is divided into three separate components: a real-time administration simulation with 4X and sandbox elements where you manage the bases of your organization (assigning all kinds of tasks such as research, manufacturing of equipment, and building of annexes) and monitor for UFO activity in a map of Earth; a real-time with pause minigame where you engage UFOs with your interceptor aircraft; and a turn-based strategy component where the actual combat against the aliens happens. This last mode is where the meat of every X-Com game lays, and in the case of Xenonauts, I'm happy to state that said combat missions are every bit as challenging, tense and satisfactory as they were in X-Com: UFO Defense. Furthermore, the turn-based combat has been largely improved from the original, featuring more deep, complex mechanics, a wider array of weaponry and artifacts, and a healthy dose of streamlining where it was needed.\n\nYou have to keep in mind that this is a very challenging and difficult game. Every choice you make has consequences, and actions are irreversible. Furthermore, if you play on Ironman (a mode which I recommend activating from your very first playthrough, as these kind of games are clearly designed to work that way) you will not be able to reverse to a previous save state. You'll have to learn to go on with your choices, both good and bad, and I can't emphasize how fulfilling it is to achieve victory in these conditions. Remember though that if one of your soldiers dies, they're gone. Forever.\n\nA rather notorious addition that Xenonauts made to the X-Com formula is the air combat. As I mentioned earlier, this is a real-time with pause minigame where you direct your aircraft against the UFOs in a radar-like interface, trying to maximize the damage you deal to them while avoiding their deadly attacks as much as possible. While I think this mode is far from perfect, as many times I felt it was a bit shallow, it is nonetheless a huge leap from UFO Defense's barebones interception system, and I think it succeeds in getting the job done.\n\nThe only real complaint I have with Xenonauts is with the way that psionic attacks works. This was a huge flaw in the original X-Com, as psionic abilities were hugely overpowered. In Xenonauts, they tried to fix this by making psionics unavailable to humans and making it a bit less powerful in aliens. Unfortunately, the result is that many times you feel completely powerless against psionic attacks, as there's no research that allows to counter it (something like the Mind Shields in XCOM: Enemy Unknown would have helped a lot in making it a fairer mechanic). Still, it's not a game breaking flaw, and the game it's still an excellent one even with the annoyance it poses.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don't see any reason not to recommend this game to everyone interested in a deep, complex, and tactical experience. For classic X-Com fans, this is a no-brainer, and for newcomers the lower difficulties are forgiving enough to make learning the basics of the game a smooth experience (keep Ironman mode activated though, that's the way to play this, in my opinion). Go for it.","July 22, 2015","true","110.7"," 175 of 191 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","175","191","3","0"

But it was also known, among people who played it much, for its annoying idiosyncracies and irritations.  Xenonauts does away with many of these, simplifying things while keeping much of the difficulty.  For example, you can define soldier classes that have no game effect, but allow you to set default equipment.  Standard-issue gear costs nothing and takes up no space, because a base commander has better things to do than count rifle clips.  Base defenses are automatically upgraded, because really, who wants to rebuild base components every time you research a new tech?\n\nSome things are harder: The tech tree seems to keep things a little more out of reach, and funding is absolutely brutal.  Some things are easier: Riot shields.  Oh my God, riot shields.  Instead of ablative rookie shields, lead your squad with a guy with a shield and a pistol.  Why the hell didn't we have these in the original X-Com.  It feels so good (and it won't help at all when a Chryssalid, or whatever they call them in Xenonauts, comes knocking).  Also, if you crash an interceptor, your engineers will recover it and put it back together in a week or so.  Losing an expensive ship near the beginning of the game is no longer painful enough to make you want to start over.\n\nA personal favorite feature of mine is airstrikes.  Are there four small crashed UFOs on the map at once?  Do you need cash?  Do you cringe at the thought of playing them all out?  Just hit the airstrike button and the local military will blow it away, recover the scrap, and pay you for your donation...less than you'd get from a raid, but well worth the savings of player time.  Also, intercepting alien ships is pretty rad.  New dimension that X-Com never had, and it might not be your thing; you order your planes around in realtime, outflanking and gunning down the enemy with nifty fields of fire.  Personally I could take it or leave it, but there's an autoresolve button, and since you can recover crashed ships it won't instantly ♥♥♥♥ you over!\n\nIf you've ever heard me complain about Galactic Civilizations II, you know I hate bad humor, especially in tech trees.  I know...I'm weirdly specific that way.  Well, your lead scientist in Xenonauts has an irritating intellectual superiority complex, but it's written *just right*, enough that you get a wonderful, subtle characterization just from the tech reports, no cutscenes required.  You want to deck him in the face, not turn him off entirely.  Well done, Goldhawk.\n\nAnyway, I've played to the point where I'm through the first terror mission, and I gotta say there's a huge difficulty spike.  Just as it should be.  If you think the first month is too easy, take another look at your funding, and wait for some pain to roll into tactical.  As a big fan of the original X-Com, I heartily endorse this game: Cleaning up all the annoyances and adding a few new features has truly made it new again.  It's the game we loved, without the trappings of retro.

The technology involves the guns from that time (first iterations of the M16 and similar weapons) to begin with, but in true X-COM fashion, these will soon be replaced with the technology from the enemy.\n\nBase building (multiple bases on the planet are a necessity in order to win), soldier management, loadout customization, UFO tracking and intercepting, all that works very similarly to the original X-COM and is not streamlined for the "newer generation of gaming" (whatever that means...). We have UFO recovery missions, base assault missions (both offensive and defensive) and terror site missions. There is no story missions or such, which take you by your hand, you have to make your own story.\n\nThe missions play in a traditional round-based system with actionspoints. When actionpoints are not used up in a round, the soldier can have an interrupt chance and fire back at the enemy (same rule applies for the aliens, so watch it when opening the door of a UFO).\n\nOn the negative side, there is not really any sort of tutorial. However, with the newest patch a lot of tooltips have been introduced which explain the game rules, but I can see that this could be a bit tedious for a new player. Also, the graphics might not be everybody's cup of tea (check some screenshots to see what I mean).\n\nAll in all, I can highly recommend this. While not released yet (still beta), the release is just around the corner and there are a couple of bugs left to be squashed. But it is highly playable. Just the ironman mode is a bit of a gamble, since there is no guarantee, that the save game does not get corrupted.","January 4, 2014","true","87.7"," 159 of 181 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","159","181","0","0"

The player is responsible for managing every level of the organization, from constructing bases and researching new technology, to deploying and commanding fighters, to directing individual soldiers on the battlefield in turn-based combat.\n\nAesthetically, the game has a unique, classy visual identity, great sound design, and a superb soundtrack.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is of course similar to its inspiration, X-COM (or UFO: Enemy Unknown), but with rebalanced combat, a vastly superior interface, added mechanics (such as suppression), and real-time air combat.\n\nIf you're a new player who was at some point intimidated by the original X-COM's initial lack of direction and micromanagement, or a fan of Firaxis' XCOM looking for a different experience, definitely give Xenonauts a try. It has all the depth and fun of the original X-COM but with almost all of the micromanagement stripped out and a clearer, more presentable interface.\n\nIf you're a UFO:EU vet, you'll find something new here. For instance, unlike in UFO, combat armor is extremely valuable, but also heavy, so if you want to follow the tried and true strategy of blowing everything up with C4 you'll have to pay for it in either survivability or mobility. Running out of ammunition can be a very real concern. Suppression and improved alien AI moves the gameplay away from massed reaction fire toward more dynamic "fire and maneuver"-style gameplay.\n\nThe best thing about Xenonauts is its ability to remain "faithful" to UFO:EU without feeling like a nostalgia-driven fan remake of an older game. Xenonauts is not afraid to make changes to the formula if they benefit the overall game, nor is it trying to "recapture" the greatness of its idol. Xenonauts wants to forge its own identity as a bleak, uncompromising, tense, occasionally terrifying strategy game. And it largely succeeds.\n\nVery much recommended.","November 26, 2013","true","46.6"," 105 of 111 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","105","111","0","7"

Get Xenonauts. It's as close as it gets to the original but with many many improvents regarding gameplay and manegement. It also adds tactical interceptions which are quite challenging. XCOM: Enemy Unknown wasn't a bad game, but Xenonauts is much better if you really want to sink your teeth into a strategy game.\n\nThe graphics are... well... functional and they look nice, but do not expect flashy 3D extravaganzas.

If you kneel behind a wall that looks like 3 feet high it often said it I had a 45% chance that my shot gets blocked by said wall. IRL I would put the gunbarrel on top of the wall. Aliens shoot at me but it says 100% blocked when I want to shoot back. That feels wrong. Cover and blocking are really unintuitive and glitchy.\n\nThird of all...the FOV for your soldiers is like 45 degrees on each side. What are my soldiers...moles?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamMil/recommended/223830/","AdamMil","Adam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamMil/","240 products in account","This is the only faithful remake of the original 1994 game UFO: Enemy Unknown (aka X-COM: UFO Defense). It has numerous flaws, but in the end it captures enough of the original X-COM magic to be well worth playing. (The recent Firaxis game, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, is an excellent game in its own right, and probably a better game, but is not faithful to the original X-COM formula.)\n\nThe game improves on the original X-COM in several ways. It helps reduce end-game grind by allowing you to skip the ground combat after shooting down a UFO, in exchange for greatly reduced rewards. It eliminates the X-COM problem of having to laboriously track down the final alien. It updates the interface to more modern standards of user-friendliness. It adds a proper cover system (albeit a frustratingly bad one). It adds an air combat mini-game to make shooting down UFOs more interesting. And, it adds some mod support to the game. Soldier advancement is pretty well-designed too, allowing rookies to get better without you having to force them into dangerous situations so they can get kills, although I think the original X-COM was okay in this respect.\n\nUnfortunately, the flaws are many.\n\nThe AI is quite stupid. Aliens (and civilians) often run around in circles, or run back and forth through a fire until they die. Your squadmates don't seem to care about friendly fire during reaction fire, so if they have a 25% chance of hitting an alien and a 65% chance of hitting a teammate, they'll still take the shot. You want to keep your machine-gunners behind you because they're not very flexible, but then you have to worry about them slaughtering a team member if they decide to do reaction fire. Or, you want your infantry to advance behind a tank for cover, but they might shoot and blow up the tank trying to hit an alien on the other side. And there's no way to disable reaction fire to avoid this.\n\nThe cover system appears nice at first, but it's quite bad. It's just nonsensical what kind of objects can block your shot or grenade. If you're next to a tall box, and on the other side of the tall box is a short box, you can shoot over the tall box but the short box will block your shot even though that's impossible. Etc.\n\nThere are unforgiveable flaws in the game simulation. If you know an alien is on the other side of a flimsy fence, you might think "time to blast through it with my machine-gunner", but no. The first bullet may destroy the fence, and the other nine bullets will just hit the empty space where the fence used to be. This makes machine-gunners far less useful, since they can't punch through obstructions to hit enemies behind. Also, there's no gravity. A favorite tactic of mine in the original X-COM was to get the drop on enemies by blasting a hole in the ceiling and dropping in on them. In Xenonauts, you can make a hole, but you won't fall through. Even with a big hole, you can just walk around in the air where the floor used to be. (Similarly, if you kill a flying enemy, its corpse will just float in the air.)\n\nOther, less important omissions from the simulation that existed in the original X-COM: no negative effects from smoke inhalation, temporary unconsciousness, etc. Also, sometimes in Xenonauts, you can see through walls. So presumably the aliens can see you through walls.\n\nThe maps are small, few, and not randomized, unlike the original X-COM which had random maps. You'll see repeat maps pretty often by the end of the game. The ground is entirely flat, unlike the original X-COM which had hills and whatnot. The alien ships are linear and thus safer to assault compared to the original X-COM ships which could be quite treacherous.\n\nThe game fails to capture the tension and fear from the original X-COM, at least for me. When you start the original X-COM, you have 14 men (with the least-upgraded transport ship). Before you even exit the transport ship, plasma bolts start flying your way. You can't even see who's shooting at you. Your men are dying. You're diving for cover, or trying to. The aliens are blasting your cover apart. Gotta find new cover. Shoot back, or keep moving?? Finally, you get to a good spot or kill the immediate attackers. Three men are dead, and two are wounded. And now you can start trying to complete the mission... The aliens in the original X-COM are dangerous. They can see further than you, their weapons are devastating, and they frequently ambush you. In Xenonauts, I never really felt threatened in the same way. The aliens aren't very aggressive, they can't see further than you, and there isn't as big of a difference in weapons. You never have to fight in the dark, and almost never in buildings. You can fight every mission in daylight. As a result, it's easier than X-COM and it doesn't feel as satisfying to turn the tide of the war because you don't start so far behind. That said, there's an iron-man mode, which should help add some of the missing tension back into the game.\n\nAlien psionics are devastatingly random. There is no way to effectively defend yourself against them. No matter how strong-willed your men are, no matter how high their morale, health, etc., they will frequently be mind-controlled or worse. Combined with the fact that psionics don't require line of sight, it's just frustrating rather than fun, especially if you want to play iron-man and can't reload the game.\n\nThe game lags even on a modern system sometimes. For instance, after I added a hovertank to my team the game started lagging pretty noticeably.\n\nThe developers seem a bit incompetent. When flaws like those mentioned above were pointed out (e.g. why the cover system was so bad), they said they couldn't fix them because "it's too hard". X-COM did many of these things better in 1994, and many other games do them better today, so I think if it's too hard it's because the developers aren't good enough at their jobs. (Also, I've been programming for decades so I know something about what things should and shouldn't be hard to do.)\n\nIn addition, there are numerous small bugs, but they're not too annoying and at least the game seems stable. It has never crashed for me.\n\nIn spite of all those problems, if you're a fan of the original X-COM, I believe you'll enjoy this game.","October 5, 2015","true","62.4"," 80 of 98 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","80","98","5","0"

If u're a fan of the original XCOM or even the XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within, then u'll love this one. Especially if u're looking for more of a challenge compared to XEU. Xenonauts definitely offers the player more control over what/how u can spend and allocate your funds, as well as more randomness in terms of ground combat and enemy placement.\n\nIf I had to pick a negative, I would say that the game doesn't necessarily have a random map generator like the original XCOM did/does. Xenonauts has more of a semi random map generator, in which u may come across a similar map, but the layout in terms of what's on the map may be different. For example; instead of a crate being placed in a particular part of the map, there may be a set of parked cars or debris of some kind etc. Of course in the forums, u can always download custom maps ppl design, and add em to ur game to spice it up, and keep the game fresh as well.

So much of this game is half way done and not fleshed out fully.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nIt's prettier than original x-com... if by prettier you mean higher resolution. There is no way to rotate the map, no way to zoom the map in or out (well... you can change the resolution i guess), no minimap, fences and doors obscure everything behind them unless there is a npc or player model on that square... the list goes on.\n\nThe geoscape is a mess. It's a flat projection of the world that takes as long to travel around the pole as it does at the equator and radar ranges are perfect circles. This would not be a problem except someone decided to be clever and program in a realistic day/night transition that even moves up and down with the seasons. It's not game breaking, gameplay is balanced around the flat map and perfect circles...\nYet I can not get over the realistic day night line. If you're going to do one bit right, you have to do all the bits right, not half of it.\n\nYou can set things on fire! But there is no incendiary ammo, and things you would expect to burn (hay bales, wooden buildings) don't. Once again, it's a lovely mechanic ripped form original x-com that is implemented half way.\n\nThis basically applies to every single item in the game. Research, manufacturing, base development, combat, tooltips, in game information, etc.\n\nI'm enjoying playing this game... in short stints. If I play too long the flaws grate too much and I get frustrated with the game instead of enjoying it.\n\nIf you can overlook/don't notice the flaws xenonauts is a solid x-com remake and is be a lot of fun.","November 3, 2014","true","109.7"," 48 of 53 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","48","53","0","0"

It does not seem that Scandinavia has such a problem, though, despite not being connected by land to the rest of Europe(or, should I say, Western Europe, since they peculiarly decided to pick the cold war era for their game?).\nRealism and consistence with the time period set up was an excuse(whenever they bothered giving one) for the things people did not like as they were holding down game experience, but was never an issue when the decision was facilitating the "development" of the game.\nThe game was getting progressively worst, cool features removed, flat progression inserted, the development team was obvious that they did not care at all. All they wanted was to be done with it. Believe it or not, 1 1/2 year ago, the Goldhawk owner was asking for coders for another project since "Xenonauts was at the verge of completion" and wanted to share the resources with other projects for cost efficiency!!\n\nThis is the history of the making of the game as I witnessed it. Result?\n\nA Broken Game!\n\nThe game is aspiring to have all cool features from X-COM, Jagged Alliance and various other great games of the past combined, but it fails in all accounts due to the laziness of the developers, the inexistent game design and the ridiculously high amount of bugs in the game.\nThis game has the most historically and topographically unrealistic "realistic strategic setup" ever made in a strategy game.\nThis game has the most lame balance ever in a strategy game I have ever played.\n\nI feel I was cheated by Goldhawk and I can say for certain that I will *never* buy or recommend a title produced by this laughable excuse of a company and they are the reason I will never again buy an Early access game again.\n\nI hope that this review will save some X-COM fans from throwing away their money, because the positive reviews of this game are greatly deceiving and misleading to anyone that reads them.","June 18, 2014","false","16.2"," 128 of 188 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","128","188","4","6"

I like playing games like this without saving (I did so with JA2) but here, to me, it seems impossible. It's just not intuitive. If I have a soldier crouch in the center on a warehouse rooftop, he shouldn't be able to get shot by someone hugging the warehouse wall. Or all the times I've moved a heavy for a slightly better position, only to be informed I now have 0% chance to hit, or something silly like a windowpane blocking 50% of my shots and not enough TUs to get back to my original position and fire. Also, I think the entire MG spray hit chance is calculated when you fire, because I've tried firing through those silly waist high walls with screens on them that you get in UFOs, which give you 0% chance to hit your target, because I figured ok, 1 round blows them away and the rest spray the alien behind... well, no, they all randomly hit the air where the screen used to be. This stuff kind of breaks a tactics game. JA2 didn't have these issues and that was 15 years ago...\n\nAlso, you can't store extra gear in the dropship. I can't be the only one who used to go back to the ship to get the heavy explosives every now & again in a difficult mission. I miss that.\n\nMission variety:\nThere really isn't any. I know there wasn't that much in the original game either, but if there's one aspect where I think the game could've evolved, it's this one.\nThere was just so much wasted potential here, extraction missions, coming to enforce local forces battle lines (I think they promised a static tank emplacement at one point), pilot rescue missions, I don't know, anything?\n\nGraphics\nI don't mind the direction they took or the lack of female soldier models or lots of stuff that could've been. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of local forces and civilians and stuff, but the game has next to no animations, the characters don't sway, don't move, they don't anything. Everything is frozen until you take an action and then it's all very mechanical.\n\nInterface\nNo option to toggle off centering on selected soldiers starts giving you headaches when you have to move 10 of them through multiple levels like in a UFO or building.\nYou can't reorganize your squad order, which is a mindnumbing oversight. I can't have No. 1 be the shield, 2 & 3 be assault and so on. Was it so hard to let me drag the ground combat squaddie tabs around?\n\nI would've preferred scroll up/down to change height levels instead of selected squaddies. I guess tab & tilda work well enough, though. You can change the key bindings but you can't bind them to scroll up/down. I guess you probably can if you  start tinkering with the game files but I shouldn't have to do that.\n\n\nXenopedia\nI generally love the descriptions in games like this, even Aftermath caught my interest with their alien types and whatever, but here, it feels too... textbook. I read all the entries but they felt dry and the attempts at humor seemed forced. There was 1 funny joke somewhere in there, though.\n\nConclusion\nIn all, it's a real shame and it taught me a lesson about buying into this kind of stuff. Maybe that gives the pricetag some worth.","June 20, 2014","false","53.4"," 239 of 383 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","239","383","0","6"

It does what it promises to do, deliver classic XCOM gameplay without the bugs/DOS limits.\n\nTrue-to-original gameplay with benefits of tech advances and without limitations of 1994 hardware. Artwork isn't pixellated or low-res, but remains 2D. The maps are 2D as well, with some tile/LOS issues, but that is just the flavor of this game. There is no need to specifically select a grenade, move it into the soldier's hand after removing the rifle, then use the nade in combat. Select it from a quick-menu and throw at the enemy. The proper TU cost will be calculated based on where the grenade was in the inventory so it costs the same, just makes gameplay easier. Inventory/equipment can be arranged and saved for future use making it possible to edit existing classes or create your own. Building Missile defences no longer requires you to dismantle outdated facilities to replace with new tech versions. They upgrade automatically when new tech is researched. Saving time and making sense. Xenonauts has many similar improvements over the original XCOM while keeping the gameplay essentially the same.\n\nEDIT\n\nThere are greater departures from the original gameplay. Developers removed the ability for the player to construct manufacturing complexes and use them to create wealth by trading new technology and devices. This was exploited in the original to make funding meaningless. In Xenonauts, your budget is the direct result of your actions in defending funding governments. Let them down enough and your budget will constrict to the point of utter failure. There are no "points" you and the aliens score, only collateral damage caused by them and bonuses paid for UFOs shot down. You will sell small amounts of alien item, but it's a pittance compared to the gravy train you could ride in XCOM: UFO Defense. Budgetary restrictions are so severe at higher difficulty levels, that even most grizzled veterans will find it difficult to manage, and will probably lose more than once. Great news if you found all your squad-level tactical games too easy and forgiving.\n\nTactical combat is also extremly dangerous at the highest difficulty level, to the point of it seriously not being worth it just for the sake of leveling soldiers. You will have to fight to collect researchable items or to prevent alien terror, but outside this you will not want to engage in too many battles, certainly not without decent equipment.\n\nAir combat is expanded. It takes place in a simplified RTS setting, though it is possible to autoresolve all encounters. You risk taking damage either way. Unlike the classic, aircraft shot down are not lost. In a rare moment of forgiveness, Xenonauts will recover downed aircraft, although it can take 72h to drag the remains back to base.\n\nIn addition to bringing back classic XCOM gameplay, Xenonauts manages to recreate the addictivness of the original. Your mileage may vary of course, but i personally managed to clock 23h during the first three play sessions. And i found myself thinking about different tactics or wondering how the hell i'm supposed to beat the game at all.","August 20, 2014","true","74.2"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","3"

Every new technology you recover and reseach has a very detailed background. And even though fictional the way it is explained sounds credible and makes sense. The devs have really thought about the underlying details of the technology and thats pretty cool.\n\nOverall the game has a lot more strategic depth than I originally thought (first few hours of gameplay).

Is not angerness as in 100% Orange Juice, or when you miss a 99% shoot in the XCOM, or when the AI in the Civ games just declare war on you for no reason.\n\nThis is Cat Mario type of frustration. The enemies can shoot through 100% cover where you can't. I have been shot thought wall with pistols from totally blind points for the aliens. You get one shoot kill across the map with a shotgun. You get kill by rifle fire from too far away, and again from blind spots for the aliens. I swear some aliens are aimbots inspired from the CS cheaters.\n\nThe AI is unnecessarily difficult. Is just difficult for the sake of being annoying. And that is just frustrating when you play on Ironman.\n\nMy feeling is that XCOM:EU was challenging, you can still make no mistake and loose the mission, but you could recover from that. In here you need to make perfect runs, with a cheating AI, and so the game become a matter of luck rather than tactics.\n\nThere are also minor CTDs, and some annoying interface designs that I don't particularly like.\n\nOn the bright side, the game actually nails the air combat. You can get your deploy ship shoot down if not withing timing range of your fighters, and so on.","January 6","false","41.7"," 62 of 96 people (65%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","65","62","96","13","1"

It's very much like the old xcom granted minus some of the graphics of today. I enjoy the fights and while you don't have to do all of them, that's where I have my fun time. To me the game seems a little rushed in play as if you are not researching some things in the right order or making the money to build equipment or ships then you'll be a little on the low side to the aliens. I do feel like they could have added a few more battle fields as they do tend to get repetitive at times. I do wish the environments were a little more destructible like the old xcom. I have had aliens on a few battle fields disappear, which is frustrating when trying to track them down (still won the battle, but saw one shoot and then duck behind a corner and then couldn't find him. If he shots at me he needs to be accounted for in the body count. :) ). In game manual/help and xenopedia could be flushed out more such as, I've got the money to build a 3rd new base, but have been unable to do so. I'm sure that I'm missing something, but can't figure out what. So, little frustrated there. Original xcom was simple in what you could do comparatively (it's hard to match the formula when  it was perfect to begin with). Haven't had aliens attack one of my bases yet, while it seems that they have hinted at this by way of base defense I've yet to experience it so it makes me wonder if it was an idea that didn't quite make it.","October 28, 2014","true","182.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","3"

They were something truly special, masterpieces of the strategy and sci-fi genre’s, and while we had XCOM: Enemy Unknown in 2012, it’s something I felt didn’t quite live up to the originals due to its simplified nature, such as smaller squads and amount of hand-holding it insisted on. However, if I were to tell you there was now in fact a game that captured the perfection of XCOM in its own way and modernised it properly, would that sound too good to be true? Because that’s exactly what Xenonauts is.\n\nXenonauts is an absolutely fantastic strategy game heavily influenced by the likes of XCOM and fans of the series will no doubt enjoy it thoroughly as it’s more of an updated throw-back to the older games as opposed to the newer ones. Newcomers to the genre though may be a little lost in its complexity due to the lack of any proper tutorial, however veterans will no doubt feel right at home and find a huge amount of content at their disposal. The amount of in-depth management can make the game feel like it drags on at times, but again, this is partially to do with the audience it is aimed at, so if you are looking for a more fast-paced game you certainly won’t find that, as it’s about being tactical and planning your moves carefully. The graphical style is very pleasant if a little simplistic but the overall cartoon-esque presentation makes it feel dated yet modern at the same time, giving it a very unique vibe. Ground combat was without a doubt one of my favourite parts of the game and is well designed and requires good tactical planning and thinking on the player’s part, even on the lower difficulties.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOMg647Fg9A\n\nSummary:\n+ Pleasant and clean graphical style.\n+ Ground combat is thought provoking and well designed.\n+ Good amount of troop customisation.\n+ Management is in-depth and enjoyable.\n+ Deep and intricate systems for veterans of the genre.\n- Ground battles can cause the game to drag on.\n- Lack of any proper tutorial.","July 14, 2014","true","9.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Despite any and all flaws it is well worth the money.\n\nIt's been years since people have been trying to bring new life into this genre.  Many sequels and clones have gone by with mixed success.  Games like XCom: Apocalypse changed the formula too much, while a good game in it's own right, it alienated fans.  Other games like UFO: Afterlight and the series tried a different approach, but suffered from clunky menus and combat felt artificial.  The recent addition of XCom: Enemy Unknown introduced excellent graphics and animations, but this hid the fact that the strategic map was dumbed down to the point that UFOs that you didn't shoot down were not the cause of missions, in fact it was possible to shoot them all down and still have missions so long as you had a country somewhere you didn't have a satalite over.  The tactical was also super simplified.  I would call that one an XCom-lite if anything.\n\nXenonauts does not have the flashy graphics of XCom: Enemy Unknown, nor does it vary far from the original.  However it is improved from the original in many ways and is what many fans have wanted.  It could be used as another start to evolve this hard to capture genre.\n\nOnce again, UFOs are the sole source of missions on the strategic map.  If a UFO is ignored, it can generate a terror mission during a landing, or build an alien base.  No longer is there effects without causes.  In fact the atmosphere of the game is even enhanced by reports of UFO activity across the globe, such as new crop circles, missing ships, and cattle mutilations being reported in areas where you cannot track the UFOs.  Also every UFO comes with a mission of their own, something you will discover later in the game.  These missions affect their behavior, and you will have to adapt if you want to control the invasion before it's too late.\n\nMany clones/sequels allowed the player to overpower the aliens far too much.  This gave the aliens the feeling of being the underdogs despite the fact that they are the ones with the technological advantage.  Not so in Xenonauts.  While the majority of the alien fleet cannot attack immediately, buying you some time to prepare, their progress is at least in part based on your success.  If you are doing well, expect to see harder UFOs and aliens sooner than you otherwise might.  This leads you to having to make tough decisions like "Do I let this UFO perform it's missions for a while before shooting it down?"  "Do I want to raid every UFO for the bonus cash" etc. because doing so can speed the rate of the invasion if you are successful.  In short, go to slowly and risk losing funding and nations.  Go too quickly and the Aliens will bring their main fleet before you're ready.  Can you walk that line?\n\nEven further you are quickly forced to decide between building better interceptors or getting better equipment for your troops.  Bullets will not do for long once aliens with armor start showing up.  Some will simply laugh off sustained fire if you aren't ready for them in time.  Defense is important too, as even the basic armor could be the difference between a shot instantly killing a soldier or not.  Even here, you cannot be reactive, as you stand to lose too much.  You have to learn to predict what you will need and when, and if you are wrong, you will pay.\n\nThis game is a hard strategy game.  Every decision you make will have repercussions you might not have dreamed of down the road.  Your soldiers, while they improve, will never be the super soldiers you had in other games.  Tactics will always be important, with armor only saving you from a mistake or two if you are lucky.  A skilled player might be able to forgo armor completely, though I doubt he would do so flawlessly.  I personally am almost a year into my game and I have never used combat shields, something a lot of players say is a staple in their forces.  My body count isn't that high either, roughly at about a dozen.\n\nAll this praise does come with a cost.  This game does have it's flaws.  If you need glasses, or have trouble reading small print, the fonts on the strategic map will kill your eyes.  I can barely read them as it is on 720p.  It may be better on 1080p, but that's not how I stream it.  This needs to get fixed.\n\nThe graphics look like something out of Fallout 2 days.  They are excellent 2d graphics, but do not expect full 3d modelling here.  They spent more of their time making sure the gameplay worked well than actually building 3d graphics.  Still if you can overlook the graphics, there is a great game underneath.\n\nThe interface, while greatly improved, is still very clunky.\n1.  Double clicking on a soldier in the management panel sometimes takes you to that soldier, sometimes not.  It's partly to do with how soldiers are organized on the equipment panel, partly to do with the double click speed required.\n2.  Planes that need to be refueled/repaired/reloaded cannot have any characteristics changed.  Even their name, or loadout.  It would be nice to be allowed to change a loadout while loading the plane with ammo.  This goes double for positioning soldiers on the dropships.\n3.  This is also a feature easily missed by most players, as it is hidden almost completely.  Placing a button from the loadout screen for the troops in the dropship to link to the positioning would help a lot.\n4.  The inability to rotate the map or hide walls makes it impossible to throw grenades on tiles behind them.\n\nThis game takes place in 1979-early 80's.  Some things are anachronistic or inaccurate.\n1.  The basic starting rifle is the M16A2, which came into use in the 1980's.  It had a 3 round burst option and 30 round magazine.  The weapon that soldiers should be using is the M16E1 which had fully automatic options and a 20 round magazine.\n2.  The starting precision rifle pictured is a M16A4 which introduced a modular rail system to a rifle similar to the M16A2 allowing for the addition of scopes, laser targetting and the like.  It would have had a 30 round magazine as well, instead of the 6 rounds given.  Instead they should have used the M16E1 fitted with a scope off to the side, with a 20 round magazine.\n3.  The machine gun pictured is the M249 squad automatic weapon.  This weapon is designed to fire ammo from a belt in a drum underneath the barrel.  It can use M16 magazines, however this is not reccomended due to severe jamming issues.  A M249 belt comes in 3 sizes: 100 round for training, 250 round infantry drum, and 500 round vehicle mounted drum.\n4.  Night vision scopes were around for the Vietnam war, and should be available for snipers in night missions in the game.  Full night vision goggle(s) however will not be seen till later in the 80's.  A possible tech to research and produce them would have been a nice touch as necessity is the mother of invention they say, and something to counter the alien's advantage at night would have been a welcome choice.  Night vision goggle(s) do however restrict vision, and accuracy due to the way they operate.\n5.  The starting grenade pictured is a fragmentation grenade.  It has a kill radius of 10 meters with an effective radius of 5 meters.  It does not do it's damage by concussive force, but by shards of metal, like bullets, flying out in all directions.  I cannot speak of how alien grenades work, but a rework of basic grenades should be in order to make them effective in this regard.\n6.  Flares burn can start fires easily but do not do so in game.  Smoke grenades produce smoke slowly, and will only burn your hand if you aren't wearing leather gloves.  They should not be starting fires in this game.\n7.  Bazookas are not easily reloadable in field.  Carrying one as a side implement should be an option for a soldier, but ammo preloaded.  The M25 rocket launcher however could fire multiple rockets, but was a mounted weapon.","July 2, 2014","true","96.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

You play the role as the commander of a special military force designated Xenonauts, who are tasked with the defense of earth from extra-terrestrial invaders. You’ll manage multiple bases you place on the globe, build ground and air forces to combat the alien threat, and defend humanity. Research technology gathered from shot down UFOs, and craft advance weapons, armor, vehicles and aircraft to keep toe to toe with the aliens as the get progressively tougher. Xenonauts is a fantastic spiritual sequel to X-COM UFO Defense, with the entire game playing out almost exactly the same. With that come some very odd choices.\n\nYou can’t rotate the map and there are many situations where targeting becomes an issue, and a great irritation. Aliens also like to use the open and close door tactic; during the alien’s turn, they can open doors which close for them after their turn ends, this means they will stay glued to the other side of a door, come out the on their turn, take shots at your soldiers and retreat back to safety, however, when attempting this tactic yourself, the door stays open the entire round, meaning the aliens are free to shoot back during their turn. Aliens even seem to know this tactics as many times they are often waiting right behind doors, making it very annoying to advance through bases or UFOs without a guarantee of losing at least one soldier along the way, the only real remedy I found was blowing the doors to high heaven.\n\nThe other unfortunate, and boring part of the game is the aircraft combat. The aircraft combat is a top-down view where you set waypoints for your ships to travel, it isn’t easy to change the flight path on the fly and the whole experience feels very slow and unbalanced, I almost always resorted to the auto-resolve, which has its own problems. When auto-resolve is at 100% it’s a guarantee victory, however, if you engage in the real time combat you can actually lose all of your fighters. On the flip side, there have been battles with an auto-resolve 0% rating but, when I engaged in the combat I was able to win. Also, alien space ships seem to have unlimited ammo while you have a very limited amount for your own fighters. The whole thing felt messy and unrewarding, you don’t get to see your ships engage in the combat other than green radar blips you see all the time, so auto-resolve seemed the best and most convenient way to deal with the aliens, this is a pretty big part of the game aside from ground combat and it’s a shame it isn’t more exciting or balanced, there’s also no way to take down aircraft without damaging it.\n\nThe other major complaint I have is the lack of mission variety, crash sites are won either by eliminating all aliens or capturing and holding their ships for 5 turns, alien bases are won by either destroying the power core or eliminating all aliens. Those are the only two varieties and couple that with small map variety and the game can start feeling very tedious. Some other things felt missing like a graph for finance and approval ratings from the various countries and just some minor graphical bugs I’ve experienced.\n\nI’ve enjoyed my time with Xenonauts, and would like to see it expanded upon, with more maps, missions, added tools and utilities, and better combat and varied environments. I could go into more detail, honestly, I’m seriously happy with Xenonauts despite my gripes with the combat aspect, I want more and always have and will and the game here is very well crafted with great visuals, music and atmosphere. Thankfully there is a great modding community who may add all that I could think of in a Xenonauts game, but, in the future, I wish for the game to be successful and for more to be added on by the creators.\n\nTL/DL; Xenonauts is a great spiritual sequel of the X-Com series. If you like those games remotely, you’ll love this one. It’s heavy with atmosphere, mostly great combat, the thrill of progress and the feeling you get when you nail a tough mission with flying colors.\n\n-Thumbs up from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork","October 20, 2014","true","77.9"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

This game is deeply rooted in old school style, which in turn is a good and a bad thing.\n\nIt’s one of those games were you’re going to struggle a lot your first time through if you are unfamiliar with the game and its mechanics. It’s a very entertaining game but also quite frustrating and vague at times. Unlike the XCOM reboots (which are fantastic by the way) this game has far greater complexity and player freedom. The game is incredibly in depth in a great way, it’s just unfortunate it’s very poorly explained. There’s so much here that isn’t in the XCOM reboots (Or the originals). The research tree and the technology you can create are vast as well.\n\nI really loved the setting and art style myself. Set in 1979 during the height of the cold war, the setting really grounds the game.  All the technology and buildings feel realistic in their world. Even the aliens and UFO’s themselves have a very realistic feel to them. While some may not like the 2D style of the game the sprites and maps are clean and well done.  I also appreciate the increased focus on intercepting, assaulting, and salvaging of UFO’s (which is the whole point of the game and the original X-COM) compared to the XCOM reboots.  Which in those games it only happened once in a while.\n\nRegardless the game is far from perfect. As stated above the game is incredibly complex but really poorly explained. However there is a manual, which does cover some things. That and the occasional cheapness of the AI which can shoot you from half across the map at a million different directions. What’s worse is the bug that allows them to shoot through walls. The game also has some pacing issues as it can feel way too chaotic at times. Finally the RNG is just too much, seriously if you thought XCOM’s RNG had some issues you haven’t played Xenonauts.\n\nOverall good game, just not for everyone:  8/10\n","April 8","true","23.0"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Take my money sir! And then Firaxis came along, announced their "reimagining" and release a truly brillian game in it's own right. It was X-COM, not quite XCOM but an excellent game. In the meantime Goldhawk (a little frustratingly at times) slowly got on with finishing their game and now it's been released.\n\nSo is it any good? This is the closest you are going to get to replaying XCOM again. OK so they can't use the same names or anything, they've set it in the 1970s (which, by the way was a minor stroke of genius) but works. It works sooo well. If you played and loved XCOM, then you can pick this up without even having to refer to an instruction manual. It does play a little differently yes  - the beefed up air combat being the main difference, something which I haven't really come to grips with so I'm heavily reliant on the "auto-resolve" button - but they flavour text accompanying the game is genuinely funny in places and very well written.\n\nIt lacks some of the creeping dread of XCOM on some of the missions (their Cryssalid replacement for example bears a remarkable resembalance to the Warhammer 40K Tyranid lictor) and suffers for it for some reason, and some of the models are maybe a little lacking. However the UFO design is excellent, and clearing them out a real tactical workout on occasion.\n\nI've not "finished" it yet, but all I can say a couple of hours of playing this over development and now release is that it's pretty damned good. If you tried the Firaxis version and it didn't click for you, then believe me this will.

I was looking for a game that had more focus on the strategy, the base building, on the various aspects of running a company that is the sole defence against aliens.\n\nXenonauts delivers, and though it was rather buggy in various of the alpha stages, the game has matured and become an all round great game to play.\n\nYou've got base management to focus on, every structure you build having a goal and purpose.\nThere's research and development going on, getting your troops better armor and weapons, or upgrading the weapons on your aircraft, researching and manufacturing newer ships to fight the aliens with.\n\nEvery soldier has a large variety of stats that upgrade and increase the more missions you play with the, and that progression really makes a difference, making every soldier a more and more valuable asset, making losing them that much more bitter when it does happen.\n\nBut that's fun, because unlike Firaxis's itterations of the game, where you were always pushed into certain behaviors to be the most efficient. Xenonauts offers you a lot more flexibility right from the start.\n\nYou have the whole world to defend, you can start wherever you want with your base and develop your team towards your ideal. Various types of grenades and a whole list of weapon types give you complete control over the battlefield, over what you want your soldiers to do and how you want them to evolve.\n\nThe game isn't easy though, because like the older generation it's based on, things can simply go wrong, an alien enemy with poor eye sight might still one of your own men by chance, and the results could be deadly! Good tactics help you out though, good preparation and positioning allowing you to jump enemies before they can possibly respond to your actions.\n\nThis is a fantastic game, especially if you loved the older games. The strategy, the management, the ufopedia, it's all very well put together, giving you a great time all around.","June 1, 2014","true","325.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

You'll find yourself in a dire situation, heavily outgunned against a technologically superior race - a situation which is well known in common SciFi movies. And you will suffer - a situation which is very unknown in common video games! You first encounters will likely end with heavy losses, half of your crew dead or critically wounded. But with time you struggle your way up the food-chain, gaining the upper hand and deliver payback!\n\nI recommend to play it on Iron Man Mode! If it feels too hard, try an easier level, but leave the Iron Man Mode activated. Yes, it is painfull to lose a good soldier because of a stupid mistake on the battlefield. Very painfull. But it's realistic and the fear for losses creates a strong bond to all your crew members!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RocLobster/recommended/223830/","RocLobster","Radioactive Lobster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RocLobster/","248 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nXenonauts is a refreshing throwback to XCOM's classic glory days. One could say that this is a more truthful-to-the-source remake of the XCOM franchise than any of the new games. Xenonauts features a deep and intimidating tactical combat system, one which will be familiar to anyone who has played almost any TBS game or XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, but with such a larger difficulty curve that you will at times be left feeling hollow, alone and abused as your squad of soldiers gets minced like tender beef in a meat grinder. The game makes a respectful nod in the direction of the original XCOM games, in that it is virtually impossible not to suffer casualties at some point in your game. Where as the recent titles even had achievements encouraging you to try completing a campaign without anyone dying, or having a lone soldier complete a mission, in Xenonauts both these tasks are virtually impossible.\n\nThe reasons behind the difference in diffuclty doesn't come from a more advanced or biased AI, but simply more input that players have to manage. Not only on the ground with your soldiers, but also back at base and infact globally. Your soldiers inventories have to be carefully managed, ensuring they have enough weapons and ammunition to last their contact with the aliens, but also not overloading them to the point that they suffer TU (Time Units, the equivalent of Action Points) penalties that cripple them and make it difficult for your men and women to gun the enemy down then make a hasted retreat to cover. On mention of cover, more things are destrucable on Xenonauts too. Where as in XCOM: EU/W there were some indestructable cover options that would at worst explode, but still offer protection, in Xenonauts pretty much anything that can be used as practical cover can also be turned into dust. So often, it becomes the case that you don't just want a wall between you and the aliens, but several and a yew yards of empty space from the walls too so you don't get caught in any collateral damage.\n\nMoving onto perhaps the more important part of the game (at least in terms of your chance of success in the campaign to save Earth), the Geoscape. You're given access to a global map and allowed to place your bases (Yes, plural. You can have, nay, WILL NEED, multiple bases at some point in your game) anywhere you like in the world. Whether you want to set up your alpha base in New York state, the Guangzhou province of China or perhaps just outside of Zimbawe, you're given some pretty hefty freedom on this matter. Though you also need to consider something else when placing bases. Their radar range. Since you're not fed mission options on a timed basis like in XCOM EU/W, you need to ensure that your base is in a decent position where not only will your base be able to detect incoming alien vessels, but also that there's a landmass large enough to make sure you can then follow up and board any crashed ships to kill surviving aliens and salvage their equipment. Poor base placement early on can lead to a starved economy, as you're largely funded by your actuall progress rather than on whether you chose one country over another in mission options.\n\nAdditional to the base placement in the Geoscape is the base's design itself. You choose how the facility will be constructed, what building will go where. And this will be reflected later in game when the alien menace starts to invade your base. So rather than just filling every single space you can with facilities, you may want to build so that the aliens have few channels to transport through your base. Maybe even forcing them to bottle neck one way in, since they always break in via your hangars.\n\nMention of hangars brings up another very important aspect of the game. Managing your aerospace force. Especially later on in the game, you'll find yourself getting swamped with radar readings for multiple UFO sightings. And since your fighters aren't equipped with an unlimited supply of fuel or ammunition, their ability to engage targets is quite limited. So you'll want to ensure you've enough hangars and jets filling them to confront any aerial menace that pops up within radar range. Without this ability to combat UFO's, you'll quickly run out of funding and let the planet fall into a state of panic.\n\nTo sumarise what I'm trying to convey here, Xenonauts is XCOM for big boys. It's challenging, frustrating but overwhelmingly satisfying when you get a moment where you feel like you're doing well. Even if those moments are short lived, as the aliens will likely knock you back down a peg in the next terror mission filled with Reapers.","June 16, 2014","true","44.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

If you've played XCom: UFO Defense/UFO: Enemy Unknown, Jagged Alliance 2, Breach and Clear, Silent Storm, or the new Xcom, and enjoyed it- you'll like Xenonauts.\nEvery update adds not only features I'm used to, but new features that streamline and improve the experience.\nAt the time of this writing, I'd say that the game is probably a year off being pretty much complete, but the current level of development is impressive. I'm looking forward to the final product, and have absolute belief that it's going to be one of the deepest and most compelling games on the market.\n\nEDIT: Final product review, 07.OCT.14.\n\nXenonauts has turned out to be everything I'd hoped for.\n\nThis is the true spiritual successor to Julian Gollop's genre-defining UFO: Enemy Unknown (AKA XCOM: UFO defense). There were only two games that ever perfectly demonstrated the potential of the turn-based tactical genre- Jagged Alliance 2 and UFO: Enemy Unknown. These two pillars of the genre are now joined by Xenonauts.\n\nThe grand strategy? It's there. The micromanagement? It's there. The research and development? It's there. The tactical challenges of storming a crashed UFO full of very hacked-off aliens with plasma weapons? Oh, yeah, it's there.\n\nIf you're a 'thinking' gamer rather than a twitching gamer, this is a game that lets you sink into the role of planetary defence coordinator. Hours can slip by as you arrange UFO interceptions, juggle base creation against reserach and development, and weigh up airstrikes on a crashed UFO against sending in recovery teams.\n\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough to the grognard-type gamer who wants a deep gaming experience without interface complications. I honestly place Xenonauts in my top ten games of all time- and I've been playing computer games for thirty-five years.\n\nBravo, Goldhawk. Bravo.\n\nHere's hoping you make enough money from Xenonauts to buy the rights to the Jagged Allliance IP and treat it better than the last mob of semi-competents.\n\nThe last feedback I can give is to comment that it's a little jarring to have female special forces soldiers in a game set in the 70's/80's, but I'll take a little Sarkeesian-mollifying Social Justice Warrior history revisionism if it means I get to play a game this good.","June 14, 2014","true","156.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

And, they committed the absolute worst crime a developer can commit during a paid early access/beta period: They refused to listen to bug reports on several occasions if the bug didn't repro in the dev build. At one point I had to spend over an hour painstakingly summing alien TUs and making a YouTube video just to prove a bug existed, despite it being reported by a half-dozen different people, most of whom encountered it on their very first mission in a new game.\n\nIn terms of the game design: At early stages, your troops will be shot and killed. On your turn. The AI is highly defensive and usually spends under 1/3 of their own AP during their turn unless humans are visible. If no humans are immediately visible, the AI will not hunt for them, they will take defensive positions and wait. The reaction fire system is poorly coded, being based on what % of a characters' TUs are remaining: If an alien is sitting around the corner with 100% of their TUs (and this happens a lot), as soon as a soldier turns the corner they will almost certainly get shot at. Usually two or three times. With weapons that have a very high chance to instakill a human.\n\nAs humans design new and better weapons, such as laser or plasma replacing standard ballistics, you do more damage but have smaller clips. That's it. There are no other changes from one tier to another, despite developer promises that more interesting design would be implemented later in the process. There are a ton of forum posts where players debated back and forth how the various tiers ought to be balanced against each other, with each tier shining in certain regions and maybe being lackluster in others. For example, I was a proponent that plasma weaponry ought to do massive damage but have ammo and range drawbacks, while lasers have voluminous ammo stores and long range but only moderate firepower.\n\nAttack TU costs are based entirely on percentage of total TUs, meaning those soldiers who can move faster can't actually fight any more effectively, they are just more mobile. This was a late change in the development process, being added with only a few months to spare. When I tried it and disliked it, I was insulted by the community as well as the developer, being told that he "wouldn't go over the reasons [for switching to a percent TU system] again."\n\nThe entire ground combat design (about 60% of the game) is tilted in favor of the AI. Elements like % TU costs for firing and reaction fire require constant calculations and re-calculation to know whether or not a given troop can, say, reach cover and fire a shot. There is no simple mechanism in-game to simplify this for the player.\n\nIn the end, I don't recommend this game, unless you have a particular desire to fill a pad of paper with calculations, spending your time reading the xml files to figure out how things actually work, and getting your people shot.\n\nIf you really, REALLY want to re-play the original X-COM... just go and replay X-COM. Get DOSBox running on your computer and replay the classic. Xenonauts is a game that wants to be X-COM but fails to either properly modernize it or recreate it.","June 16, 2014","false","348.3"," 295 of 535 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","295","535","0","35"

You start with a ragtag group of soldiers with the best technology humankind has to offer, which isn't much. Aliens invade with their own weapons in great force, striking against ships and towns, and it's up to you to shoot down their UFOs, aqcuire their technology, and use it against them before they turn human forces against you.\n\nMuch like the originals, you never really have the upper-hand. As the game progresses and you learn the secrets of alien technology, the invasion ramps in difficulty with larger UFOs and more intelligent aliens armed with even stronger weaponry.  You must rely on your own planning and a bit of luck to pull through.

Well I loved xcom 2012, It was my first xcom I didn't play the originals. So if my opinion as a non xcom hipster is revelant to you, read on.\n\nTo me xcom 2012 and xenonauts are two opposite approaches to a xcom remake.  Which means we have 2 very different games which are great in thier own right. In my mind both have strengths and weaknesses when compared. And if you are a big fan of this tiny genre, then both are worth sinking hours into.\n\nThe most immediate difference presentation and feel, both games evoke the original in different ways. xenonauts keeps the old school full 2d enviroments and sprites, but opts for more realistic and modern art design. While xcom 2012 goes full 3d modern high quality models and enviroments, and yet its art style is actually more reminiscant of the original, cartoony and a bit daft.\n\nTo me neither is superior. I prefer fully 3d presentation and destruction of xcom 2012, but prefer the more realistic and grounded art style which is more fitting to a serious game; I prefer xenonaut's chinook and m16s than the kitch skyranger and haircuts of xcom.\n\nXenonauts ground combat is much more similiar to the original, and it frankly just feels very aged and not as tight or fluid as xcom 2012. Having a much bigger squad means generally less need to employ tactics, as each individual is less important. The fire/cover/hunker system in xcom 2012 is genious, xenonauts doesn't require nearly as much decision making on the ground.\n\nYou mostly just line up all your guys and fire away, often relying on numbers rather than cover or flanking. One thing xenonaut's ground combat has is that enemies are spawned from the very start, which is miles better than xcom 2012 hugely flawed spawn on LoS system. Overall I have to give ground combat to xcom 2012, but it depends on your own preferences.\n\nThe place where xenoanuts really shines and becomes WAY superior to xcom 2012 is the geoscape. That is base building/management aswell as air battles. There is simply tons more depth and freedom and is the reason to buy the game. Once you play it makes xcom 2012's geoscape seem totally meaningless.\n\nYou can directly contoll air battles, your bases will be attacked and you get ground battles to defend them, you can build multiple bases. There is tons of decision making that xcom 2012 lacks, and it's a core part of the game not just a afterthought.\n\nSo it depends if you want a in depth planetary defense sim, buy xenonauts. If you have no interest in geoscape and only like turn based tactical combat, then stick to xcom 2012 or something else.","June 18, 2014","true","58.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This shows as a much more fine tuned balance between being able to micromanage while still feeling like the overall commander-in-charge of your organisation.

(Apparently some folks still don't yet understand how the concept of 'Early Access' works.) That being said, if you're the kind of person who might agree with those people, I would wholeheartedly recommend waiting until after development is completed to pick up (or at the very least, play) your own copy of Xenonauts. Goldhawk has been releasing updates with fair regularity, the game has been getting better and more complete each time, and they are currently very close (I'd venture to guess somewhere around 90%, give or take 5% or so) to having the game ready for its final update.\n\nIs Xenonauts X-COM? No. (Of course, if you asked me if the most recent X-COM was X-COM, you'd get the same answer. I thought Firaxis did an interesting job with Enemy Unknown, it's just not the X-COM I grew up with.) Again, that being said, Xenonauts is the game that comes closest to emulating the feel of the original X-COM that I have ever seen. There have been many, many, MANY attempts at recapturing that brutal magic over the years; many have been interesting, some even enjoyable, but none that I felt were truly close. You can tell that this game was designed by people who clearly played the original game to death. Put the cosmetic differences aside, and it still *looks* like X-COM, and it *feels* like X-COM.\n\nIn its raw, unmodified state, the game is difficult - I'd even be willing to say brutally so. (I personally went to the trouble of digging into the data files to give myself a bit of a New Game+, just so I wouldn't lose entire funding regions within the first hour of play. Oh yeah, btw - this game is moddable. The data files are somewhat dense, but with some time and effort, you can modify quite a bit.) The original UFO Defense experience of having troops plasma-blasted to death instantly upon leaving the transport can and does happen. Also included is that feeling of finally having a leg up on the initial alien opponents when you research better weapons and armor - only to have a whole new group of enemies show up and proceed to lay waste to your crack troops with the same level of ease. The UFOs will have an even bigger field day against your interceptors if you let them - they get progressively bigger and nastier and will seem to simply shrug off hits from even your biggest guns.\n\nThe graphics, while not nearly as rendered and flashy as Enemy Unknown's, are still a huge leg-up from the original game's, and the interface is familiar without being clunky. The game's 1970's Cold War setting actually plays well with the alien invasion theme and helps many of the other design decisions and features to make sense as well. Almost everything that makes up the base of this game has been pulled almost directly from the concepts behind the original UFO Defense, from the basebuilding, tech, and tactical mechanics to the enemies and the weapons. Yes, the UFOs and interceptors look unique and different, there are more types of armor and weapons, and some of the aliens look different and have unique names - but Enemy Unknown did much the same thing, albeit to a lesser extent.\n\nXenonauts really shines in the areas where it makes improvements on the base gameplay from the original game. Air combat in Xenonauts is how air combat in Enemy Unknown should have been - interactive and fully tactical. Just like in the ground combat missions, what happens to your aircraft is entirely on you - make a mistake, and your planes will be shot down, potentially leaving that region of the world defenseless against the next alien attack. Xenonauts also improves on the tactical missions by including local armed forces on the ground combat maps, a genuine cover system, and more transparency in exactly how your troops' physical skills improve at the end of each mission.\n\nThis game is definitely worth picking up if you are a die-hard fan of old-school X-COM, or if you just like deep, challenging strategy games in general. Oh, and did I mention that you can mod it? Just imagine, an X-COM-like that you can customize to your own liking. Make it easier, make it harder, make it so you can sell alien corpses to museums - whatever you like. It can be done. Remember, with your help, Earth CAN survive the alien invasion!

If you've never heard of XCOM, think the original was released in 2012, or came looking for a new strategy game that keeps you on your toes, you've come to the right spot as well! This game successfully meshes turn-based squad combat with a reaserch / funding / air combat strategy layer to keep you thinking about everything you do. I'd heartily reccommend this to anybody with an eye for such games, although be warned, the game is no A to B cakewalk... 9 / 10 I think it's worth $30 personally, but if you're on a tight budget, grab this if it ever goes on sale for $20 or less.\n\nI'll assume your read the game description, so I'll spare you the back story and get right down to the gameplay. In the geoscape (the world map view), players control bases and their facilities:  equipping soldiers, researching, manufacturing, managing planes, and managing resources. From here, the goal is mainly to send dropships to crashed / landed ufos or alien bases in order to slow the invasion. The air combat is nice, but not too deep, and is usually resolved based on the tech you have unlocked more than skill (although there are already fancy mods to make this more skill based). These dogfights can be autoresolved if they aren't your bag of tea. The difficulty chosen affects the rate at which the invasion progresses on the geoscape. Although certainly a nice way to progress the game, the geoscape isn't where you spend most of your time.\n\nThat place would be the battlescape (the turnbased squad combat). This section of the game is incredible. Each unit is given time units to spend on its turn that let it act (all actions require different amounts of TUs) and the remainder of those are used to react to the aliens on their turn. Combat is highly tactical, and the differences in difficulty are most noticed here. The AI is extremely intelligent. The enemy is stronger and heartier than your troops, not to mention extremely intelligent. As the invasion progresses, so will their tech, alien / ufos composition, and numbers. Once killed, soldiers are gone forever, and this gives each firefight a nervous tension (The ironman mode continuously saves your actions to improve this feeling if you enjoy it). Never before has a game made me think so thuroughly during a turn as Xenonauts because of this.\n\nThe downsides? It's an indie game, so it's not to fancy visually. That said, it still has some incredibly detailed and hand painted sprites. At the time of writing, the game just got out of early access, and it still has one or two bugs two work out. On top of that, some oddities occur due simply to the engine constraints of the game. Beyond that, there really isn't anything to complain about, and my gameplays have been pretty smooth! The game is easily moddable by fiddling with the xml files (doable using notepad), and a nice handful of talented map makers have already begun adding maps to the game. The maps in this game are semi-random, so after multiple playthroughs, you will undoubtably see similar looking maps, and the ones the community makes keeps the game nice and fresh!\n\nI trust that if you were an XCOM fan, you'd already have bought this - if not, you should just stop reading and do that. So to all those who have never experienced the thrill of XCOM - the thrill of defending the Earth from an invasion of unknown magnitude and power with technology you prioritized, researched, and manufactured so you could give them to men and women you armed, commanded, and lost - this is a great place to start.","June 16, 2014","true","111.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

If you dont want to manage a bunch of cash, buildings, personnel while inbetween, carefully attacking any alien ships you shoot down to loot them for technology.

And a good one,\n\nMusic is spooky, the ambient sounds.. are spooky. Artwork, is awesome. The graphics look dated but the style is consistent and feels like you're running a secret agency during the cold war.\n\nstreamlined features like not having to re-buy ammo for standard issue equipment after each mission you send your poor troops on.\n\nOverall:\n\nGreat remake, makes you think and the game depth gives good immersion if you have the time.

This is to say that I'm viewing Xenonauts on its own merits and not colored by any association with its spiritual predecessor.\n\nThere's a lot to like here, and some parts of this game I'm really fond of. I like the setting, with retooled F-16s and MiGs giving things vague Independence Day vibes. The strategic game is fun, establishing bases, managing personnel and research projects, and dispatching interceptors to engage UFOs. Some might find the micromanagement of every soldier and every F-16 a little fiddly, but I enjoy it. The overall atmosphere is intriguing and the basic premise of defending Earth from alien scum is a classic.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good ends. Manual air combat is lackluster, feeling unresponsive and offering few options other than to bring more firepower to the table and win the resulting slugging match. This is only a minor complaint, however, as it serves its purpose and air combats can be autoresolved if one wishes.\n\nGround combat is where I was truly disappointed. Again, I don't care if it's "faithful" to a 1994 game or not, this game came out in 2014 and those are the standards I hold it to. At first glance, it seemed a little reminiscent of Silent Storm, with action points (TUs) and Snap Shots, Aimed Shots, Bursts, etc. It lacks Silent Storm's depth, however, and yet also somehow manages to exacerbate Silent Storm's worst flaws of unfathomable line-of-sight/vision/detection rules, a tedious RNG overwatch system, and an AI which knows just how to exploit both to maximize player frustration. Added to this is a downright awful movement system, which punishes you for any kind of movement and making many tactical maneuvers virtually impossible.\n\nMy favorite moment thus far is when I was stacked up to assault a downed UFO's cockpit. Because of the frustratingly punishing movement/TU limitations, only my two soldiers immediately on either side of the door had enough movement to open the cockpit doors, run inside, and still get a shot off at the occupants (grenading was impossible, both because of the way the doors were set up and the even MORE punishing TU requirements for grenades). I had to make sure they ended their turn at the doors in order to get a full turn's movement the next turn, meanwhile, the rest of the squad covered the door from behind cover elsewhere. So, naturally, during the AI turn the aliens pop out of the cockpit to take a shot and then pop back in, Silent Storm style. During one of these, one of my guys gets an RNG interrupt - which I have no control over - and unloads his machinegun... directly into one of my stacked-up assaulters, despite being BESIDE the door, out of the line of fire! KIA.\n\nMaybe the game is going for some kind of wacky "Haha, see how many hapless idiots you can turn into cannon fodder" theme, but the detailed service records explaining that my soldiers are Soviet VDV or British SAS with combat experience in Northern Ireland seems to undermine the notion that my soldiers are supposed to be high-mortality idiots intended to be thrown at the aliens like disposable meat shields.\n\nI like that the strategic layer and overall atmosphere of the game are so much deeper and more intricate than the new XCOM, but the tactical gameplay is so painfully backward that it drains any real fun from the experience. Masochists and 1994 nostalgists might get a kick out of it, but anyone else is advised to just go reinstall Fallout Tactics or Silent Storm instead.","February 23, 2015","false","4.4"," 48 of 85 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","48","85","3","3"

It aimed to be a modern day remake of the original 'XCOM: UFO Defense', also know as 'UFO: Enemy Unknown' in Europe.\n\nXenonauts has stayed true to the original, plus expanded on it. Everything that was great about the original XCOM is here and even better. The UI is very nice and clean, Air and Ground Combat both feel great, and base/research/production management is very fun as well.\n\nEdit 1: Now that the game is released, I can finish this review. From when I first made this review, there's been quite a few changes and much balancing, which made an already fun TBS even more so. My only real complaint is that the soldiers stat generation has had its minimum lowered, so when starting a new game or recruiting a new soldier, you often get soldiers with annoyingly low Time Units(TU for short).\n\nThe only saving grace is that they changed how much TU's shooting costs. Instead of a flat number, it's a percentage of their max TU's. This means that no matter how few TU's you have, you can still rally off as many shots as a high TU character. However, movement TU cost is still a flat number, so low TU will greatly restrict how far you can go, and if you want to shoot and move, you'll have a hard time with low TU's.\n\nThey also nerfed some of the armor and the shield. The shield is the biggest in my opinion. I used to love having two soldiers with shields, but with its small nerf, they start to become a liability far sooner than before. There IS a shield upgrade, but you get that option LONG after the first shield becomes a liability. Doesn't help that they nerfed the pistol pretty hard too.\n\nWith the release version I tend to drop the shield pretty quickly, and I rarely use the pistol due to its poor accuracy and range.\n\nAnyway, enough with complaining. Despite the whining, this game is still incredible. If you like XCOM and/or Turn Based Strategy games, then this is definitely a game you'll need to pick up.\n\nEdit 2: I made a mistake in the first paragraph. Xenonauts was not announced before XCOM: Enemy Unknown.","October 8, 2013","true","68.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If your soldiers are fast, they can shoot their weapon several times, then run. Or shoot and move and shoot again.\n\nThe overwatch system. You just point your soldiers in the right direction and leave them some time units, and they'll shoot reactively when they see something.\n\nResearch. This could be better integrated, but the basic idea is that you need to acquire specific alien technology to study and thereby improve your equipment.\n\nDifficulty levels. I'm playing on easy right now, and it is in fact easy. A small challenge in places, but if I'm a bit careful, I don't lose soldiers. Higher difficulty levels are progressively harder and require more care to get through.\n\nThe midsides:\nEnemy variety is okay. You've got normal mooks, regenerating enemies, androids, reavers (scary), fliers, and psions (also scary). Enough to keep you on your toes, but I rarely see much difference between androids and baseline Caesians.\n\nWeapon variety is a strict progression on one axis, with different purposes on another. Shotgun to scatter laser, for instance; rifle to laser rifle to plasma rifle. Armor progression is similar at first, but branches out a bit later, letting you choose between medium armor, flying scout armor, and walking tanks. The variety is just sufficient, no more.\n\nThe controls are mostly intuitive -- but who thinks about controls unless they're bad?\n\nThere's a decent number of maps, but you'll start recognizing them after a bit. For standard missions, I think there's like industrial, city, arctic, farmland, and desert, with about three maps each. That means you've got good odds of seeing a duplicate after just a few missions. And terror missions always take place in a city. Enemy bases have more variety, but you're not likely to see that many alien bases. I would have liked to see procedurally generated terrain, but that's difficult and time-consuming to create.\n\nThe downsides:\nThe UI is a little clunky for switching between levels (upstairs/downstairs).\n\nThere are occasional bugs -- the other day, I encountered a ghost Caesian. It wasn't aligned on tile boundaries, my soldiers could overlap it, and I couldn't shoot it. I had to run away. There are occasional crashes, too. Not quite stable enough for me to recommend ironman mode.\n\nIt's somewhat expected in this kind of game, but losses can snowball. You spent a lot of time building up your forces, then got a full team wipe and lost half your equipment in a bad mission. At that point, you should maybe scrub the campaign and start over. You research things in the wrong order and things get a lot more difficult than they would otherwise be.","February 17","true","83.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I say this to raise awareness if you find yourself buying this game and enjoying it, as they've taken huge steps in listening to and incorporating feedback from the community.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst off, it's inevitable that XCOM will be mentioned at some point, so lets start there. Yes, you're likely to enjoy this if you enjoyed the original XCOM games. Xenonauts began as a passion project on Kickstarter for those wanting to relive the original XCOM experience. It stays mostly true to XCOM without replicating it, even expanding on originally lacking features like interceptor combat, which is now much more involved.\n\nSome elements of this game work in real-time (aerial combat, although you can pause), but the majority of your time (~85%) will be spent in grounded, turn-based missions. I should mention that both ground and aerial combat missions are skip-able, but of course you'll miss out on a lot of resources if you decide to pass on them. There  are  workshop (cheat) mods out there that allow you to essentially skip areas of gameplay you might not enjoy, so if you find yourself wanting to focus on the ground-based missions for example and ignore the Geoscape, you can pretty much do that.\n\nAbout aerial combat: it is, in my opinion, not that great. It's not particularly bad, but it doesn't feel fleshed out beyond the dodge and missile mechanics. I tend to think of it more like an optional mini-game that gives you a break from other points of strategy every now and then. On a normal run I found myself skipping most aerial combat scenarios with little to no penalty for doing so, and apparently that's fine. Although I didn't enjoy it personally, I'm glad I was given the option to skip it as seems a more experimental point of gameplay compared to everything else.\n\nGround combat is brilliant, and most things in the Geoscape are brilliant. You'll need patience and time to plan out your approach to the alien invasion, particularly since this game is a multifaceted strategy. By the end, you'll probably be managing several bases and many troops/employers/vehicles at the same time. For those reasons, this might be a game you need to stick to before moving on, and certainly not play if you're an amnesiac. That would leave you with an overwhelming amount of management to do and no memory on how to do it. Also, if you like your micro/macro organisation, you'll fall in love with this. In the micro sense for example, each soldier can be personalized by name and load-out (there's a pretty huge arsenal if you research weapons), with class-specific types you can set as defaults. One thing that's lacking which affects both ground combat and the Geoscape, is vehicles. Only one vehicle variant exists in this game and it requires a hefty amount of resources to get up and running. But... is it worth it? No. Even when you acquire it, you sacrifice two soldiers in exchange for having it on the ground. Unfortunately it isn't even worth two soldiers. In short, vehicles are pretty underdeveloped in this game and almost not worth bothering about. You can upgrade it into pure bad-assery way later on, but the climb to get there isn't economically efficient.\nAnother flaw: monsters and civilians sometimes have stupid AI. Aliens tend to be at their most deadly when they're throwing grenades at you non-stop, and the AI still has issues with pathing and awareness, as it tends to know where you are half the time without a good reason as to why. I was able to ignore these issues as the experience was mostly fluid.\nOh, as a side note; pretty much everything in ground combat is destructible.\n\nMy lord, the writing. It is monstrously good, and might honestly be the best experience with reading I've ever had in a game ever. And normally I  hate  taking time to read in games. Hell, Xenonauts even comes with it's own novella, yes, a freaking  novella  hidden away in the extra features. Now, I don't think it compares to the in-game text you get for completing research projects, but it's still kind of impressive that they actually hired an author to do it. One of the major things keeping me coming back to this game was the thought of completing a research project and being handed a bit more information of the alien invasion.\n\n\nSO, I recommend this game. It's worth the price, but most of all it's a lot of fun. A lot of issues posted in top reviews have been fixed/have fixes for download or are already within the game but need to be enabled. I suggest that upon starting the game you click the mod manager and enable the mod already downloaded which adds a ton of map variety.\nI'll close out saying Xenonauts has a lot of really awesome mods in the Steam workshop section, so at the very least give it a glance over before or after playing for your first time. The community is regularly patching this with updates even after the devs recently stopped, so there's also a community build if you switch over to beta.","March 5","true","95.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

But with Xenonauts I broke that trend, and the defilement team deserves every penny. The game is a brilliant spiritual successor to X-Com. It has its improvements over the original games, however any seasoned veteran of the games will be able to take to this as if they were right at home.\n\nThe new and improved air combat system is also a welcome addition. Though at times it can seem a bit dumb, having to micro your ships to fly directly at the enemy ships is a bit weird (when you click on them they adjust to their flight path but that's rarely what you want)\n\nI would suggest anyone who lives X-Com buy this game.

I don't review things normally, but I find this game interesting enough to do one regardless.  I won't arbitrarily assign number values, I'll should post my thoughts on a few areas.  My review is mostly based on comparisons with other games in the genre, so to speak.\n\nTo help you all learn what I am talking about, XCOM refers to the recent Firaxis game, while X-Com refers to the significantly older Microprose game that inspired both this and XCOM.\n\nLooks:  I imagine that most people today might be taken back by the "cheap" 2d graphics and general lack of flashy-ness.  You need to realize that the simple ui and graphics really help make the game look clean for modern audiences, while maintaining the feel of the original X-Com.  The UI does a remarkably good job at allowing you to understand what is going on (which I think is the worst way that the original X-Com has aged).  The game also has a decent variety of environments to look at, which helps evoke the sense of a global war as you battle among the ruins of downed UFOs from Middle-Eastern deserts to downtown Edinburgh.  That said, the graphics often seemed underwhelming when compared to the action taking place (something that XCOM did a great job of fixing I think).  This is a minor gripe though, and the graphics in the game do a great job of letting you know what's going on while giving a good sense of the era the game takes place in.\n\nGameplay:  Being someone who has played a great deal of both X-Com and XCOM, Xenonauts does a great job of "fixing" a lot of the things that were broken about the original game.  One my biggest gripes while playing through XCOM is that while it was fun, I never really felt the same sense of horror that X-Com inspired.  Instead, I felt that I had a squad of colorful (literally) superheroes out of an action movie kicking alien ♥♥♥.  While that's a blast, it is quite different from the creepy atmosphere and balls-breaking difficult gameplay of the original (and yes, I have played XCOM on difficulty levels higher than Normal).  For me, Xenonauts captured the utter feeling of terror that the original had in the tactical game.  It also fixes a lot of the dumb micromanaging of the original (like having to re-equip soldiers for each mission), as well as making certain tactics unnecessary (you no longer have to send suicide rookies through doors because you can open them finally!).  They also added in a second victory option on the tactical map, where you only need to hold a UFO for a certain amount of time before winning, which eliminates the need to go on those time consuming hunts for the lone alien cowering in a corner somewhere (which you can still do if you really want to).  Xenonauts also brings back X-Com's basebuilding and geoscape game, as well as (I found at least), vastly improving the interceptions.  Finally, they added in the very nice option of simply authorizing airstrikes against downed UFOs instead of sending in the grunts, which makes the game feel much less dumb at moments.  If you are a fan of X-Com, be warned about a number of changes they made though.  In order to make you reliant on council funding, they removed the efficiency with which you could produce and sell items for cash.  I believe they also removed many of the end-game options that make enemies irrelevant (such as blaster-bombs), although I could be wrong since I have not played this enough to say for certain.  If you are neither of those groups and this is just something on the front page of steam, this game uses an adjustable speed real-time global strategy map where you plop down new bases and send interceptors and strike squads as you try to save the earth from a massive alien invasion in the 1970's.  When intercepting UFOs, your fighters can either autoresolve the battle or you can command a quick realtime interception minigame.  When you send choppers full of your troopers to take downed UFOs, the game switches to being a squad-based, turn-based tactics game.  The goal initially is to just find out about the aliens and get the weapons that can take them down, all while surviving the invasion, and the gameplay does a pretty good job of making you feel that.  If you haven't played any game related to this one, you might find it difficult to figure out what everything means and how to play, but I might put a total noob's guide or something soon to help those in that boat.\n\nPrice:  I know many of are looking at that price and saying that the game can't possibly be worth it.  $25 for a 2d game that is basically a clone of a game that has already been cloned?  MADNESS!  If you are on of those types of people, I imagine you also seldom buy any game that doesn't seem like a sweet deal to grab, so just wait for a sale if it seems to strike your fancy.  If you like XCOM or X-Com, this game is different or better (respectively) enough for you to probably enjoy it.  If you don't mind throwing down the dosh for the game right now, I can tell you that as a fan and owner of both X-Com and XCOM, this game is a great addition to the collection.  Since it changes a lot of issues that X-Com has while remaining in its style, it feels nicely different from XCOM and just superior to X-Com.  If you own neither of those games, this is still a great game in its own right.  It's also one of the few games in recent memory that hasn't hit me with buyer's remorse.\n\nConclusion:  Xenonauts is really different from XCOM, since it plays much more like X-Com.  At the same time, it really improves on the old X-Com formula, making it worthwhile that way.  It might look a little weird, and if you aren't used to it, it will likely feel incomprehensible, but it isn't impossible to figure out what is going on.  If youa re interested in the premise, I think it does a great job of executing on that front (much more so than X-Com ever did).  If you don't normally buy games at full price, wait for a sale to hit like you always do anyways, but if you don't mind it, this game is worth the full price in my book.","June 18, 2014","true","3.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The simplest way to describe Xenonauts is that it keeps the spirit of the original game and adds many improvements.\n\nIf the only game related to X-Com games you know is Firaxis XCOM, then know that XCOM doesn't really have much in common with the original game, despite the name, as at the core they are fundamentally different games. Asking which one is better is like asking whether apples or steaks taste better - some will like one better, some the other, and some will like both while knowing that they are simply different. And the same applies to XCOM and Xenonauts, they are different, and whatever you learn when playing XCOM is best to forget when playing Xenonauts. XCOM is like a Hollywood action move: It's flashy, with explosions, brave superheroes who eventually defeat the aliens with style while uttering their lines, avenging their fallen mates who the aliens had the nerves to inevitably kill early on. And if you like action movies, it doesn't really matter that it's cliched, gamey, doesn't often make much sense, and is hardly "Enemy Unknown" when somebody pops up to explain everything three times the moment you encounter something new. Xenonauts is like a thriller: You don't really know what is going on, and may get lost if you don't pay attention, or may figure it out only later. Things start in a miserable situation, the aliens keep their pressure until the very end, people die when mistakes are made and sometimes even if not and they are merely unlucky. The war is all but lost and hopeless, but it has to be fought, because there's no option and it may be won despite all the losses and setbacks. And that is exactly one of the charm's of Xenonauts - anyone can win a fight that is meant to be won, but it's an entirely different matter if the victory is not given away merely for a pretense of effort, and aliens in Xenonauts do not show up to be just target practice. In Xenonauts, you have to deserve your victory, and the game won't hesitate to utterly defeat you if you fail to deliver. But if you do win, then it is the sweetest of victories, because it was you that made it happen despite everything. And it doesn't matter that there were no cutscenes, because the best story was inside your head.\n\nAnd if you have never heard of any X-Com or XCOM for whatever strange reason, then know that Xenonauts is a great game, but it is not a game for everybody. If you expect casual play, you'll lose quickly. If you judge a book by its cover, you'll be disappointed by the lack of cutscenes or flashy graphics. If concepts such as "planes with only heavy missiles can't win against nimble fighter UFOs", "soldiers in the open are likely to die", "aliens may attack from behind if that area has not been checked", "humans do not see well in the dark", "items need to be in hands in order to be used" or "your mouse has more than one button" remain a mystery to you, the game will end up being frustrating and "confusing", as there is no tutorial and the game does not spoon-feed information to the player, but rather just provides the information and expects the player to figure it out (or there's of course the manual, but it's 2010s, so nowadays it's much cooler to spend an hour on trial and error rather than skimming over a manual for a couple of minutes). But if you think about what happens, pay attention, are relentless and careful, and like to win because you are good, then this is a game for you.\n\nIn Xenonauts, aliens will keep you on the edge for a long time (unlike in X-Com, where it felt more like the aliens were just occassionally stopping by, and they will not wait forever until you research your next "priority" project as in XCOM). You will need to quickly manage setting up additional bases around the globe (wherever you want), expand your air force to hunt flying UFOs (and you really need to hunt them), research new technologies to try to keep up, manage your funds (which may soon get low if the funding regions decide you do a lousy job of defending them), and last but definitely not the least, equip and lead your soldiers to fight ground missions at downed UFOs, cities terrorized by aliens, alien bases (yes, plural) and defences of your own bases (yes, again, not necessarily just once) until the very end. Which, for many soldiers, may be their own personnal end, given they fight a superior enemy, and it is expected for soldiers to die throughout the entire game. Your soldiers have a selection of different equipment available to them, and it is up to you to choose it based on their strengths and weaknesses, and create tactics that will fit your style (there is no perks system giving soldiers "magic" abilities as in XCOM, it is the equipment and the ability to freely combine it that provide variety). And it is up to you to balance all of that.\n\nNo game is perfect, of course. First of all, I suggest you consider using the Community Edition, which provides additional bugfixes, tweaks and mods that alleviate some of the problems you might have with the vanilla game (such as a relatively low number of maps). As said, there's no tutorial, so you need to either figure it out using common sense and information in the game (Xenopedia, tooltips), at least glance at the manual, or watch a (good) YouTube video. The game is quite long, so it may feel a bit repetitive if you try to finish it quickly (but there are airstrikes to help with that). You may also easily end up in a death spiral if you do poorly (but then you shouldn't do way too poorly, it either means that you are too careless and do not pay attention, or you should play on easier difficulty). The alien AI is probably the smartest I have ever seen in any X-Com game (in other games they often just wait or wander aimlessly), which may prove annoying if you do not expect that: Alien leaders will often take defensive positions (here the aliens actually care about their UFO) and mindless attacks will often end up in a carnage, and occassionally the aliens are way too smart (the aliens do not cheat as such, but generally smart AIs are hard to do without the AI getting access to internal information, and even though it usually makes the game better, in some cases it may tip the scales of the AI's decision making into doing the unlikely). Finally, the grid structure of the battlefield leads to some unintuitive (even though not buggy) line-of-sight/fire issues, for example round shapes such as UFO hull are rather poorly mapped to the grid.\n\nBut none of that matters much if you immerse yourself into the game and let it to scare you during night and terror missions, to make you feel overwhelmed in desperate fights, to get shocked when your soldiers die, to organize your force the way you want and make progress in the hopes of overcoming the enemy, and to let you feel the joy when you make that happen.\n\nAll in all, if you like X-Com games, or if you like games that actually challenge you, this is a game for you.\n\n(Note that I do not use Steam for launching the game, so the number of hours played is way way off. I've probably spent few hundred hours on just playing the game, and since the game has hooked me enough to make me contribute to the Community Edition, I'm probably past a thousand.)","January 20","true","21.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Xenonauts offers you a lot more in the way of tactical planning and decision making, while still leaving room for you to fall into your own pattern and strategy for successful missions.  The variety of weapons is a huge upgrade from X-COM's typical Pistol/Rifle/Heavy weapon, and the balance between the weapons is pretty spot-on; you can use whatever you like, provided you plan accordingly, a strike team of pure pistol-wielding xenonauts is totally viable.\n\nThe research text is flavorful and a nice addition, immersing you more in the world and the reality of the invasion while still offering some form of believability.  The geoscape is far more lively, with alien activity being broadcasted as "casualty reports" around the globe when left unchecked, and rather than a single UFO or a few on the same mission appearing, you get swarms of UFOs appearing all over the globe simultaneously, each operating on its own agenda.  This makes having a competent airforce not a luxury but a necessity.\n\nWhile the game is far from perfect, it still gave me literal days of playtime fun, along with a few agonizing losses and times of near rage-quitting.  Definitely a must play if you enjoyed any of the X-COM games, including the newer reboot.\n\nJust remember to close the door before you end your turn and keep your eyes peeled for reapers.","November 26, 2014","true","137.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

While there are a few thematic differences - the cold war era, and the names of organisations, aliens and objects being different (copyright evasion powers activate) - the game plays in an almost identical way - you can have multiple bases and troop craft, the interceptions are more interactive and still good, bases are viewed from above - and the tactical combat keeps up the level of tension fans will be wanting.\n\nI also want to praise the addition of civilian combatants. They're not amazing, but sometimes it's nice to see the rest of the world fight back.\n\nThere are a couple of UI issues that need to be resolved, but nothing that makes it a chore to play, or breaks the game.","June 15, 2014","true","10.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

For one, it has a really solid cover system that "just works" and doesn't get in your way. It adds suppression to improve your tactical choices. It also gets rid of human psionics and thus removes one of the biggest cheese-tactics there was in the original. In addition, there are no such things as "shoot around corner mini nukes" for either side. Very welcome!\n\nIn short, this game is every bit as much of a masterpiece as the original. It's graphic style is unique and gloomy and fits the setting perfectly.

I wore that demo out. Even though the demo only contained one map I was able to get hours and hours out of it due to the high difficulty and the complete lack of any tool tips or tutorial. Some decade later X-com got a reboot which was massively dissapointing to me. Discovering Xenonauts was like finding that girl from junor high who gave you your 1st kiss then lost track of in highschool, has grown up into a hottie who makes pizza from cratch and cuban sandwiches while wearing heels and an apron (also she regards you as her 1st love).\n\nXenonauts is what X-com's re-boot should have been. Big studio AAA titles are falling into the same trap that hollowood blockbusters have. The cost of production is so high that risky ideas (read as good ideas) get a pass for more tried and true formulas (I'm looking at you infinity sequal titles). I guess a bunch of younger folks who never played the insanely hard original may try Xenonauts because they loved the re-boot. Most of those people will probably hate this game. They are going to die and die and die and not understand the satisfaction of keeping an entire team of veterans alive or the dread of losing an old friend.\n\nXenonauts for what is it, and how it was dev, is 10/10. It's not just a carbon copy of old x-com, it's better in all the right ways without losing any of the exacting tactical nature of the original. The coldwar setting is sick and adds immersion for me (I'm a grey bush who remembers the end of the cold war). The writing is great and combined with the art really draws you in and  adds depth and flavor, yet can be completely ignored if nobody got time for that and just want to grind out another mission real quick. In fact lots of things in this game can be sorta glossed over or invested in as the particular player sees fit.\n\nThis is what I love most about this game. You are free to solve this puzzel however you want. Some players are going to master dog fighting and some folks will auto calculate every air battle. Some may read every bit of flavor text in the game and soak up all the small details, and others will have eyes for ruthless ground games only. Whatever you find enjoyable you can go deeper and whatever you don't enjoy, you can dial down and not have to go down that road.","March 14","true","102.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And that means it retains the brutality of the original while still being incredibly fun to play.\nThe graphics, while somewhat cartoony in places (notably cars) serve the art style well and convey the message of grimness throughout the game.\nSound is fine, but some noises I found hurt my ears with headphones. Other than that not much of note aside from the good soundtrack.\nUI is somewhat complicated but easy to learn, while providing most of the vital information to keep your guys from not dying a horrible, awful, painful, and plasma-y death.\nGameplay, the big G.\nIt feels like X-COM. Not in a shoddy knock off way, but in a "The devs knew what they were doing when they made this glorious game graced by the almighty Gaben himself" way, complete with Time Units, Panics, and a boatload of potential ways for your poor plasma sh-err great soldiers to die. This includes fully playable air battles (which I recommend autoresolving for the most part), terror missions, abductions, and my love/hate favorite, the classic base defense.\nHave I mentioned how hard the game is? It is pretty difficult, but if you have played X-COM style games before, you will know what you're doing, but still get completely and utterly pimp slapped if you act like your soldiers are Rambos and Rambas.\nAll in all, get it, or get plasma-ed.","September 28, 2014","true","68.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Okay so my initial impressions of this game was that it was the first true original xcom successor, and if you felt enemy unknown released in 2011 was too simple or just not enough like the original, you'll find all of that here and more. From watching this game very early on in development to full release, I can full heartedly say that it has come a long way, and the devs have certainly done a wonderful job making the game into all it could be. Some things in the game are still a little wonky, however it all has to do with the RNG of shooting which is to be expected in any pecentage based strategy game so I can't fault it for that as the original even had it. This game has a very wide enemy variety, and a fully interactive dogfighting minigame when shooting down enemy space ships of also wide varieties. Also this game captures my personal favorite part of the original xcom, which the 2011 verson didn't even come close to, and that is the dynamics of the game. In this game everything you do effects the way the game plays, if you don't go to certain missions or let certian abductions, bombings, etc happen, the enemies will gain the upper hand. And if they gain the upper hand instead of having a linear, boring experience like the 2011 game, you will have a very replayable strategy game that will keep you coming back to see your friends and loved ones get blown to pieces by plasma blasts. All in all this game is truly an example of what an early accsess game should be like, and has lived up to all my expectations for an xcom like successor.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\nIf you enjoy complex strategy games, I definitely recommend this title, however if you are looking for an easier stategy game to casually play, you won't find it here as even the normal difficulies can be extremely punishing for even experienced players. I personally love this game and hope to see its added modding community only produce more content for it.","September 15, 2013","true","75.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Then get this game.\n\nNever played the original X-COM: UFO Defense, but enjoy turn-based strategic games like Chess, Jagged Alliance, etc.? Get this game.\n\nLiked X-COM: Enemy Unknown (2012) but felt it had flaws in terms of strategic depth? Then get this game.\n\nLiked X-COM: Enemy Uknown (2012), but thought it was too hard? Don't get this game.\n\nThought X-COM: Enemy Uknown (2012) was too ugly? Don't get this game.\n\n\nYou're looking a very fine turn-based strategy squad base assault with base construction elements. It's slow, even a little dry sometimes, but definitely atmospheric. You'll need some wits and a whole lot of patience, but damn is it rewarding.\nEspecially recommended for those who liked the original X-COM, because it is basically the remake we hoped we'd get in 2012.\n\nIt's easy to compare XCOM:EU to Xenonauts, but it's also a little unfair: EU tried to do something new and accessible, and actually delivered quite well. In fact the only real complaint I had with the game was that it had bad support from devs, but that's because it had a console release and those don't patch easily. Regardless, Xenonauts comes out on top easily compared to EU, simply due to the superior basic design which was, for the most part, copied from the original XCOM.\n\nSome significant changes from the original:\n- Interceptor battles are now a mini-game with significant depth. An auto-resolve mode exists, but it is now actually a fun and worthwhile strategic element of the game (well beyond rock/paper/scissors);\n- Troops can now easily be organized by class equipment sets;\n- Workshops aren't profitable! Money management is very tricky;\n- During combat, HUD/Interface changes allow for easier troop and time-unit management;\n- During combat, obstacles are calculated in an intuitive and accurate way (something that looks to use virtual voxels to calculate whether the line of fire is obstructed. Very effective!);\n- There are now shields, which have 80HP (compared to a soldier's average starting HP of around 50) and can be combined with a pistol or a stun-baton;\nEtc.\n\nConcluding, for those familiar with the original XCOM, this is an interesting alternative frmo one perspective, or a viable upgrade from another. Personally, I consider it the latter.\n\nI score it 8.5/10 and consider it one of the best games I've ever played, notwithstanding the fact that it doesn't have the virtue of originality. Nonetheless, its execution is extremely refined and it's gameplay is enormously interesting.","April 6, 2015","true","73.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/223830/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","Full disclosure: I'm writing this review from the POV of someone who's certainly heard of but never played any of the Xcom games before starting this one.\n\nXenonauts is a strategy game where you command the titular international military group tasked with defending Earth from alien invasion in the late 1970s. It's supposed to be a remake of the original X-Com set during the Cold War, and as far as I know it's a pretty faithful recreation right down to the battlefield, base placement and troop equipment micromanagement. It seems deeper than, say, the newer XCOM series, not that that would make the newer games bad.\n\nFor me personally, it feels more like a classic Doctor Who serial without the Doctor or indeed almost any sense of optimism. (It doesn't really take advantage the fact that it's set during the Cold War - often you'll have NATO and Warsaw Pact soldiers working together in the same squad.) This game can be pretty brutal at times. The only thing that will save you from the nasty, aggressive aliens is attacking them wherever possible with maximum firepower, then stealing their stuff so your scientists can reverse-engineer it into even more firepower.\n\nI quite like it myself, and it's an impressive indie effort, so I'd say it's good, but given its problems I would only call it good. Let's hope the sequel[www.xenonauts2.com] will be great.\n\n\nMy other observations:\n\nAir combat is "aces", perhaps the best expansion over the original X-Com, though it's 3v3 max and takes some getting used to. Make sure you don't insta-deploy to the first sight of UFO activity before formulating some sort of tactic for the situation, and make sure you know your aircrafts' limits before sending them out to fight.\n\nBreaching downed alien ships can become tedious - the devs should have added back doors, side entrances and/or destructible hull points to at least some of them. You pretty much need explosives, shields and/or expendable soldiers because at least some of the aliens will have holed up inside and they will shoot the hell out of your troops.\n\nTo my understanding, the original X-Com eventually gave you tools to counter psionic attacks and develop your own. Xenonauts doesn't seem to give you anything of the sort except letting your braver troops/those who survived previous psychic attacks resist them more effectively.\n\nBullet trajectories aren't really modeled past your units' line of sight, from what I can tell. If you fire on where you know an alien is, but the alien is out of your LOS, it won't do anything unless you use projectile weapons such as rockets.\n\nLines of sight themselves can be weird. Soldiers seem to have a difficult time throwing grenades over objects, but alien forces seem to be able to see your forces often before you can see them.\n\nWorkshop support is truly this game's saving grace. There's already a number of mods that try to fix what I've described above.\n\nI would say this is a rather rough but ultimately enjoyable game for people who want a no-holds-barred slugfest with MiGs and M16s against invading aliens. It's certainly smoother around the edges for people who don't want to play the original, which is more than 20 years old at this point. It also seems more grim in tone than the original, but that could be just me.\n\nThe prequel novella included with the game is good, at least.\n\n\nTwo tips. Alien activity is punishing here, since they love to screw with humanity and since every violent act you fail to stop drains your support and therefore funding - this means air superiority is key. Get at least 3 bases up ASAP and make sure they cover at least a decent portion of the map. On that note, MiGs and enhanced torpedoes are some of the most important research projects in the earlygame, followed shortly by dropship tech. You can usually pick and choose where to send in the troops, but you need to be able to match your enemy in the air war ASAP. Noticing a pattern here?\n\nAlso, ground combat is usually challenging to the point where you want to avoid night missions until the lategame, and start avoiding industrial areas around the midgame. Automatic weapons in close quarters and dangerous enemy types that run up in your face mean things will get very messy. Of course, if that's what you want, don't let me stop you from staging Stalingrad With Aliens.","February 3","true","30.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Originally, I'm sure the developers thought they were making a xcom clone, and to be fair, they've tried their damnedest to do just that.

I don't think Chryssalids anymore, I think reapers. Sebilian and Caesan role off my tongue more easily than sectoid or mutan (whatever its called).\n\nXenonauts is a true alien invasion simulator, with all the inherent learning curves and complexity therein. You pick the placement of your first base, and go on from there, with some great tooltips for your first time round. Speaking of which, you will fail. Try as you might, there's a detail you overlooked, and you'll have a base attacked and destroyed by the aliens, or your chinook will be shot down after taking out an alien base.

I have played them all (UFO: After-X series, UFO: Extraterrestrials, XCOM, etc).\nIt takes the factors from the original and makes a few modifications, giving old players of the original (and TFTD!) a new challenge as well as making the same addictive gameplay accessible to a new generation (both with graphical and UI improvements).\n\n+UFOpaedia is in-depth and has good art. Adds immersion and a bit of humour (but never feels out of place).\n+BASE BUILDING DONE RIGHT!  None of that watered-down XCOM stuff here!\n+TIME UNITS (or their rough equivalent)!  None of this move/shoot boardgame-y junk! (Though I love boardgames, it was over-simplified).\n+Destructable terrain and an AI that knows when to heft a grenade (evil reminiscences of TFTD here).\n+A sensible economy.  The player can't abuse his workshop and is forced to yield results on the tactical side (though you can carpet-bomb UFO crashes and get 1/2 the value from the scrap if you're tapped out for ambulatory soldiers!).\n+Improved interception mechanics, with the option for manual control of the X-Y manuevering and engagement style, or simply an estimate and quick resolve mechanic, should you so choose.\n+Remarkably stable!  The original crashed on me just about as much, so no complaints here.  Also, there are auto-saves should this occur.  A real sanity-saver (even for the non-save scummer!).\n+A good random number generator that does not feel cheap or arbitrary.  Some serious consideration was put into it, as the same shot sequence (yeah, I scummed it to test) does not yield the same result or "seed".  Not a knock at XCOM, as even the Holy Jagged Alliance 2 has that.  This game just generates it fresh and, resultantly, keeps things fresh!\n+A good tech tree that makes sense and has a good variety. Even outmoded gear still has a situational reason for retention, making you carefully consider your composition.\n\nIn short, all the delicious fat and none of the calories.  The ONLY thing I would add would be Coop campaign multiplayer, but realize this to be a pipe dream.  However, examples of merging Strategic and Tactical in multi can be found in Sword of the Stars and Dominions 4...  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge?  I'll say no more.\n\nBuy it!!","August 13, 2014","true","57.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are many ways you can waste aliens from the comfort of your slowly flattening computer chair. What's Xenonauts all about then? Oh, it's a remake of the original XCOM: Enemy Unknown!\n\nLike the original XCOM, aliens invade, you shoot the aliens in the face, etc. Also like the original XCOM: It takes the ♥♥♥♥ing scenic route!!! Seeing through a game of Xenonauts will take a long, long time, and a lot of the time spent will occur in ground combat, where the idiots you're guiding through the ♥♥♥♥♥ town or the ♥♥♥♥ forest will need constant adjustment in order not to get blown up (and during the early game, your dudes will get blown up as much as the ones you're shooting, because this game is balls hard. Even on Normal.). The scenic route is made even more scenic-ier, because all the missions start to bleed through and look the same.\n\nIt's not all tedium - the game allows you to walk into the enemy's UFO, kill everyone inside, and hold it for five turns to win the mission automatically, which is a nice touch. The game is all about destructible environments, so you can take a squad of fast-moving shotgunners, blow a hole in the side of the UFO with a rocket launcher, and win a mission that way. There's all these neat little additions that fit nicely with the original's ethos (saving AP for return fire on aliens dumb enough to wander into firing range). There's also a few unconventional ones to make gameplay less pedantic and fussy, such as allowing unlimited flares on night missions. The developers COULD have not included them, making night missions extremely sucktacular engagements due to a very short LOS and with one soldier having to leave his gun in the dropship to be 'the guy who throws lights everywhere who is shot from behind by some extra-terrestrial ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hiding in a tree'. But they did, and you can throw as many as you want. Yay!\n\nSo it's kind of bland and it goes on for a long while (a campaign run is in the 50-100 hour ballpark). But it's a neat take on XCOM-style play, and mods are being added by the community to hammer out flaws. It's not going to replace the 2012 XCOM for me, but if you're looking for an update that captures the original very well, give this a shot.","February 5, 2015","true","7.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

The result is not a mere 1:1 copy, and much more than just X-Com with a better interface. It's a refinement of the original, keeping the brilliant and still enormously engaging core loop intact and polishing it to perfection.\n\nIf you never played the original X-Com games, don't even try. They are hard to get into, and thanks to Goldhawk, there is simply no need to wrestle with them anymore.

Don't buy it until they have released a few patches to fix it. Alien psychic abilities are way too powerful and you have no way to defend against them. Expert marksmen will miss more often than not, even with a high % chance to hit. And the worst (possibly a glitch, I'm not sure) is loading a saved game only to have the situation different than when you saved. The worst example, in my own experience, was when I had cleared an alien base. All except the last room. (the command room) Decided to take a break, saved my game and exited. When I came back and reloaded, suddenly my troops were surrounded by aliens that hadn't been there when I saved. I couldn't continue the fight because my soldiers were automatically killed every time I reloaded. This and a number of other balancing and glitch issues make the game no fun to play. A perfectly good playthrough can quickly and easily be ruined by bad code and balancing. Hopefully they fix these things soon because the game has promise, it's just not where it should be yet.","September 28, 2014","false","110.4"," 37 of 70 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","37","70","0","4"

It is a faithful modern remake.\n\nIt is not precisely the same--and every single change I have noticed is for the better. It provides additional control over some matters (such as UFO interception) that used to be purely automatic. Conversely, it automates some matters that used to be purely tedious, e.g., you are afforded an infinite supply of conventional infantry equipment. Like the third game, Apocalypse, you can view soldier stats prior to hiring. Like the original, soldiers are likely to die in one hit before you develop new armor, while aliens are noticeably resistant to less than concentrated fire. An "airstrike" option lets you deal with crashed UFOs when you cannot afford to send in the ground troops, and still nets a minor gain.\n\nComparing it to the AAA title is more difficult, as it has virtually nothing in common with that that it does not have with the original. The graphics are modern and pleasing but most resemble higher-resolution versions of Apocalypse's sprites, maintaining a mildly retro feeling.  While soldiers have "roles," these are less classes and more changeable, customizable equipment loadouts, allowing you to quickly change equipment according to any established preference. Soldiers gain stats with experience, but do not gain unique skills.","June 14, 2014","true","43.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The nations of the world fund the company, and based on how you defend each country the funding can rise or fall. This is done from a map view of the earth, showing your base, and craft as they start to appear. To begin, just a few small scout craft arrive, easily shot down. If you intercept the craft over land, sometimes it crash lands, forming a crash site you can investigate. Alternatively, the craft sometimes lands and you can send a dropship to the location. Once the dropship arrives at the site you enter an isometric view where you can move your units, and shoot at any aliens you encounter. This section is turn based, and the amount of movement you can make is determined by how many Time Units each unit has. Once you have cleared the site, you can recover alien technologies and take them back to your base to research, leading to the ability to manafacture new items. There are many other elements to both the management and tactical section of the game, which I won't spoil here.\n\nIf you're looking for a modern take or an evolution on this forumla, look instead into the excellent 2012 Fixaris reboot, XCOM: Enemy Unknown. This is a very different experience however, and I'd still throughly recommend trying the original. However Xenonauts now presents an interesting new third option. I've recommended the original to people, only to see them never really get into it thanks largely to the outdated interface. Xenonauts allows you to experiece the brilliance of the original, but tuned to remove those frustrations.\n\nFor example, one of the least enjoyable parts of the original was surely the inventory management. While I love the base management overall, manually replacing every last clip, medkit, rocket, grenade wore thin pretty quickly, especially when most of the items were cheap enough to never really be a concern. In Xenonauts, this is thankfully gone for most of the mundane consumables. Other areas which have been simplified include reloading, and using grenades. In X-COM, using a grenade was a series of actions, removing it from your belt, putting it in your hand, pulling the pin/setting the timer, throwing it. Each took a small amount of time units, and it was entirely possible to pull the pin, only to realise you didn't have enough time units left to throw it. While this did invoke exactly the feeling of panic it was no doubt supposed to, it was largely just frustrating. In Xenonauts all of this is just replaced with a single action with a single time unit cost. To my tastes, they developers have thankfully only simplified elements which probably needed it - it certainly doesn't feel dumbed down.\n\nIt might just be me, but Xenonauts does feel a little easier than UFO was. However, this really is no bad thing - UFO was punishingly difficult, and it wasn't unusual for newcomers to be in real trouble before even their first funding review. In Xenonauts, easy mode should allow new players to get a good long feel for the game before they start ramping up the difficulty.\n\nIf you loved UFO, or you enjoy classic tactical games, if you like retro graphics style, you'll most likely enjoy this greatly. It's such a closely tied remake of UFO it almost feels like I'm reviewing that, rather than Xenonauts - either way, I cannot recommend either one highly enough.","February 24, 2015","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There have been a ton of games that have tried to do what X-COM: UFO Defense (or UFO: Enemy Unknown) succeeded so well with back in '94.

Casualties are expected, and you feel like you are engaged in a true war with the aliens.\n\n2012's XCOM by Firaxis is fantastic--it plays well, it's easy to pick up, and it's fun.

I had six soldiers that survived more often than not (then again, I don't play the super high difficulties, so that might change things a bit).\n\nXenonauts puts you into a larger scale war, with dozens of troops at your command that you will need.

The graphics are similar, and almost and updated version of the mid-nineties hit.

I haven't played the X-Com games, new or old, but I have to say that something about the "look" of the new one turns me off, a bit.  While the AAA style of that game left a bad taste in my mouth, the old fashioned presentation of Xenonauts is quite refreshing.  The excellent paintings and graphics evoke a definite "X-files" atmosphere, and the soundtrack has an excellent atmospheric dread to it.  It is quite fun to send your squads through the map, clearing buildings and establishing perimiters, hunting down that lone bug-eyed freak who you just know is going to pop out and blast your guys with a burst of plasma fire.\n\nThe amount of detail and depth in the simulation is quite good, especially for fans of strategy games which are more complex.  Woefully, many games these days have a "press x to win" mentality, but this game doesn't.  You have to carefully manage your funds and figure out your own strategies.  Should you build a second base early on, to keep the Russians convinced that your organization can do it's job?  Or do you spend your disposable income on tricking out your North American base so that you can more efficiently capture alien tech?\n\nTo sum it up, it's a little bit of SWAT 2 and a lot of X-files, all rolled up into a wonderful old-school experience.","August 3, 2014","true","43.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/majorisoor/recommended/223830/","majorisoor","Major Isoor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/majorisoor/","453 products in account","Let me start this review off by saying that this game is the spiritual successor to X-COM all of us fans of the original have been waiting for. Now, before all the Firaxis fans come out of the woodwork to make angry remarks, I have nothing against XCOM - from what I've heard it's a very good game in its own right; however from what I've seen (yes, I haven't yet had a chance to play it myself - yet - although the opinions I've heard/read and videos I've watched all seem to agree on this), the Firaxis remake changed the formula that made the original great into a more streamlined experience, that had been tailored to appeal to a larger audience - thus removing some of what made X-COM so enjoyable for some of us.\n\nHowever, Xenonauts has very much kept the formula the same. The basic gameplay mechanics are spot-on compared to what the original X-COM was like, except with some much needed touch-ups. First and foremost is the game resolution and interface - no longer will you need to suffer with an 800x600 resolution window and a clunky UI where the buttons don't reveal much ("What does this do? Oh I just placed some primed C4 at my soldier's feet"), and the interface taking up a third of the screen! Xenonauts has really improved these aspects and honestly, I really think that this alone makes Xenonauts worth considering, due to the sheer increase in playability that has resulted by actually having a nice, clean interface that didn't come straight out of the 1990s.\n\nSecondly, there are the combat improvements. They've really changed up the air combat in this game from what was in the original, and although I acknowledge that it's not to everyone's taste, it's certainly a lot closer to it than what X-COM's air combat was like, to be quite honest! All you really need to take into account are the manoeuvres (roll left/right and afterburner, primarily) for each plane and once you've gotten the hang of timing them and avoiding enemy fire, you'll be dropping those UFOs like flies in no time! (Although, don't mistake this for a lack of difficulty - some of the UFOs that get sent down to earth can be quite punishing!)\nAs for the ground combat, not all that much is different from the original X-COM: soldiers are nothing more than fodder (don't grow attached and restart the game if you lose some; they're all expendable and you should always have a couple of Chinooks' worth rotating in and out of active duty, so you've always got some skilled backup soldiers in case a mission goes bad) who can all be killed by a single well-placed round by an alien if they're unlucky (it's always a "lucky shot" if the aliens happen to get you - ALWAYS ;) ), so using cover and smoke is very important. On a similar note, one of the things that Goldhawk have added to ground combat is a suppression system, where if your rounds miss the aliens (or vice versa) but either hit their cover or whizz by near them, they will become suppressed; meaning that they will drop to a crouch, will be unable to perform reaction fire in your turn and will have reduced TUs (Time Units) in their following turn.\n\nAs for cons, I must say there aren't many. I'd say the only real cons are are there's not a HUGE variety of the randomly-assigned nationalities - although there's still quite a lot - and former units that help add some background to your soldiers, as well as the variety of generated maps being rather more limited than what was in the original X-COM. Although again, this isn't a great issue unless you replay the game a lot (but then again, who wouldn't?). However, due to the fact that modding this game has been made to be quite easy, there are community-made mods out there that remedy both of these cons.\n\nIn summary, quite frankly I'm no longer able to recommend the original X-COM to people, simply because THIS exists, and that it's regular X-COM, but with some really nice improvements. If you've been hanging out for X-COM but want something a touch less dated, then definitely pick this up! I'm honestly very happy I Kickstarted this game a while back and I consider the extra money I sink into the game by buying gift copies for friends to be money well spent.","September 8, 2014","true","178.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are a few minor bugs I've noticed with the UI, but nothing showstopping.\n\nThe only weak points I see are that the tactical locations are all very similar - they're using prebuilt tile maps and not randomly generating locations - it breaks the immersion a little bit when you  realize you've played the same map on a previous play. The dog-fighting mini game isn't very fun and you don't seem to gain anything by not using Auto Resolve. The Civilian AI could be a better too, as they seem to just run around in random patterns without any real objective or tactics. Keeping yourself in the black seems a little bit too difficult as well - but they provide full modding ability if you want to tweak any of the games parameters to tune the difficulty.\n\nThose points aside, I really love this game. I enjoy approaching it like a roleplaying game - naming all my soldiers and coming up with Cold-War-Esque code names for my bases, dropships, and vehicles.\n\nHighly reccomended for fans of deep strategy or tactical games.","September 18, 2014","true","80.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Since 2000 there has been so few of these really. Original X-com but updated. I've forgotten how much fun it is to individually equip tens of soldiers. Ground battles are as dangerous as they should be, air battles are innovative. Reminds be a bit of star wars rebellion space battles which was an excellent concept. But it's faster and more exciting.\n\nRealism is there and it's not been sacrificed in order to maintain game balance. Your tank is cheap and overpowering. If not very accurate. I've yet to discover many aspects of the game, I'm not googling stuff to gain advantage so I don't want to share my other guesses about the tactics. I might be wrong after all.\n\nThere can be many additions for the game and from the start screen I understand that it is highly moddable. Which means a high replay value. I'm sure modders will add many fascinating stuff.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend if you are a turn based strategy fan. If you are new to the gendre you might find it a bit old school but trust me, you will love it after you spend 15 mins in your first pass and will want to start again the game.\n\nIt's not for casual gamer obviously. Even though it's not very hardcore, you still need some time to go through all the way and you need to be a patient wolf.

Do you want a tactical game where you make all the choices? Do you want to have a mission, everyone dies but doesn't destroy your game?\nThis game is for you! Xenonauts has been around for a while and it is aging well with the mods making it better.  The best example being is the improvement in lore and the extra explaining the progress in the game for both you and the aliens.\n\nThis game is basically the remake of the original X-Com, you control everything in your base which you NEED to control, not to worry about petty stuff like fuel, food and who got friendzoned by the hot accountant.  Instead your job is to control the men, control where to defend, who to send, what weapons given, what research to look into, what to invest, airpower, tanks or infantry equipment and where to even locate your base, 2nd and if able your 3rd.  Aliens come in a variety of ways, while the early game is somewhat bland, you do face 2 types which require certainly different tactics. Things will pick up in the mid game and things will get much harder, crazier and you will be expected to win. When Aliens begin to have the numbers, they will strike you back and destroy your base if you are not careful, soldiers are the key.\n\nThis game is hard, on any diffulty expect to lose men and women left and right, many will not survive the hordes of Aliens which will be BRUTAL AND UNFORGIVING. You will make bad decisions, you will falter, you will be blamed for things out of your control. But Xenonauts are responsible to protect the world. Also General of the Xenonauts Program.

Xenonauts strives to be the spiritual successor of the original game. It brings a little more of everything and streamlines features that should have been in X-Com in the first place, while simultaneously removing certain elements. Thankfully the story doesn't completely retread the original game, and opts to create its own alien backstory, which is fun to experience.\n\nThe story takes place in the Cold War era, where everyone stops fighting and bands together due to the alien threat. Cue in the Xenonauts, a world-funded organization to counter the exterrestrials, study their technology, and adapt it for our own use. As the months go by, the aliens grow ever bolder, sending bigger and better ships, as though they are adapting to our own environment. Their numbers seemingly countless, they must be stopped, one way or another.\n\nSince the game is basically X-Com, I'll just outline some of the changes and what i think of them. The following are changes I thought were good:\n-All your loadouts are saved, and you can create your own custom loadouts and quickly equip soldiers to match that loadout with the press of a button.\n-Shields are a great item to have, and are much appreciated. Sadly you can only use 1-handed weapons with them.\n-Simultaneous movement. 'Nuff said.\n-Able to launch ships and soldiers while injured/low on fuel.\n-Civilians help you out! Suddenly the world doesn't feel as lonely as before.\n-UFO designs are varied and interesting.\n-I haven't seen aliens forever camp in one spot!\n-Walking consumes 3TU instead of 4TU, letting you scout about 33% further.\n-You are given all basic weapons for free in unlimited quantities.\n-Good tiles, though some art is a little off, like the portraits.\n-Enjoyable new story.\n-Air combat is very involved, though I suck at it. Also, they will run from your fleets, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n-Airstriking is great. I don't want to do every UFO mission.\n-Showing radar coverage is great. Makes me feel not-wasteful.\n-Stun rockets and grenades are great, and can be obtained early.\n-There's much less need of live aliens.\n-You are automatically refilled on supplies when the mission ends, thus you can fly multiple missions in a row in a single flight.\n-360 vision suit is awesome.\n-Easy to edit the game (though poorly documented).\n\nThese are the changes that I feel could use some improvements:\n-Holy balls there's so many aliens! They always come in waves, multiple times a week, and the likelihood of one getting away is high.\n-Therefore there are a bazillion ground missions you could end up doing if you don't airstrike them.\n-Your aircraft are limited to 2 missiles. Considering the volume of UFOs that attack the world simultaneously, this problem is magnified.\n-All aircraft have considerable monthly fees. You don't even get a refund for decommissioning them.\n-Explosives destroy equipment upon death, which strongly discourages their use. Their blast radii are also way lower, further discouraging their use.\n-Aliens do not suffer from morale problems. I miss the feeling of knowing the aliens are panicking.\n-There is no means to train against psionics short of experiencing it first hand.\n-Aliens do not need to spot you before they can start blowing your mind.\n-No mind control or blaster launchers for your troops. Those were fun!\n-Burst fire got removed from most weapons. Those that do have it consume too many TUs.\n-The maximum accuracy on any shot is 95%, even at point blank range. You can and will miss on the 95%.\n-Weapons consume much more TU on average compared to X-Com, so you rarely get many shots on a full TU bar (not counting machine guns).\n-New weapons completely replace old ones. There are no TU or accuracy differences.\n-Most weapons are 2-handed now, removing many potential combinations that could have been fun.\n-Destructible terrain plays much less of a role. Stray shots rarely destroy stuff, and high TU-shots means creating your own entrance is rarely worthwhile.\n-Lack of instant movement. When you start to do dozens of missions, the time spent watching things move really adds up.\n-Maps are not procedurally generated. I saw multiple same maps in the same game.\n-Overhead map is gone.\n-You can't earn money through item production. Thus engineers are a constant drain on your funds, and they will never turn a profit.\n-There's very little stuff to buy and sell. Money is very tight in this game.\n-You cannot use alien artifacts. I miss being able to grab a dead alien's cannon and use it against his buddies.\n-You cannot fire in the air in a flying suit. So much for death from above.\n-As odd as this sounds, Xenonauts might be too long. It's very difficult to beat in one sitting, which is discourages replaying the game a bit. The fourth tier weapons might be overkill.\n-Sometimes crashes on Win 10.\n-The sarcastic scientist isn't very funny.\n\nAs far as X-Com clones go, Xenonauts is probably the closest I've played that stays close to the original formula. It's a lot closer than the official XCOM: Enemy Unknown. However some of the changes they made oddly made the game less fun, such as the lack of mind control and blaster launchers. I don't deny these made the game much easier, but darn it, I just want to obliterate the battlefield and rain death from the skies. I like it a lot better than UFO: Extraterrestrials. I'm rather curious how they would write for a sequel to this game. By the end of the game you gain access to exceedingly powerful technology (infinite power??), and I can't imagine where they'd go from there. I give Xenonauts a 8.5/10. It's not without problems but is certainly a fine game.","October 22, 2015","true","41.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It feels like they took xcom and refined the UI and controls to make it less tedious and 'mis-click' prone, you don't have to build alien containment chambers and there's less chance of you making your solider move unintentionally. There's also a more in-depth interception mini-game that involves manuevers but I'm terrible at it.\n\nBut yeah if you like UFO Defense get it, or if you like the idea of UFO Defense but those early 90's style of gameplay don't appeal to you get it.","January 3","true","30.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is a brilliant game in its own right. I would recommend it for any hardcore strategy fan. It can be very unforgiving and will punish sloppy commanders in both the overall strategic conflict and in the combat missions themselves. You need to stay vigilant as you are truly fighting a superior enemy. The atmosphere and aesthetic is very interesting and while the graphics wont blow you away, there are some really nice renders with some lore which create a good picture in your mind of what you are facing even if the little models of the aliens and men arent very detailed in combat. The music is also nice and eerie when you have to face the enemy or soars when your interceptors thunder towards alien craft to shoot them down. The combat itself is tactically very satifying. It has lots of depth and once you take the fight to alien bases and they do the same to you things really start to get interesting. I have many memories of individual missions and the stories that unfold in them. The heroic rookie that pulls of an unbelievably feat of bravery and kills the last few aliens even as his comrades' bodies grow cold around him. The time when I dropped my rocket launcher at the other side of the map coz my man got wounded and then had to hoof it all the way back because i had cornered an alien commander and i was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and wanted to blow his ♥♥♥ to xeno hell. The bunch of ill prepared and under equipped soldiers who fended off an attack on my one and only base. There are plenty of moments like this. Buy it...and suffer!

I was really looking foward to this game and hoped an indie company could restore the glorius gameplay that was X-com -- but they fall short.\n\nThey really try to be true to the source material, but nothing quite meshes.  Graphics and animations are meh and the A.I. still makes those magical shots from 300 yards away, around the tree, under the car, through the two house windows -- killing your soldier instantly.  On the other end of the spectrum, you will miss the alien standing next to you, with a plasma shot gun and 99% CTH -- and if you are lucky enough to hit it, it will take a whopping 5% damage, while the other 7 of your soldiers will panic, drop their gun, and run right up to the enemies for a merciful quick killing.\n\nIt's very frustrating, to say the least.  So close, but so far.","December 6, 2014","false","30.2"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","18","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/recommended/223830/","kony4","kony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/","707 products in account","I like old UFO games and I like the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown (and EW add on and LW mod). I like tactical games. I like turn based games.\n\nAnd I really tried to like Xenonauts. I tried to like it because in theory it's a great game and because I wanted to justify spending money on it.\n\nBut I couldn't.\n\nEVERYTHING in this game is crappy. The first jarring thing is air combat. While in theory very good, it's just too bugged. About 5-10% of my air fights end up in my and enemy aircrafts circling around each other forever at the same spot, and if I try to move my plane it's an obvious suicide, so I can either do that or alt+F4. Other than this annoyance air combat is fine as it is, however, it's much better to just hit autoresolve and spare yourself some irritation from time to time.\n\nThe next extremely annoying thing is a field of vision of soldiers. It seems they are are incredibly shortsighted to a point they can't see anything over 10 meters away and miss targets that are five meters away by fvkking miles. The best tactic is to run at enemies to stand one meter away from them as in melee fight and then shoot them because otherwise your dvmb ♥♥♥♥♥♥ t4rded soldier will miss or even perhaps kill one of the other squad members shooting in a wrong direction by a 90 degrees. In addition, while the player is walking around the maps almost blindly, aliens always know where the player's units are. Even if they are on the other side of the map they already see you. So skreew you if you wanted to use a short vision against the enemy.\n\nThe next thing is that aliens just love "camping". A bunch of them will just sit in their aircraft with a closed door (so far I did not find a way to just blow upthe whole aircrafts with those t4rrds inside) and wait for you. If you run a soldier over there, they will murder him and close the door. In consequence you just put a bunch of soldiers around  the door, run with one tw4t through the fvkken door and get him shredded due to aliens' reaction fire and then shoot everything inside with the rest of the squad. Every fight same tactics. It's repetitive and boring.\n\nWhile your guys can't shoot anything 5 meters away, aliens seem to have better aim, but that's not even very noticeable. What is very noticeable is that sometimes they shoot from twice your vision or through walls which are impenetrable for your guys. Ultimate trolls.\n\nIt's also funny to see a fully armored combat vehicle to explode into pieces after a "bullet" from the enemy's gun hits it. It looks like a tank exploding after being shot by a gun. Why, what I don't even... either don't put such vehicles in the game if they seem too powerful or make them very expensive, but why put such a vehicle only to be as easily destroyed as a random soldier? Especially when the vehicle takes 6 slots, meaning you could put 6 soldiers on its place? Sure, it has a very powerful gun, but so what if it gets destroyed withing a few rounds.\n\nThe game also crashes like crazy on Linux. Loading new map... crash. Air combat... crash. New round... crash.\n\n\nI do not recommend this game to anyone. It's a waste of money, time and nerves. If you like old XCOM/UFO, then just play them or go ahead with the modern casualized version that is XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, which is still a great game on its own. Try out the Long War for more fun. But for your own good stay the heck away from a tvrrd that is Xenonauts. I wasted money that would buy me a few sacks of potatoes or some burgers, do not make the same mistake. Actually, don't even buy it when this game will get cheap and hits -75% sales. It's just unplayable.","April 10","false","6.3"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","18","34","0","0"

But as a big fan of the early X-com games as well as the 2012 reboot I was lured towards Xenonauts, it was one of those games that got under my skin, I kept looking at it on steam, on the fence as to whether it was worth the full asking price; I'd have to say after completing the campaign that it most definately is.\n\nWhere as the 2012 Firaxis X-com reboot was more of a reimaging, Xenonauts is an up tp date version of the older X-com games, bringing back time units and a whole list of other unit statistics giving the game a certain retro charm.\n\nThe main story arc of Xenonauts was brilliant, although it's another version of what has gone before, in my opinion it's a story which is more believable than those that have gone before it. The pseudoscience that backs it up is second to none and the tech tree that backs the game up brings some fantastic ideas with it, bulking up what we're used to in this type of game, again all of the research topics are given great entries, made to sound believable, as if all of the technology could potentially exist.\n\nThe new additions over the original 90's X-com are great:\n- Realtime air to air combat between your fleets of interceptors and UFO's\n- A variety of weapons for ground combat, shotguns, assault rifles, LMG's etc\n- Suppression effects for human and alien units\n- The ablilty to see a soldiers stats before you hire them\n- Flashbang grenades for assaulting enemy units\n- Cover that offers units protection and can be effectively flanked\n\nIn addidtion to the above the alien units are all unique and all have unique combat tactics/ablilites which maintains a real "alien" feel to the first encounters you have with them, more than once I struggled to comprehend what I was faced with on the battlefield resulting in a last minuite change of my tried and tested tactics.\n\nAll in all, a must for fans of the 90's X-com games; as well as those who enjoyed the Firaxis reboot and don't mind learning the new interface.","October 25, 2014","true","64.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whatever is not like the original xcom is a well thought improvement that we all wished the original had to begin with.\nIn short this game is a must for old timers like myself and a must for newcomers that have not experienced the awesomeness that was xcom in the 90s.\nNow if only the devs would make  something terror from the deep like for the first expansion.","December 31, 2014","true","61.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/svvish/recommended/223830/","svvish","Swish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/svvish/","28 products in account","As a huge fan of X-Com/UFO: Enemy Unknown (and Terror From the Deep) I felt let down by the path of  the modern remake of "XCOM" with its smaller squad sizes, missions that took a fraction of the time, and the overall feel of its base management system.\n\nWell what have we here? "Xenonauts"? I have NOT been disappointed. Touted as the spiritual successor to the original X-Com games and it really does live up to the hype.\n\nPROs:\n\n- Base management: Way more in tune with the original, building hangars, labs, living quarters, workshops.\n\n- Research: Still figuring out the order in which I should be researching but loving it so far, trying to improve the classic stuff (weapons, armor, aircraft, etc).\n\n- That classic feel! Guess what? Your prize Lieutenant is going to get shot by an alien in the dark, your recruits (Privates) are going to panic, and that frustration of combat missions is really recaptured. You hate it, but you LOVE it!\n\n- Computer AI: Very very good. The aliens don't just walk around shooting you as they see you. They can be quite content to know you're outside their craft from having had their pal shot to bits, and hole up in there behind some cover... waiting for your Lieutenant to say... "open the door, Private!"\n\n- Mod community: Not looked into it, but like a lot of titles on Steam it seems to have a community for mods, and that can only be a good thing!\n\n- Music/Atmosphere: That sometimes menacing, sometimes spooky music from the old X-Com? It's not the same, but it has that same feeling.\n\nCONs:\n\n- They could do more to lessen the learning curve for new players. Things like outfitting your soldiers with grenades should be done as standard. I think I did my first 4-5 missions wondering why grenades weren't on Xenonauts because they'd be damn handy! Turns out they are, you just need to outfit your soldiers before the craft leaves the base.\n\n- Targeting. I know this will come across as a gripe, but when you run up behind an alien within touching distance, with a shotgun, get a 95% chance to hit and MISS... well, part of the charm? Or outright unrealistic? ;)\n\nOTHER THINGS:\n\n- Civilians are present on some of these missions, some of them are armed (most of them panic and crouch with their hands over their heads), but the armed ones  WILL fire at the aliens!\n\n- "Normal" difficulty. Damn hard! As it was in the original, and I'd recommend jumping in at this level for nostalgia's sake ;)\n\n\nOverall then... if you're looking to play an updated version of the old 90s X-Coms then I would HIGHLY recommend this. As always, check out some YouTube footage before purchasing, but I'm having a blast! Sadly, so are the aliens!","January 6, 2015","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But as a big fan of the early X-com games as well as the 2012 reboot I was lured towards Xenonauts, it was one of those games that got under my skin, I kept looking at it on steam, on the fence as to whether it was worth the full asking price; I'd have to say after completing the campaign that it most definately is.\n\nWhere as the 2012 Firaxis X-com reboot was more of a reimaging, Xenonauts is an up tp date version of the older X-com games, bringing back time units and a whole list of other unit statistics giving the game a certain retro charm.\n\nThe main story arc of Xenonauts was brilliant, although it's another version of what has gone before, in my opinion it's a story which is more believable than those that have gone before it. The pseudoscience that backs it up is second to none and the tech tree that backs the game up brings some fantastic ideas with it, bulking up what we're used to in this type of game, again all of the research topics are given great entries, made to sound believable, as if all of the technology could potentially exist.\n\nThe new additions over the original 90's X-com are great:\n- Realtime air to air combat between your fleets of interceptors and UFO's\n- A variety of weapons for ground combat, shotguns, assault rifles, LMG's etc\n- Suppression effects for human and alien units\n- The ablilty to see a soldiers stats before you hire them\n- Flashbang grenades for assaulting enemy units\n- Cover that offers units protection and can be effectively flanked\n\nIn addidtion to the above the alien units are all unique and all have unique combat tactics/ablilites which maintains a real "alien" feel to the first encounters you have with them, more than once I struggled to comprehend what I was faced with on the battlefield resulting in a last minuite change of my tried and tested tactics.\n\nAll in all, a must for fans of the 90's X-com games; as well as those who enjoyed the Firaxis reboot and don't mind learning the new interface.","October 25, 2014","true","64.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It had a bumpy ride through development but honestly it has turned out a solid game, and I'm very happy to have supported it early on.\n\nOne of the strengths of Xenonauts is the tactics that you can pour into playing the game, on the base management level, or the battle maps themselves. This is what people were crying out for and didn't really get in the otherwise decent XCOM game: the ability to fine-tune your planning and tactics, and go different routes. Tank and heavy weapons? Rapid response scout team? Traditional army style? Beserkers filled with explosives? Patient sniper team? You can make all of these work. Plotting your route through the maps and vying with the alotted time just feels right.\n\nAnd on the globe view - base placement, setup, research order, and all that. This all matters way more than XCOM. I'd say the AI - though not mindblowing - is just as good as the XCOM game if not better simply due to the more complex map design.\n\nJust play out your first night mission and listen to those noises. It's very dark out there and you're all alone and it's all going to go horribly wrong - maybe.\n\nOne of the great strengths of this title over the originals, all the unofficial remakes, and the recent XCOM game, is that the maps needn't be repetitious. The system in place for juggling map assets does the hard work, and the editor is extremely powerful and will no doubt fill your hard drive with hundreds of variants (all of which, really, produce their own limitless variants). So if you take the time to download them, or map packs, or produce your own (it's fun!) you can cure one of the biggest nagging problems with the series' formula.\n\nCan't really recommend this strongly enough to strategy fans.","July 3, 2014","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Witnessed most of the dev`s decisions during that time, most of which were influenced by the premium access players. So, basically, what you get in the game is based on old school X-COM fans` opinions and suggestions.\n\nThe game while being complex is a bit simplified compared to old X-COM series. For example - there is no such thing as ammo buying/producing. You are always stocked up with infinite ammo even for produced weapons. You are still limited to what your soldiers can carry into battle.\nOther simplification is options to autoresolve air battles and get rid off indesired ground UFO recovery operations. You don`t want to go down and risk your soldiers for a mere amount of alloys? Just blow up the crash site by a single click and get some money for that.\nGeoscape (the global view of the world) provides reports of alien activity. These reports indicate presence of UFOs and allows player to send interceptors beyond the radar coverage of Xenonauts bases.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is familiar with the old school UFO\X-COM (not the one that Firaxis released).","February 20, 2015","true","140.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Better than Firaxis' 2012 X-COM, though that game is good too. It's set in the cold war era, which is great, but not much is done with the setting. It's mainly in the art.\n\nGameplay is pretty much the original UFO with some improvements, like bit more elaborate air combat and cover system. There is a lot of little things that bother me, but mods could fix the most of them, and there seems to be a healthy modding community. For example, the maps are generated semi-randomly like in UFO, but the maps generated are often boring, but there is mods that adds a lot of new submaps for the game to build it's maps from. The weapon tiers are a bit too obvious and gamey, this bothered me on the Firaxis' game too, but I can see how mods could fix that.\n\nSomething not as fixable by mods is that the engine doesn't seem to handle z-axis so well. The sightlines are sometimes illogical when looking above and below. That's probably why the UFOs have teleporters instead of those lift tube things of the original game. The enviroment destruction seems to be on par with the original game, not as great as in X-COM: Apocalypse, but OK.\n\nIt has some of the addicting quality of the original UFO. Endgame drags a bit, though. Overall very good and I got to try some of those mods.","January 14, 2015","true","73.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It had a bumpy ride through development but honestly it has turned out a solid game, and I'm very happy to have supported it early on.\n\nOne of the strengths of Xenonauts is the tactics that you can pour into playing the game, on the base management level, or the battle maps themselves. This is what people were crying out for and didn't really get in the otherwise decent XCOM game: the ability to fine-tune your planning and tactics, and go different routes. Tank and heavy weapons? Rapid response scout team? Traditional army style? Beserkers filled with explosives? Patient sniper team? You can make all of these work. Plotting your route through the maps and vying with the alotted time just feels right.\n\nAnd on the globe view - base placement, setup, research order, and all that. This all matters way more than XCOM. I'd say the AI - though not mindblowing - is just as good as the XCOM game if not better simply due to the more complex map design.\n\nJust play out your first night mission and listen to those noises. It's very dark out there and you're all alone and it's all going to go horribly wrong - maybe.\n\nOne of the great strengths of this title over the originals, all the unofficial remakes, and the recent XCOM game, is that the maps needn't be repetitious. The system in place for juggling map assets does the hard work, and the editor is extremely powerful and will no doubt fill your hard drive with hundreds of variants (all of which, really, produce their own limitless variants). So if you take the time to download them, or map packs, or produce your own (it's fun!) you can cure one of the biggest nagging problems with the series' formula.\n\nCan't really recommend this strongly enough to strategy fans.","July 3, 2014","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The invasion escalates faster than research does... which has put me into an Edge of Tomorrow situation on a few missions. Hard to fight Ion weapons with lead slugs no matter how good your tactics are!\n\nBut, that aside...\n\nGOOD: Solid X-Com clone, if you're into that kinda stuff. One thing that is pretty cool, is the radar installations. Rather than sweeping a continent, it sweeps a radius from the base at the center. This means you can kind-of tailor base placement to your strategy.\n\nBAD: I should note here that I have not yet finished the game, so the badness might change. But from what I've seen so far... there's nothing really new here. When I said earlier that its an X-Com clone, it is just that. There's really no reason for this game to have been made, since it already existed before (albeit with inferior graphics). Difficulty curve is pretty steep (normal mode). The graphics are obviously kinda dated. I realize that this appeals to some folks, but I personally prefer my modern video games to look modern. Also there are some glitches with the physics where damage isn't quite right, like an alien saucer icing my dude through an intact wall. An explosion that somehow hurt a character when it took down a building that she was not in, on the flip side: 2 of my characters receiving no damage when standing right next to a car when it exploded. Aliens often have line-of-sight to their targets, but those targets are blocked when aiming back. Also I have a feeling that aliens do not have fog-of-war, or at least there is a glitch in their fog-of-war algorithm that makes it so it sometimes does not affect them.\n\nOverall, I approve of this game. I love strategy, and the X-com style games in particular. While its exactly like some of the X-com clones in the past (UFO: Extraterrestrials especially) and brings nothing new to the table, I hold some hope that this game was made as a modern platform for the purpose of making expansions and DLCs that will add to the common base game. That would be a worthy idea: a UFO / X-Com game that gets periodic updates like PayDay2 does! Anyway that's my hope. Otherwise its just a more graphically-enticing X-Com (old game), which I suppose is fine if the new one was too dumbed-down for your liking, or if you just want MORE X-Com. But like... even the technologies are the same, and the species. Anyway, that's my take.

With over 100 hours of play time logged on this gem, I can safely say that it is one of the most immersive and fun games I have played in a long time.\nI have played Firaxis' X-COM and while I loved it, it still failed to quite capture the true spirit of the the original series. Not a problem with Xenonauts. Playing it feels like it was made by the exact same developers that made the original x-com, but with the approach and complexity that decades of gaming refinement have brought to the table.\nI've heard some friends express a disenterest based on the graphics, but I can assure you that the elements of the game itself more then make up for this, and seeing how some 3D modeling can end up looking rather...cartoony or kind of silly (Planetary Annhiliation, Showrun Returns), I find it pretty refreshing.\nI can't say enough about the content of this game. From the well written and detailed UFOpedia, that keeps a detailed description of every relevent item/creature you will come across and/or research, the rich histories of your team members; their prior combat experience, assignments, countries of origin, etc; to the HUGE tech tree to be plotted and explored.\nThe game takes place in 3 seperate environments...the "Geoscape", where you lay out your bases, set up manufacturing and research, hire and equip your soldiers/engineers/scientists, and watch for alien activity. Once an alien ship is spotted, you must dispatch interceptors to shoot down the enemy. Once your interceptor has engaged the ship, the second environment is entered\nIn the second phase, the "Tactical Air Battle" phase, you control up to several interceptors in a top down arial battle against the enemy ships. I have seen this tactical phase balance and transform as it was developed, and can say they have done a fantastic job with this and the balance as you research and develope more powerful crafts.\nThe 3rd and final phase is the "Tactical Ground Combat" phase, in which you control your customized team of soldiers (and various Heavy Weapon Platforms) in turn based combat against the alien invades after you have shot them down. You may also enter this phase without shooting down an alien ship if you get your lander to an already grounded UFO, a terrorist site in which the aliens are already grounded and engaged in terrorizing a major city you must defend, or an alien base they have established on Earth's surface.\nThere is a fantastic variety of terrain, maps, aliens, weapons, armor, etc throught the game, so it always seems fresh, even 40 to 50 hours in. even after my 120+ hours of gameplay (have played offline at times, who knows how many hours there) I still see new maps and have to come up with new strategies/approaches depending on situations.\nAll in all I would recommend Xenonauts to any gamer that won't be caught up on a lack of graphical complexity, and especially for anyone who likes management, strategy, simulation, or turn based games. At $25, this game is a great buy. I think the only thing keeping them from charging more is the lack of advanced graphics. The content is certainly up there with any Blockbuster game, in my opinion. Thank you to the fine developers at Goldhawk Ineractive for a wonderful product.","August 5, 2014","true","261.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I enjoy the base/financial management aspect but the ground combat is what makes the game.  (The air combat I enjoy watching, but not manually fighting....I generally auto-complete it and hope for the best).  I actually enjoyed the game a bit more on Easy mode than Normal mode.  Normal mode was a challange, but felt a bit grindy to me after a while.  Ground combat is turn based style similiar to the original Xcom (or early Jagged Alliance games).  Fun to flank, blow up buildings, fly, etc.  (more variety mid to late  game).  Note you will get punished for sloppy ground tactics, even on easy levels (but not nearly as painfully as the higher levels).  While there may be "best tactics", I found you are able to complete missions a number of different ways.   I will come back to this fmame with the Community Edition/map packs (after a short break to work on my backlog).  The game was very stable for me (although I did have 2 crashes in 40+ hours, I suspect it had to due with my PC trying to run stuff in the background).    Cons - the final mission was a bit easy and the end screen anti-climatic.  Pros - great fun with turn based tactical combat; for me at least, definitely provided the flavor of the original game.   Also has a very active modding community which will give this game some staying power.","August 24, 2014","true","49.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The invasion escalates faster than research does... which has put me into an Edge of Tomorrow situation on a few missions. Hard to fight Ion weapons with lead slugs no matter how good your tactics are!\n\nBut, that aside...\n\nGOOD: Solid X-Com clone, if you're into that kinda stuff. One thing that is pretty cool, is the radar installations. Rather than sweeping a continent, it sweeps a radius from the base at the center. This means you can kind-of tailor base placement to your strategy.\n\nBAD: I should note here that I have not yet finished the game, so the badness might change. But from what I've seen so far... there's nothing really new here. When I said earlier that its an X-Com clone, it is just that. There's really no reason for this game to have been made, since it already existed before (albeit with inferior graphics). Difficulty curve is pretty steep (normal mode). The graphics are obviously kinda dated. I realize that this appeals to some folks, but I personally prefer my modern video games to look modern. Also there are some glitches with the physics where damage isn't quite right, like an alien saucer icing my dude through an intact wall. An explosion that somehow hurt a character when it took down a building that she was not in, on the flip side: 2 of my characters receiving no damage when standing right next to a car when it exploded. Aliens often have line-of-sight to their targets, but those targets are blocked when aiming back. Also I have a feeling that aliens do not have fog-of-war, or at least there is a glitch in their fog-of-war algorithm that makes it so it sometimes does not affect them.\n\nOverall, I approve of this game. I love strategy, and the X-com style games in particular. While its exactly like some of the X-com clones in the past (UFO: Extraterrestrials especially) and brings nothing new to the table, I hold some hope that this game was made as a modern platform for the purpose of making expansions and DLCs that will add to the common base game. That would be a worthy idea: a UFO / X-Com game that gets periodic updates like PayDay2 does! Anyway that's my hope. Otherwise its just a more graphically-enticing X-Com (old game), which I suppose is fine if the new one was too dumbed-down for your liking, or if you just want MORE X-Com. But like... even the technologies are the same, and the species. Anyway, that's my take.

Thanks for watching and reading!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnYLWd7Y8N4\nSTORY: Just as in the original X-Com games, extraterrestrial beings attack the earth and the poorly prepared humanity tries desperately to fend off the incoming aggression. Over time we learn to adapt and use the alien technology to our advantage, while at the same time stronger UFOs and aliens try to assault our planet.\n\nGRAPHICS: The polished graphics are quite nice and offer a throwback to the old generation, however offering a surprising amount of detail at the same time. Some levels are, by their nature (arctic and desert), rather plain and simple, however other areas are rather impressive.\n\nSOUND: The sound design is diffident. It creates a tense atmosphere where not encountering aliens is even worse than having them in sight. The minimal sound effects will make you sit on the edge of your seat as soon as something happens!\n\nGAMEPLAY: Both the ground combat as well as the geoscape offer very strategic gameplay and an immense variety due to an array of tactical possibilities! Balancing when to expand your base, which planes to utilise to intercept which UFOs, which equipment to bring for ground assault and when to know that retreat is the best option is key to Xenonauts. The air-to-air combat seems rather shallow though and I found myself using the auto-resolve function most of the time.\n\nPROBLEMS: The game does a really poor job of tutorializing itself and thus especially the UI, the cover system and the reaction shot system need a lot of getting used to. Once those initial hurdles have been overcome however, Xenonauts kept growing on me and the more I played, the more strategic options opened up due to the very flexible Turn Unit (TU) system.\nThere are a few minor annoyances like the fact that the soldies customization is incredibly limited since you can only change their name but not face, origin, etc., or the fact that changing equipment is rather time consuming and laborious, or the fact that the UFO's doors close after each turn and thus you always have to put a soldier in harm's way, or the fact that doing an airstrike on a ground target is always worse than actually assaulting the crashsite with your soldiers, even though nothing is to be gained there, resulting in a grind, or the fact that the calculated walk distance sometimes is shorter than it could actually be if you would have optimized the path manually, or the fact that your soldiers cannot utilise their jetpacks to jump over stuff on the highest roof due to level restrictions, etc etc etc. Nontheless, I can forgive all these minor annoyances due to the incredible atmosphere that oozes from Xenonauts, especially when fighting at night in an uninhabited environment.\nThere is one huge problem though, that still hinders me from playing Ironman mode, and that is the camera of Xenonauts. As it cannot be turned and as working with heights is incredibly clunky and frustrating, I feel that improvement on that front is required. Possibile solitions would be to include a rotate option for the camera or the possibility to switch off the walls similar to the Sims games. If no official solution is on the horizon, I hope and feel that the integrated mod support might lead to great solutions provided by the community in the future!\n\nCOMPARISON WITH ENEMY UNKOWN: Xenonauts has a far greater entry barrier and thus addresses an audience looking for a more strategic experience compared to the latest X-Com game (Enemy Unkown). If you are new to tactical turn-based games, consider checking out X-Com Enemy Unkown with it's Add-On Enemy Within, preferably in a Steam Sale. Should you be looking for a hardcore experience reminiscent of the old X-Com games, consider picking up Xenonauts as it offers not only the tactical turn-based combat but additionally a strategic geoscape, which was simplified heavily in Enemy Unknown.\n\nCONCLUSION: Xenonauts is not perfect, however the tactical possibilities and the amazing atmosphere overcome the annoyances and problems. Thus Xenonauts gets a recommendation for every gamer with an interest in tactical-turn-based games.","June 16, 2014","true","34.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is not a bad thing, for me at least, but missions can become sort of repetative, but you don't have to fight the battles if you do not want to, you can choose to just bonb the crash site for some money.\nThe begining will be one the most difficult parts because you are very ill equiped and the mission variation is limited. But the missions begin to vary the further you get in the game (bigger crash sites, alien bases, and terror missions).\nThis game is AMAZING, and some of that is due to the fact that it is in Alpha/Beta (I'm not sure which one).

The original one? [jontronmoment]wwwhuszat? yusaidno? Wellthat'sunbeliavable, i don't even see how you came to that conclusion[/jointronmoment]\n\nIf you played xenonauts - you practically did. Basically it is a very faitful remake of x-com made by a huge fans, which resembles original almost on 80%.\nEverything is there - ability to damage terrain, free fire, science and assembly division, neat ambient music, etc.\nAnd it improves on so many levels which were under-taken in original x-com - like to example - aerial fighting manual mode is best one yet i've seen in fan-made x-com(1-2)'esque games. I mean - best one in series were in x-com 3, but i feel that lots of a-holes which did not actually played 3rd part gonna downvote me for that, but whatever. That's my review, i do whatever I want, god damn it.\n\nAnyway - the game is neat and polished -it crashed only 2 times in 13 hours, and i were able to quickly recover from autosaves, authors just need a little more kicking to make finishing touches and find all the bugs. But even at this point - this is very stable release candidate rather than beta.\nAlmost everything is there, i believe teleporter and psionic sounds are the same, which they shouldn't be, also some plasma rifles have same sound.\n\nBut besides that - core is there, feeling of progress is there too, game just as addicting to mea s the original, and i just spent 14 hours playing it non-stop, for the note - in recent xcom reboot i got bored after 3 (6 in ufo afterlight) and barely finished it. Something to cosider.\nI think main thing about this game is that it keeps throwing new stuff at you even after you think everything is done and beaten - on normal difficulty progression is rather slow, but rewarding at that - it doesn't feel rushed, nor does it feel too slow. Just hits the spot.\n\nIn the conclusion - buy this game guys - it worth every penny and delivers+it has crazy potential for modding since EVERYTHING is in xml+it has map editor.\nAnd even if you played only reboot of xcom - but original x-com and this one and compare them back to back - they are pretty damn close and xenonauts most certainly can be called X-COM: UFO Defense 2.0.","March 26, 2014","true","83.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At this time the game is pretty much ready and should be set for official launch in the next few weeks.  Still working on finishing V1.03 build so review will be updated and finalised by official launch.\n\nSummary: For all intents and purposes Xenonauts is a modern remake of the ORIGINAL X-COM from 1994.  Where as the modern X-COM Enemy Unknown changed alot from the original, making it more of a action tactical combat game (one that I enjoyed alot) it strayed from the original.  Many a vetran from the original game (including myself) have been clamoring for a remake of the original and, now, I can say, that has happened.\n\nXenonauts remains true to the original and as a player of the old game I was right at home with the controls and mechanics.  To summarise, the game puts you in charge of an organization charged with defending against and alien invasion.  Your main strategic view is the Geoscape, a full map of earth.  You start out by placing your first base whereever you wish.  You must make considerations for how much coverage it will give you and to which funding nations.  You will be able to develope your base, building new buildings, hiring new staff, training new soliders, researching new tech and building new gadgets.  You will outfit your troops and aircraft for battle and eventually build additional bases to increase your coverage.\n\nSoon your first UFO's will arrive.  You will need to intercept them with your aircraft.  This can either be handled via auto-resolve for via an Aerial battle minigame which is surprisingly involved.  Once the UFO is downed (over land) you will send in your troops to retrieve the wreckage and elimate any surviving aliens.\n\nFrom here, the game turns to the Turn Based Tactical map.  Your troops will start in your dropship, and you will have to move them about the map.  This portion uses a turn based system.  Each unit has X amount of time units which they use to perform any action, being it move, shoot, crouch, etc.  Shooting can take up more time units if you want to improve accuracy.  Once you have used up all your time units for all your units, you can end the turn.  Then the aliens will take their move, and it will then go to your turn etc.\n\nFans of the original and of old school Turn Based will be at home here.  It allows for fine control of each unit and as unit get more experiened, they will get more time units and their other stats such as accuracy, health, reactions etc will also improve.\n\nThe aim of the game is to defend against the aliens, tech up to be able to match them more evenly and eventuallly defeat the alien menance once and for all.\n\nPros: Playing the game, I felt like I was playing the original...I cannot think of higher praise.  For all intents and purposes this is  the original, given a face lift and brought into the modern world.  It streamlines things a bit, for example, no longer do you have to manufactor basic weapons, nor do you have to manufactor items such as grenades, flairs, and ammo.  This was tedious micromanagement in the original which has thankfully been streamlined now.  Instead, you focus on building weapons, armor, vehicles, planes etc.  Grenades, ammo etc are auto-crafted.\n\nAlso, now you have the option of calling in an airstike against a downed UFO instead of sending your combat team.  I remember in the original, during end game it was quite annoying having to deal with smaller UFO's that I shot down, so this is a welcome addition for when you don't want to have to deal with them.  You get a small amount of money doing this, but you gain much more if you send in your assault team.  It's nice to have options.\n\nNow you have a wider array of weapons and equipment including Pistols, Shotguns, Shields, Rifles, Machine guns, Sniper Rifles and rocket launchers.  There is a "class" system, but basically this is just a set of pre-determined equipment.  You can assign any solider any class.  It is useful for quickly giving units gear and you can set what gear each class gives.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful 2d graphics and the interface works well now with modern conventions.\n\nCons:  Alas, all cannot be perfect.  The most pressing issue at the moment is bugs.  Even at V1.03 there are some bugs still left to be addressed, but the dev team is aware of them and looking to fix.  Right now, for me, I get crashes when new gear is made and I go to equip my troops.  Since I save alot, and am now aware of this, it is not more than an annoyance.  I have spoken to the dev's and they are activly trying to fix this.\n\nMaps - While the game has some random placement within maps, it still uses an existing pool.  As such, before long you will be replaying the same maps over again.  The community has already published a map pack to increase the number of maps available.  However, this will always be a problem when not using auto-generated maps.\n\nWeapons - A personal issue, but each generation of weapons is literally a more powerful version of the former.  I.e, laser weapons handle exactly the same as the ballistic versions, just more powerful and different ammo counts.  Not an issue, but would be nice to get some more exotic weaponry that differentiates itself a bit more.\n\nIn Closing\nIf you like or are interested in Turn Based games with a strong strategic and tactical element you should give this game a try.  As I said before, when I played this, it was like playing the original X-Com, and I cannot give higher praise than that.\n\n9/10","June 9, 2014","true","124.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Handdrawn graphics, classic turnbased action. Seemed nice enough.\n\nWhat I got from that was absolutely amazing. This game managed to pull me in entirely and made me go through hours, making progress and playing to see what it might pull out next. The handdrawn nature made the absolute best out of this. Detailed depictions of the autopsies, backgrounds for the sections of your base that look like a masterpiece each and change over the time as you develop new technology. It really proves that great graphical experience has nothing to do with a powerful GPU.\nThe narrative style of the game and lots of lore that come with it only increase the experience and keeps you going on, wanting to see the next artwork and the self loving speech of your chief scientist as he tells in his eccentric way of mixing imperial and metric systems what he developed this time.\n\nGameplay wise there is nothing too revolutionary, the game relying on what had been proven good on the early XCOM games and making you wonder why so much was lost in Enemy Unknown. It's a good strategic experience that challenges your mind at times but doesnt frustrate you or make you desperate to a point that you toss away the game.\n\nI definitely recommend this to fans of Xcom and the genre in general, a good experience for casual players and more experienced alike and a pleasure to look at.","August 1, 2015","true","21.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Or maybe you played the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and found it a little too... gamey. Well, send in the Xenonauts!\n\nCOMPARED TO XCOM:\n\nXenonauts is a more user-friendly, streamlined version that replaces clunky UI for more strategic depth. And this game is DEEP. Spend you hard-earned cash on buffing up your wimpy troopers and giving them sweet, sweet gear or spend it like any rational government agency would and buy more bases and jets. Lots of jets. Upgrade those babies. Yeaaaaahhh... that's it. Jets are the future. I know those lasers look pretty, but jets make those governments happy... yeaaaahhhh...\n\nAlso you'll be happy to find that, although challenging, you won't have your entire team mind-controlled on the third mission.\n\nCOMPARED TO XCOM:EU or EW:\n\nSo you have your flashy graphics and simplified UI. But do you have air combat? Do you have the possibility of managing multiple bases around the world? Maybe you just want one base to have xenonauts in it and the rest filled with jets. Maybe you can't aford anything because you are bad at finances. This game has all the strategic depth that XCOM: EU lacks. Pinch those pennies, ladies and gents.\n\nIn Closing...\n\nFor those looking for a more management-oriented, strategic experience, Xenonauts will be more satisfying than its flashier cousins. It has its problems, but the free Community Edition fixes the majority of them. I really hope XCOM:EU and its sequels consider adopting the strategic management elements from this game; it makes it a vastly satisfying experience.","December 3, 2015","true","36.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Sadly the sheer size and complexity of the game, won't allow me enough room to give you a short and long version of my review.  Either way I hope this helps!\n\nIf you'd prefer to see the game in action, please take a look at my LP, it should give you a very good idea of what's going on.  If you grabbed the game and are stuck, check it out for a semi-tutorial/walkthrough, as well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHJ4gqex0Ok&list=PLtzgP48ATFJB1iDXzaSGTSHFD5ZHQTFYK\nor\nhttps://www.youtube.com/bumpymcsquigums\n\nXenonauts has been heralded as the classic X-COM games spiritual successor.  It's been compared to both new and old X-COM and it's still making quite a bit of noise.  The game is very playable and very enjoyable in it's current state but the devs are still hammering out little issues, doing balance and stability updates and trying to get Xenonauts perfect.  If you liked the old OR new X-COM games then you should very much like Xenonauts.  I could spend hours talking about the similarities between the two games, but you can read that virtually anywhere.  So, I will try to explain the game for those of you who have never played it before.\n\nXenonauts is considered a Strategic Planetary Defense Simulator.  It's around the time of the cold war in the late 70's and aliens have invaded the Earth.  You are the commander/leader of the Xenonauts and your goal is to basically do battle with the aliens and save the world.  You are "graded" each month by the nations of the world and based on how much you helped them, you will break even, gain or lose monetary support from the nations.  You have a lot of responsibility and control on how everything pans out or works.  You control where you want to set up your bases, what to build in the bases, which aliens ships to shoot down, what to research, what to engineer, what roles your soldiers have, which soldiers to hire, and even which crash sites/missions to take.  There's a ton to do and it can be overwhelming at first.  I'll try to break it down a bit more.\n\nYour base is pretty much the very start of the game.  You have to place your base so you have decent satellite coverage over land.  The more individual nations you can cover, the more likely you are to please them when the end of the month comes.  Anytime you shoot down an alien ship or send troops to deal with a crashsite or landed alien vessel you gain a sort of "reputation points" with the nation.  The more you deal with aliens in their nation, the more they will fund you.  Likewise if you do not have coverage and alien activity occurs in other places or you ignore it, you will lose those "rep points" and funding.  Base placement is important as is what to build in your base.  It might take some experimenting to find the perfect build.  Xenonauts does have a quick start guide to help you and one of the good things is, it does not overkill you with a tutorial phase.  :)\n\nThe air combat is a pretty cool feature.  There is a mini-game you can do for the air combat when you send your interceptors after the alien ships.  It's well done and enjoyable but one of the really cool features is that the autoresolve is actually really really good.  So if you don't care to do the air to air mini-game, you generally can autoresolve it and skip it.  To explain the mini-game briefly, you can pause or unpause at any point and your ship(s) and the alien ship(s) will close with one another.  Then any weapons you have active at the time will fire on the aliens.  The aliens will fire back and you have the ability to do evasive manuevers as well as retreating.  The aliens also can avoid your missle fire, so you have to plan accordingly.  It's all sort of RTS-ish with the ability to tactically pause.\n\nThe bulk of the game is spent in the ground missions.  It's what makes or breaks this type of game.  You have a roster of soldiers.  Hopefully you outfitted a decent variety.  There are preset classes as well as the ability to make your own.  It doesn't CHANGE the soldiers in anyway, it's more to ease you gearing up people.  The classes are: Assault, Sniper, Shield, Heavy, Rifleman, Scout & Rocketeer(and of course the ability to create your own).  So basically you click and assign your soldier to assault, outfit it with whatever you want, then save the gear configuration.  Then anyone you make an assault class will automatically get that gear.  They have different icons in certain places so it makes it easier for you to tell what role they play.\n\nAll that being said, you chose your soldiers, and deploy them in a drop ship.  Send the dropship to an alien landed craft or a crashsite and the ground battle begins.  It's a throw back to classic squad turn based strategy combat.  It's your turn and you can use any of your soldiers in any order.  You can move each and every one of your soldiers before you end your turn, then it's the aliens turn.  You move cover to cover and with the implementation of the shield units, you even have mobile cover!  All your moves/shots/actions are based on TU's (Time Units).  So any time you move out, turn, crouch, throw a grenade, or shoot, you use up a certain amount of TU's.  You can conserve TU's to make sure you can still shoot and move, or have enough for reactionary fire (taking a shot at an alien if it moves past you or shoots at you).  The entire ground combat system is done extremely well and once you get the hang of it, it's amazing.\n\nThose are the big things to cover most of the game.  A few other things worthy of mentioning is the fact that you can rename your soldiers, aircraft, and I'm pretty sure vehicles as well.  Naming your soldiers generally makes you care more about them and is a nice tool.  Your soldiers DO level up, they climb in ranks, the lowest being Private and the highest being Commander.  Each time you go on a mission with your soldiers they have a chance to not only earn a promotion(i.e. level up) they also have a chance of increasing their stats.  The longer your soldiers survive combat and the more they do in the missions the better they become.  So it pays to play it safe and keep your people alive.\n\nThere's a ton to this game and I like virtually all of it.  I don't think I could explain each and every part of the game as there is simply SOO much.  I'll give a word of caution about some stuff and those are kind of my "things I don't like", or "what's bad" in Xenonauts.\n\nTwo things I'd say to be cautious of are:\n\n1.  At the current point in the game, the devs are still hammering out issues here and there.  I have literally only run into one major issue at this point and that was my ironman game got stuck in permanent "Alien's Turn - Hidden Movement Screen".  They had planned to take the game out of early access at the end of May, but decided it's not quite ready.  My word of caution is to NOT use Ironman mode until the game is out of early access.\n\n2.  Money is a bit of a challenge in this game.  Spending enough to keep everyone happy and getting good coverage but not so much as to over extend your funds and end up negative is a big challenge.  A LOT of people are having the issue of balancing what they need and what they can afford.  I know Goldhawk Interactive is still doing balancing, so it's something they are trying to tweak.  It's just something to be cautious of.\n\nAll in all, Xenonauts is an amazing game and I highly recommend it.  The UI is great, the graphics are nice, the music fits the game perfectly.  It's well worth the investment of time and money, it draws you in, it's challenging, and rewarding when you pull off a perfect plan.  Grab it now and support the Devs!\n\n","June 12, 2014","true","159.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

The ground combat system is truley amazing, the game designers have kept things simple yet realistic you can crouch behind object thus reducing your chancing of being hit.  I seriously reccomend buying this game if you are a fan of turn based games. My advice is to start the game on normal difficulty and in Ironman mode, this is because you will just end up save scuming when your best unit gets killed.  Your soilders are expendable wich is a shame because you can really get attached to them. Also you can name soilders to people youu know in real life, its pretty funny at times.  There are lots of really good mods that the community have made for this game aswell, so if you get bored with one set of rules you can subscribe to a mod and change them to another set.  This game is amazing! I just wish i had more time to play it.","September 27, 2015","true","343.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Personally I rate this game better than the vanillar XCOM.\n\nBUT, the EW expansion and the Long War mod are both far superior to Xeno. Why? Xeno suffers from being a pre-KS funded indie project that presumably had only a modest budget. The later half of the game runs out of steam with generic aliens, bland tech and pure incremental weapons era progression that makes everything kind of dull. WARNING: there are even LESS things to do than in the vanillar XCOM.\n\nIf you are itching for the classic x-com game and wished XCOM had TU instead, then pick up Xeno for a spin.

Quite certainly and without any shame, Xenonauts developers Goldhawk Interactive are speaking out the truth about their inspiration - Xenonauts is spiritual successor of acclaimed strategic game XCom: UFO Defense.\n\nGameplay resolves in circles which comprises of three main elements: management of your bases and strategic command centers via Geoscape, your game screen; real-time air combat and final stage - turn based ground combat.\n\nAlthough we live in cruel time when hand drawn graphics are unfairly judged as unworthy by most of the (childish) players, get over retro, but charming hand-drawn sprites and you'll enter the world of comprehensive, multilayered strategy where you can manipulate every single aspect of your gaming experience. Numerous classes, weapons, tactics, strategies, upgrades and ideas have been brought upon the table and shrouded in mystery and atmosphere which perfectly collides panic of alien invasion and Cold war isolation.\n\nThere are numerous selling points to Xenonauts, but one of the most important IS and SHOULD BE that it's an honorable, greatly improved over original and richer hommage to XCom which delivers in every single aspect. It's unbeliveable that an indie team can deliver a game that even surpasses the original on so many fields.\n\nIf you're into aliens and hungry for some long-lasting strategic battles that will test your nerves, luck and decisions, go for it.","June 27, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And I'm not just speaking about the type of map projection used, I'm talking about the way aircrafts are travelling, the way radar ranges are depicted and things like that.\n\nI don't feel like I'm defending a planet, I feel like I'm defending a flat table with a distorted map drawn on it, or more accurately a cylinder since the map connects on the sides.\n\nIn this game, on the ''flat map'' globe, the radar ranges are circular, no matter where you are on the globe, well they should'nt, the range of the radar should be factored for the fact that it's a flat map, it should widen towards the poles, otherwise the map is all wrong.  Every aircraft travel in a straight line, just like if the earth was flat, well they should'nt.  The map is distorted, and so are the trajectories and distances.  Now what would be the advantage of putting a base on the north pole, since the distances are so wrong when you consider the earth as a cylinder with very wide poles.  For example, in real life, the shortest route from the southern tip of Chile to Australia doesn't involve going all the way on a due east trajetory, it should be trought the south pole.  ( Where is the south pole anyway in this game ? )  By using such an unrealistic approach to the ''globe'' aspect of the game, it really breaks a big aspect for anybody who liked managing strategically the globe part in XCOM.  Once again, the original game from 20 years ago had it all correct, why change that ?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm going to recommend this game to any XCOM fan.  XCOM was one of the greatest game of all times and any attempts at bringing back some memories of it should be funded and encouraged.  This remake is an excellent game, with one unnecessary big flaw in my opinion.","August 21, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

On the downside, It can get a bit repetitive over time as you send a team to clear out yet another UFO you shot down, but I guess that just adds to the atmosphere of an endless conflict where you are badly outnumbered and outgunned. But you can fix that in time, of course.

The UI is also somewhat JA style, but has been streamlined enough that it reminds me more of Fallout 2's UI. Like XCOM, it has managed to do away with the tedious, forced micromanagement of JA and other games of that period, but does also seem to reward it a bit if you want to take the time to mess with the details, and has made doing so much easier than games from the period this one is trying to emulate.\n\nYeah, reading that sure makes this game sound derivative, doesn't it?\n\nThat's because it is, and proudly so. And what's wrong with that? Why wouldn't I want a game that looks good enough. lets me tweak things as much or as little as I want, and plays and feels like some of the best games ever?\n\nIf you are into shiney graphics and found hard difficulty XCOM:EU to be fun and challenging enough, then don't bother with this - the normal difficulty is generally a little more difficult than hard EU.  If you thought it was a great game, but just lacking something to make it a real 700 hour monster time eater, then you should really check this out. If you liked Jagged Alliance or it's modern clone, then you'll love this - it plays very similarly, and the RNG, LOS, and other mechanics are less broken. If liked the quirky gameplay of Fallout 1 and 2 and the darkly comical world, then you'll probably like this, but if you found the combat there overwhelmingly hard, then you might not.\n\nOne more quick little note: If you haven't played any of the above, but want to get into this sort of games, this is a good place to start. Unlike most of them, the easy mode is actually easy enough fora brand new player to get the swing of things, but becomes challenging enough to be worth playing through to the late game.","January 5, 2015","true","127.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Despite having some minor flaws.\n\nXenonauts is basically a modernised and up-to date version of the classic with it's own little twists and features. Where Xenonauts excels is that it's just a really enjoyable experience. First of all the aesthetics might look pretty bland but they fit the game quite well and everything looks extremely sharp and detailed. There is a lot of great artwork and sprites in this game. The soundtrack totally enhances the threating atmosphere and truly immerses yourself into the game.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are mostly identical except that they improved the interface and user-friendlyness. The classic Xcom had a lot of tedious micromanagement and a cumbersome interface. I never particularly enjoyed the logistics aspect of the classic. Xenonauts has a great interface that conveys information in a great manner. Equiping soldiers and manageing your base is far better. The research tree is great aswell and the descriptions add a lot of flavor to the game.\n\nThe tactical turn-based ground battles are intense and quite challenging thanks to the multitude of difficulties that you can choose from. The geoscape section is also greatly enhanced, the aliens won't hesistate to launch a full scale assault and there is far more to do on the geoscape than in the classic. They also add some nifty new options and events like local military fighting against the aliens as well and airstriking downed ufos.\n\nThere is much to talk about in this game but I'll keep it short for now, it's a great game for fans of the classics or turn-based games. I definitely recommend it.\n\nThe only negative aspects that come to mind is that there aren't that many maps, you will often see the same layouts during the battles. Luckily there is a huge mappack available on the official forums that adds tons of detailed and varied maps.\n\nAlso sometimes the tactical battles can be a bit fiddly on tight spaces and the cover system can be confusing at times, the line of sight works really well but at times it's confusing as well. But once you play for a while you get the hang of it.\n\n\n","July 1, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't have a lot of hours in yet but all I can say is WOW. This is the most faithful reproduction of X-COM: Enemy Unknown by a wide, wide margin - and that's no knock on the recent reboot by Firaxis; they are simply dramatically different games. Xeno distinguishes itself with the faithful depth and unforgiving, unapologetic tactical harshness that is carried by poor or reckless decision making.\n\nIt is amazing that we have both XCOM and Xeno, and that they are both such great games and I found a fantastic article below by Phil Hartup that dives so well in to exaclty this topic and provides an excellent history of what the franchise has gone through. Absolutely worth the time to read if your exposure to the franchise is rooted larely in the recent reboot, and if you loved the classic from 1994 and have, like so many of us, given up hope of a faithful reproduction after decades of disappointment - this is a slam-dunk to run long nights in to the dawn.\n\nhttp://www.newstatesman.com/killing-time/2013/10/xcom-enemy-unknown-xenonauts-dumbed-down-game-any-less-fun","January 2","true","16.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Once you dive in, you'll see it.\n\nThe difference is the tech trees, discriptions, maps, aliens (beings, ships, weapons, ect). Their motivations are the same, plus the planet Earth, but the interface is quite improved.\n\nYou have pretty much total control - planning bases, troop management, improvements, mission planning -  the whole shebang. As you progress, the aliens get more numerous, dangerous, larger, more aggressive, and your apprehensions can get the best of you. Only downside is the end game - it was a tad gamey (maybe even letdown), expected something harder ala the old X-Com. Was fun, though....\n\nThere is ample mod support - The Commuinty Edition is widely played, and tweaks many of the standard game to enhance the experence, and is endorsed by the producer, and hosts a lively forum. Pretty darned impressive...\n\nBeen following this for a while, and it dropped off my radar, but quite glad it did not become vaporware.

I heard the legends, of course, of all the things it did right that no other game (incuding newer X-Com titles) had managed: the perfect balance of weapons and gear so that every type of loadout has its use, the punishing yet fair difficulty (the aliens are stronger than you, but it's always possible to beat them), the general sense of dread at every crash site, the amazing metagame of base building and resource allocation across continents, and so many other features that added up to an amazing, tense, immersive, and satisfying experience.\n\nI cannot say if Xenonauts is as good as X-Com, or how the two compare, but I can say this: Xenonauts does everything right.  It sounds crazy to say, but it's true.  The balance of both your equipment and enemies', especially with the latest patches and Community Edition, is perfect.  Both the metagame and tactical encounters are complex and satisfying.  Every choice, every action has weight, tension, and immense significance to your war with the alien threat.  Battles are tense, tactics are paramount; your soldiers' survival is tenuous, but if you use the right tactics, there is hope.\n\nSo, I cannot say if Xenonauts is as good as X-Com was, but I can say that it is as good as X-Com's hype, which is even more impressive.","November 7, 2015","true","162.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If the XCOM enemy within and this one merged it could be the super game it could be. Both games are missing things the the other has.  Love the multiple bases, the base play and air game of the Xenonauts but its missing the newer XCOM enemy within metals, training school, MECHs, Gennetics and a few other things.

For enchanted playthrough, see notes about CE-version.\n\nTrue successor in the spirit to the UFO: Enemy Unknown (1994), its sequel Terror from the Deep (1995) and Microprose's latest 'UFO-colors' game, X-Com: Apocalypse (1997).\n\nEarth is under the attack by menacing alien forces which are gathered around the Earth orbit. Player is tasked to command Xenonaut-organization and plan the battle against this threat. Game consists of two parts: Geoscape where strategic planning happens and tactical turn-based combat which is heart & bone of the UFO-games.\n\nWhen compared to it's predecessors, game plays fairly lot in the same way. On Geoscape you build your own bases and try to maintain air superiority. Xenonauts get their (small) funding from the continents of the Earth. So one of the top priorities is build air superiority cover over the world parts if you want to receive spending money in the upcoming months. Air superiority means that you have to acquire interceptors, research upgrades to keep your edge up and shoot down UFOs. In addition of embarking to turn-based battle, any UFOs shot down could be airstriked for fixed sum of money and saved real world time.\n\nAliens seem to first have problems to enter inside Earth atmosphere except with small crafts but that is rapidly changing. Therefore ground combat also has an important role: you acquire alien artefacts and your hired soldiers will get more experience. Increasing your soldier's statistics is one game aspect where you prepare to the end game. Also as this is an UFO-game, there are some inevitable combat losses which means you need to keep up healthy sized pool of soldiers. Also you have to protect your bases which usually means keeping the garrison on the base.\n\nOn turn-based you get usual TB-game mechanics, with mid-turn interrupts and soldier movement is limited by 'time units'. Game design blunders are mostly avoided: xeno-soldiers can 'peek' from the corner facing diagonally towards it. Protection and cover is calculated only using the largest blocking object, making the decisions very simple. Weapons are labelled in very generic categories instead of giving you multitudes of the same. Assault rifle is an assault rifle, until you get a laser rifle (which works in exactly same way). This means you could pick generic weapon genre and chosen weapon would work in that role as expected. Combat system sounds very simple, but in practice it's working. Sure, you could have bad luck with the dice roll and aliens might get lucky shots, but that's UFO for you... do not leave your soldiers to the line of sight. :-)\n\nHowever, some things does not exist even advertised, like jumping through windows or are not advertised at all even they are actually useful (melee attack). Structural damage seems quite mild and there are no spectacular building collapses and wild-fires like in Apocalypse. Game will still have some irritating bugs for which I seriously considered score of 7 from 10. Also I would have liked to have several dropships on the same mission to train my rookie hordes, but you can't get everything, eh? Until you realize there's modders community...\n\nInterface works enough well to do it's job. That's all I have to say which means it's pretty mediocre, simplistic but it won't get in your way. Some people on forums have commented on lack of tablet/touch screen support.\n\nTo the credit of the writer every game tech has fairly convincing description how this particular piece fits to the game universe. Even the upgrade works in exactly same way - like assault rifle works technically exactly as plasma rifle  - there is explanation how this particular piece of technology would affect the game universe. Also game soundtrack consists only of few pieces, but these are fairly moody.\n\nIf you have waited all these years to pickup old UFO/X-Com and play again, look no further than Xenonauts. Game package additionally contains a short novel. Fairly generic reading, but entertaining enough and it adds to the game lore.\n\nEdit: To avoid already fixed bugs and errors in the game, you may want to use Community Edition (CE) version for your first playthrough. You can install CE version through the Steam.","September 15, 2015","true","313.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","2"

Even though The Buraeu: X-Com Declassified and Enemy Unknown/Within were great games in their own right, they just didn’t quite capture the same feeling that the classic games had. While some things need to evolve and change, there’s something to be said about making a recipe with most of the same ingredients to enjoy the meal you remember. (That’s especially true if they are going to say that it tastes similar.) I covered a lot of the basics of this game in the X-Com: Enemy Unknown VS. Xenonauts review so I’m not going to cover everything since Goldhawk Interactive finished up everything that needed fixing to transition from Early Access to Launch status pretty smoothly.\n\nLet’s start with difficulty shall we? That was a trademark aspect of the originals. (I still can’t complete TFTD.) I started Xenonauts on the Regular difficulty and had both starter interceptor planes shot down in one-on-one dogfights. (At which point I had nothing to shoot down enemy aircraft.) The enemy craft ended up landing after downing my two aircraft giving me my first mission… out of pity. During the pity mission (which happened to be a night mission of course) I had lost two soldiers before I got ten spaces from my Chinook from enemies I couldn’t see. Needless to say I started over and changed the difficulty to easy. I usually don’t like playing games on easy, but this game just kicked me in the nuts and laughed in my face.\n\nThinking that the game was going to be too easy after the difficulty was changed was a bad assumption on my part. That little dead alien in the corner reminded me that I shouldn’t let my guard down. This little bugger skirted around the edge of the map taking pot shots at my guys almost killing two of them. I was throwing out flares left and right to try to find him to no avail. I eventually found him by sending one soldier randomly to the side of the map and just happened to spot him. Needless to say, when he became visible, the bullets went flying.\n\nMoving on, research has been overhauled to be more convenient for the player. Let’s just say that you go out on your first mission and you clean house very well. When you get back to base you have only a few options to research, general concepts like alien electronics or alien interrogations if you managed to capture an alien alive. What about the dissections and the alien craft that you left behind? Well, it’s being taken cared of. That’s being done behind the scenes and you’ll get that info in good time and the other related research options therein. You still have plenty of things to research so don’t feel robbed here; Xenonauts makes research feel streamlined.\n\nAnother interesting note is that wounded soldiers heal more realistically. This is a neat update while at the same time pretty frustrating. I liked it when people just took a few days off and then poof they were combat ready and good-as-new. In Xenonauts they take time to become combat ready with reduced stats and even more time to fully recover. When the number of days are up for your soldier to enter the field again, they are given a percentage of how much they’ve recovered. You’ll have less health to run around with and lose when you get shot. As time goes on, they do get better, but that’s with time.\n\nThere are plenty of different looking locals between deserts, desert bases, towns, farms and enemy bases. They have different maps for the same type as well so you’ll never really feel that “you’ve been here before”. That is a very nice feature, because few things feel as cheap than reused levels. Some may call the graphic choice dated, but not only does it look nice aesthetically, the devs do a great job setting a creepy atmosphere with it. I really like the presentation of Xenonauts.\n\nOne last note, the NPCs in Xenonauts are freaking amazing. Some are just helpless civilians and do stupid civilian things, but the guys with guns (soldiers and farmers) actually use thier guns to defend themselves. I’ve had some levels be finished by some random farmer killing an alien before my guys got to the part of the map. Well played Goldhawk Interactive, well played.\n\nScore: Tasty!\n\nThere is a lot to love here for fans of tactical games. Nothing feels rushed and sometimes that’s a concern people have when games come out of Early Access. It’s all smooth running and gunning here. With the varied locals and very nice looking isometric scenery, there is some really good “retro” (if you want to call it that) eye-candy to be had. Goldenhawk Interactive doesn’t go out of their way to revamp the series with light blooms and next-gen graphics. They pull from what made the originals so great and modernize it. I have nothing bad to say about Xenonauts (especially since they allow me to lower the difficulty setting). I will try a harder difficulty later, but as of now I appreciate having my ego padded a little more.","December 26, 2014","true","34.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game falls into two categories of gameplay. A globe you must monitor, while in this "Geoscape" the world will go through day and night cycles. During this time you can set scientists to research, Workers to manufacture, and slowly build from a tiny strike force into a globe encompassing powerhouse as you aquire more and more alien technology and information of what they are doing on earth. The key to this part of the game, is sending out fighters to have aerial battles in a very neat radar style where you move your fighters around to position for maximum effectiveness, or to eventually touch down your transport vehicles to enter the next stage of the game.\n\nThe second part is where the core of the gameplay lies. A turn based isometric game. Rather than diverging away from the original and giving them 2 actions like the new X-Coms. Characters have AP, meaning all of your abilities must be carefully calculated for the perfect shot or just to hope you can run far enough away after missing and shouting out loud at your computer.  These points can also be used for a variety of abilities, from weaponry to alien technologies.\n\nThe gameplay feels very genuine and solid, you'll never curse the game for slip-ups, as it's quite informative about how much AP an action or moving will work. Although knowing if something will still be blocking your shot can be somewhat confusing. The feeling of moving inside of an alien ship will fill you with as much dread as it used to. The only issue that ever came up was spotting enemies and still not seeing them in game.\n\nI was a bit skeptical about the price as I suppose I've been spoiled by steam, but this game is definitely worth it as of now. Although some of the art assets seem a bit out of place and a bit to cartoon like, the art inside the turn based is smooth and polished enough to recognize what's happening. And notice some very nice cosmetics, particularly the exterior of  the alien ships.\n\nIn terms of soundtrack, you'll find it quite suspensful which is always a pleasure on games like this. The sound effects are crisp, and hearing an alien scream as you shoot across the map will give you a little fist pump moment.\n\nHonestly pick this one up and support the devs. Have fun with it and know this is one of the best successors to those old games you loved.\n\nI'd give it a 9/10, my only qualms are some of the art assets, and a few technical issues. Beyond that it's been a great game!","July 3, 2014","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

There's no tutorial (and the game DESPERATELY needs one), you can't rotate the camera in combat, preparing your squad for combat is needlessly split across three different areas of the base, soldiers are MORE difficult to tell apart in combat than the original game because every race and gender has the exact same sprite (except for the weapon it carries).\n\nThere's just NOT enough effort here to make things clear. In air combat YOUR planes show how much HEALTH they have left, but alien ships show the reverse - how much DAMAGE they have taken (remember that bit in the Bruno movie about the importance of consistency?). You can only see your weapons' stats at base (and only in a particular place at base - can't examine the weapon your soldier is actually holding, no sir, we don't like that kind of basic UI consistency around these parts, Yankee!). In combat, you don't even get to see how many Time Units you need to reload a gun - the reload button just beeps at you if you don't have enough. And don't get me started about the horrible system for reserving Time Units to shoot your gun, which doesn't reserve the Time Units you need to be able to actually turn towards the target so you can shoot it (would anyone really object if they just let you turn for free when you attack, like in the Rebelstar game on Gameboy?!)\n\nOh, and the art and sound are just nowhere as good as the original X-COM. X-COM's blurry VGA graphics didn't age well, but at least all the aliens looked scary instead of goofy (well, maybe not those dumb Floaters or that Jello alien) and you could clearly tell which room in the base was which - you can't say that about Xenonauts. And a chill still goes up my spine whenever I hear that blaster bomb sound effect used on TV for something else.\n\nYou can make a strong argument that X-COM 2012 lost some of the original's charm with "gamey" elements and being dumbed down, but it also had some clear improvements that Xenonauts is sorely lacking. Despite 2012's many terrible design choices, it's still clearly the true sequel to X-COM.","October 4, 2015","false","15.7"," 45 of 93 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","45","93","4","7"

Kovacs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WJKovacs/","33 products in account","FINAL RELEASE REVIEW: This review was originally a negative review. It turned into a positive one, and now it's negative. Prepare for a rant.\nXenonauts still feels like it's in beta. Civilian A.I is stupid. You can't tell them to stay put; they still run around like idiots and get killed. The game pretends the aliens have moved. A lot of the time, you won't be able to see an alien after your team JUST took potshots at it. You will have to move up a squadmate (wasting that soldier's TU) so that you can see the alien again, which has not moved. The game's rendering system is RIDICULOUS. Here's an example: I activated C4 on the front door of an alien ship. The turn ended. The area where the fire should have been was dark. It seemed like the C4 failed. I brought my soldier up and he walked into fire that didn't even render until he stepped on it. Seriously? Also, if you have your tank (hunter scout car) blow up in front of the UFO doors, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You can't open the doors, shoot through the tank, get on top of it, or push it away. The animations are lacking severely. The doors just snap; there isn't any cool animation of their opening. The geoscape takes a bizarre amount of time to load, too. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing PICTURE, not some 3D holographic image from XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The soldiers are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, too. Am I hiring my family members and people off the street to join my organization or something? Like I said, this game still feels like it's in beta.","February 9, 2014","false","37.6"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","12","26","0","5"

It tries its own thing here and there and most of the time it manages to improve on the concept. It is not perfect, but it is a damn well realized vision and re-imagining of the original X-Com formula.\n\nIf you enjoy strategy games in general, or turn-based squad combat in particular, it's a no-brainer.

If it were not for XCOM: UFO Defense, I doubt this game would have been made. That being said, it is more than fair to strictly compare Xenonauts to XCOM:UD and the latest, much more streamlined, XCOM: Enemy Unknown.\n\nGiven the choice between XCOM:EU and this, I would choose the former. The over-simplification of XCOM that Xenonauts sought to address is no longer a concern once The Long War mod is installed. Xenonauts' incredibly plain graphics and visual design are something I just cannot get past. Everything about it is pure blandness. XCOM has unique visuals, and most importantly, small graphic nuances during the tactical combat that makes it feel like a thrilling shootout. Xenonauts on the other hand is a VERY by the numbers turn-based tactical game.","December 9, 2015","false","11.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Problems are front and center though. Like aliens having amazing accuracy and your soldiers dying quite often. Its not that the loss is unbearable, I like that, its really just a balance issue. The combat is way off. Its best to just have a random guy you didnt name, push up with a shield. Then all the other characters use sniper/rifle, and a machine gunner. This circumvents the crazy high enemy accuracy/damage. It makes the combat dull and even without that element, the combat is dull enough since its really a very standard turn based combat system.\nThe building of your base is clunky, after awhile you figure out what does what (most of it), and why you need it. But building is expensive and income is limited. Early on you can only wait to loot UFOs you shoot down. Thing about that though, is on my first game I had the game is max fast forward and waited a literal 8 minutes before a UFO triggered my radar. Bad placement, I thought... Worst of all, I couldnt catch the UFO. I waited another 3 minutes in max speed, until I got my first UFO. Then inbetween them, they were so scarce. My 3rd game was much better, still more rare then I liked, but I got about 11 of them, out of maybe 18, shot down and secured.\nThe research and mechanic shop are nice, the game does have a good feel to it, but overall the problems with it bog it down from being overly exciting or absurd fun.

It feels unfinished and in time modders may fill the gap but its painful and repetitive in a way that the original was not. The start of the game is well tuned and feels like the original and you don't notice how the AI reacts to your approach often increasing in aggressive level (which in gameplay terms equivalent to knowing you where you square are). However, the gameplay barely advances as the game progresses; at least on veteran alien scales faster than your weapons and there is no psi combat. This just means later missions are just slower and longer than at the start. The tech tree has the same feeling, repeated upgrades but without any excitement or dynamic change to you as the player. In addition without psi combat of your own alien psi is just another random frustrating element to add to the handful of aliens with three times the health of your toughest troops you will find camping in the final room of each downed alien battleship\n\nI am amazed after my first few hours to say that the latest xcom reboot that i felt i barely made through the campaign without being bored probably has more replayability.\n","May 14, 2015","false","54.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Transition to Cold War times is a nice move and ufo-generated events (abductions, crop circles etc.) adds a lot to the game creepy atmosphere. The story... well, I can't tell much about it yet, but it can turn out to be good.\n\nOtherwise this remake of X-COM is extemely close to original, even in its awful, really awful interface and slow uneventful combat system. Seriously: Time Units suck, especially when interface doesn't help you much to predict whether you have enough of them to complete your plan. Soldiers can't look behind a corner! They need to WALK behind a corner, then TURN - take a REACTION shot from an enemy - then maybe SHOOT, then WALK back. WTF. Cover system is very obscure. You cannot tell at first glance how much protection a cover offers and where you should place your soldier to use it effectively.\n\nNew air combat is unnecessarily hardcore though it can have an appeal of its own. I struggled to fight against light scouts losing a fighter after a fighter, while autocombat offered me a 100% victory. It's not impossible to master, but well, it's hardcore. I warned you.\n\nBack to ground missions. Maps are extremely similar to each other. I found myself playing on the same map three times in a row, only differences being my starting place and UFO type!\n\nXenonauts could be a much better game if they dared to shred some X-COM's obsolete features like TU's and interface micromanagement, but well, we have Firaxis XCOM with Long War mod for that.","June 9, 2014","false","6.0"," 67 of 139 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","67","139","0","0"

Often not randomly. The keyboard binds do not save, and the interface is.. sticky and unpolished.\n\nBetween losing support, the insane maintenance cost of multiple bases, staff, vehicles and production costs,\nthe game difficulty curve never changes, and there is nothing you can do get ahead of it. Your troops never even get as good as the aliens troops, they are ALWAYS better, faster, more accurate.\n\nThe aliens are ALL snipers (even the blind ones). They can shoot through glass, over obstacles and kill your troops in one hit easily on normal. Whereas my troops will sometimes miss a 3 yard shot with an 85% chance to hit, 4 times in a row. Or a heavy weapons soldier with a 25% chance to hit will miss all 10 bullets with his\her burst. Even with 8 Colonels for a fire team my troops cant help but shoot each other and miss 95% accurate shots way more often then they should. Additionally, shots are % based on your total time units, so your troops NEVER get to fire more shots per round, just move further.\n\nThe reaction fire system makes it almost impossible to kill any aliens without getting shot yourself by the alien who's turn it ISN'T, because all the aliens seem to have AMAZING reaction times.\n\n2 Months into the game you need 4 bases and 20 fighter craft to deal with the entire worlds ufo problems and you will only have money 1\5 of that. Ufo invasions come in literal swarms so your ships sit and wait or are outnumbered 3 to 1.\n\nScientists and engineers can NOT be moved from base to base, they must be fired and re-hired.\n(What year is it and how many turn based strategies have there been?)\n\nTech options (research trees) are mundane and boring. Its the same old Balistic-Laser-Plasma, blah, blah, blah. Translation: more damage, better accuracy, different sound effects. Nothing interesting like a toxi-gun, or other biologic warfare. Even the bullets from the shotgun look like sniper and assault rifle bullets. Same with laser and plasma.\n\nAll in all. The game is glitchy, my soldiers would rather shoot themselves, and it's a save\load-fest even on normal, the load times on the larger ship missions are un-godly long..oh and no quick save\load option.\n\nX-Com Apoc is STILL the best turn-based strategy. It was beyond stable, ran like water off a hydrophobic surface, good mission time vs geo-scape time balance (didn't spend 98% of your time in missions), well balanced difficulty curve (troops got dope), with interesting tech options.\n\nThe soundtrack on Child of Light would get a better score than this game.","June 1, 2014","false","103.2"," 39 of 83 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","39","83","0","2"

The abilitiy to build and field TANKS was one of big things I was looking forward to in this game and I was not disapointed.\n\nI never played any of the original xcom games so I found the combat a little hard to grasp, and it took me awhile to figure out how turn units work, but after I got past the learning curve it wasn't bad at all.\n\nThe artwork is top notch and all the lore behind research projects is well worth the read.\n\n\nYou're probablly wondering why I'm giving this a negative review after hearing how great I think the game is, but the last is also the most important.\n\nThe game feels dead.......When I go on a mission and deploy my troops there's no life, A simple idle animation would suffice so people don't look like cardboard props standing in a field. There's no discernable ambiance and while this may not sound very important, it is. The game might actually be very entertaining but after a few minutes it simply gets to dry to play.\n\nI hold high hopes for the next game because with just a little more work this game could easily be better than the current xcom.","February 14","false","18.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

At first I was unsure if it was worth the money, and people's complaints about LoS and other annoyances held me at bay even more. Today, finally, FINALLY a discount worth getting the game at. I love it more than the new X-Com. Not only do I already enjoy it's systems just a few hours in, but besides the stray trick-shotting alien, the game runs perfectly and feels fair. The time period is spot on, the music is spot on, and the atmosphere gets so tense that I have jumped twice playing so far. Top this with the time units, allowing you to pop out of cover and fire, the great LoS(the ability to face your soldiers and actual vision arcs)/cover (the abiltiy to crouch, and intervening objects actually having an effect on accuracy) systems and you have a tactical game that is better than most on the market. I've dumped copious amounts of money to my regret into games that are too slow or too shallow, where the atmpshere it too light for the game or the game too light for the atmosphere. Xenonauts does not stand in the ranks of those games. If you played the new X-Com, throw it away and come learn how to run an actual defense network. Buy it. I give you my word you wont regret it.

First I tried playing it on ironman, but soon noticed that the whole game is riddled with oneshot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t through walls and other cool stuff like that which you have zero control over in any way and absolutely no way to counter them, in any way. Your guys will constantly get oneshot, even in the best armor, out of the blue, or sometimes, through walls.\n\nI especially love the grenade mechanics in this game. You see that comforting animation of something flying and you're like: "yay! grenades!". Sadly, the reality is cold: they thought it's too much hassle to actually code grenades to have their own mechanics, like flying path which would allow them to fly OVER the obstacles. Instead, they fly in a straight line like bullets hitting every possible obstacle on the screen and in addition to that they have ridiculously low hit % and the scatter is random to the max. Of course this doesn't prevent the aliens from throwing grenades THROUGH EVERYTHING, including walls, and hitting with them 100%. More ofthen than not that results in the death of everyone in the blast radius, even with best armor and 100hp. Mass oneshots, yay. If you ever happen to hit with your own grenade, you can feel happy if it makes a scratch on the alien. Also you can't even blow up covers effectively with grenades thanks to the... "interesting" explosion mechanics they use. And in addition generally you need 2-4 grenades to destroy any envinroment block. So yeah, grenades, why are they in the game?\n\nAlso your hit % with most weaponry is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly low unless you go into melee and the cover mechanics are iffy at best. If there's a pebble anywhere in the path between you and your enemy, your shot will lose hit %. And I mean literally a pebble. A pebble will lower your aim by 10% and anything fist sized will lower it by 25% and so on. And... I don't even want to get started about the % based action costs. Basically your virgin rookie who hasn't drawn first blood will shoot his/her gun as just as many times as your battle-hardened commander who's looked death and slaughter into eyes and laughed. Your highest rank soldier will move a few squares further and that's it. He'll still get oneshot anyways.\n\nThe combat is extremely simplistic, exactly like it was over 20 years ago in the original X-COM games. That's all nice and cool, but if I want to play a game with 20 years old technology I'll play those games, which actually have functioning grenades as well in addition to some other cool stuff. Additionaly they have the great excuse of actually being over 20 years old, so you can forgive their flaws more easily.\n\nFrom the newer X-COM games I really missed the classes and how they affected the game play in various different ways. It added spices to the old mix, making missions different and changing your approach. Also another thing I missed was the "trinket" items of the newer games. Like S.C.O.P.E.S. and stuff. The lack of player usable psionics is also a con.\n\nBut is there anything good in this game at all...? Well, I liked the base buildling and how you had to manage more than one base to save the Earth. Also the air combat mechanics, even though simple, were a nice thing. Both of these could've been improved on, massively. The base structures could've had more variation in different ways and so on. But still, it's an indie game and at least they tried.\n\nAnd why do you have storerooms in the game at all if they are basically not used? You store what? 2 items in those? Alien alloy and energy things. Why do you destoy the alien corpses after the missions? I'm sure there would be a market for alien skull decor for housing if you have no other use for the corpses. Also the rewards of doing missions are pretty lackluster, but in this game that's a good thing when you think about it...\n\nApparently there's going to be Xenonauts 2 so we shall see if they manage to actually improve the mechanics. I hope so. This one had potential, but you can see through it's flaws after a very short time of playing.\n\nI can't really recommend this game unless you're suffering from massive boredom. If you want some turn-based alien action I'd recommend you to try The Long War mod for X-Com:Enemy Within.","February 25","false","39.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

Thats XCOM on high difficulty, in this game its medium. Thats sad.\n(i dont remember the exact difficulty-names, sorry)\n\n6) research doesnt make much sense - the results are well explained but its senseless to gain knowledge about ARMOR during PLASMA RIFLE reseach, for example - that should've been available after "alien alloys" .... and its only a small example\n\n7) air combat is a bit more fun than in XCOM - but its also a bit harder\n\n8) air-retreat has a big bug : the match ends only once the UFO (!) has left the screen, even if your fighter has already left\n\n9) ground combat is ... not bad, it basically looks like XCOM with high resolution but in that case i prefer a lower resolution - either polish the classic combat in ways which make it better or keep it like it is .... there is no in-between, everything else looks pretty cheap to be honest and thats exactly what this game is -- even the dying-animations (if one could call em that) are cheap and consist of .... one (?) single step - in XCOM it was at least 2-3 per alien.\n\n10) Music is good but the soundeffects are pretty bad - most sounds are missing or replaced by very bad ones\n\n11) It has no XCOM-like feeling, the ground combat does not instill fear, there is zero tense anywhere and  it looks like ... something boring.\n\n12) ground combat-view is not rotatable. Yes. One of the most important features in tactical, turn-based games is missing. XCOM had it. Because its necessary.\n\n13) the world map looks bad - even XCOM had a (much) better one, even in 3D\n\nconclusion : its worse than the classics in some ways. The few additives make it worthwile for a few hours but thats it ... if you want a new (and ACTUAL) XCOM-follower this is not your game, its basically a bad version of what should've been released from the original XCOM-developers a few years after the last of the (original) series ... not bad but also not really good.","December 17, 2014","false","5.2"," 20 of 45 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","20","45","0","2"

The in-game help does a poor job. Why does it say I don't have enough hangar slots for a new fighter when I have a free hangar? This and a bunch of other questions send me to google searches 10 minutes into the game.\n2. Why is it when I buy new solders they don't show up in my ship list?\n3. Why it is when one research completes it doesn't automatically start a new research on my queue, instead of requiring me to manually assign scientists?\n4. It's extremely cumbersome to reserve action points. I have to click or make a hotkey to reserve a certain amount, but this doesn't account for kneeling or soldier rotation.\n5. Melee attacks don't work, clicking the button just uses action points and does nothing.\n6. How many action points do I need for grenades? No way to tell that doesn't take a lot of clicks.\n7. How does cover work?\n8. How does overwatch work?\n9. Things which should be simple take many clicks - healing myself, throwing grenades, assigning soldier gear.\n\nThere is no in-game narrative. Unlike XCom which has animations and voice acting to flesh out the feel of what is going on, you are just dumped into a bunch of spreadsheets and left to figure things out.\n\nThe only real positive to the game is the 2D art, which is generally well done.","September 25, 2015","false","21.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Origen0/recommended/223830/","Origen0","Origen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Origen0/","859 products in account","UPDATED: With the release of version 1.51 I decided to give this game another go.\n\nUnfortunately after putting in enough time to get to the final mission I still have to give this game a thumbs down.  Much of the game has been improved, many bugs fixed but there's ultimately still some very weak or bad mechanics and a lack of balance to the game.\n\nThe difficulty level even at Normal is still punishing of even the smallest of mistakes.  By the end game even with troops with almost all max'd stats using the best armor and weapons available it's not uncommon to be sniped at by monsters that are beyond view range and are very good shots, sometimes killing your soldiers in one hit or two hits.  This turns the game into a load/save fest because if you lose your well trained troops in late game it'll be very hard to train new troops with bad stats up to the level your previous troops were.\n\nThere's still issues with visibility and firing angles that often don't make sense, such as cases where I'm 100% blocked from shooting an alien I can see but yet it can shoot at me.  Also missed shots are entirely too erratic, standing right behind your own tank your veteran soldiers can still fire off a shot so badly aimed it hits and severely damages your own tank.  Or trying to shoot an alien in a second story window and having the missed shot hit a stack of pallets 10 feet in front of my soldier at ground level.  I've never fired a real gun in my life but I'm confident I could get the bullet to go in the general direction of the window with minimal training.\n\nMorale also gets silly, my squad has been on dozens of missions, each member killing dozens of aliens, but still will find reason to panic or flee at times.\n\nMany UI elements are not well designed or missing information.  When you unlock new weapons that you can build in your workshop there's no tooltips in the workshop to provide details on what the stats of the weapons are.  So you end up having to blow money to build a single weapon to then look at its stats to understand if you want to bother making more.  Item weight is not listed in the tooltips either, you have to equip them and do the math to figure it out, not hard, but annoying.  It wasn't clear to me until late game that when intercepting an alien craft you can send multiple planes.  Hiring a soldier and putting them in a dropship requires going through 3 screens.\n\nIt's odd that you can't build other base buildings until the command center is completed. This isn't apparent until you experience it firsthand.  So be careful - the second base you build is going to take 10 days longer than you think it will.  They should really let you plan out/execute a blueprint all at once for the entire base.  Take into account build times and existing structures automatically if you want.\n\n"Run in Windowed" option only works if the resolution is less than your native desktop resolution.\n\nOther countries that you don't have coverage over seem to lose money faster than reasonable when playing at normal difficulty even after version 1.51.\n\nThe entire interception portion of the game is entirely too tightly balanced and crucial to success.  I'm here for the TBS not the interception game.  Having said that, I can't stress the value in having a large air force and doing airstrikes on many of your alien crash sites.  You can't and will not want to raid them all.\n\nI ended up having to tweak the monetary values of several items in the game in order to loosen the difficulty up (on Normal) to something more reasonable to the point where the focus of the game was on the missions with your troops rather than trying to balance a checkbook.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game isn't horrible.  However unless you're dying for a new TBS game (and I was) I'd recommend waiting till it's on sale before trying.  If you're a fan of the new XCom and are expecting more of the same look elsewhere.","July 1, 2014","false","42.0"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","0"

This is simply one of the best strategy and tactical games I have played in years.\n\nYou are leading a black ops organization that exists to defend the Earth from alien invasion, and it is multinational, receiving funding primarily from the USSR/USA but the rest of the world as well. You start at the beginning of an alien incursion into Earth, and you are charged with building base[s] from which to base interceptors, infantry strike teams and their helo transports, radar, SAM sites, research laboratories, workshops to build dank new memes for your infantry and pilots, medical centers, et cetera!\n\nThe strategic side of the game occurs in the geoscape, where you make decisions regarding the administration and disposition/construction of your bases. You monitor world events - alien incursions will occur with the aim of terrorizing populations, and the more South Americans ♥♥♥♥ their pants, the less money they will allocate to fund your operations. You can increase your relations (and funding!) with regions by intercepting and destroying UFOs. By shooting down a UFO over land, you create a crash site, which you need to launch a raid on aliens and recover alien technology and resources. This is critical. The strategic side of this game is very engrossing.\n\nOn the tactical and RPG side of the game, you scout, hire, and deploy infantry in a variety of roles, with a variety of equipment, on a variety of missions including raids/assaults and base defense. Your troops come from all over, with pertinent information (aside from their ability statistics) being age, nationality, prior unit, and combat experience. I've had an American paratrooper with combat experience in Vietnam, Soviet Spetsnaz GRU member with experience in Ethiopia, Soviet Spetsnaz with Afghan experience, Norwegian FSK, British Paras and Royal Marines, Italian Bersaglieri, et cetera... autismo dreamscapes! DANK #swagover9000\n\nCombat itself is very well thought-out and challenging. You never know what sort of enemy you will be facing, and caution is a good idea while moving out from your infil point. Assaulting a crash site is always messy, and a genuine challenge.\n\nOne point of contention - I'm a Marine, and as such it pisses me the ♥♥♥♥ off to see virtually 50% of troops in the game be females. There has never been a female SEAL and never will be - why the ♥♥♥♥ am I see female Alfa, SEAL, Royal Marines, etc.?

Enemies on higher elevation can hide in spots not visible from the ground, occasionally annoyingly prolonging combat.\n\nAnd sadly, there is not a huge amount of gear to choose from - e.g. you end up with two choices for armour (heavy armour limiting the user to machine guns, and light armour with a jetpack that makes the character FLY nearly every time you give him a move order and also makes checking corners redundant due to 360 degree vision), which ultimately contributed to me rushing towards the end; having everyone in the annoying jetpack armour was just too damn annoying.\n\nIf this review had been for the first half of the game I'd have recommended it, but with the 2nd half I don't think I can recommend the game overall UNLESS you are already into what I assume old school XCOM was like; I, at least, won't be playing it without looking very hard at mods to fix the above.","December 31, 2014","false","28.7"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","0"

The game artwork is sorta mediocre, but the gameplay graphics are more than adequate although not anywhere near the quality X-Com Enemy Unknown.  What is most important to me in this type of game is the gameplay, and this is where Xenonauts falls woefully short.  Let me give a couple of examples.\n\nI started the game on the default "normal" difficulty, chose my starting base, and proceded to "fast forward" towards the first enemy encounter... Seconds later, a target is spotted and I send both my aircraft out to intercept the bogey.  Once they get close to their prey, they violently circle around the target at dizzying speeds until eventually they run out of fuel and have to return to base... hmm... okay.. no problem.. I will just start over.  This happens again and again over the next 3 or 4 restarts (from scratch choosing a different start location each time).. Apparently they didn't play test this part, or apparently I was very unlucky about ship positioning.\n\nOkay... Finally I get a non-spin cycle encounter, and I heroically down the bogey with barely a scratch... Time to send in the troops !   My troop ship lands and my 8 ground agents are ready to kick some alien butt !   I deploy my troops from the landing craft in pairs, being sure to reserve some Time Units for a shot or two in case aliens are close.  From past experience, I also make sure to "kneel" and take advantage of cover whenever possible.  My last troops out of the ship are Joe & Bob... and I deploy them kneeling side by side behind a nearby fallen tree trunk and I End My Turn.  The hunt is on !  Seconds later during the Enemy Movement phase, I strike it rich !... My planning has paid off !   An unwary alien has appeared direectly in front of my two would-be heros, and Bob carefullly lines up a shot with his Sniper Rifle using his extra Time Units that he saved.... HEAD SHOT !... Not the Alien... but Joe crouching 90 degrees off to his right one square away  :(\n\nTwice I removed the game from my hard drive, and twice I reloaded it in hopes that it was a quirk experience... But these experiences happened each time.   I sincerely hope that the developers/programmers work to correct these problems, and I hope I have the opportunity once again to try to play this game, but as for now, it will be removed again, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.","March 16, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","1"

And by that I mean if you're a fan of fustration and like having your butt handed to you on a platter on a consistent basis. I played through, all the way, on 'normal' mode (which is actually easier than what it's supposed to be played on, which is veteran) and the sheer unfairness of it all was mind boggling.\n\nGrunts that would have something like a 17% chance to hit at point blank range, the absolute worst RNG ever (consistent misses, also at point blank range, with shotguns when you've got like a 90% chance of hitting). Aliens that can see across the screen when you *can't*, absolutely insane maintenance costs that basically mean that if you don't optimize your initial base you'll basically never be able to make another base. Which is a problem because you *need* at least 3 or 4 bases in total if only to get radar coverage of the whole world map. To say nothing of the extreme cost putting hangers and fighters in those locations.\n\nTLDR- Horribily unbalanced combat in favor of the aliens, horribly implemented and unbalanced economy. When it's literally impossible to make a second base because your funding is so low you can't even afford to *start construction* there is a problem. Especially since the odds are extremely good that once you hit that critical point where you aren't making enough money you'll basically stay there for the rest of the game.\n\nI recommend this game only for die hard purists of the original XCOM. In every other way however the newer XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within is a superior use of your money. That and if you're really a die hard purist of the original XCOM then you could, you know, just buy the original XCOM since it is also on Steam.","May 24, 2015","false","24.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

And Xenonauts is NOT a good game. The user experience is horrible. ***Mild spoilers ahead***\n\n2 main points to illustrate, strategically and tactically:\n\n1)Strategically, this game pointlessly drags on for many, many hours more than necessary because the UFOs that contain necessary tech just simply DO NOT arrive until VERY LONG time into the game. Case in point: First Battleship for me? UFO-199... You have to go through like 100+ tactical mission drudgery just to advance the game... And you sort of HAVE TO play the tactical part because Airstrike doesn't give enough resources. Then, even when you have some Marauders (but not a lot yet), you still have to play each air combat out, and it's exactly the same, you patiently click and wait, click and wait, until you are tailing UFO for comfortable Cannon takedown to avoid taking damage... And you will have to play 10s of air battles, which gameplay you solved 10+ hours ago, just to farm enough money to afford 10+ Marauders so you can autoresolve.\n\n2)Tactically the game is also really bad. The maps are too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ large and Industrial map is the biggest nightmare of them all - you will have to advance at a REALLY SLOW pace, or else you will get killed. That is not difficulty, that is just boring. And all 90% of deaths I had was because I got so bored of advancing a few tiles a turn I just rush in with all TUs spent.\n\nLate game things get even more messed up - Once you got Sentinel Armor, you cannot simply order a soldier to move to a point, and then do it with the next one - The camera will FORCEFULLY center on a soldier who's flying MULTIPLE times and will break your control of someone in a Predator armor because your previous soldier is flying at a DIFFERENT ALTITUDE LEVEL... And thus you are forced to watch EACH of 12 soldiers SLOWLY move one by one to the target point. The same bull$hit happens on UFOs with multiple levels.\n\nI think the developers didn't play this game themselves. I do not know how they could subject anyone to this mindless boring repetitive piece of krap.\n\nWhat's the difference between old school UFOD and this?\n1)Turns resolve momentarily. In Xenonauts they take 5-15 seconds on I5-3570K. The simple AI logic doesn't warrant this amount of computation.\n2)The animation was instantaneous. Courtesy of DOSBox speedup, but still. In Xenonauts. you have to watch people fly for like 7-10 seconds each in Sentinel armor for NO good reason.\n3)The UFOD does not swarm you with pointless spam of UFOs. Maybe it should have, but you should NOT have to capture EACH of them in order to barely have enough money for anything. I've had 10 colonels by mission 30-35. Then what? Nothing - you still play 100 more combats with them, with barely any progress at all once TUs and Accuracy are maxed out.\n4)Game pace in UFOD is much better, you do not have to trudge through 50+ UFOs to advance to next tech level.\n5)With late game tech you can own small UFOs no problem. Not true in Xenonauts. Due to best armor in the game being unable to stop the very wild 50-150% damage fluctuation, you still have to be wary of a lucky burst from a simple Caesan.\n6)UFOD had Psi. Xenonauts? Only aliens do.\n\nWould I play this game again? Hell no. Too much time wasted NOT playing or making decisions, but watching unit animation, and waiting turns.","March 5, 2015","false","70.0"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/recommended/223830/","badtexture","Kill-Cam Celebrity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/","184 products in account","So far, I'm rather disappointed.  While I was hoping for XCOM UFO Defense expanded and prefected, what I got was a rather dumbed-down version with some Facebook-esque artwork.  What's worse is that upon researching the game, I learned that there were several great features cut during early access and dumbed down, with developers being extremely hostile towards anyone who thought otherwise.\n\nLet's start off with the good: First of all, it's more XCOM.  No, not Firaxis' streamlined and modfiied reboot, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but the classic XCOM: UFO Defense and Terror from the Deep.  It's got a wider scope than the reboot, more micromanagement, and places equal emphasis on your planning as it did combat, unlike the more combat-focused reboot.  Regardless of your opinion on Firaxis' attempt to reboot the franchise (which I absolutely loved), this game is a completely different experience.Air Combat has been revamped, and feels like a game mechanic rather than a short prayer to the AI Director that has screwed you over so many times in your Warframe loot tables and L4D2 sessions.  It's one of the few changes I genuinely enjoyed, a fully realized version of the air combat in which you operate your ships in real-time and attempt to outmaneuver the alien contact.Variety of weapons.  XCOM classic had launchers, Assault Rifles, and pistols, Xenonauts added Snipers, LMGs, and Shotguns.New feature: Airstrikes.  They cost $15,000 and you miss out on loot, but if you simply don't have the resources to respond, you may have to take the loss to control damage.  It's a great addition, and one of the ways this game's best points is interception.\nNow, let's go ahead and address the neutrals.\nExternal launcher.  I count this as a negative, but it's simply something I really can't take too harshly.Civilians are almost ALWAYS present.  I have mixed opinions on this, as while it gives the missions a bit more tension, it turns civilians into a regular instance of combat.  In XCOM, The announcement of a terror mission genuinely scared you, as it put your entire monthly rating on the line.  It threw off your usual strategies, and it forced you to take risks you would have never done before... now, civilians are just a "oh well, let's go through plan D."You're no longer protecting a planet, you're looking at a map.  Whatever, I think I'm done nitpicking for now.\nAs much as I love some of the changes present, the rest of the game completely kills the praise I could have had for the game.  Well, let's get the pitchfork and burn this thing down:Artstyle.  It's cell-shaded and looks like it belongs in a Facebook game.  XCOM UFO Defense can pass as pixel art, and its visuals have aged fairly well.  This game already looks dated and distgusting.As I said, the mechanics are horribly dumbed down from XCOM UFO Defense, and combat isn't nearly as interesting.Somehow, they managed to make the XCOM UI block even more convoluted and unorganized.  I didn't even think it was possible, but despite the fact that XCOM was meant for resolutions ranging from 200p to 480p, it's amazing that with all the extra screenspace Xenonauts managed to do an even worse job of organizing the UI.\nIf this were its own game, I would be willing to overlook the flaws and recommend it anyway.  However, it isn't an independent game, it's just an XCOM clone without the same kind of flair that the classic holds.  For $15 less, you can get the original and with the OpenXCom mod, it stomps all over Xenonauts.

The same people who obsess over this will be the same ones who whine about the brilliant Xcom enemy unknown game for being "cinematic". Such heresy, how dare modern technology actually make games fun to play and enhance the atmospherics and visuals while also giving it a gameplay system that actually works.\n\nThe negative reviews here hit on some key issues, the combat is unbearable, illogical and random, crouch makes no sense, visibility is a mess as well, can be a few tiles away from an enemy and they'll just disappear from view, you can't use anything properly for cover or aim over or around anything, but hey, I guess realism and better gameplay don't matter, that's "too cinematic" and we must rigidly cling to the outdated systems of early 90s video games. Also even on easy the game is not so much hard as plain awkward as your soldiers can't shoot for s**t and half the time end up firing at each other instead, the interface in general is as awkward and inaccessible as the old games if not worse and unlike modern games that actually have these things called tutorials and learning curves it just expects you to figure all of this out at the start.\n\nThe graphic style leaves a lot to be desired, whereas the likes of shadowrun, wasteland 2 and xcom have done a fantastic job of updating the visuals while remaining faithful to the classic and newly revived isometric format, Xenonauts has this silly cartoonish style that I really can't take to. Also the audio mix seems a bit off, can barely hear the ambient music, but the only settings in the game you can alter at all are controls....\n\nJust the whole combat system is so outdated and tedious to play, as soon as someone's wounded they can't do anything, does the game tell you what to do to heal them? Of course not, but I guess you can only know how to play this game if you grew up with 90s xcom games. I guess this is something for rigidly conservative gamers incapable of trying out anything made past 1995, but modern turn based games do the whole isometric sci fi tactics much, much better. Trying this overhyped disappointment just makes me more impatient for a follow-up to the Xcom Enemy Unknown and Enemy WIthin games.\n\nThis modern trend of just shamelessly regurgitating retro games and outright refusing to take on board what games since then have achieved and moved forward with is just very tedious and pretentious. I am all for a degree of nostalgia and for reviving the classic isometric style but it's been shown in shadowrun and enemy unknown that you can take the best of both worlds without completely straying from the style of the classics. They're still old school at heart.","February 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

But I didn't.\n\nIt's hard to quantify exactly what sucked the fun out of the game for me, I think it's a combination of elements.\n\nGraphics:  awesome .. if it were the late 90s and the game were a direct sequel to UFO: Enemy Unknown.  But it isn't.  I just found the graphics - whether units, localities, base drawings .. to be very underwhelming.  I know they were aiming for "retro charm" possibly because they couldnt afford/achieve "acceptable for modern gaming".  (I do like some retro-charm games, like FTL .. but I guess I suffer the graphics because I enjoy the gameplay.\n\nGameplay:  where to start .. ?   I found the AI to be pretty simple -- the action point system quite painful, especially managing large numbers of units -- the fog of war to be quite annoying (I dont mind fog of war in general, but in this game it's just an ugly mechanic and in many ways not intuitive .. like not seeing over a hedge) -- on a good note, the progression of units felt OK -- the strategic map and base building was OK but .. dunno, it didn't feel to me like a gripping financial sim, which was one of the appeals of the original.\n\nResearch tree, all the incidental stuff - dunno .. just felt "been there, bought the t-shirt, don't need to go back".\n\nI had no particular expectation of the game .. which is usually a good thing because you're not set up for disappointment .. and yet somehow I came away disappointed anyway.\n\nMaybe it's just because the formula hasn't aged well.  I enjoyed the original games, played up to Xcom: Apocalypse (which I also enjoyed despite being outraged and culture shocked by the fact that they confined it to a city).  But yeah .. in my opinion Xenonauts is a pretty bland game .. maybe a 6/10 ..\n\nMy advice is to kick the tyres and look at some videos before deciding to pick it up.\n","February 17, 2015","false","4.3"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","3","13","0","0"

I started the game and had no clue what to do. Had to go back and read stuff. OK, lot of common elements to XEU but with a very clunky interface. Fine. So this game has an strategic level more complex than XEU. Many of the mechanics are similar to  XEU like constructing the base by expanding locations and selecting what to build. Combat is also similar turn based and using cover, changing weapons, etc. But I just have no fun with this game. Here is what I dislike.\n\nThe combat in XEU is implemented much better. For example,  in XEU line of sight works is carefully implemented. In Xeno it seems they use a random factor to simulate it and it doesn't work well. For me combat was the most fun part of XEU and it is the worst part of Xeno. Xeno relies low hit rate to simulate difficulty. Chance is not a replacement for implementing strong combat elements like line of sight. XEU adds chance on top of strong combat elements, that is fun. Xeno adds chance as a replacement to implement strong game elements, that is not fun.\n\n\nI will stop purchasing games with low production values like Xeno. This seems implemented for the 1980's before dedicated graphic cards were implemented.","May 23, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","7","0","0"

Some have been interesting, most have been fairly bad but Xenonauts is special.\n\nYou could put it this way, of all the X-COM clones over the last 20 years, Xenonauts is the most faithful.  In a way it is aiming to be the "ideal" version of X-COM, like it want's to be more X-COM-ey than X-COM somehow.  It does not attempt to introduce new core mechanics, blasphemy!  No wacky moves into mixed real-time mode and definitely no newfangled 3d!  It's like the dev sat down and said something like "This game is going to be EXACTLY like X-COM exept where it is better!  Because, I don't like things that are different!".\n\nUnfortunately the result is inferior to X-COM in every possible way.  And, it comes off as being devoid of any creative inspiration.  It looks like the Chinese, knock-off t-shirt of X-COM games.\n\nSince Xenonaut's only selling point would be the graphics, to review it you have to talk about that.  The graphics in Xenonauts are a slight improvement over the 1994 X-COM game.   But, they're embarrassingly crude by today's standards.  Xenonauts released shortly after games like X-COM Enemy Unknown and The Banner Saga which have set consumer expectations for this sort of game fairly high.\n\nAn effort has been made to give the Xenonaut sprites smooth (rotoscoping?) animation.  Despite this welcome improvement the visual style is... well... bland, I suppose... insipid, maybe?  This whole game honestly made me wonder why this developer bothered to publish this product.  But, I think it might have had something to do with cashing-in on X-COM's recent popularity, in what essentially amounts to stealing IP.\n\nAnyway, that aside, Xenonauts is playable but don't get your hopes up for a "dream come true" X-COM update / remake.  It borrows freely from other, better games but gives nothing back to the genre.  It would comfortably make the grade as a marketable product for steam but beyond that it is only memorable for its extreme lack of creativity.\n\nIt's very, very strange to see this sort of game come from indie developers.  It's a postcard from a topsy turvy world where indie devs cannot innovate and try to compete based on graphics.","July 1, 2014","false","31.4"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

You can stay right behind a tall one square obsticle and it will say 100% blocked line of fire for you, in spite of the manual saying otherwise, and still the aliens can kill you behind that obsticle.\n\nSometimes the "cover" system works, meaning you can stay behind a corner of a wall and shoot around it at a spotted alien by another unit. But other times you cant.\n\nUFO doors that you open on your turn stay open when its the aliens turn and they fire at you, and then closes when its your turn. If the doors are opened by the aliens on their turn, they close just the same on your turn. Spoiler: Blow the fricking door open.\n\nLosing soldiers to faulty game mechanics is not the way I want to be beaten by the AI!\n\n\nDowned UFOs are all the same. They never have holes blown in their sides that can use to enter the craft, you allways have to use the front door.\nCombat maps are decent. They are made of several smaller chunks, smaller than other X-com clones I've played, making the maps seemingly more varied. I've come across the same chunks very often, so there arent alot of them - yet. Maybe a modding community can rectify that.\n\nIf you compare it to the original, which they clearly want (they even called their game X-COM one place in the manual) they have less stats than it. Xenopedia lacks info. You need to visit the soldier equipment screen to find the stats of the different weapons, and then only in a hard to activate mouseover popup.\nCudos to the role system they have for the soldiers, making it very easy to switch equipment on soldiers.\n\nIs the game bad - No. Is it better than all the other clones out there - No, not really.

The guns are pretty unbalanced, generic and boring, the game feels odd, it doesn't feel like an advancement from the original. There are currently a lot of problems with this game.

Until the game is patched up a lot and a lot of the game hopefully fixed, I don't recommend this game to anyone.

Even Civ, which has more complex ideas I think, has a tutorial complemented with a full in game manual which is easy to access and use.\n\nHopefully we don't get a Xenonauts 2.","October 13, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","9","2","0"

Would want to give the game "recommend". However, the unrealistic setting in regarding to the financing, world political, world economy setting (by comparing to another xcom title - x -com : Enemy unknown) and the excessive punishment setting which prevent me to enjoy the game.\n1. The organisation is poorly financed by the world and expectation is unreasonably high. Easily get financial punishment without a proper reason. Unable to expand due to financial problem.\n2. Reward setting is poor. Success in high risk mission do not end up with equivalent high reward. (Destorying an alien base do not get apprasal from the local government)\n3. Financing setting is poor. Limited option to get additional financing. Reselling price of advance equipment is unreasonably low just like the alien technology is commonly available to the world\n4. With such high end technology and elite soliders on hand, the organisation can simply choose to walk away and get financial from other source (selling alien technology, equipment in black market, team with the most rich in the world) and deal with the alien threat on its own (just like some other sci-fi fiction). Therefore, the excessive punishment setting in the game is not enjoyable. Beside, if the government choose to kill itself, who care. The end of the government does not mean the end of the world, so long the organisation continue to exist. Sadlessly our real world actually telling you this in these recent years.\n\nAnyway, the main point is, as a simulator, it would not be harmful if the game include the original rule set, improved rule setting and custom rule set for player to suit their style.","September 27, 2014","false","94.0"," 5 of 20 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","5","20","0","0"

There's nothing new about it except for a graphics update, and if you've played any of the latest console versions of XCOM, even that's not there. So, why am I surprised it's allowed to exist?

Really? Well, I guess it was perfect before, then, because as I wrote, there's not much new about it. There are some changes: it takes place during the Cold-War, you can control your interceptor when fighting UFOS (think Zaxxon or Defender), and I guess sometimes your interceptor faces multiple enemies.

It is ENTIRELY based on a poorly designed random number generator (RNG.)  The RNG determines if shots will hit or not.  Your shots frequently miss (and your soilders are ex- SPECOPs by the way,)  while shots from the aliens will pass through several solid objects, including shields and other soilders (without injuring them) and fatally strike a soilder you were retreating.  Shots will frequently miss even at point blank ranges with all weapons, especially with shotguns and sniper rifles (I mean, really, shove the gun down the xeno's throat and pull the f---ing trigger.)  Your troops seem to have failed basic training (read: boot camp.)  They will FREQUENTLY panic without even being shot at.  They will throw down their weapons and run (I once had a soilder run INTO a UFO.  (What the f--- made you think of that idea dumba$$?)  You can not sling a soilder's weapon, throw a grenade, and unsling the weapon (so its back in your soilder's hands) during the same turn.  Needless to say, this make a panic smoke grenade impossible.  It seems that some doors are incapable of being closed (really, you're in the military and you can't close certain doors?)  It seems your soilders are incapable of melee combat without a certain weapon (a stun batton.)  (So, let me get this straight, you DON't know how to slam the butt of your rifle into a xeno's face?)  I've also had issues with soilders throwing grenades at thier feet.  (I'm not even going to say anything about that.)  Finnaly, the alien's psionic abilities are completly imbalanced.  Theroretically, they are capable of mind controling a soilder they can't even see while he is still on the dropship (and possibly dropping a C4 charge with zero turns on the timer.)  Not good at all when a core mechanic of the game is permadeath.\n\n(My English teacher would be saying to start a new paragraph here, so...)\nThen there are bugs.

I've had soilders get shot, survive, and then drop dead as soon as my turn begins.  Finnaly, in the year 2014, this game uses a launcher.

On the plus side this game does offer gameplay reminiscent of the original XCom series. The abilty to research alien technology and then reverse engineer to enhance your team of elite soliders as they battle aliens in a variety of tuen based senarios is still there. Also there is the need to manage the logistics surrounding managing your resources including contsructing new equipment and costs associated with expanding  your bases facilitites.\n\nWhat is different is the pace of gameplay. Even on easy setting this game is very difficult, so much so that you find yourself saving and reloading again and again. The result is slowed gameplay that often feels like a real slog whereas the original titles were challenging but well paced.\n\nOther annoyances include the constant bugs that plague each release. All of my games work seamlessly with the expcetion of this title which crashes again and again.

When you actually find the aliens you have to attack them with your strike team but that can prove difficult when you solider is 2 feet away and only has a 35 pecent chance to hit so then if you miss the alien can shoot you and almost every time it hits and does 20 to 50 damage. please if you want to have a fun good time dont play this game.  it is definetly not worth the 25 buck for","August 31, 2014","false","51.0"," 0 of 20 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","20","0","1"

The developer himself admits to watering down the game. They've based the entire game economy on the air war, and, at the same time - made the air war far far too easy. Buy this only at a deep Steam sale discount. Probably in the $9.99 range, but at full price it just isn't worth it.\n\nIf more dissappointing is the fact that your fighters can NEVER be killed. If they get shot down they magically "crash land", only to be completely rebuilt FOR FREE in a short 72 hours. Also, pilots never get injured and you get a free one of those aswell.\n\nThe ground game is half decent, but air combat is candy land that one cannot simply dismiss it. It ruins immersion and any sense that you were playing a panetary defence simulation.\n\nAvoid.\n\nThis is NOT the X-Com you so fondly remember.","December 28, 2013","false","23.6"," 15 of 58 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","15","58","0","0"

While the remake has a small team, they tend to feel more like some sort of action movie super team. In Xenonauts, your team dies. And dies. And dies some more. When you reveal the map, you only increase the tension for those places still hidden, the awareness growing that as you eliminate hiding places you are only closing the range and make it easier for the unknown enemies to perforate your squad with vastly superior firepower. The fire superiority enjoyed by your foes makes no difference to the mission generator, often outnumbering your soldiers as well. You deliberately harden your heart to avoid becoming too attached to that one officer who can move a quarter way across the map and still have time units and accuracy to put a shot through an alien's eye because you know it's just a matter of time until...BANG!

Xenonauts is more intuitive and pretty than its predecesor as well as creating the same feeling that you are juggling 9001 balls at once, and are constantly a few poor choices away from total collapse. All in all, the game is a great experience.\n\nAlthough I have not completed the game, just scratched the surface really (I've played three months in-game), I can say for certain that all of the difficulty of the original game is present. Every desicion is vital and it is imperative to really consider the best course of action at all times. If you don't, well, let's say there have been more than a few missions which resulted in complete annihilation of my squad, a terrible loss.\n\nThe game is also much more faithful to the original than XCOM - ENEMY UNKNOWN, bringing back TU's, much larger squads, and a more complicated geoscape portion of the game. In many respects, though, it improves on the original. The OP Blaster bomb has been removed, the graphics look polished and attractive, and useful/relevant data is more easily accessed.\n\nHowever, I do not mean to say that the game is without faults. For new players to the series, there is hardly and tutorial to introduce them to the many facets of being an international super-secret alien defense force commander. This means the learning curve can be quite steep. Furthermore, the game has some frustrating line of sight issues. Sometimes, I will attempt to move my soldier to firing position, only to discover that the bush I was trying to shoot through might as well be a solid wall. Although over time I have been able to more successfully ascertain what I can and can't do, it has provided a great deal of frustration.\n\nAll in all, the game is excellent, and in my oppinion more pleasurable to play than the original. (Although the punishing nature of the original adds a bit to the feel. Ironically by making it better it's worse?) Anyway, if you are a fan of strategy games or the original series then I would highly recommend you purchase this game immediately and begin fighting off the extraterrestrial invasion!","June 5, 2014","true","46.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its very similar to the original with a lot of the content removed(multi-format release) from the latest XCOM game returning .\nThis game has improved strategy in the global setting over Xcom, with you needing to way up more options like; do I build another base to incease radar & aircraft range or add labs & scientists to get better equipment. Time is not on your side, funding dissapears very quickly on hard settings, especially due to unmonitored alien activity.\nThe visuals do a decent job as does the AI (on normal & above). The maps are reasonably varied, yet do repeat slightly more than i'd like. They're about the right size & unlike the original I havent found myself hunting the map for the last camping in a loft alien for 30 mins. Theres also a nice addition in the form of being able to airstrike downed UFO's rather than sending a team in.\n\nOverall I've throughly enjoyed this so far and am happy to recommend it, if you havent played the original this is well worth your money.

For x-com veterans it should be a walk in the park (while getting killed many times by an unseen alien and reloading every now and then)\nAlthough targeted to a limited market, this game can only get better with time as developers work on it.","March 20, 2014","true","70.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was in 'early release'. Played it through a couple of times, it's a good game. I wish at some time they would call it done though... Anyways. I wrote the below bad stuff.\n\nI replayed the game all the way through, on easy. I lost before getting plasma stuff. Lol (still can't figure out how to support more than one base). I did see some new aliens, and a lot of technologies. The descriptions are filled in where they were once missing. There are a lot of tweaks, visually. The game is basiclly the same game, with new aliens, and a little prettier than it was 12 months ago. It crashed a few times, but I save often. :)\n\nI'll probably play it again, and maybe again if they ever finish the game!\n\n(please)\n\n_________________________\n\nI'm RECANTING (taking back) this review.  I started up the game for once in 6 months or so, and it is significantly different now.  I am replaying it to evaluate further.\n\n___________________\n\nXeno has been an early access game for about 1 year now.  Complete turnoff for early access games.

Well, if you are an oldie such as I. Then you will come to appreciate old classics, like Ufo Alien defence (The old X-com), Jagged Alliance 2 and Panzer General. With the exception of Panzer General, the other two are very similar games. With their core underlying mechanics being grounded in managing a team of soldiers in accomplishing some sort off objective. How is that relevant? Well, for starters. You need to understand what this game is trying to accomplish. And that is replicating an old classic and making it more pleasing to the eye. The 'pleasing to the eye' has already been accomplished by the remake Firaxis has made. So again the question is: What does this game bring? Well it successfully manages to incorporate the core aspects that made the original Xcom so great into a neat little package that is pleasing to the eye and keeps the features rich. 'Feature Rich', that is the key here. Everyone including me loves the new remake of X-com very much, but again, if you are like me. Then you will yearn for the classics. In that case, what better then to play a pseudo remake?","April 27, 2014","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even in the late seventies early eighties, special forces looked like special forces. In Xenonauts they look like early James Bond baddies...\n\nAlso there are too few conventional weapons, like SMGs etc.\nAlthough minor, I'd like to have some variation.\nThe troops should look like the bad asses they are supposed to be, with the variety of weapons that Spec Ops use.\n\nBeing relatively basic in the graphics department (and weapons modeling) it should not be too difficult to address these matters (like the modding community is doing at the moment).\n\nAlso the maps seem to lack variety, even with my few hours of game play, that might become an issue in the long run. The way the maps are generate, might lead to the game becoming too repetitive.\n\nAliens have a tendency to pop in and out of their UFO, shooting when it is their turn and going back when it is the player's turn. Tedious and very gamey, of course a rocket or heavy weapon can remove the door and solve that issue. Still some AI tweaking seems to be in place, including interaction with the environment.\n\nStill I like the game and it earns a solid 7/10, which could easily get above 8 if the developer gives it a little more attention, even if it is done through DLC.\n\n","March 1, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

XCOM is easily one of the best designed games ever, so a faithful remake can't be too bad by definition, and this one is not bad at all.\n\nWhere Xenonauts tries to diverge from XCOM it does that with mixed results. For example, the alien races are quite a bit more diverse. One of the starting races is tough, has innate regeneration, but poor eyesight and is best dealt with from a distance. The starting weapons are great - the classic pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle and machine gun differ not only in stats (as in the original), but in their tactical values. Shotguns are deadly close-up, machines guns dish out tons of damage and can easily punch through obstacles, sniper rifles are amazingly accurate from a distance.\n\nAdvancing the weapon tech is, unfortunately, quite boring. It is the same set of classic weapon archetypes all over again, only gradually more powerful. This is exactly the same as in the original game, but after seeing the initial diversity of ballistic weapons this was very disappointing. I had the same issue with the Firaxis XCOM - a "laser shotgun" just has to be one of the silliest sci-fi weapon concepts. The more interesting parts of the original tech tree, like the mind probe, the motion scanner, the psi technology and the blaster launcher are no longer in the game.\n\nThe UFO activity seems to be much more involved, later in the game the aliens will start defending their missions with aggressive fighter wings that will bring down your dropship or fighters returning from a mission if you are not careful. The aerial terror missions are also a nice touch.\n\nOn the other hand, the interception mini-game is highly repetitive, and very slow-paced - I have been using autoresolve most of the time because it gets very tedious after just a few interceptions, and the game will usually swarm you with UFOs because of how the economy works.\n\nI really didn't like the change where the engineers can no longer build items for profit - that option made a lot of sense in the original game (though was  probably too good to the point of Xenonauts' authors calling the feature an "exploit"). In Xenonauts your engineers are just wasted resources unless you need something built immediately, which you don't always do, so they have to be fired / re-hired as needed to save money.\n\nThe funding provided by the nations is just about enough to run 2 bases and fund two workshops. The only source of income for further expansion are the UFO raids, which are (relatively) less profitable than in the original, and therefore have to be more frequent. There is even an option to earn about 33% of the downed UFO's worth by bombing the crash site in order to avoid losing money when the ground squad is not available. Still, the income is quite low. For instance, the cost of a new base is $1M. Medium-sized UFOs that are prevalent in the mid game are worth about $50-75K if you raid them and $25K if you bomb them, minus the combat losses that can be VERY painful (a basic scout vehicle costs $60K to produce, and they are easy to lose). This means that in order to get a new base you need to raid about 15 UFOs with near perfect performance, and that is not considering the cost of buildings, staff and maintenance.\n\nGround combat is pretty much the same as in the original game, except for the cover system that can sometimes be frustrating because it is not at all obvious how it calculates the lines of fire, and the game won't show you the cover calculations unless you are aiming at something.\n\nThe game's performance is frankly embarrassing at times. The Geoscape scrolling is very laggy, visibility calculations cause obvious frame rate drops on larger maps, and the animations seem not to load until they are played for the first time, so the first time a new animation is shown it is basically dropped frames. This is simply unacceptable for a 2D game that is not particularly more complex than a 20 year old game that ran fine on computers compared to which your today's phone is a freaking alien planetary mainframe.\n\nOverall, the game does not really add that much to the original XCOM experience, however it recreates it quite successfully. I am finding myself returning to play just a couple more missions all the time.","June 10, 2014","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the time I recommended not purchasing the game due to its significant list of missing features, bugs, and poor gameplay. My review of course got condemed, but I'm a true believer in reviewing a game on how it is *now* and not what it *might* become in the future.\n\nOver a year later, here we are at the official release.\n\nNow that the game is officially finished and released I am re-doing my review to reflect on how the game is in the current state.\n\nXenonauts takes the conecpt and gameplay that many of us fell in love with long ago with the DOS game X-Com: UFO Defense and brings that into the modern world. It isn't a direct copy however. The aliens are different, their are different weapons, different technologies, different aircraft. It takes the best of the original game, and combines it with some of the best modifications to that game. As icing on the cake, it also incorporates some of the features the XCOM reboot by Firaxis had.\n\nIt keeps the isometric 2D view from the original game, but with more modern graphics. Large squad sizes are present (your first aircraft can have 8). Base defense is present. You are allowed, and required, to have multiple bases. Combat remains turn-based, and time units are very much present. That convers just about all of the complaints series fans had with the XCOM Enemy Unknown reboot.\n\nNew is a more indepth aircraft interception mini-game (that's optional, you can auto-resolve if you wish). Unlike most games with an auto-resolve feature, this one doesn't screw you over with excessive losses/damage if you use it.\n\nFor anyone who was a fan of the original XCOM: UFO Defense game, or new people who don't want to deal with a DOS Box game I reccomend they check out this game and give it a shot. The initial difficulty spike is quite large, but after a few games you can learn what works for you and really start to dig in.","May 22, 2014","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Xenonauts also doesn't bother explaining much about itself, so prepare for a high learning treshold, especially if you haven't played the classic original.\n\nBut it makes up for it with some lovely (albeit tiny) graphics and atmosphere, and of course, the original tactical battles on random maps with roaming aliens that the Firaxis X-COM remake got completely wrong (although the cover system was a nice improvement that this game could have used). It's interesting to note that both X-COM and Xenonauts feel like they have line of sight issues compared to the original UFO, so prepare for some frustrating moments, in addition to those "normal" frustrating UFO moments! :)","June 16, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will also need to decide whether or not to expand quickly or build up your current base and its forces. There are bonuses but also negative points to this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shitkatapult/recommended/223830/","shitkatapult","Shitkatapult","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shitkatapult/","636 products in account","I've been following this title for ages and while I couldn't resist trying out the alpha demo about two years ago, mainly checking the looks and feels, I never really played the pre-release versions. I prefer having a complete experience, so I patiently waited for the magical 1.0.\n\nAnd now it finally arrived. I am not disappointed.\n\nI completed a playthrough on Normal not using Iron Man Mode in an 18 hour session, interrupted only by a short break to catch some Zs. I was pretty much hooked right from the start. The base building and overall beginning of the game is very XCOM-y. If it wasn't for the 2D geoscape you might as well be thinking you're playing the original. But there are certainly differences.\n\nAerial Combat:\n\nThe mini game for this got made over quite a bit. You can manually move your jets around the battlefield and issue basic orders like 'evasive maneuvers', 'fire missile' and 'retreat'. I found it especially fun to fight bigger UFOs. Get one Jet to distract the enemy and another to get on the bogeys tail, hammering away on his butt. If you don't like this kind of gameplay you can just let the CPU auto-calculate the outcome for you, with the approximate winning chance displayed on the encounter screen.\n\nAnnoyances:\n\n- The Corsair is way too strong, making alien air superiority fighters nothing more than a nuissance.\n- The amount of UFOs appearing during end game can get quite the hassle. Not because they are dangerous, but because it ends in a neverending clickfest.\n\nGround Combat:\n\nAwesome. Finally you can freely equip your soldiers again (unlike in Firaxis' XCOM, which had way too few options after my fancy). You can use a squad with different specialists or just stick to a jack-of-all-trades kind of team. I managed to work with the latter, but it was way more difficult and less fun at the same time. However I only played on normal difficulty, so I don't know how viable this is in harder modes. I'd definitely recommend going for specialized troops.\n\nAliens behave differently. There are smarter ones and dumber ones. Overall the AI is ok, but not breath taking. Yet the suspense IS there. Playing the game in a pitch black room, sweeping the area for hostiles while trying to keep your men and the civilians alive never ceases to be great and thrilling fun.\n\nMovement and aiming hasn't changed much, but the newly included suppression system makes the combat feel way more alive. It counters reaction shots, so you can't just camp in a good position until the sun explodes. However this tactic is very often neglected by the AI. Would like to see them be more aggressive. Yet again, maybe that's the case in harder modes.\n\nAlso, you can now just bomb crash sites if you don't need anything in particular from it. This will yield no XP/loot but money. Really saves you from getting dizzy doing the 100th scout UFO ground mission for just some crap loot. Good thinking there.\n\nAnnoyances:\n\n- Why no quicksave/-load? The hardcore crowd will play in Iron Man Mode anyway, so why not include this simple feature? If I just didn't see the button, shame on me.\n- Sometimes maps repeat, I only ever had it happen twice I think, but it shouldn't happen during the same game at all.\n- Alien Bases are too similair. I always found the base commander in the same corner of the base (I did 5 base assaults). Can this be randomized a little more? (Why did I just write 'base' four times in one sentence?)\n- Why are there ALWAYS civilians? If a UFO crashes in no man's land, there shouldn't be any. Just a minor thing, but the occasional map without friendly NPCs would do for some randomization as well.\n\nTech Talk:\n\nUhh, well it's an indie game with a 2D engine. If you expect some fancy AAA effects and stuff you will be disappointed. But I have to admit the ingame sprites and art work in the game's encyclopedia are very good. The battlegrounds look great and especially the alien assets (and UFOs) look very nice.\n\nSound effects are nothing too special but meaty enough. The music during ground combat is awesome though and really helps create the creepy mood. Well done!\n\nConclusion:\n\nThat pretty much sums it up. The geoscape gameplay is mostly the same as always. Research, build, expand, intercept. I wouldn't know what to drastically alter there and everything is well made, so it's fine for me.\n\nAll in all I am very impressed and would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the old XCOM games or is looking to get into this kind of genre.\n\ntl;dr: 9/10 would play again","June 18, 2014","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can autoresolve the air fights and a calculation will tell you whether you won and how much damage your planes took, but it is much more fun to run the 2D eagle view simulation to navigate the fight yourself.\n\nEach time an enemied UFO crashes, it creates a crashsite that can either be airstriked to deal with the alien survivors, or approached with your soldiers in ground battle to recover alien technology to either sell it your advance your own weaponry, whcih becomes an essential part of the mid to late game. The ground batlle for me is the most interesting part of Xenonauts. It is very strategic and thrilling and you really develop feelings for your experienced soldiers and mourn for their unexpected deaths. But still there are sometimes so many Crashsites to deal with (each one can last up to an hour, if you are a careful player) that it can get a bit tedious in the long run.\n\nAlthough the ground battle is the essential part of the game, the real strategy lies in distributing your very expensive bases, airplanes and soldiers over the globe efficiently without losing your relations to a contintent that provides your funding in return. I personally considered the game very challenging even in Normal difficulty, since everytime you feel you can somehow cope with your enemy, the UFOs and ground units get even stronger and higher in number. Some elements can also be quite frustrating (for example your armour and good cover are worth nothing when a "reaper" approaches over vast distances out of the fog of war and one-hits your soldier making him an armored zombie enemy, too). The AI is not super-intelligent (especially not the civilians always blocking your way), but challenging.\n\nI enjoyed the game very much, but it could be considered a bit repetetive in its basic principle (manage upgrades -> UFO atttack -> shoot down planes -> intercept crash sites -> manage upgrades). The writing and the "science" elements in the well-written codex full of some beautiful artworks as well as the soundtrack set you right into that alien mood. Atmosphere, emotion and suspense 10/10, gameplay 7/10, since it feels quite repetitive in the end.","August 31, 2014","true","59.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Xenonauts replaces the original X-Com for me! The remake by fraxis didn't but I like it for separate reasons (like the Bureau).\n\nThe game can be a little long the first play through since you dont' know what your doing, and the geo strategy game can be brutal. There are also a few bugs, but most of them are harmless. The end game has one that's crops up every once in a while, that requires you to reload.  The graphics a good for a indie project, but not state of the art.\n\nDespite the downsides, this is the modern X-Com! It adds a lot of new twists,  I love the strategic depth of Xenonauts, managing multiple aircraft in dogfights with UFO's. Truth is,  I didn't immediately realize the tactical depth in this when I first started playing, but after a few hours I realized it had more depth (and control) than I initially relaized.\n\nI also loved the addition of tactical shields to your teams arsenal, makes a new tactical element to your teams, and being able to set up defeault equipment for a role, or create a new role, or a hundred other small improvements over X-Com really show how Xenonauts isnt just a clone, but a player that sets a new bar.\n\nI love the armed civillians,  Billy Bob on his farm with a shotgun killing the aliens for probing his cows. The local cop who saved my beacon in a  tough fight. The military that shows up later in the game armed with the laser rifles I supplied them with, now helping my team out (somewhat).\n\nI loved my predator armor that could walk through walls and obstacles. I really enjoyed setting off several chain explosions with my explosives and firefights that clears large portions of the map!\n\nI'm really impressed with this game! It really is the ultimate X-Com homage. Its going to be tough for me to try other indie efforts after this unless they bring something vastly new to the table.\n\nOthers have come close, but Xenonauts gets enough of it right to take the mantle. I hope some aspiring moder converts it to the original X-Com with the included modding tools. I would so play that mod!\n\nThere is also a lot more under the hood that could be used. Some modder created a nice wav collection that realty amped up the tactical combat with lots of military chatter, lots of mods already and can't wait to see where this is in a year.","June 22, 2014","true","218.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In my opinion, this game did everything that i wanted the new X-com to do and with some fancy new features stacked ontop. The ground combat is intense and satisfying, there's plenty of gear and technology for you to research and progress through and the game is hard as nails. Everything you could want if your looking for that nostalgic playthrough of the old X-Com games with a bit of a newer coat of paint. The only flaws that stand out to me is the user interface is a bit janky in places, alt-tabbing makes the game act wierd for a few seconds, and the graphical quality of the ground combat isn't the best, and in the later game you really aren't given enough funding, i feel like they should scale it in some way, in my playthrough i was on two bases, and i was doing fairly well for myself, making 2.9 million every month, but the maintinence costs of the bases shrunk that down to a mere 800 thousand a month.

It is a real success; the general way you play the game is very faithful to the original game, but it is significantly deeper and more interesting.\n- The same can be said for the strategic game. The general feeling is the same as in the original game, but it is much, much more complex and the game has little forgiveness for people who make wrong choices.\n- The interception minigame is really nice. There are a few problems that should be solved (some dogfights which have good success chances on autoresolve are actually unwinnable if you try to play them) but it adds something that had not been attempted or done right by any of the previous XCOM-inspired games.\n- The general cold war atmosphere is nice and the flavour text (research reports, news ticker, etc.) fleshes out the universe nicely. All the text-based universe description is a real success.\n- The music is good, and the sound effects are good too.\n\nNow a few criticisms:\n- The graphics. Seriously. The geoscape and base layout screens are OK. The background art (research/engineering screens, etc.) is decent, even though it lacks something. Everything else is horrible. The aliens, the equipment, most of the armours and almost everything in the tactical game is ugly, bland and unremarkable. I would go as far as saying that I prefer the visuals from the 1994 game in their VGA splendor. They are pixelated and often cheesy in a 90s SF way, but they have a character that is completely absent here. Even the recent X-COM: Enemy Unknown, which is much more bland and soulless than Xenonauts in many ways, easily wins this match.\n- The UFO missions eventually become repetitive. True, you can airstrike crash sites, but it is often not an economically viable option, and the combination of low resources, quite slow research and high enemy activity leads to phases of the game where you have nothing else to do than wait for your research/engineering projects to eventually complete while playing non-stop difficult missions which look a lot like one another, have each the potential to wipe your team, and do not bring you any reward except some cash and the chance to live another day. This is somehow realistic, but not so funny.\n- This is not a true Linux game: the developers juste made special efforts to make the game run correctly with Wine. This is not nothing, and I don't blame the developers, but Wine compliance is not the same at all as a native GNU/Linux version, and I find it misleading and disappoingint to see it listed as a "Linux game" on Steam. (And even more so since you can't even install the Linux Wine port through Steam) This is one of the reasons why I so readily bought this game, and although it is a fine game, on that point I feel cheated.","August 25, 2014","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The earth gets attacked by aliens, and all of the worlds super powers are left bent over a table with their pants down. You, and your organization, the Xenonauts, are effectively the last defense we have left.\n\nYou start out by placing a base on the globe, and then monitor alien activity around you via radar dishes. While things are dark, you can research alien artifacts and technology,  build new military toys, and invest in both your base and its employees. Once a Ufo is spotted, you can choose to launch a fighter or interceptor to its location to try and shoot it down. If you succeed, you'll most likely be given the option to send a mop up crew to kill off any survivors and acquire whatever the ship had aboard it. Alternatively, you can also send in an airstrike in to obliterate the crash site, netting you a small amount of cast from the pieces left.\n\nOnce a crew of soldiers arrives at a crashsite or other battlefield, the game plays out in a turn based fashion. You move your soldiers around a battlefield, using various cover, weapons, and equipment to out position and destroy your foe. Whether that be by blowing a hole in the side of a building and running inside to flank an enemy, tossing a flash bang or smoke grenade to disorient and charge the enemy head on, or laying down supressive fire while a sniper gets into position and guns down an enemy. The choice is up to you.\n\nWhile Xenonauts does however, have its own share of faults, (Playing the same levels over and over in combat missions, predictable enemies inside downed ufos, graphics ocassionally bugging out, etc.) they are few and far between, and the game can be modded to the point where most of these things are not an issue.\n\nIf you liked the original Xcom, I can almost assure you that you will love this game, and if you've never played one before, you should give it a shot.","June 21, 2014","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fire superiority enjoyed by your foes makes no difference to the mission generator, often outnumbering your soldiers as well. You deliberately harden your heart to avoid becoming too attached to that one officer who can move a quarter way across the map and still have time units and accuracy to put a shot through an alien's eye because you know it's just a matter of time until...BANG!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/china_shop/recommended/223830/","china_shop","China Shop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/china_shop/","76 products in account","I've played thousands of hours of old X-COM (UFO Defense, Terror From The Deep, Apocalypse), and over 500 hours of Enemy Unknown/Within.  I'm enjoying Xenonauts tremendously.  Details follow, but if you're a fan of the old-school X-COM games, I'm already telling you that you should check this game out.\n\nXenonauts describes itself as a "spiritual successor" to X-COM.  It's important to note that they were very probably not talking about Enemy Unknown/Within; the differences in polish will disappoint you if you're expecting that level of visual quality.  However, as a successor to -old- X-COM (UFO Defense, Terror From The Deep, Apocalypse) it succeeds pretty brilliantly.\n\nThe look and feel of the Geoscape is very UFOD/TFTD (only much prettier), while the tactical aesthetics are much more like Apocalypse turn-based mode.  Bases have radar ranges determined by the number and quality of detection facilities present, but the range limits are far more visible than in previous games.  This makes it far easier to understand the coverage consequences of base placement.\n\nShip Combat:\nX-COM ship fights (even in EU/EW) are like sumo wrestling.  The ships' locations on the field are completely abstracted away, and there are hit percentages simulating mobility, so you see two craft holding relatively still and slugging at each other.  Misses look more like bad aiming than evasive action.\nIn Xenonauts, the ship combat display is a 2D grid wherein momentum and turning radius count.  Weapons have ranges and firing arcs, ammo and fuel count, afterburners are a thing (but see: fuel counts) and missiles have their own maneuverability values.  Defensive maneuvers exist for evasive actions, and a dogfight isn't always 1:1 -- in fact, encounters can get up to 3 vs. 3 in some cases; as UFO's begin to appear with escorts, and fighter squadrons roam in packs daring your interceptors to come out and play, you respond by sending attack groups instead of lone planes.  There are light and heavy interceptor classes, with maneuverability, range and armament consequences.\nYou can't form an attack group out of craft from more than one base, unfortunately.  I'd have loved to see a rendezvous point system wherein disparate fleets could join up, but ship combat is a fun, complex mini-game in and of itself and a strategy guide could be (and probably has been) written just for that facet of gameplay.\nNOTE:  There are -way- more UFO's in the early part of the game than in any iteration of X-COM.  This becomes important during...\n\nShip Combat Aftermath:\nYou can send troops to fight at a crash site, but that's not always an option.  You probably don't have enough strike teams to cover every site where you've shot something down, especially early on when a single Condor is still a match for anything the aliens field.  Rather than letting the sites rot and taking a PR penalty with the nation where they crashed, Xenonauts provides the option to call an airstrike and saturate that area, then send a non-combatant cleanup team to salvage what it can.  This results in a static amount of cash based on the class of crashed craft, and a few recoverable items, but no soldier experience or personnel equipment captures.\n\nSoldier Management:\nEnemy Unknown/Within introduced the concept of soldier classes; a Rookie, upon promotion to Squaddie, was assigned one of four classes.  That class distinction determined what stats increased when the soldier was promoted, what weapons the soldier was allowed to carry, and what special abilities became available to that soldier as rank increased.  It's a novel concept, but there are downsides.  Class assignment is for life, for one thing, and there's little room for creative misuse of inventory -- you can't load down an Assault trooper with grenades, for instance.  Nonlethal weapons were considered Items rather than weapons in EU/EW, as well, which meant that you had to choose between that and grenades, or extra armor, or whatever else.  It added importance to the range of choices, but only by limiting them.\nXenonauts doesn't have classes, but it does allow you to assign a soldier a role.  The main differences are that any role can technically carry any equipment; there are customizable default equipment templates for each role; you can change a soldier's role in the barracks anytime the soldier is on base; and you can create new roles.  Weapon disparity is a little wider, and there is in fact a "laser shotgun" and other mechanics-only nonsense, but in general the strategic and tactical choices you can make in Xenonauts is far wider and more granular than in its ancestors.\n\nTactical Combat:\nOh, man.  Where to start.  Quick list of things that don't require explanation:\n- Stun rockets are a thing.  You get them as soon as you get stun grenades.\n- You don't have to wait half the game to get stun grenades.\n- Nonlethal melee weapons exist, and they're weapons -- not some other item class.\n- All soldiers carry an infinite number of flares!  (But vehicles don't.)\n- Vision arcs are back.  An unarmored human has a 90-degree effective vision arc.  (Heavy armor can reduce this.)\n- Cover is not a light switch like in EU/EW, but rather a stack of calculated obstruction percentages like in older X-COM titles.\n\nStuff that might require some more description:\n\n- Range matters a lot.  Different weapons are optimized either for long-range armor-piercing fire, or massive trauma at point-blank range.  You have to make sure you send the right soldier for the right tactical situation, all the time; the aliens are as merciless as they ever were in TFTD, and a soldier caught at a disadvantage is very probably toast.\n\n- Area denial is a real thing.  Enough shell-shock (automatic weapons fire, explosives, etc.) in the immediate vicinity of a soldier (human or enemy) can cause them to become Suppressed, which takes away their TU's (no reaction fire from that soldier), and reduces the TU's they get next turn by 50% (no burst fire, probably no grenades, just movement adjustments OR one decent shot).  Heavy weapons and vehicle weapons are wonderful for this, but remember ammo is being counted.\n\n- Reaction fire is not solely a function of the reacting soldiers' statistics -- reaction initiative is calculated using (get this) modifiers determined by the weapons and equipment worn by both the active and reactive soldiers, Reaction stats, and *TU's the reacting player has left*.  That doesn't just mean that low TU's result in snap shots; it means that high TU's can result in normal or snap shots, and low TU's can lead to the reactive soldier being unable to respond fast enough even though he technically has enough TU's to take a shot.  In addition, assault weapons actually inflict a reaction penalty on anyone calculating reaction fire against them; carrying a shotgun actually makes it much more likely that you'll get the first shot in a point-blank, room-to-room encounter.\n\nSummary:\nThe mechanics of Xenonauts are closer to what I've always wanted X-COM to be.  I'm not in love with the tactical display's graphical quality, but if there's a sequel, I'll look for that to improve.  Meanwhile, the game is a beautiful example of this game type, and the creation and maintenance of it is behavior we enthusiasts should reward by burying the developers in enough money that they decide it would be crazy not to make another one.","August 5, 2014","true","41.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is what I wish Enemy Unknown had been and I was never even one to be nostalgic of the originals mostly because I hadn't played them but to compare them side by side this, to me at lest, is simply a better strategy game. Each and every difficulty setting is a challenge even easy mode but then again I'm a dumb dumb, I couldn't really recommend it more I haven't found an aspect of it that pisses me off at all. The first time I took a look at the manually controlled air combat I said out loud "Why did I click on this button? It was a guaranteed victory." But I did not then understand that it was fantastic air combat not to mention that you'll be better off engaging a target manually if your percentage for victory is less then seventy because you can do what a computer cannot, fight for the survival of humanity with some gumption.\nAnyways it's got big women, big money and big fun.

It takes the gritty, granular tactics of UFO Defense, and adds a fresh coat of paint and some new controls. The art and setting are distinctly darker and more realistic than XCOM's cartoony superheroes, and the gameplay is waaay more stressful (enjoy getting shot at from offscreen!)\n\nHighly recommended if you found 2012 XCOM wanting in some ways.","July 16, 2014","true","77.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The curve at the lower levels is pretty good. You develop your newer guns, finally build and issue some, have fun for a mission or three and then suddenly 'WHAM'! New alien to bring your ego back crashing down.\n\nThe air war ramps up quickly to the extent that while you start to feel you can handle everything being thrown at you on the ground, even at EASY you get the impression you just do not have enough intercepters and you never feel completely confident about handling all of the latest swarm.\n\nHaving played more I have realised there are a lot more maps then I first assumed. Still not so many that you don't start recognising previous locations from time to time, but definately enough that even after 30 hours you are fighting on areas you haven't experienced before.\n\nLot of fun, has that 'just play for a bit longer until...' attraction that easily chews up the playing hours but again, if you are not an existing XCOM fan then this game may seem a little old school to you.\n\n(end edit)\n\n\n(based on v1.07 and 11 hours play on Normal)\n\nTentative THUMBS UP.\n\nThing to remember is this game is Xenonauts, and NOT X-COM classic with better graphics. If it was sold as X-COM Classic -HD version or something similar.\nWhat that means is that, surprise! there are differences. Bases are now only one level, the world map is 2D rather then the funky globe. Some of the starting weapons and equipment from Classic either require research or are simply not within the game.\nWhy?\nBecause it is a different game and let's be honest, if you think classic X-COM was better, then maybe you should go play that instead (hint, I still do - or would if it wasn't so punishingly hard!! :D )\n\nThe game is a bit of a mixed bag. Some of the interfaces are very simple, some (research screen I am looking at you) are downright ugly. Combat seems easier (in that it is possible to complete the early ground missions without having half your squad KIA) and the way reports of 'strange' activities pop up on the global map is interesting. You wont spot UFOs outside your radar coverage, but by looking at the reports of corp circles and abductions you can sometimes have a good idea where to send out a patrol.\n\nGround maps are no longer randomly generated as they were in classic. On the plus side they now look a lot better, on the down side there is no longer the tenseness of simply exploring the map to work out where the drokk you actually are. Hopefully the game will add new maps with upgrades as once you have explored a map for the first time, remembering the danger spots with weird lines of sight is reasonably easy.\n\nSlightly disappointing is that crashed UFOs are no longer massively damaged when you arrive. Player's of classic will remember turning up on a crash site to find half a wall section and some un-lootable piles of smoking scrap and can breach the craft from the gapping holes your air to air missiles made in the hull. This means that every combat seems to back down to going in through the front door. Oh well.\n\nSome of the micromanangement has been removed. Everything you can't use yourself is automatically sold, so you no longer have store rooms full of stuff you are loath to get rid of.\n\nAlso slightly disappointing is the study of the corpses you bring back, which are now done automatically. Gone is the choice between removing your limited science teams from the new lazer rifles you want to develop in order to study the latest hunting trophy.\n\nSo, I think this is a good game. Maybe not 'great' and maybe not the sort of thing you would be interested in as an XCOM newbie trying to work out what the fuss is about.","July 14, 2014","true","71.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's tense and challenging. You'll see soldiers distinguish themselves in combat in terrible situations, and you'll see your vets get killed when things go sideways. You'll have to juggle the competing priorities of the air war and the ground war (hint: focus on the air war) since you can only build so much expensive stuff at once. The only glitches/bugs that really bothered me got patched (timing of bleed damage, Harridan snipers glitching into walls, berserking) and there really wasn't anything else that I feel has gone unresolved.

The money mod makes sense so I didn't feel any gamer guilt using it. If the world was under alien invasion I am pretty sure every goverment would scrap the idea of money and just use whatever resources Earth had to defend it....not charge those responsible defending for a garage and such. The weapons mods do give you a good advantage in a ways but still those aliens will one shot you, through a wall or just walk right up to your units and MURDER all of them. You will miss just about every shot and each alien takes about three to four rounds but with the weapons mods it gives you a chance. The air combat is great and hope XCOM 2 has something along the lines. Overall it is a great game, has that looming atmosphere of the unknown, great music, the art is good (especially in the alien autopsies and weapon/gear descriptions) besides the character models. They could have done a bit more because your soldiers look extremely plain and paper cut outs. The micromanagement of your bases and world events is pretty awesome too.

Xenonauts is more intuitive and pretty than its predecesor as well as creating the same feeling that you are juggling 9001 balls at once, and are constantly a few poor choices away from total collapse. All in all, the game is a great experience.\n\nAlthough I have not completed the game, just scratched the surface really (I've played three months in-game), I can say for certain that all of the difficulty of the original game is present. Every desicion is vital and it is imperative to really consider the best course of action at all times. If you don't, well, let's say there have been more than a few missions which resulted in complete annihilation of my squad, a terrible loss.\n\nThe game is also much more faithful to the original than XCOM - ENEMY UNKNOWN, bringing back TU's, much larger squads, and a more complicated geoscape portion of the game. In many respects, though, it improves on the original. The OP Blaster bomb has been removed, the graphics look polished and attractive, and useful/relevant data is more easily accessed.\n\nHowever, I do not mean to say that the game is without faults. For new players to the series, there is hardly and tutorial to introduce them to the many facets of being an international super-secret alien defense force commander. This means the learning curve can be quite steep. Furthermore, the game has some frustrating line of sight issues. Sometimes, I will attempt to move my soldier to firing position, only to discover that the bush I was trying to shoot through might as well be a solid wall. Although over time I have been able to more successfully ascertain what I can and can't do, it has provided a great deal of frustration.\n\nAll in all, the game is excellent, and in my oppinion more pleasurable to play than the original. (Although the punishing nature of the original adds a bit to the feel. Ironically by making it better it's worse?) Anyway, if you are a fan of strategy games or the original series then I would highly recommend you purchase this game immediately and begin fighting off the extraterrestrial invasion!","June 5, 2014","true","46.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Balenced out base building system. You can't spam several bases/buildings at one time and expect to win. They cost a lot of funding/time to make.

For example, the line-of-sight mechanic is in this version. The aliens can sneak up on you and vice versa. If an alien is obviously hidden from the view of a soldier, then that soldier can't hit it. Why would Firaxis take this out in their version? It's CRITICAL to the feel of the entire game!\n\nPlus everything unnecessary about the original X-Com has been streamlined, e.g. selling useless items at the end of a mission & buying ammmunition is done automatically. Just lots of little things that weren't really decisions you needed to make, more like chores that had to be done every few minutes.\n\nOn the negative side, the maps get a bit repetitive when you've played for a while, as the original had randomly generated maps to keep things fresh (although Map Packs can be downloaded from the Steam Workshop). I also preferred the droney music of the original as well, it always put me on edge! Otherwise, everything else is definitely better.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is the definitive X-Com experience for fans of the original.","June 6, 2015","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only thing great about this game is the workshop, because the vanilla game is actually pretty bad.\n\nYou see, what made you invested in the tactical part of the game was the alien loot you could grab when you finished the mission. From there you could continue your research, or if you were low on funds, sell it to foreign powers. That was the best part of the game, manufacturing weapons, and then selling them to the governments of the world. It allowed you to continue funding science projects, and recruit staff had the odds swung against you. Sometimes you couldn't get enough missions or things didn't turn out right, and a few nations stop funding your project.\n\nThat was removed, and from what it seems, the political aspect as well. You aren't trying to convince the governments of the world that your project can work. You seem to just get a set amount of income each year, I don't know who funds us, or why, we just get money.\n\nWell, I can take a good challenge, tough aliens, and the great level design the game throws at me. But the most disgusting part of the game is aiming. This game takes XCOM's difficulty over the top. While yes, enemies did cheat a bit, but there were few times when they could shoot through walls. But the game's difficulty doesn't come from enemy health, uniqueness, or powers or even intelligence. No. The game's difficulty comes from your soldier's ability to aim, alone. I find it hard to be invested at all in this game, with the ability to sell loot, manufacture items, or attempting to convince the UN that the xcom project works. I find it even harder to invest myself when soldiers shoot like idiots.\n\nYou can have 1 alien surrounded by four soldiers, and have ALL of them miss. You can have the odds in your favor, the perfect LOS, and miss. What? You don't think it's that bad? "It might not be that bad, I'll give it a go" Let me give an example of how BAD a soldier's aim is:\n\nThere was an alien in a ship, the door destroyed by my rocket launcher. I took my heavy weapons soldier, told her to fire at the alien inside of the ship. You know what she does? SHE TURNS AROUND AND SHOOTS THE SOLDIER NEXT TO HER. SHE UNLOADS ON THIS POOR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LIKE SHE WAS INJECTED WITH ADAMANTIUM RAGE. KILLING HIM INSTANTLY.\n\nThis game has so much potential, but it's like the developers thought the only way to make aliens any kind of threat was to nerf your soldier's aim. Down to the point where they couldn't even shoot an alien that's in a square next to them. Stuff like this NEVER happened in xcom, in xcom YOU'D HIT! But you were never sure if you were going to KILL!\n\nAlso, the morale in this game feels so screwed up! Your soldiers would take one hit, and then immediately go beserk? The last time I played xcom, your soldiers would only go beserk if someone DIED. In fact, beserking soldiers were actually pretty rare if you kept everyone alive. And even if I'm wrong on this, they should fix it, soldiers should not beserk or panic after getting hit once.\n\nThis game is frustrating but I feel like the workshop fixes some of it's problems.","August 12, 2015","true","47.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
