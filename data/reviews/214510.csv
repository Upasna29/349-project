The devs has done well to find a way to nearly-constantly trigger my brain's pleasure center (with rewards, sounds, and visuals) that I don't tire of playing it.\n\nI can safely recommend this title to gamers of all ages and skill-levels. :)\n\nBuy with impunity!","October 12, 2014","true","14.4"," 145 of 161 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","145","161","8","4"

I think this game is definitely a fun game even if there are annoyances to be found.\n\nThe game uses audio from the movies, which is good and bad for me. The audio is well done and as always it is nice to hear those familiar voices, but it does kill the humor and creativity of a lot of the cutscenes. I wish they had went back to no audio for the voices.\n\nThe character wheel in game is useful but can definitely be cumbersome as it becomes an extra step in getting to the full roster, which when you have a lot of characters of when free roaming is very important.\n\nThe questing is crap to me. Making me go back again to other levels and get items is not fun, it is boring. This is a feature I think was fixed well in more recent Lego outings.\n\nThe mythril equipment was very good and I think brought creativity to the game, especially with the musical shoes and the Disco Phial.\n\nCombat was so so, I actully thought fighting would be improved for a game like this but it was the same.\n\nLevel design was done well and I think encapsulated those scenes very well. If not for the many game breaking glitches and the ability to somehow get 1 or 2 extra minikits or items over the limit effectively keeping you from reaching 100%.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game with a 7.5 / 10. The newer games have improved this formula but this one is left in that time between old and new.","November 26, 2013","true","52.9"," 137 of 152 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","137","152","0","1"

Really fun and exiting, you can spend dozins of hours playing this and new things still happen. Simply very awesome game with the real voices from the real actors. You can experience all the awesome battles not just watch a cutscene of them. For an example the battle with the Balrog of Morgof :D You acually play the part where you fall down with the Balrog. And besides the real levels you can do quests, find secret places, do a bonus level, craft funny hats, weapons and more, you can gain money to buy all the awesome characters, red bricks, and so on. Don't compare this Lego game with another Lego game, because this is totally diffrent, in a very good way. Would absolutely recommend this for anyone.

Over the years developer Traveller’s Tales has refined a very particular mold with which they create each Lego game, perhaps changing a few things here and there to fit a particular license, but largely sticking to now ubiquitous design principles that have shown themselves to be resilient and endlessly applying to practically any franchise.\n\nAnd honestly I’m pretty alright with that. To me, Lego games are a bit of a gaming standby, something you reach for when you want a familiar, easily enjoyed experience kept fresh by whatever new skin has been fitted on it. It’s one of a few series I’m largely content remaining as it is, and from what I can tell that’s a sentiment shared by most people who play Lego games.\n\nIn a lot of ways then Lego Lord of the Rings is what I expected and wanted it to be. It transforms a franchise I’ve a great fondness for into adorable bricks, giving me a world to run around and destroy (to then build up again), while getting to revive three movies I know by heart in a new way. The addition of voice acting surprised me in how quickly I grew used to it and valued its inclusion, something I was concerned about prior to playing but found helped in retelling a rather complicated story that grunts and chuckles would have had difficulty in doing. In its levels Lego Lord of the Rings is mostly indistinguishable from any other Lego game, and as such occupies a space that you likely already know if you want to take part in.\n\nThe bad news is the outside of these levels, Traveller’s Tales has made some less than desirable changes to the formula. At first it was a welcome refreshment to the series, adopting a more traditional RPG design with a sizable open world, quests given out by NPCs, minimal crafting, and an equipment system that does away with removes the need for specific character skills. The more I played around in this system though the more I became bored and frustrated at its simplicity and tediousness.\n\nWhile there’s a definite largeness to Lego Lord of the Rings’ world, much of it is empty and bland. The sparseness of locations and characters within this environment creates a feeling that there’s less here than there actually is. There is a huge amount of stuff to do and collect in Lego Lord of the Rings but getting to it took me through such a dull vacuum of space that eventually I couldn’t bring myself to be bothered. Lego games have traditionally been exceptionally adept at making me want to seek out absolutely everything that’s been packed inside them, but here it was only ever more dots on my map and the area stretching between them.\n\nWith the lack of vehicles (even horses are difficult to come across) or flying characters, the size of Lego Lord of the Rings’ world became a huge detriment to me wanting to continue playing it. The vague questing system made things worse by making it difficult to even know what direction I should be heading in. When I began to spend hours running around finding nothing and coming away having barely moved the progress bar, my enthusiasm with continuing the collectathon dissipated and the overwhelming number of things still left to find weighed down on me enough to ensure I had no desire to go back.\n\nI don’t wish to imply that Lego Lord of the Rings is a bad game, and if you’re the sort of player who only cares about the critical path then it’s as recommendable as any Lego game. The problem is the portion I’ve always considered the core of a Lego game - the scouring of levels for every last doodad and thingamabob to arrive at that satisfying 100% - was insufferably tedious and drawn out. With the ridiculous number of other superior Lego games to choose from, Lego Lord of the Rings feels like a tough sell, even as a huge fan of the source material. I admire Travellor’s Tales willingness to try new ideas with the game, but in this case it amounts to more of an example of how strong the Lego formula already is and that tampering with it isn’t nearly as foolproof.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 8, 2015","true","14.3"," 75 of 78 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","75","78","4","4"

In general yes, however there are some flaws. The strongest thing imo in the game is the sandbox mini-middle earth, player can roam through all locations known, from movies, and books. There is plenty characters to unlock even Tom Bombadil who was cut out from the story in the movie! Nice and new feature is the forge which allows player to forge special items. Those items can grant abilities of some characters to every character in the game, even those created by player. Game has quite modern graphics, but not as good as hobbit, yet still very eye candy. The music is taken from the move, and it never gets old, so I'd say it was good decision to use original music from movie trilogy.\n\nDespite game is really enjoyable it has few cons. There is a bit less humor in the game than in previous lego games. I think that the original voice lines from movie don't fit lego characters to well, it breaks the humor, and makes the game little less understandable for children. Lego games are targeted for children and families so I'd say its a con. The game has a huge amount of collectibles to unlock, therefore its is very glitchy and in most cases player usually stucks in the game progression in about 98%, because the couple last collectibles were not counted, or some level got bugged and is showing 0/3 collected items despite all of them were found, and player has them in inventory. Another annoying glitch is that sometimes player model is falling under the ground just after it was spawned, and keeps falling for eternity. I rode that console version was patched, however no one fixed PC version :(. There is few codes that player can use to unlock everything so if somebody got stuck in 98-99% of the game due to glitch he can use them but again it doesn't help with ever glitch. As far as the main story goes everything is usually fine, but when player wants to get maximum from the game it turns out to have few game breaking bugs.\n\nTaking into consideration all aforementioned arguments I would recommend the game for every lotr and lego fan, however some players that love to unlock everything in lego games might get vastly disappointed once their game is stuck at 98 %, after countless hours of playing in order to unlock everything, and the "cheat fix" is not satisfying solution. Still the game is worth to play and it brings much fun, just don't try to finish the game in 100%, and you wont face any disappointment.","February 18, 2015","true","66.2"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","54","58","4","3"

I have played this off and on over the last couple years, lol....but that is no indictment on the game. Actually, my interest in both the topic and the LEGO aspect kept bringing me back, even though my gamer ADD often took hold. The humor added to a mostly dark adventure was perfect, and as somebody who knows the LOTR inside and out, I really appreciated all the subtle jokes and such. Often, they really said what a lot of fans were thinking. The gameplay itself is fairly standard LEGO game fare. Engaging and simple enough that anybody can pick up this game and play it through to its conclusion. I also like how they broke the game up into three books with credits at the end of each. That was appropriate IMO.\nThe extras such as free roam and so on all are also what you would expect and could literally add countless hours to your game.\n\nMy only complaint is that a played a couple chapters offline, and the game never synced those trophies afterwards, so it is kind of odd seeing my completion without some of the end of chapter achievements (like the Weathertop one for example).\n\nAll in all, I would consider this a must own for LOTR and/or LEGO game fans. Very well done.

On the one hand, its a charming and often funny adventure where you re-enact LOTR... with legos! I'd never played one of these lego games before, so I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a fun game with plenty of content taking a serious storyline and making it goofy as well.\n\n...And yet this game frustrated me. Alot. For one, it's a terrible console port. There's no mouse support, so you have to do everything with the keyboard. I did manage to get through this, but it makes playing a little awkward. Worse for me is the platforming parts, where you have to jump around to reach hidden areas or to progress further in the levels. Trouble is the camera can be annoying with this, and it is far too easy to fall off ledges or into water, and then have to try again and again. I got seriously frustrated at a few parts, though ultimately I made it through. I'd call the platforming the worst part of this game.\n\nSo it's a fun game with some frustrating elements. This is one of those cases where a "maybe" recommendation would be ideal, but ultimately I'll lean towards "yes" on this one because the good bits outweigh the frustrating bits.

So, suffice it to say that we have a lot of Lego games.  LLotR is not a bad addition to the franchise.  It's fun, they've added a lot of new functionality to the gameplay and it's a Lego game.  We both like the game quite a bit.  The one thing we do both agree on, however, is that the actual movie voice acting is weird at best.  We enjoyed all of the previous Lego games because the characters only grunted and made noises while explaining the plot.  This added quite a bit of humor and fun to the games as you would have to think about what they were basically acting out for you.  Now with the actual voice acting, the games sort of lose that playful sort of feeling.  Regardless, the game is fun, but I would still take many of the last Lego games over this one.","December 23, 2013","true","4.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/214510/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Lego Lord of the Rings is pretty cool I guess.\n\nAfter the success of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novel: The Hobbit, he began to work on an epic saga about an all powerful ring that would bring the destruction of a place called Middle Earth. He wrote this series between 1937 and 1949 but not having it published until 1954 and 1955. What Tolkien gave us became one of the most renowned and beloved series of books in Fantasy history, pioneering many tropes, themes, and subjects that would cement themselves in literature, video games, movies, and many other art forms. So what better way to celebrate Tolkien's legacy than by remaking the movie versions of his coveted series but in miniature brick form?\n\nPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-\n\nLego Lord of the Rings takes place during the Third Age of Middle Earth, two and a half millennial after Sauron, the Second Dark Lord and most trusted lieutenant of Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, is defeated in the land of Mordor, at the slopes of Mount Doom, by an alliance of Men and Elves during the war of the last alliance after he loses possession of the one ring, a powerful artifact forged in the fires of Mt. Doom to concentrate his own power as well as exercise his own dominion over the other rings of power, magical rings that were forged by Calebrimbor, Prince of Noldorin and the last of House Feanor.\n\nWow, look at all those made up words.\n\nThis one ring is picked up by Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit and dirty little sneak thief who steals the precious from Gollum, who was also a hobbit at one point but now looks like my sister, a moldy grilled cheese sandwich. But Sauron, being the big ♥♥♥♥ OG that he is, is regaining his power and mustering his forces to regain the one ring.\n\nFrodo Baggins, another filthy little hobbit, is forced to take this mighty ring to the fires of Mt. Doom, the only place that can destroy it outside of the oven at Papa Johns, ooo that's spicy! So Frodo, Sam, Marry, and the other Marry, team up with Aragorn: Son of Arathorn, Legolas: Prince of Mirkwood, Gimli: Son of Gloin, Gandalf the Grey, and Sean Bean on one of the most epic fetch quests to ever exist.\n\nOh right, this is a lego game, ♥♥♥♥, hold on.\n\nI forgot to mention that pretty much everything in this game is made out of Lego, save for a few exceptions. Have you ever played a Lego game before? It's like that. So everyone is made of Lego, they move like Lego would, and they fall apart when they die like Lego. So what you have is a Lego platforming game about the first three LOTR movies instead of the books. Which is cool because all of the dialogue that is actually spoken outside of a few random NPC's is straight up from the movies.\n\nThere are two parts of the game, the parts where you play through a level that was inspired by the movies, and the part where you move from place to place over a pretty good looking over world of Middle Earth. I have to say the game is pretty impressive for what it is. There are parts with a ludicrous amounts of little Lego orcs in them and it's almost baffling how I didn't have slowdown with so many jokers on screen at once.\n\nYou can't die in LLOTR, I mean, you can, but there's no game over screen. It's obvious that these games are meant for kids, but this game is neat even for a kids game, like the one Chuck-E-Cheese that still has a Marvel Vs Capcom Machine. It's there, but you have to bring your little brother so you don't look like a total weirdo.  I don't have a little brother so I'll bring your little brother instead. I'm getting that machine one way or another.\n\nBut should you play Lego Lord of the Rings: The Return of the land lord?\n\nGet it for cheap, it's fun and a well made game, but there really isn't enough meat on the bones to warrant a full price, I'm also pretty sure I hear Tolkien going mach speed with the rolling in his grave right about now.\n\nLord of the Smorg gets 3 men who's last names are just their father's first names out of 5.\n\nThe one Curator to rule them all: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","December 17, 2015","true","7.5"," 36 of 56 people (64%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","64","36","56","21","2"

Anyway, here's my review.\n\nPLOT\n\nThe story follows the plot of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King, using cutscenes with sound clips from the films and levels with some brilliant gameplay. There are 18 action-packed levels to play, each about 25-45 minutes depending  on how much time you like to spend fighting, collecting etc.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nYou can play as loads of different characters from Frodo to Tom Bombadil to an Orc. In the levels, it's obvious that there are some new features, such as Ring Mode, where you can enter the wraith world and discover new objects that only ring-bearers can make, along with horse rides including the frankly epic Ride of the Rohirrim in Return of the King. There are cooking puzzles that require collecting of items that are then put in a pan, and the ability to use the Palantir in both Film 2 and 3 in order to travel between Frodo and Sam's and Aragorn Gimli and Legolas's stories. There is also the Eye of Sauron to look out for when you finish Fellowship, because its sight will cover areas, blocking access until you play a certain level, after which the eye will shift to a different area. This is so you don't just play all of Frodo and Sam's journey and none of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas's journey.\n\nOPEN-WORLD\n\nOne of the best bits is the Open World, a complete map of all the areas explored in the story. You can visit the stone trolls in the Trollshaws, sail down the Great River and then past the Argonath, walk into Mordor, complete quests, forge items and collect gold and red bricks. Areas you can explore include: Hobbiton, Bree, Weathertop, Trollshaws, Rivendell, The Misty Mountains, outside of Moria, Lothlorien, The Great River, Amon Hem, Fangorn Forest, Rohan, Isengard, Helm's Deep, Edoras, Dunharrow, Minas Tirith, Emyn Muil, The Dead Marshes, Ogsgilliath, Minas Morgul, The Stairs, Shelob's Lair, Cirith Ugnol, The Black Gate and Mordor! You'll be able to switch the world from day to night and back again when you've completed the story, and inbetween levels you'll be journeying through the land. I must say that I prefer some aspects of the Hobbit world more than this one (see my LEGO Hobbit review for more detail) because of Eagle travel and the different locations, but that's just my opinion.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nGraphics are pretty good even with the medium settings I had to use on my seemingly ancient computer.\n\nOTHER\n\nThe game doesn't feel rushed, but some levels, such as the Caradhras level, do feel a little stretched out. I particularly like the main menu screen that has four different versions, one with a map of Middle-Earth for the very first one, another with Hobbiton for Fellowship, one with the alignment of Isengard and Bardadur for Two Towers and Baradur with Mordor for Return.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is a great game that feels like an epic bargain if you get it on sale. The LEGO games do go on sale often, so try and grab this one quickly if you see it on sale! Still worth the money at the usual price, too though. All in all 9/10.","February 22","true","13.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

In my experience, LEGO games are not so much about ground breaking, innovative gameplay; but rather, immensely enjoyable fun for the whole family that comes in all kinds of assorted flavors. Personally, I find the Star Wars flavor to be the best out of all of them, but for the same reason that a die-hard Harry Potter fan would tell you that the Harry Potter LEGO Games are the best.\n\nOverall, if you haven't ever played a LEGO game, then don't just buy the "latest and greatest".

This is my first one where the LEGO figures speak. Quite a change. It is nice and a little sad: The game cites many sentences of the motion picture and yet you do not have the original voices all of the time - it's kind of confusing. Nevertheless it uses very often the original voice acting from the movie. The combination works well. So play it in English for the original voices. The German edition has only new voices, no archive material from the dubbed films. That works also, but you do not get the complete LEGO movie feeling. The strong points are the new dialogues that wrap the story up and introduce minor changes from the original.\nThe game is fun to play - especially in local coop, but it is not very different from any other LEGO game. Just another franchise with new minifigures and new funny videos. If you just don't have enough you might buy this one. The textures of not LEGO specific things look quite aweful. They should get better game by game and not keep the graphics from 2004...","June 24, 2014","true","10.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Yet for all that it is entertaining to play, for any fan of the series (LotR or Lego). Telltale Games manage to make the game humorous, which is where its lasting appeal will lie. From ridiculous gags, such as carrot arrows stuck through Pippin's head and the inclusion of most of the comic relief scenes from Jackson's films, the game will at some point have you chuckling and deliberately rewatching some little humorous cutscene.\nThe game is also fairly extensive with lots to do, and may require multiple playthroughs to see everything and acquire all the items. There are lots of little secret areas tucked away to find, some of which are quite beautiful, even if rendered in lego blocks! It is this encouraging of exploration where the games longevity will predominantly lie, so in terms of time to money investment it is worthwhile, especially as it is relatively inexpensive now.","September 28, 2014","true","45.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

From famouse ones like Sauromon to lesser-known characters like Tom Bombidil. I have to admit I love playing this game over and over to uncover all the interesting secrets and crafting weapons as well as unlocking cheats to make it all the more easier.\n\nIt's the best one Lego game I've played so far, but I still havn't played one or two of the newest ones yet.\n\nHowever, this game is very bugged and getting 100% is impossible unless it's fixed. most likly some community fix out there, but may affect achievements.","March 27, 2015","true","44.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

An excellent choice for casual couch coop. A few areas feel lackluster (Minas Tirith being one room, for instance, and lacking any siege of Gondor level), but overall the world is well constructed and relaxing to gallop about.\n\nI'll say this though, the collectables are obnoxious and perhaps the numerical peak in the Lego series. Playing through the game you'll come across quite a few blocked off areas and currently indestructible bricks. At first this makes you eager to go back and satisfy that completionist urge, but the sheer number of them quickly becomes overwhelming. Unlike Lego Star Wars (where a thorough first try would net you the majority of a level's secrets), you'll probably have to play the same levels half a dozen times before being able to sit at a comfy 100%.\n\nBut don't let that dissuade you from an otherwise enjoyable game!

Lego LOTR uses an open world as well and follows the story of Frodo and his companions in order to destroy the One Ring.\n\nLego Batman 2 felt fresh because it didn't try to tell a story that had already been told. We all know the story of LOTR. We've all seen the movies by now, right ? While the gameplay is shallow but fun, it's nothing groundbreaking. And might I say I'm a big LOTR fan, so you can imagine my disappointment when I started playing this.\n\nThe classic Lego humor is still there, but mostly subtle though. And the gameplay is solid as always. But since it's a retelling you kinda know what to expect, making the whole thing... less exciting. Yeah yeah, there's no other way to have created this game, I agree. But still...\n\nBy the way, the low quality voice acting truly bothered me. It's like they ripped the sounds straight from a DVD or something.\n\nLego LOTR shows us that not every tale can or should be made into a Lego game (Lego Avengers does look pretty cool, however...).\n\nFor now, I think you're better off playing Lego Batman 2.\n\n[Rating: 72/100]","February 16, 2013","true","10.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You take charge of a party of protagonists and work your way through the Lord of the Rings plotline (in the style of Peter Jackson's movie trilogy).  Along the way you collect lego bits as a currency, smash enemies and objects that get in your way, and solve an occasional puzzle allow you to progress ahead.  There are a bunch of optional side quests which allow players to collect/craft various items and have some fun outside of the storyline.\n\nAs one might expect from LEGO-branded games, this one seems fit for young or new video gamers who don't want too stressful a challenge.  The only penalty for dying is losing some of the bits you picked up on your current level.\n\nThe story follows Peter Jackson's depiction of Lord of the Rings, however it does take a little bit of creative liberty.  The end of Boromir, for example, is more comedy than tragedy, in the LEGO telling of the tale.  This is almost certainly a necessity when making an E-rated game out of a PG-13 rated movie.  The musical score, character voice clips, and scenery right out of the film trilogy really make you feel like you are playing through the films, and not some alternate rendition of Middle Earth.  Except, of course, when creative liberty was taken here and there to cause LEGO-appropriate silliness.","January 13, 2014","true","34.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

There's a ton to see and do, with a large but not overwhelming Middle-Earth overworld containing lots of subquests and items to acquire as well as eighteen action stages that take you through the movie trilogy. I say "movie trilogy" since that's what the game is based on for the most part, but the developers have clearly done their homework and include a fair number of references to things only found in the books. Tom Bombadil and Radagast make appearances, for instance. This reverence for Tolkein's work makes this game a sheer joy for anyone who really loves The Lord of the Rings in any form.\n\nAbout my only complaints are the lack of online co-op and the length of some of the action stages. They can take upwards of half an hour to complete, and the mid-stage saves don't seem to work reliably enough to allow for quitting and resuming the stage from where you left off at a later time. There's almost no real difficulty to speak of, with death being almost inconsequential and both combat and platforming being extremely basic affairs, but I don't consider that a negative since the game controls really well and has enough clever puzzles that you can't just turn off your brain if you want to collect everything.","July 28, 2013","true","34.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In the free roam you will be able to get additional characters and red blocks, while both free play and free roam will be needed to get all items and mithril blocks.\n\nIf you played a LEGO game before and didnt enjoy it, I would skip the LOTR version as nothing is new or refreshing enough to change your mind. If you do enjoy LEGO games, you will find the same familiar, entertaining gameplay in LEGO LOTR.","January 3, 2014","true","32.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've been asking for this for years and years and we've finally got it! I'm definitely not disappointed either! As a huge ringer, this is one of the few games I just couldn't put down. I've beaten the main story and I will definitely go back to 100% later.\n\nPros:\n- Great graphics\n- Dialog from the movies\n- Soundtrack from the movies\n- Open world\n- Fun take on the classic trilogy (I think Tolkien would be proud)\n- Best level design in a LEGO game since LEGO Star Wars\n\nCons:\n- Based on the movies - So that means no Old Forest or Barrow Downs and also Faramir's character is butchered\n- Only being able to buy certain characters (such as the Wraiths) at night. This wouldn't be as bad if you could wait like in the Elder Scrolls\n- Some cutscenes feel rushed due to the nature of the game; The scene with the Wraiths in Bree is an example of this\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nLEGO Lord of the Rings is a magical adventure... I had a huge grin on my face the whole time I was playing it. It is, quite possibly, the best Lord of the Rings game I've ever played. Certainly the best based on the movies at any rate.

You take charge of a party of protagonists and work your way through the Lord of the Rings plotline (in the style of Peter Jackson's movie trilogy).  Along the way you collect lego bits as a currency, smash enemies and objects that get in your way, and solve an occasional puzzle allow you to progress ahead.  There are a bunch of optional side quests which allow players to collect/craft various items and have some fun outside of the storyline.\n\nAs one might expect from LEGO-branded games, this one seems fit for young or new video gamers who don't want too stressful a challenge.  The only penalty for dying is losing some of the bits you picked up on your current level.\n\nThe story follows Peter Jackson's depiction of Lord of the Rings, however it does take a little bit of creative liberty.  The end of Boromir, for example, is more comedy than tragedy, in the LEGO telling of the tale.  This is almost certainly a necessity when making an E-rated game out of a PG-13 rated movie.  The musical score, character voice clips, and scenery right out of the film trilogy really make you feel like you are playing through the films, and not some alternate rendition of Middle Earth.  Except, of course, when creative liberty was taken here and there to cause LEGO-appropriate silliness.","January 13, 2014","true","34.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I initially played the Star Wars titles on the Nintendo DS. These were buggy affairs with many show stopping glitches. But over the years I've found they have honed the collect the pieces / puzzle game play to a solid dependable platform.\n\nThe previous Lego game I played on PC was Lego Marvel Super Heroes, this was heralded as the high water mark of the recent titles. I have to say, I was I little underwhelmed by the game. Perhaps it was the franchise that didn't resonate with me. I'm not up to speed with all the comic book characters and their special abilities, so the puzzle solving wasn't very straight forward. Also the sheer size of the game left me feeling there was a lack of focus.\n\n6 hours into Lord of the Rings, it's a totally different beast. I've found the story mode hugely enjoyable. All the puzzle elements have been tied nicely with what you'd expect from the roster of characters. Sneaking around is Bilbo domain, given he has the ability to become invisible.  Legolas uses his bow to fire at hard to reach targets. Gimli uses his axe to power smash rocks, to open up new paths.\n\nAll these features are embellished with some very faithful cut scenes and environments, which directly channel the Peter Jackson movies. Voice work is directly taken from the original cast which adds an extra layer of authenticity.  Howard Shore's themes are uses to great effect and add yet more polish to the mix.\n\nLego games are simple affairs. You know what you are getting when you boot them up. I've found Lord of the Rings to be a great pick up and play title, colourful, engaging and just pure fun. I'd recommend it heartily, to kids of all ages.","February 15, 2015","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

What a punchline that was. Came out in 2012, after Lego Batman 2. It also was released for consoles Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii. Oh, and had handheld version for NDS, 3DS and Vita, which is kinda somewhat different but same. Well, lesser versions.\nPC version doesn't have DLCs that consoles have. Those are three character packs and one tools/stuff pack. I doubt that they are important in Lego game, but it still means that PC version isn't the best one. At least be happy that they still support non-Xbox controllers. Oh, and be happy that they finally implented achievements for Steam.\n\nTechnically, it shows that Travellers Tales kept spitting out Lego games pretty much every half/full year. People complain about crashes and bugs, like getting stuck in geometry. Personally I had a bug where I lost control over character aside from jumping when he tried to ride the Warg beast in one of the levels. Had to restart the level. Also had character to jump high into air, like when hobbit was cutting ropes over Gollum's hands. Or when riding the Ent, huge tree character. At least it wasn't anything progress halting.\n\nAnd hey, it's yet another Lego platformer. Punch stuff to collect studs. Lose studs by dieing, but never have game over. Have simplistic puzzles of using right character to do something. Collect everything you can!\n\nAlso, second game that has actual talking character and kinda-free-roam between levels. Lego Batman 2 was the first. Though this one is the first licensed after movie, so have your copy-pasted voice talents. Oh well, having plot still makes it more fun for me. And levels themselves are nicely done that they aren't annoying. When not glitching.\n\nWell, you can also craft. And "crafting" just means another way-around of collecting. Collect recipe, collect mithrill bricks, choose to craft them. And there are quest-givers, which are fetch-quests, mostly involing the crafting. Oh, and developers figured out that since they have split-screen then you can separate characters into two different scenes for some solo actions. Back in previous games they always would have at least two character in same area, slightly altering scenario. Now at least two characters but they can be in two different areas.\n\nOpen world portion also seem to be a bit nasty at times. Most often you are probably going to walk by foot and there is only one spot on a map that has blacksmith. Heck, when I set it destination, game for some reason decided to change path mid-way through and showed me the path to bonus level. When I checked this level and quit, I was sent back to where I starter: opposite side of map.\nBah, should have checked forums to see how to fast-travel.\n\nAnd once you unlock free-play you will notice that sometimes it behaves against players. Like, you climbed this tall tower while AI kept standing on the ground. That AI is Frodo. On top of tower you noticed Campfire that you can light with Sam. And if you change your character to Sam, instead the AI will change character from Frodo to Sam since they are both hobbits and it will change control to this character. Or because both Frodo and Sam are short. So either reclimb the tower or do even more things of changing characters around, selecting different races.\n\nNot to say that there is no positive. Actually, there are a lot. It just that it's so formulic that I got tired of talking about same things all over again. Still fun to whack everything. And such. And collect everything.\n\nI will rather talk about things that really matter. Like, did you know that They Are Taking The Hobbits To Isengard? Whole 10 hours! You don't simply get tired of such classic YouTube video.\n\nBut eh. Yet another Lego game. With free-roam and voices.","February 17","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Which is always wise before thinking of getting a game). And, maybe the game will get you liking one of them, or introduce you to, if you weren't already.

The entire cast of LoTR characters is here (even characters that were in the books that didn't make it into the movie) and the missions use voice clips from the movies so the characters aren't just grunting all the time.\n\nThe game isn't perfect though. Unfortunately the LEGO games have earned a reputation of having a lot of bugs and glitches, and this game continues that trend. The character creator is also seriously lacking, there are hardly any parts to choose from and they are all generic so it's difficult to create anything interesting and the created characters don't have much in the way of special abilities.\n\nDespite the (relatively minor) shortcomings this game was a lot of fun to play and I can easily recommend it to any LEGO or LoTR fan.","October 3, 2014","true","40.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/214510/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","As my first Lego game, I chose this one because many people told me it was the best.  I was never really all that interested in the series, but I'm looking forward to playing some others after this one.\n\nGameplay is typical Lego, using the abilities of various characters to solve puzzles and find collectibles while you progress through the story and explore the game world.  There are a ton of characters to collect as well, some I don't even remember from the books.  This one follows the Lord of the Rings movies, and the majority of the voice acting is taken directly from them so it is very high quality.  Cutscenes are thankfully skippable, especially considering you are forced to replay story missions in order to find all the collectibles.  If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, you will probably enjoy this game.\n\nI personally found the humor pretty weak and often forced, though it is generally considered one of the high points of the series.  A few areas in the game really made me wish there was a way to summon a horse so I could move around faster.  There are a number of bugs and though most of them thankfully minor a few can be quite annoying.  One in particular makes a couple platforming puzzles in the game extremely difficult.  When juping across these platforms, the game  slows you down in the air so you don't jump too far and fall off.  Unfortunately in certain locations, it always slows you down too much, causing you to not jump far enough and fall no matter how far you actually try to jump.  This makes it extremely difficult to actually finish what should be trivial puzzles.  I have also heard reports of a bug preventing 100% completion though luckily I did not run into that one.\n\nFor the technical aspect of the game, it runs mostly smoothly except when loading a new area in the overworld and is very stable; I only experienced one crash in my playthrough.  The graphics are nothing special but it's a Lego game, not Crysis.  The game does not have mouse support like all Lego games so I would highly recommend playing with a gamepad rather than the keyboard.\n\nI enjoyed this game a great deal, more than I thought I was going to.  I can definitely recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Lego games or Lord of the Rings.\n\nMy wishlist for future Lego games:\n- A minimap (I believe this was added in Lego The Hobbit)\n- Proper mouse support with free look\n- A way to move faster later in the game\n- The ability to skip in-game cutscenes in addition to cinematic cutscenes.  Blacksmithing is quite tedious in this one.\n- Better autotargeting.  This game likes to loose the target when you hit the button to act on it.","April 27, 2014","true","27.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

After I beat the main story, there were no more funny cut senes or any big adventer to compleat. I only played it for two or three days after beating the main story because there just wasn't enough to keep my entorest.\n\nThis is definetly a game to play, but you should do what I did and hold off untill Steam puts it on sale, because I would't want to pay full price for a game I may only play once.","August 30, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's tons of collectibles, several characters, charming missions and plot. There's even dialog in this one. What does set LEGO LoTR apart though, are the side quests, because it is open world, there are a plethora of side quests, similar to an RPG. You can just gather side quests and burn some time doing those, or skip them and dive right into the plot. The side quests are fun though, I suggest doing them.\n\nThis game is awesome.\n\n9.4/10","July 26, 2013","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Out of all the lego games I've played (which happens to be quite a few) have never proven to amaze me more than this. I believe that the graphics are superior to all previous and newer LEGO games, such as from the scenes on Mount Doom, Helm's Deep and many others. The games large open world concept brought a new standard to LEGO games, something I only believe may be able to be beat by LEGO The Hobbit. Now, onto the controls! I think that the controls are almost completely natural, with me having to only remap 1 button. It uses the very common pc game controls, WASD with the edition of U to change characters, K to change weapons, J to jump (reccomend remapping to space, very easy) and H to attack. This game is good on any pc or console version in my opinion, as I also have it on PS3. So, this reccomendation isn't JUST for pc, but any version of this game you desire. The next LEGO game I plan on getting is LEGO The Hobbit, so I'm reccomending that also. Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10!","April 22, 2014","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

LEGO Lord of the Rings is a fantastically charming and funny walk through the famous trilogy. With plenty of characters to play and replay missions with, items to collect and bricks to smash apart or put together, there is hours of content for you to complete.\n\nPlay alone or with a friend over network or on local co-op. Exploration is rewarded. As is destruction.\n\nMany cinematics and cut scenes however, are not skippable, which might give you long breaks in the gameplay that you would rather not watch. Local co-op gameplay, whilst not the horrible experience of split screen gaming, does divide the screen into two halves when enough distance is put between characters.\n\n\nPros:\n\nCharming and funny gameplay and cinematics\nHigh graphical fidelity\nResponsive controls and combat.\n\nCons:\n\nLong, story heavy cinematics.\nLocal co-op single screen looks uncomfortably strange on screen\nAwkward keyboard controls.

There are no surprises here.  Having said that, this is a fun and well-made game that fans of The Lord of Rings films will enjoy.  Of particular interest is the overworld which allows you to walk from one end of Tolkien's Middle Earth to the other with no loading screens.  Not at first, of course, since certain parts of the map will be locked off until you've completed the requisite story level, but once you've finished the story mode, you can walk from Hobbiton straight through to Mount Doom without stopping.  It's not to scale, so the trip will only take you a few minutes, but it's still very cool, and the sights along the way will be familiar to fans of both the books and the movies.\n\nThe individual levels are very enjoyable and contain lots of puzzles and secrets, most of which can't be accessed your first time through since they require the right character, so you'll want to go back and play them again in Free Play mode which gives you access to every character on your roster; however, you may want to wait until you've beaten the game because then you'll have every character you need to tackle every challenge, and finishing the game isn't hard since it's virtually impossible to fail.  If your character dies, you lose some studs (LEGO currency that you use to buy special unlockables) and your character is immediately resurrected on the spot, so even the most ham-handed gamer should have no trouble being able to make it to the final cutscene.\n\nLEGO games are known for their humor, but I was somewhat surprised at just how funny these cutscenes are.  Since they use dialog from the movies themselves, the animators had to be creative, and there are endless visual gags like the possessed King Theoden briefly nodding off while talking and Grimma Wormtongue elbowing him in the ribs to get him talking again, or Lurtz taking down Boromir with bananas and chickens fired from his bow (trust me, you'll never look at Borormir's climatic scene the same way again).  Who knew that the films' relentless severity lent themselves to so much humor?\n\nThe game looks good with its colorful, high resolution textures and lighting effects.  We're not talking Arkham City quality, of course, but it does the job, and the music is great because it's taken straight from the Howard Shore soundtrack, so no complaints there.  I did run into several minor glitches throughout the game, such as characters getting stuck in the level geometry or suddenly freezing in place while the game carried on around them forcing me to restart from a checkpoint, but this was relatively rare.  Finally, multiplayer works great with the innovative dynamic splitscreen, and my boys had fun playing through the game with me.  I might even go so far as to say that this is the recommended way to play.\n\nBuy this game if you're a fan of LEGO games and The Lord of the Rings, but if you've had your fill of LEGO games then move along because there's nothing to see here.","January 19, 2014","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Finally, multiplayer works great with the innovative dynamic splitscreen, and my boys had fun playing through the game with me.  I might even go so far as to say that this is the recommended way to play.\n\nBuy this game if you're a fan of LEGO games and The Lord of the Rings, but if you've had your fill of LEGO games then move along because there's nothing to see here.","January 19, 2014","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The PC version is a bit buggy, but I personally did not encounter anything that ruined my good time.\nI will say that I did prefer the older Lego games' form of communication full of grunts and miming.  Despite this game utilizing the speech from the movies, it still managed to bring some of the Lego charm with it.  Plus I totally dig the overworld.\nOverall, it was worth the money I paid for it.

If you are itching to watch the Lord of the Rings movie one day, just sit down and play this.\n\nIt has scenes from the movie reenacted as Lego, the music from the movie, and most importantly, the same voice actors. The world is huge, and the movement system is really nice. LEGO Lord of the Rings has fantastic multiplayer. It just works. You can use the same keyboard and everything and it isn't even awkward! And if it is, try plugging in two keyboard into the same computer and just using one each, it worked perfectly for me. If that isn't enough, game isn't frustrating at all because you can't die. Still, it is b eneficial to stay alive because you will lose out on future rewards if you die too much, but this game really is a tribute to the Lord of the Rings franchise.\n\nPersonally I'd try to grab this while it's on sale because I'm not sure I'd be paying a full 50 dollars for it, but I'd say it's definitely worth 25.\n\nPresentation: 9.0/10 - Everything just feels how a LEGO game should, without ruining any of the experience with disgusting block floor, etc.\n\nGraphics: 9.5/10 - Graphics will surprise you in a good way.\n\nSound: 10/10 - Voice actors from the movie, (all of them, some of them are directly from the movie itself,) and the music is fantastic.\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10 - At first you will not like the controls, but you will get used to them. The game feels nice to play when you are used to it.\n\nLasting Appeal: 9/10 - I feel like I will come back to this game every time I feel like watching Lord of the Rings. I mean, instead of watching it, why can't I just live it?\n\nOh, and as a side note, Samwise is a ♥♥♥♥ing beast.","December 31, 2013","true","12.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The story closely follows the events of the LOTR trilogy and the spliced in movie dialog was a nice touch. The bright and colorful atmosphere is expansive with plenty of areas to explore, collectibles to discover, and puzzles to scratch your head over. Depth perception setbacks and funky camera angles can make more of the heavy platforming elements a challenge but the simple controls and easy navigation system ensures that anybody can pick up, play, and have fun. Most of the LEGO games in the franchise have been lighthearted and entertaining but LEGO LOTR shows that this series can be that and so much more.

The graphics are superb, especially in cutscenes. The level graphics are done very well, from rivers and trees to level objects and distant landmarks. The combat and fun, simple, and free flowing. The puzzle solving in levels is probably the most fun part of the game because it utilizes the talents of all the characters to solve puzzles to advance. All of the characters from the movies are here so far and represented well with a lot of dialogue actually taken directly from the movies. If you are a big Lotr fan or Lego fan or just have time to spare there is a lot of stuff to do in the game.

Easy menu and easy controls when you understand them (as I'm using a keyboard and this game is totaly made for controllers but it's still playable without any problems)\n3.

For people who take Lord of the Rings seriously (as I do) won't understand what's funny in the "humor" that's in the game such as the intro: 9 people are holding their rings and one of the rings falls. It looks silly and childish and I did not like it.\n\nI'm not a fan of Slashers / Puzzle games so I'd put 5/10 but for fans of this game style it's probably will be 8/10.","April 7, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are a couple of things I'd like to note:\n\n- Gameplay is much better when using an Xbox controller, as you can control the perspective better.\n- Gameplay requires a lot of hours to be put in in order to purchase everything and achieve everything. It reminds me a grinding game.\n- It offers some satisfaction and hundreds of hours of gameplay. I suggest in stead of grinding it out, to play it once in a while and finish it slowly.\n\nOverall, this is a great game to destress and enjoy the Lord of the Rings triology. I did notice that the game is very spot on with the story book (Legolas can walk on snow. This isn't depicted in the movie). I suggest buying this game only if you enjoy legos and the story.","October 4, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joaten/recommended/214510/","Joaten","Yung Joaten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joaten/","81 products in account","I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\n\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.\n\nBut one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.\n\nIn a sense we've come to our nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.\n\nThis note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds."\n\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\n\nWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.\n\nNow is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\n\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.\n\nThe marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\n\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?"\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.\n\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating "for whites only."\n\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.\n\nNo, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.\n\nGo back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.\n\nI say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal."\n\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.\n\nWith this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\n\nThis will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, "My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrims' pride, from ev","January 20, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumpenetration/recommended/214510/","maximumpenetration","Vitamin ω «Expired Tomato»","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumpenetration/","306 products in account","LEGO The Lord of the Rings is the classic tale we all know and love set to prop comedy and Louis Armstrong's seminal hit "Blue Yodel No. 9 (Standing on the Corner)". All the major beats of the classic teleplay are present: young Frondo Baggins is left to care for his uncle's estate after uncle Bilbo announces his retirement from the LAPD. However, the wise wizard Gonald realizes that a piece of confiscated bling Bilbo passed on to Frondo is in fact The Ring, and sets him off on a quest with his gardener Rudy.\n\nHowever, Frondo is situatied somewhere in the back of the title card for the game, and the story does not truly begin until reaching the elven city of San d'Oria, where Viggo Mortensen and a young Jimmy Connelly (stunningly rendered in LEGO form thanks to advancing mocap technology) join the group. Many trials and tribulations await our heroes, not the least of which trials and tribulations await our heroes, not the least of which the mad Gallum.\n\nIf you've played one LEGO game, you know what to expect. LEGO The The Lord of the Rings ups the ante by introducing a basic questing and crafting system, as well as an inventory management system that puts the likes of the Resident Evil series to shame. Many medieval stand-ins appear for similar elements in other Legos games: minikit pieces become treasure chests, gold bricks become mithril (used for crafting and the exclusive one million dollar cash prize Traveler's Tales is running), and red bricks become red bricks.\n\nThe LEGO Lord of the Rings takes the idea of an open world, first attempted in LEGO The Batman 2, and tweaks it in an interesting way. The hub world is in fact a completely explorable LEGO The Middle Earth, complete with side objectives. While the normal level-by-level gameplay occurs in the same static camera layout we've all come to enjoy, these little breaks between levels are a nice median between the tiny hubs of elder lego games and the huge, yet dull, world of LEGO Batman 2.\n\nTraveler's Tales has opted to pull dialogue straight from the movies for this game, which makes sense because they ultimately do not have the budget to bring on amazing, well-paid and respected actors like John Rhys-Davies and that guy who looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Paulie Shore. Not only does this make the dialgoue volume slightly inconsistent, but it also creates interesting scenarios, like that part where Boromir dies like a ♥♥♥♥♥ being voiced with all the seriousness it deserves, while portraying a LEGO man dying of a banana to the chest.\n\nThe game supports local co-operative play, which is also a staple feature of The LEGO games. The games are fairly simple to pick up and play, and provided you don't play with some ♥♥♥♥ who keeps wanting to kill you it's sure to be a good time. The game also splits the screen if the two players stray too far from each other, which demonstrates the amazing power of the Cell. Just don't play with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ younger cousin, because at some points in the game the two players control two different aspects of the same scene, and he's not going to get anywhere if you aren't there holding his hand.\n\nIn conclusion, LEGO the Lord of The Rings does not disappoint, but that's only because it's impossible to set the bar for these types of games too high to behin with, and any attempt the game makes to surpass the bar is worthy of praise. Buy this game for something fun to do with friends over the weekend. Just don't invite the sperglord who loves Lord of the Rings, because I swear to God Kyle nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ if this isn't a 1:1 reproduction of the movie we're just trying to have a ♥♥♥♥ing good time.","November 29, 2012","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What's not to love? As far as I am concerned, it's the best of the open-world LEGO games and if you're wondering whether you should get this or LEGO Hobbit, this one wins (although it's not as complicated). It is the first LEGO game to use inventories and forging, which adds a nice gameplay element, and also has some pretty humorous side quests.\n\nSure, it only takes 40 or so hours to clock. Sure it has a few bugs. Sure, it added speech instead of pure mannerisms. Thing is, it's a great game if you want FUN and if you enjoy your drop-in/drop-out, sit-on-the-couch-and-play-on-the-same-computer co-operative gameplay.\n\nSo if you find it for a steal of $14.99, you shouldn't even be hesitating as whether or not to buy it.\n\nTOTALLY worth it.","September 27, 2014","true","44.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It captured the spirit of the movies rather well, and the spoken dialogue is a welcome change from the charades the characters in previous games would act out (though don't mistake that to mean that the cutscenes no longer have any wacky elements!). There's so much to see and do and collect, it really is an epic experience. My one criticism: Almost every level has a boss fight. That gets old after a while, especially if you find yourself going through levels repeatedly to gather up stubborn collectibles. If you're not a completionist, though, you don't have to worry about it. :)","May 4, 2013","true","37.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The lego games were really starting to annoy me. And you go on the internet and everybody keeps praising them. "If it aint broken, don't fix it.". Well lego star wars came out in 2005. Every lego game has been the same since then. Personally I miss the old lego games like "lego Island" "Lego Racers 2" and one of my favorite games of the past "rock raiders". But getting to this game, Yes a lot of it shares the same pattern of the lego games after star wars, but they shake things up enough that this one is acutally good and worth buying (on sale). The graphics have been pumped up and look good, It is open world (at least inbetween levels), and it was really well done in connection to the movies. They use the sound clips and conversations from the movie directly, instead of just "grrr, blah blah, grr" from the other lego games. But I would say if you are not a fan of lord of the rings (specifically the movies) then dont buy it. So much of the humor and value of the game is playing it and watching the cut scenes and noticing the differences that they made to make it humorous. Oh well feels weird talking this long about a lego game from a critical standpoint. But yes, even though it follows some of the basic layout that I'm getting sick and tired of in lego games, It has so much more to it that it is good enough to play though and not go insane with boredom.

What's not to love? As far as I am concerned, it's the best of the open-world LEGO games and if you're wondering whether you should get this or LEGO Hobbit, this one wins (although it's not as complicated). It is the first LEGO game to use inventories and forging, which adds a nice gameplay element, and also has some pretty humorous side quests.\n\nSure, it only takes 40 or so hours to clock. Sure it has a few bugs. Sure, it added speech instead of pure mannerisms. Thing is, it's a great game if you want FUN and if you enjoy your drop-in/drop-out, sit-on-the-couch-and-play-on-the-same-computer co-operative gameplay.\n\nSo if you find it for a steal of $14.99, you shouldn't even be hesitating as whether or not to buy it.\n\nTOTALLY worth it.","September 27, 2014","true","44.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Labcoat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtLabcoat/","1680 products in account","Hmm... well rather than just give a review of the game itself, I'm going to say something different:\n\nIf you haven't played a Lego game, Star Wars: The Complete Saga (the first Lego game) is probably the best to begin, largely because it's the biggest - it's two games in one.\n\nNow, compared to that one, Lego Lord Of The Rings... well, it's hard to say. Obviously, it's not AS good (for value), or I wouldn't be recommending Star Wars first. Gameplay-wise, it's very similar - nearly the same, I'd say. Content-wise, it's... oh, let's say, 70% as long as Star Wars. It's got longer levels, more collectables, and a VERY nice overworld. The biggest drawback though is Lord Of The Rings' serious tone doesn't suit Lego that much compared to the other Lego games, so the story feels a bit of a wash.\n\nSo do I recommend it? If you liked Lego Star Wars, then yes, but if you didn't then no.\n\nOh, and it's got a slow start.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazzmyob/recommended/214510/","kazzmyob","kazz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazzmyob/","422 products in account","Okay, I love lego games, I love the collecting, the humour, the everything but this one is one to give a miss to.\n\nIt's just buggy and glitchy and badly implemented. Prety much all the things that were design choices that impede your ability to play are fixed in The Hobbit lego game. Unfortunately I played that first so while if it had been the other way around I might have been ooohing over the delights of The Hobbit as it was LoTR felt like I was playing a badly broken beta of it.\n\nThe control scheme has it's awful moments, suddenly forcing you into unhelpful fixed camera perspectives, making it excedingly difficult to tell exactly how you are positioned relative to other stuff, the targetting screws up regularly meaning you may fall through objects you are trying to grab or simply swing wildy at things you are trying to hit. The counters on missions glitch making it hard to tell whether you have collected everything. The levels themselves sometimes just plain break as trigger points fail to trigger and your progress is entirely stopped. NPCs mis-position themselves and become unable to interact with. A lot of the achievements are buggy and if you aim for completion (I do on Lego games at least) you are looking at a reasonable amount of frustration as you may have to repeat the requirements for various achievements multiple times before you get them to trigger - and at time of writing I am still missing one, very easy to get achievement as it refuses to pop no matter how many times I complete it. Most progress stopping problems with the game can be fixed by killing it completely and restarting it. This will unfortunately not save you from the rest of the bad design choices though.\n\nFeel like walking miles? LoTR = yes, Hobbit = summon a mount\nStupid camera angles screwing up your positioning? LoTR = yes, Hobbit = helpful marker underneath you\nCan't hit/grab items? LoTR = yes, Hobbit = all works like a charm\nCharacter wants to hit random crap? LoTR = yes and there's nothing  you can do about it, Hobbit = you can aim anything even remotely ranged\nWant to change to a character with the ability you need? LoTR = well screw you, we've decided to turn the character following you into that one. And since you were half way up a jump quest at the time when we did this, the jumping character will not only fail to get the ability it needed, it will also immediately ambled off the edge of the jump quest to rejoin its now useless partner on the ground. I mean really this one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so many times. There seems to be some inherant desire to keep characters the same size so if you have Legolas and say, Frodo (one big, one small) and half way up a jumpy thing you need  a rope so you figure you'll switch from Legolas to Sam, it will switch Frodo to Sam and switch your focus to him leaving Legolas to leap off the jump quest, and this is despite explicitly selecting the character from the menu of all possible characters etc etc. Amazingly in the Hobbit when you selected to switch to a different character, it just switched to a different character...\n\nHonestly, I played through it out of stubborness, but really if I had known how incredibly annoying it was going to be I would never have bought it. If you are a seriously casual player, don't care about completion and don't mind having to restart the odd level every so often in order to progress it might be an okay game for you. Unless you are really invested in Lego/LoTR though there are better games out there, better lego games and better LoTR games...","July 15, 2014","false","70.6"," 25 of 52 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","25","52","0","0"

Your character moves to the left of the screen when you hit left and so on, but when the screen direction is constantly shifting because the game feels free to swing around to a different camera angle which you didn't want controlling where you're giong becomes an exercise in frustration.

Seriously, I've read almost all of his extended works. So, I really want to love this game. I really, really want to love it. However, I just can't. I purchased this game on December 27, 2012, almost exactly three years ago. Despite meeting the sytem requirements, I was one of the people to be caught by a bug in the game that prevented me from making it past the prologe. It really sucked. The next year, with a new pc, I was able to complete the Black Rider, but I could go no further. Fast forward to the summer of 2015. I finally purchased a decked out gaming rig and was ready to give the game a go. It was pretty great. It had all the cheesy lego action that I expected, the wonderful sound track, and an open world approach. In short, it was everything I wanted all those years ago. However, It is hard to feel great about a game that was purchased for full price and wasn't playable for years.\nThe short and simple is this: Go ahead and buy the game if you well exceed the system requirements. Have a blast, it will be enjoyable. If you meet the system requirements or barely exceed it, then don't even bother. You will essentially be gambling on whether or not you will actually be able to play the game or not. The customer service won't be helpful... like at all.","December 23, 2015","false","29.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I'll stick to a list of pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n- Lord of the Rings theme.\n- Official soundtrack of the films.\n- A sense of humor, good for an occassional chuckle.\n- LAN multiplayer with up to 2 players, a rarity these days.\n\nCONS:\n- Fixed and unhelpful camera angles.\n- Quick Time Events as far as the eye can see.\n- Puzzles are extremely easy and generally only require you to press a button or two with the right character selected.\n- Poorly fitting dialogue and voices taken directly from the films and used regardless of tone of the scene in the game. Once Gimli even said one of Aragon's lines in Aragon's voice ("Mithril...!").\n- Very confusing controls. Some menus require one set of keys while others require other keys. Only the movement keys are used for movement, the other 6 buttons seem to have been picked at random for every menu.\n- Singleplayer this game is very frustrating, as sometimes you must complete a number of mundanse tasks to continue. With two players this process can be sped up significantly. Fights with bosses (like a troll) are also much easier, since the troll will always be targetting a player.\n\nAll in all a big disappointment.","February 5, 2015","false","3.2"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

This is an excellent retelling of a story we're all familiar with, laced with kid friendly humor. This is the staple of the series & TT Games delivers. However, this entry into the Lego series is problematic.\n\nPlatforming is TERRIBLE. Most notibly are spots where you are forced to do the balance beam jumps. There seem to be force fields in the air that stop you from jumping far enough or into the right spot. you will repeatedly fall into the water on these sections & have to repeat the whole set of jumps over again.\n\nThe stage "Osgiliath" is extremely buggy. The Ents will randomly rocket up into the air because of their shoddy clipping with the ground. There is a pit where if you get too close with an ent. He will go into a minute long trance & just walk toward it. The thunderous footsteps of the ents changes to clicks when the ent has both Pippin & Merry in possession. When the ent attempted to rip down the dam wall at the end of the map, the game seized all control & all I was permitted to do was change between the hobbits.\n\nOn the stage "Cirith Ungol" there is a bug that will not allow you to trade items, between characters. If you happen to pick up 2 helmets or 2 armors with 1 character. You will be forced to restart the section.\n\nBasically this is an ok game, but it's not up to snuff. Glad I bought it on discount. I recommend you do the same if you're considering this.","February 14, 2015","false","68.8"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"

But the ring wants to be found and the road to Mount Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed, will be perilous and riddled with Orcs and fouler things. To help Frodo, a Fellowship is formed —Aragorn the Ranger, Gandalf the Wizard, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Boromir a Man of Gondor, and Frodo’s Hobbit friends Sam, Merry and Pippin. Players relive the legend through the LEGO mini-figures, as they explore wonders, solve timeless riddles, and overcome endless foes in their quest to destroy the Ring.","December 27, 2013","true","452.8"," 18 of 41 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","18","41","0","0"

I however am giving up on it after a little over two hours. The problem is that it's just not the game I was expecting, it has the tags action and adventure, but I'd make that a big adventure and a small action.\nThis game frustrated me for the same reason that old school adventures do. I get stuck somewhere and although I eventually get past it, I feel like I just end up cycling through my available characters and run all over the place smashing everything and seeing if a trigger pops up. Also silly things like get stuck for ages knowing what I have to do but it seems like the last piece I need is nowhere to be found... only to find that I accidentally already picked it up with one of my characters and it was in their inventory. I don't think it's necessarily a fault in the game, it's just not my cup of tea.\n\nSo, while it's a good game, I'm just leaving my negative review to warn other players like me. If you're the type to easily get frustrated because you get stuck and you don't care as much for exploration and collecting every small thing in an area as you would for some proper action, you might want to give this a miss.\n\nOh yeah, one other thing... other reviewers say it's a must for die hard LotR fans? Make that die hard LotR MOVIE fans as the game follows the movie more than the book (even if they are reasonably close together for a movie adaptation).","July 7, 2014","false","2.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

It's incredible that anyone would release a game with as many problems as I encountered to be marketed to children. Its a very easy game, but far too frustrating due to bugs that somtimes break the game forcing you to close the game and open it again.

While I might not be the biggest LOTR fan there is, this game doesn't skimp on the story - it makes light of certain elements that kids might find a little distressing, but this isn't exactly a game designed for mature themes. It's lego, after all.\n\nThe controls are adequate at best, and downright appauling at worst. You would need to bind your own keys from the default arrow keys and number pad (numbers 2 to 5, no idea who thought that was a good idea). I - for the most part - played it with a 360 controller, and bar a little ineptitude from my part, I had little issues with the controls. What makes it downright appauling then? If you have a 360 controller as player 1, and player 2 hops in on the keyboard, it isn't possible for player 2 to hop out, while player 1 can. Admittedly this has nothing to do with the controls, when you attempt to customise the keyboard controls after being forced to get rid of the controller and wanting to continue to play with something usable, player 1 now has no input. Pressing any button on the keyboard (including esc) will try to assign player 1's controller to that, but as player 2 is using it, it won't keep it. Trying to re-introduce the controller wont' help. I've pressed every button on both keyboard and controller, and onyl been able to get away from it by force quitting the game.\n\nAs for character controls, the game is fine, except during the platforming elements. Or maybe I just happened to find one really, really bad one when looking for mythril blocks near Mt. Doom. It's bad enough to make half-life platforming look good.\n\nThe graphics are okay, until you turn off depth-of-field and motion-blur, then they're actually quite pretty, and at least you can see stuff in the distance with it off.\n\nThe comedy is as it is with all other lego games - slapstick and visual. It doesn't deviate from the story at all, so beyond silly disguises, or someone being hit over the head with something else, there aren't going to be too many giggles.\n\nTo round this off - if you like lego, go play with lego. If you like lego games, you might like this one, but I'd suggest something else; this is easily the worst lego game I've played. If you like LOTR, then you might want to give this a miss. If you love LOTR or have kids who are into it, you might have some enjoyment from it.","April 4, 2015","false","39.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

By the end, I just didn't care anymore.\n\nThe game holds your hand all the way, and the difficulty level is pretty much constant. The fear of dying is non-existent because the game brings you back almost as if it never happened. Basically, there is nothing to challenge or stimulate the player besides the sound of LEGO pieces clinking together.\n\nI couldn't even get into the atmosphere of the game. It seemed like it couldn't decide when it was being serious, when it was being funny, etc... when to play certain music even - I was outside Edoras and for some reason the Shire music was playing; really broke the mood...\n\nOh yeah, and there are the glitches as well, like an in-game cut-scene where the characters stand around mid-pose, staring into the distance forever... but I think I've gone on long enough.\n\nGood things I can say? Well, it's a nice looking game, and it did make me laugh a few times (especially the joke with Peter Jackson throwing his Oscar away in Helm's Deep).

It has too many problems that ruin the good things about it :(\n\nGood things are it has a large open world to explore in-between missions, but I don't like that you need to beat the campagin to be allowed to use any character in-between the missions, it makes it so you pretty much should jsut bum-rush all the missions so that you can REALLY have true freedom in the open world.\n\nThe cast of characters is okay, im not a fan off it having say 3 costumes for certian characters like arigon, frodo etc. and it counting as 3 seperate characters, though for actual number of characters that are unqie in their abilites their is not too much (check lego marvel for chracters with a wide variety of abilites) However Lego LOTR has a pretty infuriating chracter select method, after you beat the main campagin the main fellowship members are set as your PERMENANT quick select characters and if you want to switch to ANYONE cool like golum, saroun, ghost king etc. you have to g to choose other character option, then hcoose from large list. If that was not bad enough, if you get to an area that requires you to have a certian characters ability to get by (i.e gimlis boudler smash) when you switch to that character, if you try to go back to your cool character they have been replaced by the default fellowship character!\n\nIts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you should be able to customize the character wheel to have any 8 characters you want ready whenever.\n\nThe mithril and treasure item system is really cool! Being able to collect a huge amount of items that augment your abilites of just look cool or grant entirly special abilites is awesome, but same as the character select its a total chore to do. Say you find a rope section but you can't be bothered switching to sam (the rope bearer) to get past it? No problem, if you have a mithril rope and your in free play mode you can just summon it out your trove and use that with any character, HOWEVER, your items are NOT saved to characters AND if you pull out another mithril item that is a tool/weapon it will overide your current item.\n\nSo even if you have 6 empty slots, bring out the mithril trowl and now have 5 empty slots you will NEVER get to equip another thing in them, your trowl will jsut disappear.\n\nSo basiclly if you had hoped to ever create a badass custom character with aragons sword, then give him all the tools and special armour peices to have all ablites you get to EAT ♥♥♥♥. Because the best you can do is give him the armour, one tool, but then, if you switch to someone else, yo uwill have to re-summon them AND re equip all the items. Which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing terrible desgin. (oh and yh, in frodos house you can make custom characters)\n\nThe game incorpirates a side quest system, however they ALL seem to be fetch quests, though they do net you access to more treasures since whatever you fetch you get a copy of or your trove which is good.\n\nactual story is a highly watered down version of LOTR, giving you most of the important stuff to know whats going on, though some things are completely missed like that idiot king/mayor in gondar who is included as a buyable character even though you literally NEVER see him in the campagin.\n\nSo the game is decent, the large open world is overwhelming and the sheer armount of unlockables is like a wet dream for digital hoarders such as myself, however its almost completely ruined by the fact that any awesome stuff you find or characters you unlock take far too long to switch too and equpping them is only temporary. To the point it actually does ruin the game. Also most fights/bosses can be very repetative, requiring you to do the exact same action multipel times OR situations where you should win without hassle, i.e hitting golum taking a heart, but hitting him again does no dmg becaused he is scripted to jump back onto cliff and keep throwing ♥♥♥♥ at you until you do the exact same repatative task for bringing him down.\n\nAlso I need to mention the controls are terrible, I mean, a lego game with no controller support? Really? and the default keyboard controls are actual dirt, I rebinded them imedtially.\n\nOverall, Its maybe worth it if you are gunning to play all the lego games or are a big fan of the series, but I would highly recommend lego Marvel over this game.\n\nLego Lord of the Rings has a massive good amount of content that is ruined by the way its accessed/handled... Its a shame, I really found myself wanting to like it :(","October 30, 2014","false","14.8"," 19 of 44 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","19","44","0","1"

This is the first one I've played on PC and the first I've played in a long while. (There's a TL;DR at the bottom if you don't want to read all of this)\nThe game is good, but the controls are just terrible. They resemble something from prior to the mouse existing, with (by default) uses H to attack, and J to jump (the space bar can be reassigned from it's default use as character switch.) and if you could just reassign certain actions to the mouse it would be fine.  THIS GAME HAS NO MOUSE SUPPORT. and by that I mean none in any capacity, the game won't even pick it up (and based off of the community discussion, it's not just my mouse )\n\nSo if you're okay with playing this using only a keyboard (i.e. not on a laptop or something with a small keyboard) or using a controller, then I would definitely reccommend the game.\n\nBut since this is a PC port that is usually $30 (and was at one point $40 or $50) there is NO REASON they couldn't have one person on the team porting this just add some damn mouse support. And that's the reason I can't recommend this game, hopefully others will do the same so maybe they'll take notice and put in some mouse support, aside from the obvious lack of effort on the side of the developers in porting this it's good.\n\nTL;DR: If you like lord of the rings, and you don't mind terrible controls or using a controller, it's worth your money. If you're like a lot PC gamers such as myself, I can't recommend this because of the bad controls that make the game pretty unplayable, even before counting the fact it shows the lack of effort on the end of the developers.","December 28, 2013","false","0.6"," 39 of 87 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","39","87","0","7"

Consistently getting 70+ % scores in reviews, utilizing popular franchises so you know in advance what to expect, and promising co-op, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nFirst off, Lego LotR does not recognize my mouse. And no, I'm not talking about game-play yet, I'm dropped into a game where you cannot even operate the menus with the mouse. My 360 controller doesn't seem to do anything, either. I google it. No, it's not a bug or configuration hiccup, the mouse is not supported. At all. This is a classic example of "You could've researched this, but because the notion seems so insane, you never thought to."\nOn the upside, you can use the controller once you've told the game that that's what you want. Using the keyboard.\n\nAt which point you may notice that there are two columns for control, player 1 and 2. A dark sense of foreboding descends upon you. You shop around the options, and sure enough, there is no online play. In all fairness, this has a degree of user error to it, as the steam description plainly says, "local co-op", but since e.g. Lego Star Wars had online play and most reviews you'll read don't specifically mention that this game doesn't, just "co-op", "I played this with my kids," etc., there's certainly room for misunderstanding, so I'm warning you now.\n\nThe opening cinematics have a forced-funny moment or two, but given the presumed audience, I'm not sure you can blame them for trying to make things more child-accessible, except that I had a couple of "I'm not sure this would make much sense unless you've read the book/watched the movie anyway" moments, so at that point you already need to have decided the undiluted version isn't "too dark" for your spawn. (Either way, you do essentially start off playing Isildur, who is then force-killed by plot requirements ten minutes later, so what are we even talking about here?)\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the game immediately drops you into an uninteresting fight against minions and finally Sauron. The game doesn't exactly tell you what to do, but not having spent your life under a rock, you aim to cut off the dark lord's finger to get on with it. Which meant battling not so much Sauron, but the controls — I know this is probably aimed at children, but does it have to feel like that game where you're supposed to eat a candy bar with knife and fork wearing huge oven mitts? The directional controls were the most unprecise it's ever been my misfortune to suffer. Strangely, the dark lord seemed to have the same issue, because we spent 10 minutes bumping into each other and swinging our weapons around without inflicting any noticeable degree of damage on each other.\n\nThat's all I can say about the directional controls, except that the camera ones aren't much better. In the opening scenes, an angle is forced on you, which you can change by a handful degrees either way. Later on, you fortunately get full rotation, but turning the camera still feels slow and laborious like pushing around a boulder.\n\nThe challenge of the opening mainly consisted of picking the right character for a task ("it's not like you can't jump up there, it's that you can jump there as Isildur, it looks like Elrond does the same jump, but he'll succeed", "it's not like you can't destroy that, you just have to pick the character with the right sword", etc). And yeah, you may have to read the character names to pick the right bearded and helmeted Lego head.\n\nAt some point, I got sufficiently frustrated with the controls that I essentially switched to finding new ways of killing myself on Mt Doom (fell off the cliff, fell in the lava, etc.), which at first glance didn't seem to have any ill effects — outside of the minifig exploding into its parts, I mean. It's not so much that you "lose a life", it's that you lose gold, cos our guy Isildur is constantly looting stuff as he goes along. This gold is apparently later used to unlock new characters to play or something, which they allude to in an interstitial screen that came and went so fast I wasn't sure (I'd read that you can choose a character or even create one in the Hobbit house, so I was anxious to get there. Of course, that option was not offered, so I don't know whether you first have to complete some quests, or what.).\n\nSo, yeah, you know why the minifig's hands look like that? Because they've given the lego computer games all their thumbs down.\n\ntl;dr Don't impulse-buy this, despite the sale. Research very, very carefully, much more so than with "normal" games, just reading a few reviews on metacritic can be vastly misleading. If unsure at all, Do. Not. Buy.\n","April 17, 2014","false","12.2"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","6"

Overall, it's a very sloppy port to PC.\n\n1) It's a PC game that doesn't support the mouse, despite several game mechanics being ideally built for it - for example aiming ranged attacks brings up a reticule that must be placed over a target. The game does not support the Playstation 3 pad, so if you want to play it, I'd have to recommend picking up a 360 controller.\n\n2) It's buggy. Characters will frequently get stuck in walls and other such similar annoyances. Thankfully if you move far enough away, they'll teleport behind you when you're not looking, but this isn't always an option. Mercifully, I've not found myself unable to continue at any point. Rendering errors are frequent - and I've found myself unable to continue past the Nazgul attack in the moors, as some sort of ground overlay is floating around in the z-axis meaning I can't actually see the gameplay area. From what I gather, the console version of the game have been patched, but the PC version has been neglected and abandoned. Reading online also indicates that there are bugs related to white blocks that can potentially make it impossible to finish the game.\n\n3) The overall design isn't great and the game has it's problems. Some of the character interplay towards the mid-game is nice and it may get better later (though I may potentially never find out as I'm unable to continue), but the level design is shockingly poor. The majority of the game is entirely linear, including the puzzle sections which have components that illogically have to be completed in a certain order rendering the puzzle section little more than a waste of time as you go through the required motions. Large parts of the game seem to take place on hills and slopes, but the player is tasked with collecting studs which are represented with rigid bodies - as a result you'll spend a lot of time chasing them down hills to collect them, only finding they have rolled into water or off a cliff and are therefore unobtainable. Some levels have too many playable characters - one level has the entire Fellowship of nine characters, which makes selecting the correct character a chore - it doesn't even fit on the character wheel any more. Some of the character icons, particularly those of the hobbits, are difficult to discern from one another, compounding the frustration. In some cases areas of the levels are enclosed and too small (such as structures in Rivendell), meaning that the camera is obscured by outside walls of the structure, meaning you cannot see what you are doing. Lastly, some of the lighting and choice of colour palette can make some things in the environment very difficult to discern, particularly during levels that take place at night.\n\nOverall the game is entertaining, but frustrating due to issues, and I cannot recommend it.","March 17, 2014","false","5.6"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ripentaro/recommended/214510/","ripentaro","ripentaro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ripentaro/","172 products in account","I have been a fan of the Lego games since the initial run of Star Wars titles. As such, I was well aware of the minor problems with controls and camera that have always been prepared to deal with them in each new Traveller's Tale title but the gameplay and glitch issues make this game feel incredibly slapdash. There are other issues beyond these that I take issue with but as they are secondary they shall wait till later in my review. Firstly glitches. You don't notice them early on but as you start to explore the HUB world more they become more redolent. You will fall through the world on an occasional basis but this can be fixed by instant travelling to a location. the more crippling factor is the broken collision detection for both characters and objects. Frequently you will find your character floating uselessly in the air. Floating objects are a more nefarious as they will render push and pull block puzzles unsolvable. These kind of glitches are so frequent as to render it impossible to believe that they would not have been caught by game testers had a proper  quality control been done. This leaves the game feeling, in spite of its graphical quality, extremely unpolished.\nNow on to gameplay. The controls are terrible. Direction feels imprecise and button response is indecisive. Buttons very often do not respond as desired, such as when holding the Y button is supposed to bring up the character select but instead just swaps you with the second player (extremely annoying when playing co-op). At other times they simply do not respond at all, such as the case of the extremely flaky jump button. This, paired with the vague directional input, leads to much cursing in what is essentially a platformer. Much of the challenge in this game arises not from clever puzzles but from the player fighting the controls.\nAnother problem in gameplay are the design choices. Many quest-givers (is that a word?) are in hard to reach locations making just the act of turning in a quest an annoyance. More annoying are the menus. This is illustrated most by the constructable items. In the game you can build certain items that allow you to mimic one character's powers on another. This is rendered superfluous by the fact that you have to navigate 2 menus to equip the item each time so that it is simply faster to search one menu to find the character with the requisite power. Every time something requires doing you might as well just whip out Samwise The Swiss Army Knife of Middle Earth.\nAlright, the finale: Story. But this follows the story of the movies, right? That should be a good thing, right?... Actually, no. Here's why. There is no freedom to deviate from the scripts of the movies as they are married to using the film's audio. Part of the enjoyment of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones games where their ability to deviate from the source materials in order to better facilitate gameplay or to make jokes that could not be done with the source dialogue in place. Yes, there are added jokes in this game but as they cannot change or add dialogue many of them feel weird and out of place, especially in a movie that maintains a serious tone in almost all of its dialogue. The original audio also prevents them from adding story sequences that weren't in the movie, for example an added Tom Bombadil/ Old Willow Level would have made a welcome addition but, as there was no dialogue for this they couldn't. This issue of the audio was initially what steered me away from the game until the recent sale, mostly because of the serious tone of the story. I was not really interested in seeing these performances being juxtaposed with silly sight gags. My fear was realized and many of the jokes feel out of place or will leave you saying, "Oh, that's just wrong." Should have listened to my doubts. At least it was only five bucks.","April 18, 2014","false","21.4"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

Plus the mouse is disabled too. This can be a kick in the teeth for some players expecting full keyboard and mouse support. There isnt many options for graphics either.

There is a bit more viol;ence in this title than others, due to the nature of combat in the LotR universe, but that shouldn't be an issue for all but the youngest of children.\n\nHowever, like other LEGO games, this game has terrible PC controls, and (at least as far a I could see) no way to change up the keybindings. I'll be coming back to this game when I have a gamepad but until then, I'm shelving it, after only about 50 minutes.\n\nRECCOMEND: Yes, to LotR or LEGO fans...but I'd highly recommend playing with a gamepad, if possible.","January 7, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actually, I was disappointed I didn’t grab The Hobbit-LEGO while it was on sale too. (I bought it the second the title went on sale again, since LEGO titles seem to go on sale pretty often.)\n\nWhat first sold me was watching the re-created movie cut scenes with the twist of LEGO humor. There’s about an hour and a half worth of cut scenes, which are definitely not a waste of time. The “voice acting” is audio clips from the movies so it’s obviously spot on. And the music consists of the same majestic scores you hear in the movies, making simple tasks like lighting a fire 1000x more epic.\n\nIf you’re going for 100% completion on the game, it’s going to take time: probably 30-40 hours. I’ve logged 37 hours and I’m at 82% completion, but I do mess around.\n\nYou get to unlock pretty much every conceivable character mentioned in the movies (and some from the books, like Tom Bombadil) which allows you do things like  ride a sheep around the Shire as Sauron.  Now tell me that didn’t make a “Thank you for your purchase!” email arrive in your inbox. The entire world of Middle Earth is your sandbox.\n\nAs a side note, I definitely suggest using a controller. The controls are pretty wonky and unnatural if you want to stay true to keyboard/mouse.\n\nReally the only drawbacks would be (1) that you don’t have much control over the camera angles, which makes some areas hard to navigate, but those instances are minimal. (2) The fact that since it is a game made for a controller, it’s a “one button does everything” control system so you’ll definitely end up dropping an object instead of using it a few times. And finally (3) if you’re an achievement hunter, there’s a couple buggy achievements, so I suggest you seek out a guide to overcome them.\n\nBut all and all, it’s a great game if you want to kick back, enjoy Middle Earth, and hit things with a frying pan ‘till money bursts out. Oh, did I mention that there’s a “Mithril Disco Phial” that plays a remix song of famous LOTR quotes that your characters rock out to?\n\nYeah, just buy it.","January 29, 2015","true","39.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Real voice actors and soundtracks from the movie. If played with controller and with friends co-op it's even more awesome!\n\nI can only praise the game how cool it actually is, but there are few negatives I'd like to point out:\n\n1. There are often 3-4 characters you need to switch between. It would be really helpful to have the character names visible at all times. When a puzzle requires Sam for instance I don't have a clue which of the four hobbits is Sam. Also the controls for fast character switch work between two character and you need to use the Y button to choose the other two, strange.\n2. The coin hunting is somewhat annoying as about every bush and stone is destroyble with fists (ehh) and coins explode everywhere. And many of them even end up going to unreachable areas.\n3. Every character has it's own inventory so it's kinda annoying to find the right character to complete a certain puzzle or use a certain item.\n\nThat's about all negatives I can think of. For me there has been no crashes or any bugs whatsoever.\n\nOn a scale 0-5 I would give this game 4.","November 10, 2014","true","38.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has much more of an Open-World/RPG feel than any of the other LEGO titles. It has voices and full dialogue from the movies which I believe is a first for the LEGO video game franchise and is an amazing change from the usual LEGO gibberish dialogue. It is pretty much like watching the movies done in LEGOs with their typical comedic additions. If you love Lord of the Rings and LEGOs this is a no-brainer. 9/10.","November 12, 2014","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are so beautiful and I love that I can look around and then see this gorgeous waterfall or something. Haven't put in codes in yet, just playing it straight through on the first run and I can see there is lots of areas to explore.  Lots of characters I'll be needing to get and errands to run for certain characters. Haven't quite figured out the map thing yet, but again, more things to explore. I'll be playing this one for a long long time. I play this alone and with my husband and it's amazing all the different things going on when you play two player.

This is funny by itself, but they also add in visual humar.  I can't fault any game that honestly makes me laugh more then once, as this one has.  Yes, the camera has a mind of it's own and half the time does not point where you want it too.  Yes, goals are not always easy to find and you will wonder aimlessly around a few areas where it's not clear what you need to do. Yes, the game constantly wants you to play co-op and almost punishes those that refuse to use it, like me.  But the attention to detail and care used to bring out the characters is great.

A few pros & cons about this one though:\n\nPros: Looks great, the story plays out well, the characters have some more versatility than in previous games since they can use tools or combine items in inventory.\n\nCons: so far, it has been really buggy.  Expect to play a few levels over because your character gets stuck or the cutscene gets messed up. Most of the bugs are things that should have been rooted out in beta testing... but in my opinion, it is still worth playing the game.\nI find some of the levels quite a lot more tedious than previous lego games - the balrog battle and the swamp level for example - Lots of repetitive pointless action required by the user.\nI'm not a fan of the open world "lobby" that has replaced the traditional lego game lobbys in many of the lego games.  They at least added a fast travel feature once you finish the story, otherwise it would have been a huge negative for me.\n\nOverall, a classic lego game for sure.   I would play the star wars saga (incl. lego star wars 3) & pirates of the Caribbean before this one if given the chance, though.","December 10, 2013","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This time, the game is open world, which really surprised me, given that all the others were only levels, and all of the voices are those of the movies. From the beginning to the end, I enjoyed seeing how the adaptation went.\n\nHOWEVER, everything came crashing down when I went for the 100%. There are a ridiculous amount of bugs when you replay the levels in free play. Itens that don't appear, invisible walls, disappearing itens and a lot more - and not the kind of that only appear once in a while; it happens all the time. And during the free play you begin to realise the horrible gameplay and controls which are the same since the first LEGO Star Wars - it's outdated and just doesn't work anymore. Several characters that you buy are only copies of ones you already have, and more than half the itens you collect are useless.\n\nI looked on foruns, and there are people who COULDN'T ACHIEVE 100% BECAUSE OF BUGS. It was almost my case as well. They informed Traveller's Tales of this and, instead of fixing it, sended cheat codes to unlock the itens - basically, they're not gonna fix then.\n\nOnly play this if you don't intend to achieve 100%. Otherwise, skip it and go play some other LEGO game less buggy.\nNot even my love for Tolkien's saga and the LEGO franchise made me tolerate this.","March 7, 2015","false","35.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a compelling campaign and fun, enjoyable general gameplay, I definetely recommend this game.","December 8, 2013","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I had tried the lego series one other time with The Star Wars franchise, and it didnt take, this was when it first came out. I was curious and for a good price I picked up The Lord of the Rings. I really enjoyed it. I wasnt used tot he camera changes, and this game is much better with a controller than a mouse and keyboard. A mistake I made originally with Star Wars. I plan to pick up some others of this set in the future.\n\nGameplay : I really enjoyed the fun whimsical  aspect and comedy nature they game developers took with the story. The atmosphere and environment were really dead on adn in some times if you squint you'd think you were watching the movies. The world of Legos really does mend well with LOTR's.\n\n","December 27, 2013","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingjamesm/recommended/214510/","kingjamesm","King James","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingjamesm/","193 products in account","As a fan of the LEGO game series, I enjoyed LEGO LoTR. If you've never played a LEGO game, though, I'm not sure if this is the one to start with unless you're a big huge fan of LoTR. One of the things I've enjoyed about the LEGO games is the anarchic sense of humor and the willingness to lovingly goof around with the source material. However, LEGO LoTR is oddly restrained. Maybe it's because it not only follows the story of the film series, but uses actual audio clips in doing so, that the sense of playing around with the material isn't there like it is with the other LEGO games, such as the silent Star Wars and Indiana Jones games. Maybe it was an intentional design choice. The humor is still there, but it's just not there in the same laugh out loud way that previous games in the series had.\n\nStill, the game is fun to play. There's a wide range of characters, but the addition of the Mithril Treasures that allow any character to have the powers of any other character in some ways means that you won't be playing as quite so many characters in free play. Quite literally, once you've got the Mithril Treasures, you can play as a single character in Free Play and accomplish every task without switching out your character.\n\nPretty much every character of note in the film series makes their way into the game, as well as some that only found their way into the Extended Edition footage. There's also some that never made it out of pre-production, like the love-him-or-hate-him Tom Bombadil. I am not a giant LoTR fanboy but I consider myself decently familiar with the source material both in film and book form, and even I'll admit that there were several characters I had to go to an LoTR wiki to remember who they were. The film's locations are also recreated on a small scale but are instantly recognizable. The details are appreciated especially as the game has an extensive overworld with a lot of secrets and quests to complete.\n\nIf you're a veteran of the LEGO games looking to get your fix, or a big huge fan of LoTR (particularly the film series), I'd recommend this title. If you've never played a LEGO game, you may want to start with another title in the series to figure out whether they're your cup of tea before you pick this one up.","February 20, 2014","true","44.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few pros & cons about this one though:\n\nPros: Looks great, the story plays out well, the characters have some more versatility than in previous games since they can use tools or combine items in inventory.\n\nCons: so far, it has been really buggy.  Expect to play a few levels over because your character gets stuck or the cutscene gets messed up. Most of the bugs are things that should have been rooted out in beta testing... but in my opinion, it is still worth playing the game.\nI find some of the levels quite a lot more tedious than previous lego games - the balrog battle and the swamp level for example - Lots of repetitive pointless action required by the user.\nI'm not a fan of the open world "lobby" that has replaced the traditional lego game lobbys in many of the lego games.  They at least added a fast travel feature once you finish the story, otherwise it would have been a huge negative for me.\n\nOverall, a classic lego game for sure.   I would play the star wars saga (incl. lego star wars 3) & pirates of the Caribbean before this one if given the chance, though.","December 10, 2013","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes one needs some relaxing, and in these moments a game should not be a job, but it should provide a sense of satisfaction and distract from the problems of every day life. In this, LEGO LotR is a full success. It  provides loads of nice images while you click on your keyboard to advance in the story, and the main purpose of playing becomes to see what comes next, what gorgeous recreation of the LotR world has been produced by the developers. There may be some small criticisms to be done: clicking can be a little too frantic at times, and the overall game is strictly linked to the fairly awful movie trilogy, but in spite of that it is simply so funny to see your small Lego characters do their jobs in the gorgeous environment. And there is, as in all LEGO games, a nice sense of humour which makes the playing experience quite enjoyable.","December 27, 2013","true","41.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good use of mechanics and a lot of stuff to unlock and do.  I would recommend to play this game with a controller as it feels nicer (it works with xbox 360 controller). Sometimes it's a bit difficult to do the platformer parts right, because the camera isn't always positioned right. Also when playing with two players in storymode (levels) the splitscreen can become confusing as it's adjusting towards the relative position of eachother. One player was looking at the left all the time and then the other player changes character and his camera shifts to the other side suddenly. Also aiming is a problem when the players are not close enough together to form one screen. Later I saw you can configure it back to a classic splitscreen. When roaming through the overworld (between levels) the splitscreen acts like a regular splitscreen and you don't have these problems. The game follows the story well and makes funny short versions of scenes. I would definitly recommend this game.","January 9, 2014","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingjamesm/recommended/214510/","kingjamesm","King James","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingjamesm/","193 products in account","As a fan of the LEGO game series, I enjoyed LEGO LoTR. If you've never played a LEGO game, though, I'm not sure if this is the one to start with unless you're a big huge fan of LoTR. One of the things I've enjoyed about the LEGO games is the anarchic sense of humor and the willingness to lovingly goof around with the source material. However, LEGO LoTR is oddly restrained. Maybe it's because it not only follows the story of the film series, but uses actual audio clips in doing so, that the sense of playing around with the material isn't there like it is with the other LEGO games, such as the silent Star Wars and Indiana Jones games. Maybe it was an intentional design choice. The humor is still there, but it's just not there in the same laugh out loud way that previous games in the series had.\n\nStill, the game is fun to play. There's a wide range of characters, but the addition of the Mithril Treasures that allow any character to have the powers of any other character in some ways means that you won't be playing as quite so many characters in free play. Quite literally, once you've got the Mithril Treasures, you can play as a single character in Free Play and accomplish every task without switching out your character.\n\nPretty much every character of note in the film series makes their way into the game, as well as some that only found their way into the Extended Edition footage. There's also some that never made it out of pre-production, like the love-him-or-hate-him Tom Bombadil. I am not a giant LoTR fanboy but I consider myself decently familiar with the source material both in film and book form, and even I'll admit that there were several characters I had to go to an LoTR wiki to remember who they were. The film's locations are also recreated on a small scale but are instantly recognizable. The details are appreciated especially as the game has an extensive overworld with a lot of secrets and quests to complete.\n\nIf you're a veteran of the LEGO games looking to get your fix, or a big huge fan of LoTR (particularly the film series), I'd recommend this title. If you've never played a LEGO game, you may want to start with another title in the series to figure out whether they're your cup of tea before you pick this one up.","February 20, 2014","true","44.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having the whole Middle Earth to explore was amazing and as a fan of the book it was nice to have characters that werent in the movies to interact with.  If you are a fan of the movies, the book, or LEGOs in general, pick this one up.  It also has a decent play time to complete everything (about 30 hours).

It's definitely Lord of the Rings, with the strong story, setting and atmosphere - and yet its all Lego, with the silliness and sandbox gameplay you come to expect.\n\nThe map is brilliant - much better than hanging around in the Cantina or the Batcave, you can roam around all of Middle Earth while you're not doing missions.  The addition of quests is very nice, as is the additional puzzles outside of the combat playgrounds.\n\nInstead of episodic gameplay, this game manages to keep the transitions from being jarring between gameplay modes, which helps keep the illusion in place that its one seamless epic.\n\nGreat game!","January 6, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember buying this game from Amazon for $7(Thanks to Tony) and after hearing from people that Lego games were very childish and no fun, I wasn't planning on enjoying the game at all. After playing the game for an hour, I noticed they used voiceovers from the actual movies and not some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice actor. In all honesty the voiceover saved this game. It was surprising how good they made this game, since everything is made out of Lego. If you are a die hard LOTR fan consider adding this game to your collection. The game covers the whole LOTR trilogy. Contains all the epic battles such as Mines of Moria, Borromir fight/death scene, Golem/Smeagol, trolls, rivendell, Helms deep etc. They also have the right names for the weapons as well as all the major cities. The game is detailed as ♥♥♥♥, I do not think the children that play this game could even pronounce the names. If you have a XBOX 360 controller it would be easier to play. One play through took me around 12hrs to beat the game. Thats skipping all the side missiond and trying to unlock all the LOTR characters. After you beat the main story line, you can go back to the game a free roam with the characters you unlocked and do the side quests, that would probably add another 10-15hrs of gameplay. This is the first game I beat in my Steam library and it feels good to be my first(cherry is popped). All in all good game. Giving this game a 8.5/10\n\nCONS: They cut out some things that bothered me. They cut out the Aragorn and Arwen sex scene, Arwen did not come out as much as the movie. Arwen is hot. No one smoked leaf in the ♥♥♥♥ing game making cool boat shaped smoke. Gandalf and bilbo never got high together.","January 28, 2013","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","8"

I can't say I'm a fan of the Lord of the Rings movie series, and I only purchased this game because of the LEGO association and the fact that it was on a super sale, along with the Marvel Super Hero's game and some DLC.\n\nOnce you pick up your controller (Big screen mode, with a 360 wireless controller), it is pretty damn difficult to stop playing.  There is an ever so slight element of RPG going on, and it fits in nicely.  I am hoping the next Tt game will feature more of the questing style, and add more elemental style play.  A dumbed down Final Fantasy, much like Pokemon to a degree, but with the lego characters and humour.\n\nWould I recommend this?  For sure i would!  I bought it yesterday and have racked up about 10 hours already!  I do play as a bit of a collector though.  I need to get as many lego buttons as I possibly can for some reason.... Ever since I played the first LEGO star wars game on my DS Lite.\n\nIt could really do with a LOT of trading cards though.  Imagine all the characters as a separate card?  150 odd cards, having say 8 drops per person, this could be a HUGE micro transaction spinner for Steam or Tt or whoever cashes in on the trading cards.....

It is a blast to play through and I really enjoyed the light hearted take on the series. The story is told very concisely and almost assumes you have seen the films (it is definitely based on the films not the books). If you have no knowledge of LOTR I would not recommend the game.\n\nMy one main gripe would be lack of fast travel system. Once I finished the game the map was opened up to me and I saw Tom Bombadil was labeled. I had to go see him and I spent about 10 minutes running in his direction on foot as no horses were nearby. After almost getting there I triggered a separate minigame which sent me all the way back to where I began when I finished. I still never bothered to go back to find jolly Tom.","November 13, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actually, I was disappointed I didn’t grab The Hobbit-LEGO while it was on sale too. (I bought it the second the title went on sale again, since LEGO titles seem to go on sale pretty often.)\n\nWhat first sold me was watching the re-created movie cut scenes with the twist of LEGO humor. There’s about an hour and a half worth of cut scenes, which are definitely not a waste of time. The “voice acting” is audio clips from the movies so it’s obviously spot on. And the music consists of the same majestic scores you hear in the movies, making simple tasks like lighting a fire 1000x more epic.\n\nIf you’re going for 100% completion on the game, it’s going to take time: probably 30-40 hours. I’ve logged 37 hours and I’m at 82% completion, but I do mess around.\n\nYou get to unlock pretty much every conceivable character mentioned in the movies (and some from the books, like Tom Bombadil) which allows you do things like  ride a sheep around the Shire as Sauron.  Now tell me that didn’t make a “Thank you for your purchase!” email arrive in your inbox. The entire world of Middle Earth is your sandbox.\n\nAs a side note, I definitely suggest using a controller. The controls are pretty wonky and unnatural if you want to stay true to keyboard/mouse.\n\nReally the only drawbacks would be (1) that you don’t have much control over the camera angles, which makes some areas hard to navigate, but those instances are minimal. (2) The fact that since it is a game made for a controller, it’s a “one button does everything” control system so you’ll definitely end up dropping an object instead of using it a few times. And finally (3) if you’re an achievement hunter, there’s a couple buggy achievements, so I suggest you seek out a guide to overcome them.\n\nBut all and all, it’s a great game if you want to kick back, enjoy Middle Earth, and hit things with a frying pan ‘till money bursts out. Oh, did I mention that there’s a “Mithril Disco Phial” that plays a remix song of famous LOTR quotes that your characters rock out to?\n\nYeah, just buy it.","January 29, 2015","true","39.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is full of tiny glitches like giving me too many minikits, graphical glitches from hell, sliding of balance-beams (Many puzzles involve these which makes it hard but not impossible), enemies getting stuck or pathfinder breaking, getting stuck behind ♥♥♥♥, some random crashes.\n\nBut the content is so god damn good that I will keep playing until I get 100% because I love it's sorry ♥♥♥. It's full of that heart and soul of LEGO games but don't buy it unless you're prepared to restart a level or 10  because of a glitch.","October 26, 2015","false","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
