While I enjoyed ar-k 1 and 2 and I do recommend those games to play first, this for me is a lot better - story, graphics, setting.  The writing was very good and if you didn't want to read everything, you didn't need to click on that character's bit of conversation but could come back to it if you wanted.  I liked the humour, and it was witty in parts.  It is the perfect balance of not just a good story which is vital in an adventure game but also good interactive gameplay.\n\nYou continue to play as Alicia and thankfully she is more likable.  In the first episode the OTT "I am a sexy vixen" coupled with a not nice attitude a lot of the times frankly put me off her and I didn't care what happened to her, but by the end of E1 this was mostly gone and here I actually cared and liked her.\n\nThe story continues from 1 & 2 and I loved how at the end of episodes there is just enough surprise or hook to keep you invested for the next epsiode, it is literally a cliffhanger ending (not resolved or tied up with bow) with all of them and this episode is the same.\n\nI love the setting in this game (all new) and I got to solve a murder as well which was cool.  There is also a transporter map so you aren't wasting time walking everywhere.\n\nWhile you could play this on it's own I do think there would be too many unanswered questions (what is the sphere, why am I here etc) and I do think you need to play the first game (which has episodes 1& 2 in it) to know what is going on.  There is a video intro at the beginning which is supposed to recap what has happened but I don't know why but the clips seemed out of sequence, and they could have done a lot better job of a recap, seemed very disjointed.\n\nI loved the achievements in the first game, very imaginative and different but here it was mostly straightforward and some more unusual ones would have been fun.  There is one though which I didn't see the point of and will be a bit annoying to do (worker one,)  - so don't go by my final time re gameplay!\n\nThoroughly enjoyed it and I really look forward to the fourth and final episode.   Thanks DEVS for a very good, fun point n click adventure game.","July 17, 2015","true","18.4"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","30","32","0","6"

DO NOT buy the first two episodes which are bundled together in AR-K. Unless you are a completionist that must have a complete series, really don't play the first two. This game begins with a "Previously on AR-K" and shows you all the cut scenes and dialogs from the last two episodes that you need to know. 6 hours you could waste on the first two episodes are summed up in a couple of minutes.\nNow the good stuff: EVERYTHING I felt that made the first two episodes bad has been fixed. My compliments to the developers who know when to correct mistakes. The characters are much much more likable, the puzzles, while sometimes needing some thought, are not nonsensical. I didn't find this episode boring at all, and all the side missions served a definite purpose. The game looks great! I love how the colors pop. The voice acting is also great.\nBelieve it or not, I really can't think of any jarring negatives. This episode was a giant leap forward. If anything, this is the quality that should have been present in the first two episodes. It set up Episode 4 perfectly, and I can't wait to play it!\n","November 5, 2015","true","5.1"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","41","51","0","6"

If I did was becuse of the 73% discount, and I must say it was a great deal.\n\nAnyone can see the graphics are much better just comparing the screenshots, the gameplay was also improved (they took off that annoying inventory and made a better one), animations, STORY... Everything is much better than the first episodes. They really learned something about how to make a point-and-click game.\n\nI'm really enjoying the story, in my opinion it's the most important part in a game like this. First chapters were too simple and a little boring, and the solution for a couple of puzzles was a real nonsense. This game is absolutely different, has a few characters that are GOLD (don't miss Phil the scientist, the little girl or Horn), balanced puzzles (some simpler and a few more complex) and a lot of hints about ARK that the first chapters lacked.\n\nThe game looks quite simple in the first scenes, but after the factory it brings a lot of different scenarios and interesting puzzles (I specially liked the murder). I would recomend the game even if you don't buy the first two chapters, this one alone is a great game (in fact, I would reccomend not to buy the first chapters).\n\nOf course, it's not perfect, has a few flaws:\nThe "previously" video, that plays when you start the game is simply terrible. Long, boring and annoying. I think it's the heritance of the first part. The good news are that things can only go better from here.\n\nThe first screen has too many videos, the hospital has too much talking. After that the game finds the perfect balance, but I feel like these two scenes could be a little better.\n\nCardesians voices are soooo annoying!\nAnyway, these are just a few cons that can't make this game bad. I think this is one of the best adventures I played in the last few years.\n\nGood work, keep it for the 4th chapter!!","July 16, 2015","true","5.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

I liked the first parts, too, but this really was excellent.\n\nThe graphics, dialogues and voice acting are all really first class. The gameplay mechanics have been greatly improved since the first game, as have the graphics (though I thought they were fine in the first game, too).\n\nThe biggest stand-out feature of the game is the humour - there are some lines that really made me laugh out loud. One of those lines is in the second scene - completely unexpected and hilarious.\n\nThe story gets really engaging and interesting now, and the supporting characters are a lot more involved in the story.\n\nThere are great twists and turns, and it's very well-structured.\n\nI highly recommend this game and am looking forward to the next parts!","July 20, 2015","true","4.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

It's a bit disappointing that the dev felt the need to switch to individual installments purchased separately rather than the episodic format of the first two games, but this game is an improvement in almost every aspect over the other two. To be honest, you could probably skip the first two episodes without much trouble and drop right in at The Great Escape and still have a great experience.\n\nThe story overall was interesting and had much more of a sense of direction to it. The story that the game is telling is nothing new in the sci-fi genre, but it's told well. Most of the characters are interesting and fun, and Alicia (the protagonist) is fleshing out to become a more likable character.\n\nVoice acting is mostly great, all actors deliver their lines with believable emotion. However, the actors could have used a bit more direction in terms of pronouncing names and made-up terms correctly (the name of Franky's species comes to mind) so that the world feels a little more real. Additionally, the humour sometimes gets a little too self-referential (the conversation with the little girl about "female characters", the guy who tells you to "wait for Chapter Four") and there was one kind of unnecessary joke where the punch line is a male character disguising himself as a woman that might bother some people.\n\nI enjoyed most of the puzzles a lot, particularly a great logic puzzle near the end (however the text in this puzzle could use a little native speaker proofreading). Most of the time I felt like I knew what I was doing and why, which is really all I ask.","July 26, 2015","true","3.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

In the first two installments, they established the setting and characters, though the game mechanics were not polished. The puzzles were troublesome more on account of a clumsy user interface, though this was in addition to the puzzles being somewhat obscure (i.e., just keep rubbing items together until something works).\n\nPart 3 is a more satisfying, polished experience, in terms of plot structure, character motivations, puzzle logic, artwork, and user interface. If you want to skip parts 1 and 2, then all you need to understand for part 3 is the following:\n\n\n-- SPOILERS --\n\nThe lead character (Alicia) was framed for having stolen a golden sphere, about the size of a softball. The sphere is a piece of high technology that can hold an electric charge. The origins of the sphere are unknown, though more is revealed in part 3.\n\nAlicia has a love interest (Blaine) that works for a corporation that has an interest in the golden sphere.\n\nBlaine has an ex-love interest whom also works for the corporation.\n\nAlicia has a friend, Franky, who is essentially an alien minotaur. Though Franky was a minor supporting character in parts 1 and 2, he takes on a more important role in part 3.","July 18, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Unlike previous 2 episodes in AR-K series, puzzles and dialogs are, with maybe one or two exceptions quite logical and provided clues generally lead to sucessful solutions. Graphics and voice over and quite enjoyable and huge improvement over the first 2 episodes.\n\nThe big question is weather great escape is worth the money. On its own, probably not as it provides only 3-4 hours worth of narrative. However if you are willing to grind your teeth trough some poorly designed puzzles in episones 1&2, the total of 10E for all three is worth the investment. And if episode 3 is any indication, episode 4 finale should provide redemption for the series as whole.\n","December 6, 2015","true","3.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
