It is also a game I have played on and off for over 9 years now.\n\nYou get to be a pirate, and you perform your tasks(Sailing, carpentry, navigation, swordfighting and many more) by playing puzzles. The puzzles done interact with eachother, making it a unique challenge to run a functional ship together with others. While you can play it for the social aspect of puzzling together and having a great pillage among friends, it is equally possible to just puzzle on your own, or to join easily accessible pickup groups('Jobbing') just for the puzzling.\nSadly, due to its age it is now unlikely that you'll find a large amount of people - An issue in any social game.\n\nWith your rewarded or pillaged money you can buy outfits for your pirate, customising your pants, hat, shirt and boots with plenty of different clothing and colour options - As well as allowing you to buy a fancy house, paint it, furnish it, and just have yourself a humble abode, a shack, or a magnificent mansion. The customisation in the game is excellent, with many years of content to keep you busy furnishing, clothing, painting and customising every bit of your pirate, house and if you have the money even your ships.\nBut sadly, you won't be able to do too much with it, as the ingame economy has almost wrecked itself. This game has a very good economy model, with supply and demand, freight trips, and commodities being produced and moved all by players, fashioned into their end products by players, and bought by players. However, to deliver anything but the most basic of goods you need to pay a delivery cost. There are two currencies, Pieces of Eight(PoE), and Dubloons. PoE are the money of the world, you get PoE from your pillaging, from working for the navy, and as payment for labour(Also a puzzle!), and Dubloons, a currency you can only buy with physical money from your own wallets outside of the game.\n\nOf course, nothing is ever truly fully free, is it? There are two kinds of servers for Puzzle Pirates. The first is a subscription ocean, where you have to pay a monthly fee to have access to just about anything(But you do get to play and puzzle for free as an unlimited trail), the economy on there is actually pretty decent, but if you aren't subscribed and do not plan to subscribe you will be locked out from a large amount of content. The other is dubloon oceans, where you are free to play - But you need dubloons to deliver anything more fancy than a broken crate and a bedroll, and you need to buy badges with dubloons to unlock content such as anything rank based in your crew(Read: Pirate version of a guild/group), Sea Monster Hunting, and playing some of the puzzles and parlor games(All shipboard working puzzles are always free. On-shore labour and parlor games are free only a few days a week depending on the specific puzzle).\nLuckily, dubloons can be bought using PoE in a market system, so you can technically get everything without ever paying anything for a dubloon but your ingame currencies. Sadly, this means that you will need to spend -A LOT- to get them. As demand for them is set incredibly high, with almost everything of any note costing you dubloons and a large part of the remaining playerbase being rich their prices have gone up to nearly 4000 PoE. To give that some context, you gain about 20 for an average performance with the NPC navy for one league point, on a trip that lasts 20 or so minutes. At this rate, you have korean MMO levels of grinding just to be able to afford the basics for your pirate, and it is not at all uncommon for an item's cost in PoE to be negligible compared to the dubloon costs. Dubloon costs for everything has sunk the economy for all but a few, but at least the puzzles themselves are enjoyable, even if the MMO part of the game is a mess.\nAs long as you have your expectations right this is not a problem, with well designed puzzles you can surely find ways to enjoy yourself\nEdit: I wrote a guide to help you enjoy the game, all the way at the bottom\n\nAs you might tell from the economy bit up there, it is not very friendly to newcomers, mostly thanks to the prices becoming impossible. Aside from that though, it is a very friendly game and easy to pick up. Easy controls, easy to learn but difficultt o master puzzles and an appealing artstyle are part of the draws. The population on server is friendly, helpful, and tries their best to enjoy a good game, but without reaching for your wallet it is unlikely that you will ever get far these days - And if you plan to make your own crew you are out of luck as this is one of the most expensive (in dubloons) things one can do. In addition, if you do not buy dubloons or subscribe, you have around 6 weeks since your last login to come back. Else your pirate will be deleted.\n\nAs amusing as the chatfilter is with pirate-y-fying your swears, and as amusing as the puzzles are, as friendly as the community on server are, and as satisfying it is to build up your home and move somewhere bigger over countless pillages, Puzzle pirates is on a straight track to the cliff of abandonned old games and nobody seems to know if the developer has plans to slow down and save it, or given up hope to just let it fall while hoping to get some final payments out of it for dubloons.\nIf you do join the game, please get on the Emerald Ocean, it's getting lonelier by the day\n\nEdit: A guide to get you started\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=115409864\n\nEdit2: A guide by me on how to make the best of a dubloon ocean\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495957446","June 11, 2015","true","358.6"," 52 of 55 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","52","55","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CartoonJessie/recommended/99910/","CartoonJessie","CartoonJessie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CartoonJessie/","25 products in account","First of all, let me state by saying that I used to love this game. About ten years ago or so, I played this daily, was part of a nice crew (Eowyn's crew, in case anyone remembers those days of old), and I puzzled my weekends away. For those days, this MMO was one of the best to play on old computers, there was always tons of stuff to do.\n\nNowadays though, islands and ships are deserted.\n\nI always felt that after they introduced Poker, the game just got worse. You had some people winning millions with poker and if you went on a Sea Monster Hunt for hours in a row, you would be lucky to get 5K and a few nice items (that were probably old...)\n\nI really enjoyed the puzzles though. I was amazing at Carpenting, pretty decent at Bilging and Sailing too. I sucked at Navigating though and never got more than a "good" on that puzzle.\n\nTo me it just feels like the economy of the game has been completely messed up after Poker was introduced, and I'm not surprised that hardly anyone is playing this anymore.\n\nIt was a GREAT game though. If I had a dozen friends who would play with me, I might go and try again, so that we could fill up a sloop and plunder. But on your own, it's hard to find a good crew. *sighs*\n\nI am sad, cause I used to love puzzling in this game, but it just feels like a big waste of time nowadays.","October 17, 2015","false","5.7"," 51 of 61 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","51","61","4","1"

Lose at poker, and that money could go towards your enemy's funds for blockading your island. Everything you do can (and will) have an impact on the world.\n\nThere's a real sense of achievement when you continue the game - you start as a pirate with a bandana, a few clothes, a flimsy foil sword, and you can end up the ruler of an island in a month. There's no real skill level grinding, due to the rating system that rewards natural puzzling skill. The game is fuelled by it's vibrant system of crews and flags, supported by the sense of close community - after all, you can't sail a big ship on your own. The economy is fairly deep, and it is nearly entirely ran by the people who play the game. Need some sugar cane for your distillery? Order it from an island and ship it in, or wait for someone to do it for you.\n\nThe game is filled with colour, and the cartoon design adds a nice friendly touch, the games are addictive and fairly plentiful. The range of things you can do as a pirate is massive once you get in to it. A really fun and addictive game. :)","June 8, 2014","true","346.2"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","33","34","0","0"

Clipper ships and war brigs sail the seas, crewed by all manner of scalawags and sailors. Islands populate the landscape, inhabited by numerous seafaring folk. Like most any MMO, the populace of Puzzle Pirates has to earn its keep by performing assorted labor tasks, like being part of the crew on a ship or taking on assorted tasks for businesses while on land. However, you don't run around killing monsters or collecting rare items like you would in most any MMORPG. Instead, you perform your work via puzzles, and each one is uniquely tailored to the task you're charged with.\n\nFor instance, when on land, you can opt to take a job with an apothecary, a distiller, or a shipwright, among others. If you choose the apothecary, you'll see several orders for potions and concoctions that have been placed by actual players in the community. The puzzle itself revolves around rotating a number of pipes leading from colored jars at the top of the screen to a position where they'll pour out into color-coded vials at the bottom. You can create combos to up your rank, but if you screw up, you'll break your jar. Even though you can just play the puzzle as it is without even worrying about the available orders, you'll earn more money and a higher rank by filling the orders. Every task is just like this, featuring a unique type of puzzle that fits the type of work you're doing, and essentially providing you with a way to perpetuate the economy. You earn money for your work; you help a local business fill its orders; and you help other players get the items they want.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates is just about the easiest thing in the world to boot up and play. The game starts up instantly and quits out just as easily. It runs on basically any machine, from a high-end PC to a Mac to even a Linux box. Granted, this is because this is just a Java client that doesn't take up more than a hundred megabytes on your hard drive. Make no mistake; Puzzle Pirates isn't bad looking at all. The puzzles all have a nice look to them, and you'll see an appreciably precious art style while you're wandering around a ship or island. Because of the game's visual limitations, you won't find anything especially impressive. However, the visuals are just fine for what they need to be here.\n\nOverall a nice little game and is also free so there is no reason not to try it.","July 31, 2014","true","10.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

I found this more of a time waster, but I have to appreciate the game throughout the years. If you plan to pick up this game and randomly play for fun, it'll be a fun experience for sure, especially if you meet up with people on this game. (You'll be surprised of how many adults play this game.) There hasn't been a real disappointment for me, except for restarting because I lost my account information.\n\nIf you plan to pick up this game as serious play, then you'll be disappointed because there are tons of islands, resources, and places that are outdated and needs to be refreshed. This game has only been patched for various updaes, but never had any real work under the hood, because I still remember people's houses, shops, and various things still existing several years down the road and they're abandoned now.

Multiple!\n\nMinuses:\n- a fee in Doubloons for most of items you can buy (see the last paragraph)\n\n\nAt first I installed it for the puzzles. When I first opened the game, I couldn't stop myself from whistling along to the intro music. And then it was only better.\nThe atmosphere of the game is admirable. The music and sounds are nice and not distracting, graphics are nice to watch. The world is wide and there's plenty to do - you can sail on different kinds of voyages, run a workshop, take care of your house. Things are generally cutomizable, starting at your clothes and ending at your ship, when you earn enough for one. The variety of puzzels is wide enough not to get bored. Your character is constantly developing and you can see the progress as your reputation and trophy board grow. And last but not least, people. There are gamers of all ages and from all corners of the world, so for kid's sake there are some manners enforced, but not to the point where it could destroy the "piratness" of the atmosphere. Players are generally helpful, newbies can ask any question and get a solid answer.\n\nThe only minus are doubloons. In game you earn Pieces of Eight which are used to buy things. Problem is that you also have to pay a fee in doubloons, which is usually 3-4 times higher than the prize of an item itself. You can exchange PoE for them, but the course is really high - about 3000:1, when on an average pillying you earn a bit less than that. Or... you can buy them for green cash. So if you decide to start the game, be prepared that either you'll pay, or spend the first week of playing on earning for a decent bed. Despite that, you can still play quite freely if you're just there for the puzzels and sailing.","January 29, 2015","true","78.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I downloaded it on Friday night, played it for most of Saturday and a fair portion of Sunday... now I'm about to go back on for the start of my bank holiday Monday. It's first and foremost a roleplay game, where you have a character. You can get to all of the features without paying any cash if you're sensible and patient, which suits those of us in austerity-stricken Britain.\nAll of the tasks in the game are represented by addictive little minigame puzzles - so when you want to repair your ship, it's a fill-in-the-holes puzzle, when you're in a sword fight it's a "send things to your opponent's board" Tetris-type game... all the puzzles are imaginative and varied, keeping the pirate theme quite well.\nMy one complaint is the screen resolution. It runs in 800x600 and always in a window, with no scaling options. On a 1680x1050 monitor, that makes it pretty small. Even if the game's native resolution stayed the same, a little upscaling algorithm and full-screen option would be awesome.","May 2","true","49.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It may seem like a kids game with the graphics and such, but it is reach in depth and detail. You can do anything from owning your own home to working an hourly job to pay for upgrades. Joining a crew and building relationships with other people is a big benefit to this game. Everyone works together to reach their goals on the vessel which is accumulating as much loot as possible on a single voyage. Your personal ability benefits all the other players around you so you really do have to work together and can easily become an asset to other pirates and captains. All of the puzzles are challenging and provide hours of gameplay. The best part for me is that it has steam achievements which is awesome for a free game. I recommend this game to everyone who loves puzzle games and pirates.","December 30, 2013","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On one hand if you're not feeling adventurous you can complete the puzzles mediocrely and your crew will get by just fine, however if you're in the mood for showing off - or if your ship is being attacked by ravenous pirates - the puzzles have a rating system based on how quickly you solve them and also how many points you aquire.\n\nThe only let down is that a lot of the content is locked unless you put some money into it, however it is possible to buy these things with in-game currency.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game even if it was not F2P.","December 31, 2013","true","30.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has quite a bit of age to it but thats what made it the game it is today, 100% driven by the community game. Probably the best economical player ran system I've ever seen in a game. All the shops are player ran and even the islands are owned by players, pretty much if there are no players, this game wouldn't be what it is today, I feel like a revamped graphics engine is way overdue, as is a new president. I've played this game since Who knows how many years ago, But the thing in this game to watch out for is if you make money don't blow it all in poker, although it is very tempting.    That is what I have done over the years, make a little bit of money on a pilly, going out with a crew as a jobber and making 2k or lessish, make up to like 10k in poker, then either make up to 70k, which at that point you either spend a little bit of money on stuff you actually need and lose the rest in poker or Make it big time in poker then get an extremely good hand and go allin but the guy next to you does the same thing but he has a barely slightly better hand than you then he wins all your money and says "Aye, sorry mate" (Which btw, people in this game love to RP, Its done everywhere, infact its frowned upon if you dont talk in a pirate accent.) Then you start over with zero money which at that point you either repeat or rage and come back to the game in a couple of days.","March 2","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't know when it came to Steam but I always forget to load it through here when I decide to play. Hence the little time Steam thinks I've put into this game. I won't claim to play too much recently, but it is still a game I can come back to and pick up in no time and enjoy myself.\n\nFor most purposes it is still the same game it was when I started, some massive overhauls to features and many new minigame additions have occured but it is still the same base game. Think of Puzzle Pirates as a game full of minigames where sailing a ship is a compilation of various stations with different games each with different goals (get it, PUZZLE Pirates). There are easy to learn minigames that you can enter the game and pick up quickly but enough intricate details and strategies in each and some harder minigames to master to strive to be the best on the Ocean. There are some competitive 'PvP' (not to kill but you can bet money) minigames for direct competition steaming from a simple swordfight to a ship battle with cannons ending in a sword fight or rumble minigame (note the minigame word you will not run at another pirate with a sword or your fists).\n\nThere is a quirk, as with any able to be free to play game, to encourage spending real money to make things in game easier to obtain. These are not neccessary to buy by any means and can be obtained in game for in game money, though it takes work and it based on the player market. The game is fully playable and enjoyable without spending any real life money and (I believe) every item can be obtained in game without having to spend real money.\n\nEight years later and I still enjoy this game, I only sporadically play it because it's hard not to play for hours once you start. I can go on about this game and do a full review but who wants to read that?\n\nIt's a free to play game, why not at least try it?","March 12, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was java based. I played this game in 2005 til about 06. It was one of those I used to take away from WoW(Back then things were much different). I'd puzzle and hang out with people. Got a girlfriend to play it, broke up with her. Faced her crew in a blockade and sunk her ship.\n\nAll to say this, the game WAS fun. However, it should have sank a long time ago. The subscriber oceans(Business model much like the current Sub games) is dead. There were 2 and they were well populated, now they are 1 and the last tally I did had 70 players on it... that's 1.2 islands to each player.\n\nThe dubloon oceans(The F2P counterparts) are still active but pulling in 1/5th the numbers they used too. And most of those are people searching for people who used to play the game and finding no one.\n\nThis Jolly Roger should be retired. It's sailed more than it's fair share of lasts.","January 30","false","0.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

That said, you can still do some of the basics without paying. But BE WARNED: the company requires you to pay money to them or have your account deleted after 6 weeks of inactivity, no matter how many ships and items you have on your character. I paid and was still deleted, lost an entire clan and ships.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game for the following reasons:\n- Account uncertainty\n- The need more microtransactions\n- The pure repetitious gameplay\n- Questionable community\n\nThe first is explained above. The issue with microtransactions is that they are around every corner. Some things can be purchased with in-game currency but not much and the amount of grind to just get a "badge" for 30 days saying you can play a feature in the game is ridiculous.\n\nWhich leads into my next point: repetition. In order to get anywhere you need to up your skills, which in turn means you are playing the exact same tetris puzzle over and over and over again. It's so mind numbing it actually starts to become physically painful. You get the idea.\n\nFinally we have the community. If the repetition and wallet-poking don't run you off, you might be ok with the community. The players in game are an odd mix, comprised of the following demographics:\n\na) Those that will talk to you and try to recruit you\nb) Those that ignore chat or are too stupid to use it\nc) Trolls\nd) Jerks and all-around unreliable people who take up a slot on your crew and then disappear\n\n\nI'm sorry guys, I love pirate games and sandbox games but this isn't worth the trouble. It's garbage for many reasons. I don't even know why I bothered writing a review for it, you can easily install it and find out for yourselves.

The more you try to get involved, the higher ranks you reach, the more it becomes your prison! The game itself is awesome with smart puzzles for various pirate duties, but... Be very careful if you play this. I used to play too and I got in serious trouble. If you want to lead your own pillages, navigate in sea battles and such, you need to become an officer, but there's where your trouble begins: going for a pillage requires a very long time usually and you can't leave your ship in the middle really, very bad idea. Then there's the whole political part: responsibility for the crew, having to come online regularily and do pillages so your crew can earn money with you. Voting on issues, later perhaps running your own businesses to help you gather necessary supplies or make money: this requires following the constantly changing prices, often trade missions to transport resources between islands...

Sadly though this game isnt as popular as it used to be. There are still a ton of things to do but not as much as it used to be. Used to i would sail with some pretty enormous ships on blockades and now there are only a few that do them. You could always meet some pretty cool people too on there just hanging around the outside of the Inn or town center but now you are lucky if you see the occasional person walking by. Dont get me wrong its still a fun puzzle game but its just becoming less popular :/","September 29, 2014","true","45.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Pls release for Xbox One and PS4 too.\n\nI just bought the new Call of Duty (AW) and this game has still taken up most of my time. The distilling mini game is the epitome of human progress thus far. Who needs 3D graphics, DirectX 11, or any of that stuff. I literally sold my GTX 660 ($200) because this game doesn't need it. I actually installed Windows 95 because it runs perfectly on it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roger10/recommended/99910/","Roger10","[Nighty] Roger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roger10/","266 products in account","Puzzle Pirates has been a longrunning game which has almost been around for a decade from what I recall, either way.\n\nPuzzle Pirates is a game orienting on the exploration of a virtual sea world in which you will plunder, hunt (and potentially bet thousands if you're a poker player). Last time I had played this game was in 2009 and it is still familiar to me with barely any extreme changes that would put me off, the game itself is nowhere near Pay-2-Play and is entirely F2P as the economy relies on people who pay into the game. Gameplay itself is quite simple and revolves around minigames to either gain money, prowess or for fun.\n\nEither way I recommend this to anyone who is wanting to play a simple F2P game and you have time aside to get accustomed to the game.","December 8, 2014","true","45.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaximoDP/recommended/99910/","MaximoDP","Admiral Auschwitz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaximoDP/","419 products in account","it is the most romantic film that has ever been made about a nervous lady getting slapped all over the place by a millionaire hunk that is right it is the erotic comedy thriller that is called 50 shades of grey. this morning when it was the morning time i went to see 50 shades of grey on my own at the cinema for a romantic treat for myself to help get me in a valentines day mood and as soon as the film starts it shows ana who is the main girl in the film going to do a interview with a man who is called christian grey who is a millionaire ex model hunk because she is doing a essay about millionaire ex model hunks for her college course and when ana gets to christians office she starts feeling dead nervous because of how much of a hunk he is and the camera does loads of close up slow motion shots of her biting her bottom lip and licking her chin from all different types of angles and my best bit in the whole of the film is when christian says to ana that he wants to show her something and ana says so show me then and christian does a half smile and he slowly walks over to a hidden door that is in his office and he tells ana to come closer to see what is behind it and as ana steps through the hidden door she looks around the room and she sees that it is completely filled with thousands of sausages tied to the ceiling from stings and christian looks at ana and he says this is my playroom i wanted you to see it and ana turns to christian and she stares into his eyes and she can see the reflection of thousands of uncooked sausages shining back at her and it was almost as if she was having a look into 2 tiny butchers windows and then all of a sudden christian does a really high pitch screaming laugh and then he starts running underneath all of the sausages with his mouth wide open and he starts dipping all of the sausages into his mouth like he is having a quick taste of each and every one of them and ana just stares at him watching his every move and she can feel herself tingling with excitement and after about 15 minutes of watching him she cant even contain herself anymore so she starts running around the room doing the same and then after watching them dipping the sausages into their mouths for about 45 minutes they both go to grab the same sausage at exactly the same time and their lips meet and they share their first kiss together under the blanket of dangling meat and at that very moment the whole of the world stopped just for them and then christian gently puts his fingers next to anas mouth and he says i wont do you no harm and ana says ok and she closes her eyes and she slowly puts christians fingers inside of her mouth and then she just starts swallowing his arm like she has been possessed by a erotic snake and christian says what the hell are you doing and ana trys to say i thought that you told me to swallow your arm and christian shouts no i said i wont do you no harm and then he starts screaming oh my god please god stop it please you are crushing my arm and as he trys to pull his arm out of anas mouth her throat just gobbles it back up even more like it has got a mind of its own and before they could even call for help ana had swallowed christians arm right up to his shoulder and then after them struggling for ages to get christians arm out of anas mouth christians whole body starts turning completely grey and that is why the film is called 50 shades of grey and then right at the end of the film there is a slow motion shot of ana lying on the floor with christians lifeless grey body hanging out of her mouth and it really is such a beautiful ending to such a romantic film so if you want to feel a extra slice of spice this valentines day then this is definitely the only film that you need to see.","February 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","1"

These bodies were lightly sprinkled with lime, not for the purposes of destroying them, but for the purpose of removing the stench.\n\nWhen the shed was full--I presume its capacity to be about 200, the bodies were taken to a pit a mile from the camp where they were buried. The inmates claimed that 3,000 men, who had been either shot in the head or who had died of starvation, had been so buried since the 1st of January.\n\nWhen we began to approach with our troops, the Germans thought it expedient to remove the evidence of their crime. Therefore, they had some of the slaves exhume the bodies and place them on a mammoth griddle composed of 60-centimeter railway tracks laid on brick foundations. They poured pitch on the bodies and then built a fire of pinewood and coal under them. They were not very successful in their operations because there was a pile of human bones, skulls, charred torsos on or under the griddle which must have accounted for many hundreds.","December 3, 2013","false","0.5"," 12 of 36 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","12","36","0","0"

Was having lots of fun here till work took over all my time. Never a dull moment!\n\nBack recently to play again. So many types of puzzles to play alone or with others. Play as a group, fight each other, lead a team... plenty of adventure to embark with like-minded players. Anybody can play but not everybody can play excellent or get to be the ultimate one.\n\nDon't be in a hurry to frown upon the idea of trying puzzles. It takes lots of strategising. I find it a good challenge to ace the different puzzles. Show off your puzzle skills in the extensive trophy collection.\n\nI guess pirates like to gamble, so theres always card games on board! Oh I know pirates who loved to go shopping after payday for nice clothes and grab a lovely portrait with fella pirates and loved ones ;p Which reminds me, make enough money playing puzzles and u dont just own your own fleet, u can buy this dream house or houses and fill it with luxury furnitures...\n\nSo much to do.

You'd think this is a kids game at first glance, but it's much more complex, which is a good thing. The game contains a myriad of puzzles, which are all easy to learn, but difficult to master. I've played for a while before, and am playing now, but still haven't found a puzzle which I am good at, just mediocre. An expansive economy is also a part of this game. Puzzles earn you pieces of eight, which are the basic currency of the game. These can be used to buy items such as clothes, weapons, ships, houses, and even commodities for player-owned shop stalls. You can have a shop stall and earn money that way if you don't fancy a life of adventure, or you can trade commodities with other shops. If you're really good, you can even own and govern a whole island. All in all, a very fun and time-absorbing game, with challenging puzzles and a nicely made economic system.","July 21, 2014","true","70.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Play as a group, fight each other, lead a team... plenty of adventure to embark with like-minded players. Anybody can play but not everybody can play excellent or get to be the ultimate one.\n\nDon't be in a hurry to frown upon the idea of trying puzzles. It takes lots of strategising. I find it a good challenge to ace the different puzzles. Show off your puzzle skills in the extensive trophy collection.\n\nI guess pirates like to gamble, so theres always card games on board! Oh I know pirates who loved to go shopping after payday for nice clothes and grab a lovely portrait with fella pirates and loved ones ;p Which reminds me, make enough money playing puzzles and u dont just own your own fleet, u can buy this dream house or houses and fill it with luxury furnitures...\n\nSo much to do.

Looking back at those days where my parents just didnt want me wasting time on silly games. In comes Puzzle Pirates, the fun family friendly game with cute pirates who puzzle and stuff.\n\nAlas those youthful days of both I and the game are passed. The game as just about all games is on its last leg as it tries to fight to keep the old members around while fewer and fewer players venture into the puzzling seas.\n\nIf your okay with a game that has a small fan base then this is it. The game in itself is still pumping strong, new puzzles and content are added reguarly howerver there just isnt new blood coming into the game.

This game is something you can be dedicated to, or just play an hour a day. Start as a crew member, pumping the water out of the ship, rigging the sails and such... Then rank up and start navigating your own ship and commanding the crew! Eventually you can own shops, houses... You can have your own guild/clan with it's rival guilds, alliances, hell, even your own island or a whole archipelago if you're good enough! Everything is player-driven and it's all just puzzles like connect 3! And the best part... You can gamble like a true pirate!\n\nThe game has micro-transactions, monthly-payment or you can buy doubloons, which makes progressing faster. It shouldn't affect the gameplay that much, I haven't had any problem with it. There are subscriber oceans and doubloon oceans.

Then rank up and start navigating your own ship and commanding the crew! Eventually you can own shops, houses... You can have your own guild/clan with it's rival guilds, alliances, hell, even your own island or a whole archipelago if you're good enough! Everything is player-driven and it's all just puzzles like connect 3! And the best part... You can gamble like a true pirate!\n\nThe game has micro-transactions, monthly-payment or you can buy doubloons, which makes progressing faster. It shouldn't affect the gameplay that much, I haven't had any problem with it. There are subscriber oceans and doubloon oceans.

That isn't to say its bad though, there's a lot of aspects to the game that keep you coming back, like its pretty big variety of puzzles and politics relating to certain areas (islands).\n\nThe game has two kinds of ways you can play, subscription based servers, and microtransaction based "doubloon" servers, needless to say, subscription servers are pretty much dead. Subscription servers allow you to pay a monthly fee to have unlimited access to everything in the game, while doubloon servers require you to pay doubloons to access parts of it. You can purchase doubloons in game or pay real money for them, but earning them in-game is pretty tedious, as doubloons cost a decent amount of gold (known as PoE, or pieces of eight). The doubloon servers are populated a bit, due to it costing no money to access all the game content,\n\nThe game has a lot of depth to it, thanks to island politics, sea adventures, and crew management, I myself can't speak on behalf of politcs, as I have never been the "king" of a flag (a political party basically), but sea adventures and crew managment really bring the game to life and add replayability. There are multiple sea adventures you can embark on (Cursed Isles, Atlantis and a couple others I forgot the names of), and usually require a crew of up to 60 people to do, but are usually plagued by AFK's (lazers), which hurts the experience.\n\nThere's a lot more to the game, but it's 3AM and I'm too tired to go through it all, perhaps I may revise this in the future.\n\nOverall I recommend this game, but dont expect a spectacular MMO, as the game has a relatively low population and high paywalls.","July 23, 2015","true","73.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything about it. I beta tested for it, many eons ago,and though I am less active now, I still recogniz the names and faces of the ocean's politics. YPP is an MMO in its own right. I hesiate to call it a role playing game, though pirate lingo is spoken freely. This is solidly a puzzle game,and until ye learn the ropes, things might be hard. Don't walk into YPP expecting to run a crew or slay a brigand king right away--you will have to spend time honing your skills before such things are even thinkable. The meat of this game is in player interaction. You don't need to bring friends, you can easily find a crew or just a job through the notice board.\n\nthe people who complain about this game are upset because the puzzles are hard--and they always will be! you cant buy anything or get any help with them: they are the same for everyone, and it is only by your own mind and eye that you will suceed here. with that in mind, remember that you dont have to be a skilled player to be and active player who has fun--we have room for all kinds of pirates.","January 24, 2014","true","110.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Using those Doubloons, you can buy a Bravery badge so that you cn go to the Newest attraction: The Kraken!\n\nAh used to loathe BNav, but after the Kraken was introduced, not only do I enjoy the experience now, but it made me a more competent BNavver during even regular encounters. There as many things to do here. Aside from the puzzles you can own shops and stalls, make Rum, Shot and Sword! Ah find one of my Passions is ship buildin. After you go make loads of Poe and Dubs, you'll have to find someway to while away the time. Ye can ave fun Flirtin and drinkin in the Inns, lots of games to be had there Poker, hearts, spades and Drinkin!\n\nThere are too many to list, but ah like to meander through the shops and look at, try on, and buy clothin to wear.

The entire game is ran by players, from the economy (you can own your own shop, from blacksmiths building swords and cannonballs to shipyards building ships) to the politics and warfare. Various player- ran crews can form a flag, wage war on another flag, and even blockade an island in hopes of capturing it for the flag.\n\nBut if you have no desire to get in to all that, there is really no need to! (Aside from the fame and wealth) Casual players alike can hop on, do a few fun puzzles (There are competitive puzzles from sword fighting another player, to loading cannonballs as the ships gunner, to navigating a ship in a tense sea battle) and make some loot.\n\nMoney (Pieces of Eight or POE) can be spent on anything you like, from fancy clothes, ships, pets, houses, swords etc.\n\nI can't reccomend this game enough if you have an interest in MMO's, Pirates, or Puzzles.","July 22, 2015","true","403.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything about it. I beta tested for it, many eons ago,and though I am less active now, I still recogniz the names and faces of the ocean's politics. YPP is an MMO in its own right. I hesiate to call it a role playing game, though pirate lingo is spoken freely. This is solidly a puzzle game,and until ye learn the ropes, things might be hard. Don't walk into YPP expecting to run a crew or slay a brigand king right away--you will have to spend time honing your skills before such things are even thinkable. The meat of this game is in player interaction. You don't need to bring friends, you can easily find a crew or just a job through the notice board.\n\nthe people who complain about this game are upset because the puzzles are hard--and they always will be! you cant buy anything or get any help with them: they are the same for everyone, and it is only by your own mind and eye that you will suceed here. with that in mind, remember that you dont have to be a skilled player to be and active player who has fun--we have room for all kinds of pirates.","January 24, 2014","true","110.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It continues to do so, now more than ever,  being a sandbox MMO that offers something no one else can.\n\nSkindeep, the game floats on dozens of different puzzles representing combat, keeping your ship seaworthy, crafting, harvesting, and just having a good time in the inns. The game is still much more deeper than that; the game is built on the shoulders of its players with a constant world heavily impacted by the politics of massive crews and flags and the entrepreneurship of individuals.\n\nThe path you choose is entirely up to you. As many will find, you will probably start off getting jobs aboard ships but this can quickly branch off into what YOU would like to do. You can continue to keep jobbing for crews or join your own doing the same thing, work at shoppes, run your own pillages as an officer in a crew, become a trader sailing island to island, become an adventurer or monster-hunter sailing to unknown dangers and looting giants, join the polticial scene among many of the top flags and crews who run a good fraction of the ocean, or even conquering entire islands owned by other players.\n\nIt's presented with a 2D setting and environment, but its very stylized and clean. The only true downside is the lack of effort put in by the developer's interest; the game has constantly taken blows due to poor management and bad decisions. You'd think a game like this would absolutley THRIVE in the current situation we are in now where puzzle and casual games rule. Alas, even Three Rings botched that up making a failure of a transition to mobile.\n\nStill, what the game truly needs is more player activity. It's a highly social, very detailed yet entirely simple game that may be the best MMO made as of yet. If you're looking for something new and fresh, that is skill-based, detailed but without a steep learning curve, easy to learn but hard to master, or simply just one of the best casual games there is, then I highly recommend this to you.","May 9, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the time this game out on Steam, I've spent maybe 10% of my total hours on the Steam client. My best guess has me at over 10,000 hours. That's well over a year of game play. Not even kidding you.\n\nThe game has been in a state of "dying" for about 5 years now. At its peak it saw 5 free servers, 2 sub servers, 2 foreign servers, and 1 kid server, with ~5,000 concurrent players daily. Now it's down to 1 sub, 2 free, and the 2 foreign servers, with ~800 daily. The Spanish and German servers are literally down to 10 people.\n\nAs a game to get started in, things are pretty daunting. There is a bit of a tutorial experience for players, but the real fun stuff begins once you've amassed experience/money.\n\nThere are puzzles for every type of player. There are 2 combat puzzles, one similar to Tetris, the other similar to any ball-pop game you've played before. There are 3 shipboard station types: Sailing, Carpentry, and Bilging. Sailing and Carpentry both have an alternate puzzle. There is also a Navigation puzzle. The Battle Navigation Puzzle is where the person in charge moves the ship to outmaneuver their opponents, and is the most important role on the ship. There are 5 "Carousing" type puzzles, including Poker, Hearts, Spades, and two puzzle PvP games. There are 6 "Labor" type puzzles, that require a labor badge on the free oceans. These puzzles are uniquely tailored to fuel the game's economy system, as every puzzle helps produce labor that produces products you can buy throughout the game.\n\nWith all of these puzzles, you can take on a variety of personas. There are the hard-core puzzlers, the ship-masters (they run pillages, sea monster hunts, etc.), the carousers, the traders, and many more. It's really up to you to decide who you are.\n\nThe best part about this game has to be the social aspect. There is literally a chat function for almost every group imaginable. I've met so many great and wonderful people playing this game. You can get the best experience imaginable if you 'put yourself out there' so to speak, find a crew, open yourself up to voice-communications, and amass a list of 'hearties'.\n\nThis game will suck up your time. You just have to dedicate maybe 30 hours to getting used to the puzzles and interactions, and it opens up completely.\n\nThere is an extensive experience/rating system for each puzzle. There are hundreds of trophies to mark your adventure with. There are thousands of items to collect. Dozens of ships, with many 'limited edition' versions to collect, each with their own, fun, and unique niche. Still hundreds of people to meet, across a number of oceans. Hundreds of Islands with their own unique histories.... the list goes on.\n\nYou can pillage the high seas; fighting brigands, barbarians, hoards of monkeys, Brigand Kings & Queens, The Infamous Black Ship; exploring Treasure Wrecks, Forage Spots; Raiding Vikings, Imperial Outposts. You can explore Sea Monster Lairs including: Atlantis, The Cursed Isles, The Haunted Seas, and The Kraken. You can engage Brigand Kings at their very own Flotillas. You can job for flag vs. flag or flag vs. Brigand King Blockades. You can join the navy to gain experience. You can spend your time at the inn, playing poker or settling disputes with a swordfight. You can collect pets, familiars, ships, houses, trinkets, swords, trophies, whatever you'd like. You can make ships, potions, clothes, MONEY. You can sit on the docks and harass random players. You can do absolutely nothing. You can do absolutely anything.\n\nSeriously.\n\nPlay this game.\n\n10/10 would spend another year+ of game time on this game.","July 30, 2012","true","372.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamsii/recommended/99910/","gamsii","gamsii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamsii/","38 products in account","Rating based on current state of play, as per my last login. The last time I logged in, there was nearly no one to play with, things were stagnating, and there was far less to do as a "greenie" (nonsubscriber on subscriber oceans) than there seemed to have felt like in the past. Even if I had resub'd, there didn't see that much to do, let alone anyone to do any of it with.\n\nI played Y!PP on and off for SO. SO. SO. many years. I believe my first account was made somewhere in 05 to 06, putting me at roughly the 9-10 year mark. While I played more off than on, those times during which I did play I would get completely sucked back into my ocean for weeks, if not months.\n\nWhen I was a bit younger, this game was tremendous amounts of fun. This has more to do with the fact that the ocean(s) were far more populated back then than they are these days, even after the colossal oceans merge. I was originally on Cobalt I believe, which during the prime of my play-days was THE ocean to be on. As I got older, I began to better understand the mechanics of the games I was actually playing, which made me better at them - but, alas, there weren't many people to play with anymore.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are clever and a LOT of fun. Most of them are simple enough to begin with that anyone could jump right in; still, they also have layers of depth enough to keep amused those whom understand the advanced concepts to each (insane amounts of chaining, combos out the booty, etc etc).\n\nThe variety of things to do seemed pretty much endless for awhile. From jobbing to running pillages; sloshing down drinks and throwing down rounds of poker, hearts, spades; exploring uninhabited islands; playing borderline-impossible games of hide-and-seek with me mates and trying to make everyone play on the fair (aka clickable; looking at you, dock arrow hiders!); running a shoppe; blockading islands; and so much more. There are so many awesome puzzles sprawled all across the game, and they are all extremely unique. You can spend hours working on your ability to perform Incredibles on one of the half dozen or more ship/duty puzzles; then go manage your shoppe/stalls and put in work hours at the awesome crafting puzzles; then spend a couple hours running commodities from port to port; go in search of El Polo Diablo for kicks and giggles and much insta death lols; then chill out at the tavern with drinks, game puzzles, swordfighting duels, and players buying, selling, trading, looking or advertising for crews, trying to pick a fight, and more. Then there are blockades, monster hunts, skeleton/zombie island take overs, contests, avatar outfitting, homes and ships of all sorts of sizes and designs to buy, paint, and decorate, parties to throw... Yeah. Lots to do.\n\nAs a game that was hugely social in its prime, seeing the excruciatingly slow and painful death of Y!PP (esp the sub oceans) was... really, really sad. I miss this game a LOT, and really wish it could be revived. Once Spiral Knights started to take off, things went downhill.\n\nI've never really found any other games quite like PP. The thorough permeation of theme, the way it was kid-friendly but not so much so that it was off-putting or unappealing to adults, how one could play casually, socially, or fer-srs. This game is both niche yet massively appealing to the masses, especially in the casual mobile gaming world of today.\n\nWhat would be SUPER. FREAKING. AWESOME! ? If Y!PP were to produce a sequel, or a spiritual successor, or something like that. The system itself worked quite well - $10/month subscription is very fair. Some things would need to be reworked a bit, and I can EASILY see how expansive it could get. An enormous open-world you could explore on your own or with your crew, finding hidden, previously undiscovered islands in the far corners of the world, exploring overwhelming jungles, diving into the deep-sea ruins of Atlantis in search of treasure and adventure, brave the misty swamplands of the cursed isles, all while interacting with diverse wildlife and a population of both advanced AI NPCs and other players; yet  still keeping the original base concept of the game (crews, pillages, plunders, and puzzles)...  I lost many hundreds of hours to the original Y!PP - and I can easily see myself pouring hundreds more into its successor, if it were done right.\n\nBut right now? The game isn't worth playing unless you want a poor social experience (if any), a few puzzles to play (these days the only puzzles you can play without a subscription are ship duty puzzles such as bilge, carp, sails, rigs, etc), and an empty, empty, linear world in which you don't so much explore as you do sail in a straight light along a pre-dotted path from island to island, archipelago to archipelago. Perhaps you could even buy up a stash of little blue potions and whisk yourself to quiet, abandoned port towns and long-forgotten jungle islands, just to see what could have been.","August 6, 2015","false","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The entire game is ran by players, from the economy (you can own your own shop, from blacksmiths building swords and cannonballs to shipyards building ships) to the politics and warfare. Various player- ran crews can form a flag, wage war on another flag, and even blockade an island in hopes of capturing it for the flag.\n\nBut if you have no desire to get in to all that, there is really no need to! (Aside from the fame and wealth) Casual players alike can hop on, do a few fun puzzles (There are competitive puzzles from sword fighting another player, to loading cannonballs as the ships gunner, to navigating a ship in a tense sea battle) and make some loot.\n\nMoney (Pieces of Eight or POE) can be spent on anything you like, from fancy clothes, ships, pets, houses, swords etc.\n\nI can't reccomend this game enough if you have an interest in MMO's, Pirates, or Puzzles.","July 22, 2015","true","403.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Depending on what you choose, that's the world you're stuck in. The system works, though, and doesn't seem bad until you need to pay a ton of dubloons (paid currency) for expensive premium content like estate housing (640 is a ton of IRL money.)\n\nIf you have the money at all, it's probably a better idea to use P2P oceans (servers), else Y!PP might be ruined for you with dubloon inflation prices, as currency can be exchanged between pieces of eight (PoE) and dubloons (dubs). I've had experience with pretty much (almost) every ocean they've offered in history, but all I can say here is choose based on your wallet.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes. However, I'd only recommend it if you enjoy 2D virtual chatrooms that turn into PvE/PvP puzzling on the fly. Basic listening skills and the ability to commit are highly recommended as well, as no captain will keep you on their ship if you disobey them or slack off.\n\nAnd no, you can't have that wheel. ^_^","July 27, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is now 13 years old and it's age has shown. Puzzle Pirates was released in the early days of MMO's, and for many years kept me interested for its involving fun puzzle gameplay and live econemy that was effected by the players. It also helped that for the years of WoW's massive popularity, every other MMO in existence was a WoW clone or so it seemed.\n\nThe game offers a wide variety of fun puzzles, both single player and multi player, and a large amount of missions such as tournaments and raids to profess your puzzling skill.\n\nMany things feel terribly dated and strange compared to the way game are played today, such as the way we move around islands (you could click to walk to areas for no reason or simply teleport to important areas on the map). Large raids could be very difficult to pull off as finding 50 people online to sail into Atlantis could be vastly difficult.\n\nIf you are a fan of puzzle games, you could have a lot of fun here. The game has aged heavily, and it shows. No amount of updates and polish could save it in that regard unfortunately. It comes down to how you rate a game. Rating this for its time I give it a hearty 5/5, and for today, I could reccomend it only to puzzling fans and more casual gamers.
