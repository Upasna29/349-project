Same three bots since the begining, looting system is currently a chore to pick up anything that's inside a box/bag, game lags on lowest settings possible, in the dark sections of the game it's basically pitch black even on the highest brightness settings.\n\nThe Robots:\n\nThe Hunter is broken, always has been. In the begining it one shot you and could detect and walk through walls. One year later the only change is now it takes two shots to kill you. With how the damage system works the more damage you take the less mobility you have. One shot takes you from 100% down to 18% essentially crippling you. Leaving you to wait to die or take an hour to find a repair station to fix the damages. Personally I liked it better when they insta-killed me instead of me stuck there waiting to put the second bullet in me.\n\nThe Kamikaze bots are stupidly easy to deal with. They walk slowly, stand in place to explode, and take five seconds to explode. Making it insanely easy to just walk up to them to activate their self destruct and then casually walk away.\n\nThe Hives I don't know if they've been changed or not because I kept getting shot down by Hunters before I could get anywhere near one of their nests. They're insanely hard to shoot down and hack considering their high mobility.\n\nOverall they can detect you before you even know they're there and you end up just getting gunned down.\n\nLoot System/Items:\n\nThe loot system is rudimentary at best. picking up individual loose items is a breeze but picking up items in boxes or bags is time consuming and grating to grab items out of. Oh by the way the ammo comes in a box that you have to open first then take the ammo out of adding a needless step to looting. When grabbing items from a box/bag you have to click it then select the item then take an amount of said item. There is no double click to grab the whole stack or singular item. Items now no longer come in completed products. You now have to go out and find the seperate parts to craft said tools to do anything.\n\nWeapons:\n\nMelee weapons are a joke in single player. Good luck getting close enough to whack a Hunter to death, the Hive Drones are out of the question, and "Why would you even?" with the Kamikaze bots. Guns now need to be built which is the only way to effectivly defend yourself against the Hunters and Hive Drones. So have fun hunting down every single part. Also you can't break down items into their base components or continue to craft on an incomplete item. Making anything you've finished crafting with only the parts you had effectivly useless.\n\nHacking:\n\nHacking is overcomplicated, if you don't know coding before hand you're going to be referring to a guide before you memorize the basic commands (if you can even stomach playing that long).\n\nPower/Mobility System:\n\nI like the power system in this game, you need capacitors to store charged up power and you need reactors/solar panels to generate power. The more weight you carry the more energy you consume. If you run out of power you have to slowly waddle around or stand around a bit to generate some more power (unfortunatly you're not going to be able to stand around much). The jumping system sucks, let's just sit here for two minutes while I charge up my jump to get over a two foot high ledge. Basically making jumping a chore and something to not bother with considering most of the map is flat anyway.\n\nOptimization:\n\nThis game is terribly optimized. It lags on the lowest settings possible. The brightness setting literally doesn't even matter for it does basically nothing for the pitch black sections of the game.\n\nAfter all of this my only advice is never buy this game or wait for another year to see if something significant has been done. After a almost a year in development this game has basically gone no where and it won't get anywhere fast. Just avoid the game and find something else to buy/play.\n\n(Edit) The reason I have 16 hours on this game is because when it first came out the game had a fun masochistic challenge to it, even though the AI had quite few advantages. In the beginning we had a little thing called the RFID Tracker. It allowed us to see enemies on the map due to their RFID chips installed. So you could effectivly avoid enemies before they could even auto lock onto you or run out of the range of their auto lock before it was too late (F.Y.I This item isn't in the game anymore.) . The PvP aspect had you set in teams of two to survive against three other teams. Unfortunatly when the PvP was first introduced you couldn't win with your partner being alive, it was coded to be last man standing. So you either ended up murdering your team mate in the beginning with the basic tools given to you or have a battle royale at the end. Game was fun at first but with nothing new to up the ante, fix issues, or add more interest to the game it gets dull and repetitive.","June 8, 2015","false","15.8"," 498 of 562 people (89%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","89","498","562","25","17"

In this vast world of robots mercy does not exist. You will have to make use of every item you can find if you are to survive even one day. So far, the tutorial is very informative. The tutorial gets a very good foothold into the basics of the game and made starting the single player pretty easy. The game itself is running pretty smoothly so far. This game has some really good potential. I would give it a 7/10 so far. The final product should be promising.","July 25, 2014","true","29.5"," 362 of 445 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","362","445","6","10"

IF YOU LIKE IT, KUDOS TO YOU. BUT NOTE I AM NOT YOU.*\n\nI really tried to like this game, it felt like it could be something special even if it was really F-ing hard. But as the game is now, I can't play it without feeling increasingly frustrated at nearly every aspect of the game.\nYes, its a good game, it held on to me for almost a week, but my patience for it has ended, and I just can't play this anymore.\n\nPros:\n- Crafting - Done in two ways, one by assembling tools & guns through your inventory screen (provided you have the parts), the other through some machine that cannot be moved or made (luckily there's more than one).\n\n- Loot & Materials - All found in small flashing crates in almost areas. Most of the loot is pretty easy to find, but expect copies along the way. You can also, if you have the scematics, use the craft machine to recycle items in your inventory. And there's at least 3 Harvesters (that I'm aware of) that you can control & gather Wood, Ore, and Concrete for you.\n\n- Jumping - Once you figure it out, you'll be able to jump at ridiculous heights, helps when you need to access an item & simply want a safe spot (I'll explain why in Cons).\n\n- Building - As the trailer shows, you can build stuff. You can build pretty much anything in Wood, Concrete, or Brick. The Turrets however require a bit more to build & start up (but they are your base defenses with pretty epic range), and get their own drives.\n\nCons:\n*Note - This is being developed by apparently one guy*\n\nBots (Enemies) - Every survival game wouldn't much of a challenge without enemies, but these enemies are relentless, annoying, and frustrating. Hunters (looks like Terminators with helmets) move a somewhat slow pace, but have ridiculous range, their mere presence WILL make you run for your life cause there won't be a viable way to fight them at start, and they can shoot you twice & you're dead. Suicide Bots will walk up to you and blow up (after having a seizure).\n\nBots Spawns - Random spawning is also understandable, but most times you'll as if the game intentionally TRYING to kill you as if you're the end of days or something. You can be walking along and then 1 foot away, an enemy spawns (sometimes you'll get a group).\n\nBugs - The bugs hurt the play experience a lot. Some enemies will clip on ladders then one second later they're back on the ground, then back at the top again. The menus during multiplayer will randomly stop working, making something simple become abyssmal level frustrating. Since the Hunters will war with the flying hive bots, you can expect some ridiculous lag. When building stuff, you can expect some decent lag, but the more you place & build, then more it goes from ok lag to WTF lag. And best of all, Bots can walk THROUGH WALLS that you built! Making your defensive walls pointless.\n\nBuilding - Since the Dev tries pretty hard to add realism like gravity to the game, don't expect anything like Minecraft building in this game. If just one piece of your structure is even SLIGHTLY off, expect all your hard work to go to hell, and even better, you lose ALL of the used materials if the building falls. And it gets worse, sometimes you'll hit a point where the Auto-Placement will go where you don't want it, making custom projects almost impossible.\n\nMultiplayer - Despite the game having 352 positive reviews, hardly ANYONE is online to play. Most people I've seen was 4 people in one room (including me). Most times though, the lag & menu bugs will increase rapidly while playing multiplayer (big bad for multiplayer only gamer types).\n\nOne Map - Thats right, just one map. The items' placement is random, but buildings, repair station, recycle machines, everythingelse in completely preset. And though there is a ridiculous huge tower out there, the point of it has not been discovered or explained - as that is, the huge tower is completely pointless & serves no other purpose than to take up space.\n\nThe Hunters always getting the drop on me, even while having a Radar was getting to me.\nMy health getting low forcing me to move slower than Yoda with a cane.\nNo real plot or story in the game.\nBut bots being able to walk through walls while being able to spawn in unfair spots, that pushed me over the edge.\n\nSorry to say, but you'll find less frustration in Dark Souls. I'm starting to regret even buying it...\n\nRating: 5/10.","July 17, 2015","false","25.3"," 261 of 320 people (82%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","82","261","320","26","12"

It is currently still in Alpha and since the developer has never bothered to release a road map it's unknown if, or even when, it is supposed to progress beyond its present state.\n\nSadly it's now over 5 months since the last software update and the developer, Touz, continues to ignore the Steam community. A brief posting by him on January 6th was a rehash of previous statements he's made but did nothing to instill confidence that the game is moving forward in any significant way.\n\nCurrent game play is, quite frankly, boring. At one time there were multiplayer servers that allowed for PVP but the online community has vanished.\n\nThe singleplayer component is bare-bones and has no goal. Essentially it consists of running around and attempting to find components for weapons and other bits and pieces while trying to avoid enemy AI. That's it. The weapon crafting system is needlessly complex and there is absolutely no reason to build a base as the AI is not programmed to recognize player structures.\n\nThe lack of any progression system, storyline or end goal severely limit replayability. This is made worse by the small static map that comprises the player world . Once all areas have been explored there is nothing to draw the player further into the game since there is no 'further' to be had.\n\nIf you are interested in this game, I'd suggest you wait. If the developer decides to actually work on the game and make significant improvements it may be worth purchasing at a future date. Right now it would be a waste of money.\n\nNot recommended.","April 22","false","7.0"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","51","53","0","1"

If you can't handle incomplete games with glitches and bugs -- look elsewhere.\n\nPotential is nice - StarForge had mass potential and so have many other games.  Some reach it, others don't so go in knowing the risks and judge it based upon it's current state for playability -and- your willingness to risk based upon that potential.\n\nA list of things to look at:\n- The skill-point system only works multi-player so you won't skill up in single player.\n\n- Multiplayer you will end up against leveled up oponents and those levels have meaning and high value.  Lots and lots of value to being leveled up here.\n\n- Gathering requires hacking a harvester which then can take quite a while to gather things - you can't harvest anything.\n\n- to get that hacking device you must find it.\n\n- Robot NPC's drop nothing.  You need to hunt through ruins to find weapons, ammo and other supplies.\n\n- ammo is fairly scarce for the quantity of robots you'll bump into - again, no points for dealing with AI opponents.  You're best bet is to run/aviod them.\n\n- robots can pop up at any point near or far.  They have been toned down to 2 shots to kill you but that's the best you'll get.\n\n- AI robots cannot aim upwards.  If you are above them, they can't hit you with their weapons -- if at range and above, they can and will hit you.\n\n- AI robots can walk through walls that you build.  So if you build, make the building tall and use stairs to get up there.\n\n- You need to find power for your unit - not those silly solar cells but nuclear power.  Without it, you won't be able to power up the capacitor to run, jump, etc.  Extra capacitors are good but you shouldn't need too many of them.\n\n- picking up anything early will stop your running.  Anything except a nuclear power units.  The solar power cells weigh a ton for the energy they give, which slows you down.\n\n- many items are sunk in the ground and other items - you'll see loot markers but can't loot the item nor even know what it is.\n\nAgain, it's got potential but that potential has a long way to go to be achieved.  IMO - worth supporting with funds but don't expect a highly clean and polished version at this time.\n\nIt runs well but it's not done yet.","October 6, 2014","true","8.7"," 136 of 189 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","136","189","5","1"

I am eager to see how this progresses as it has the potential in my mind to give games like Rust a run for its money. The premise of a left behind robot trying to survive in a world of hostile robots is a very fresh concept and the use of a hacking system is reminiscent of other awesome games like System Shock.\n\nFrom only playing about 2 hours of the game so far, in that time I found 2 harvesters, hacked them and set them to gathering resources. I also looted one of the nuclear power plants and towns and got some loot before getting bumrushed by 2 robots as night was falling.\n\nQuite eager to see what new updates will bring!\n\nNavigating the inventory is a bit clunky when switching between RFID reader and weapons etc, draws you out of the game a bit but I am not complaning. For a game this early in development (and by a sole developer) it is probably the most stable I have seen before bar none and expecting this will be optimised in the future.\n\nHighly recommend this game for anyone that can handle the fact that the game is very early alpha!","October 10, 2014","true","3.3"," 61 of 82 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","61","82","2","0"

I spent a couple hours exploring the single-player world and was impressed with how good it looked, as well as how good the enemies and character models were.\n\nGraphics aside, the gameplay is quite slow-paced at first. You'll spend the first few lives exploring around and learning the map. Since there's currently no in-game map feature at the moment, you'll have to use your compass and navigate by landmarks, like the tower, cities, and nuclear power plant. The hacking, which is necessary for any type of survival in the game, requires a tool that you don't start off with, so the first few minutes of every life will be spent searching for a hacking tool before too many enemy robots spawn. Once the tool is in hand, you can hack enemy hunters to make friendly guards that follow you around. I once had thirteen friendlies plodding their way behind me, shooting anything else that spawned around me before I got the chance to hack it and add to my army.\nOh, and you should avoid swarms like the plague. It's currently fantastically hard to hack a swarmbot, and they'll kill you and everything following you while you're trying.\nAnyways, once you have a hacking tool, you need to find a harvester. These spawn in large dish-like structures in the ground, and they allow you to collect wood and other building materials for your base. Unless you know exactly where they are on the map, or unless you get wonderfully lucky and find a hacking tool right next to the harvester, you'll likely spend a good while searching for one before you can build a base, Once those resources start coming in, you've got the game won. Enemies can't currently shoot through doorways or windows, so you can build a square structure and hide in it until the end of day 5, or you can make a bunker with charging stations and turrets and only leave to scrounge up more resources that the harvester can't bring you, like ammo and capacitors.\n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic Alpha.\n\nPROS--------\n-Beautiful game\n-Fun gameplay so far (if you enjoy exploration and the long-play style of Rust and 7 Days to Die)\n-Loads of potential\n\nCONS--------\n-The updates are rather slow. Touz is currently the only dev on this game at the moment, and the updates are spread out. There was an update just a few hours before I posted this review, so it is still being worked on, but it takes a while.\n\n\nThis game is a fantastic early-access experience. If you like following early-access games, you'll love this.\nI'd really love to see this game maintain the Robots gimmick instead of turning to Zombies, as many people have suggested in the forum. The market is already saturated with zombie crafting survival games, and even if it is a slight change, the robots and hacking and power supplies bring a refreshing change to the survival genre.\n\nThis dev does a great job and should be supported. This game is still extremely early in development, and is already fantastic. I love it.","October 19, 2014","true","4.4"," 86 of 123 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","86","123","3","0"

And, it actually kinda saddens me that this game is getting so much hate.\n\nYes, The Fifth Day is incomplete. It's obvious. But, it's not bad... Actually, I find myself loving it when I find another person to play it with, as Multiplayer makes the Death Game so much more fun.\n\nSimple, you start out with nothing (Sadly), and work your way around the map, avoiding hunters and other dangers while keeping your power up, until you can find a Hacking Tool, a harvester, and a construction tool. Then, you multi-task exploring for ammo, weapons, weapon parts, etc. and managing your base, its power, its defenses, and the supplies your harvester(s) collect.\n\nYes, it's obscenely hard in single player, especially when you have nothing to work with... But that's the point.\nIt's not supposed to be a solo experience.\nIt's supposed to be either a team of people, working together to make a base, and survive who knows what, or a fight for your life as you hunt for supplies, watch out for hostile players, and hope that there are still harvesters around to claim so you can survive on your own.\n\nPlease, if you're thinking of getting the game... Get it. Support the game devs, expand the community, and wait who knows how long for an update. (Yes, it's updating... But think how hard it is to make this kind of massive game, with all those A.I. trying to hunt you down and destroy you. Along with managing the hacking gimmick... yes, you can hack everything except for other players. It takes a hellish amount of time to master, but if you can get hacking something to make it friendly before it kills you down, then you stand a chance for experimentation.)","May 18, 2015","true","14.3"," 217 of 339 people (64%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","64","217","339","25","35"

Other than that I haven't found many other reasons to play the game as you can run about and loot all you want but the single player aspect is pretty much limited to building.\n\nMultiplayer was interesting but surprisingly for a survival game, everyone ended up working together rather than just killing eachother to win so that was nice,\n\nOverall, I do not recommend this game as I feel like this is another "Early Access" game that doesn't deliver. The premise of the game is interesting but since the game is very rarely updated I feel like it isn't making enough progress or taking in  the consideration of the players.","November 8, 2014","false","4.6"," 144 of 220 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","144","220","0","18"

All of the current positive reviews say the game has potential, which is true. But the game in its current state as a new released early access game, it is not very fun. Multiplayer is completely unplayable. The map is too big for such a small multiplayer mode, I played three matches and ran into only one person. And I always "won" because people would just quit because there was no point to multiplayer. The inventory bugs in MP, preventing you from picking anything up. The only reason to do multiplayer is because you get skill points, which is an awesome idea, but you just have to stand around and wait it out to "win".\n\nIn single player, the game is rough starting out. You have no defense against enemy robots because you don't start out with anything you can hit with and the robots will one shot your face off. Eventually you will run around and die enough that you finally manage to find a gun or something else. Items are very rare except in cities. Hacking is too difficult, it is near impossible to even try hacking the enemy robots because of their one shot kills. The harvester, which is the only way you can gather to start building, is VERY buggy! It does not fly high enough above the trees and frequently gets stuck. Sometimes the harvester does not listen to your commands and just flies away forever. And when you died and load your save, your harvester will be all the way back at its original spawn.\n\nThe game has potential, and I will surely revisit in the future. But if you are unsure I would wait. You can check out my gameplay at twitch.tv/Lowco2525.","July 25, 2014","false","5.0"," 108 of 184 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","108","184","0","3"

I know this game is an in-development prototype but a game good as this should at least have a good AI system. To me personally the AI is the worst thing about playing this game. Having a stable AI system that doesn't spawn ten feet in front of you and then kills you instantly and still follows you when you respawn and will try to kill you until either you or itself dies. It would be amazing to be able to do what the game has in store for you and to be able to play with your friends in peace without getting interfered by the AI, but I won't give my hopes up yet and I hope to never give my hopes up on the game's up coming development, but once this game seeks the development that it deserves I will find myself and I hope others start to praise the amazingness of this great game.\n\n\nKeep up the good work Touz","January 11","false","26.5"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

There's the ground, and hills, valleys, trees, buildings, tunnels, and the world extends out to the horizons in 4 directions (although you do hit the invisible wall at the edge).\n\nThere are no objectives per-se. You simply need to survive. You can collect resources (mainly via harvester dotted around the world that require hacking to activate and control). You play a drone robot, so power generation and consumption is everything. I found the fastest way was to collect solar panels from the farms and capacitors from various locations, then stand still for a while to charge before moving off.\n\nAlways keeping a watchful eye on the automated drones gives the game a certain edge, especially at night and when you're building structures. I build a small tower, and was standing at the top adding a roof when a drone walked into the bottom and exploded.\nNeedless to say, it took out a corner of the building and the whole thing fell down, but you take no damage from falling so dont die.\nNo, that comes in the form of hunter bots with shotguns that kill you in 2 shots.\n\nOverall, in my opinion, a nice game. It contains elements I enjoy: survival, open world, freebuild of tools, weapons and structures, achievments (there are Steam ones as well as in game for solo and multi play), and most importantly, it's always recieving updates. Always small, but they are always fixing a bug or adding a new featre, which is great.","January 28","true","18.8"," 39 of 66 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","39","66","9","4"

The game itself is a lot of fun once you figure things out.  The fact that I had to use trial and error while figuring out the game was extremely refreshing.  The tutorial is great and teaches you about all the gameplay functionality but it doesn't hold your hand throughout the game.\n\nYou can currently play locally or multiplayer.  The multiplayer game reminds me of a "Hunger Games" style arena.  The servers are 10 player max with two game modes.  "Loner" where it's every man for himself, or "COOP" where there are 5 teams of 2.  The idea is to be the last man or team alive.\n\nIn the early access there is already a lot of functionality:\n-  More than several weapon variations (Melee, Pistols, SMGs, Assault Rifles, Grenade Launcher, etc)\n-  Crafting system for base building (Foundations, Walls, Stairs, Doorways, Pillars, Charging Stations, Automated Machine Gun Turrets, etc)\n-  Hacking other robots and controlling them\n-  A reasonably large size map\n-  Lootz\n-  more things...\n\nNow, this is an early release game and you can expect some things to bug out.\n\nHere are some gripes I have with the game so far:\n-  UI sometimes bugs out and in game weapon and UI functionality stops responding to buttons and clicks (requires exiting to fix)\n-  The UI is clunky in the sense that navigating the UI is not optimal\n-  The multiplayer mode doesn't encourage players to utilize any of the base building or resource gathering mechanics.  It's basically this: Get weapons and power -> kill other players.  Every time I've started harvesting resources and building a base the other players got killed or quit.  The longest multiplayer match I had was the first day and half of the first night.  This might improve as players get better though... the game has only been out one day.\n\nOverall, I think this game is really fun.  I'm very excited about building large bases and creating power arrays... crafting in general.  In my opinion, this game is going to go from "early access fun" to "completed game awesome".\n\nGreat job so far "The Fifth Day" devs and keep it up.  Congrats on the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","July 26, 2014","true","21.4"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","0"

Hacking tools, humans extinct, robots, etc. I am sort of disappointed that it's not a true open world game like Rust or DayZ. But considering that instead it is an arena sort of game, I am still interested. I like the concept of entering a battle to the likes of Hunger Games and for five days be a predator and a prey at the same time. Still and as most EA games, I cannot recommend this game at this time for a lack of content. I will keep the "recommended" state because I see potential.\n\nPros\n- the tutorial, it explains everything very well\n- fresh look on the survival genre\n- a lot of interesting mechanics like hacking\n\ncons\n- for now, the multiplayer looks stale, you get in a match and sometimes you wander untill you're killed with no chance to fight back\n- survival gamers might not enjoy the arena style that much","July 25, 2014","true","0.7"," 33 of 56 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","33","56","0","0"

He stated in his video that the game was poorly made, very buggy, and had little to no content. Still, I purchased it in hope of a half-way decent survival&building game.\nOnce I launched it I was greeted with a pleasant surprise. The game's visuals were beautiful and captured the asthetic of a cold, lonely wasteland well and without any FPS drops or crashing on maximum settings. Once I started walking around the desolate world I came across a new breed of enemy, robots. The bots were well modeled and effectively frightining, as one of them slowly turned around; scanned me and shot one round. Killing me in my place. I must say I jumped as the shot rang out.\n\nGameplay mechanics such and building and combat are fluid and difficult enough to provide a challenge, not a headache.\nTo start building you must find a hacker tool (They mainly spawn in cities and towns), and a harvester. (Harvesters are found in pits around the map) If you do find a harvester, you must hack into it using the tool mentioned above. Once hacked you command the machine to collect resources and drop them near you (The way the harvester flys around and drops supply pods is impressive for a game this young). Once you have enough resources you build using a recipe book found around the map. The building itself is rather alot like the game "Rust" by Garry Newman, You craft templates and place them in a locking format. I prefer The Fifth Day's building more because it has no glitches with the terrain and more templates to produce more complex structures. Combat is wonderful, the weapon models sway with your charecter, the firearms themselves feel powerful and fun to fire, and the recoil is set properly to give you the satisfaction of a well aimed shot.\n\nThe AI is not the smartest out there, but still provide enough of a challenge to keep you on the edge of your seet as you walk through the deserted countrysides and cities.\n\nAll in all I give The Fifth Day a 10/10, for breathtaking visuals and atmosphere, no bugs or glitches, well designed building and gunplay mechanics, interesting and new hostile enemies, low hardware requirements, and low price.","August 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

First off this is a early release game and its only 0.0.3 anyone ♥♥♥♥♥ing because it has bugs, or because it doesnt have much content how ♥♥♥♥ing stupid can you be. a game takes time to make, and since its only one guy making a indie game i think hes done pretty damn good on what he has done so far. for instance lets compare a published game by a company like square enix. its takes them ♥♥♥♥ing years to create a game with a big ♥♥♥ staff to make a decent game. so pretty much if you have anything bad to say then go play something else till the game is worked on more and features has been added. For me the game looks promising and i know its tough roaming for supplies and then trying to find your base again while constantly avoiding enemies.\nMy thoughts on improvements would be a few things starting off, lets have it where we can manually collect supplies so we can start building from scratch once we have the books. add the recipe for solar panels the stand the are attached to and such as. add recipes for ammunition, weapons, and other things that is hard to find like circuits. i would like the map expanded when time allows with more complex and beautiful towns, cities, and landscape adding underground areas and caves and such as. keep up the good work and seriously dont expect a indie game that has just came out to be like a game you buy in the store, give it time to progress just like your parents who bought you the game are waiting patiently for you to grow the ♥♥♥♥ up and move the hell out of thier house.","October 5, 2014","true","7.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The other little game additions like hacking, which I personally think is a fantastic idea, really makes the game feel that little bit more unique, and once you get the hang of it enemies become far less of a problem! Further positives are the way the game is playable, you choose to either go full frontal assault, or try to build up your defences first, or just loot and pillage like a stealthy ninja, entirely your choice and all completely plausible.

I wasn't expecting too much, but even then it failed to deliver.\ntl/dr; the combat is probably the worst part of the game, and in a survival game like this, that's a huge dealbreaker.\n\nThe best thing about this game I can say is probably weapon crafting. While it's a pain early on, you could probably make some pretty nice weapons later on. I say probably, because I've never actually lasted longer than a few minutes, so I've never gotten to experiment with the weapon crafting.\nThe enemies range from either absurdly stupid to absurdly powerful. There are "creeper bots" (they walk up to you and explode) but they're hardly a threat. I don't think I've even been damaged by one of them. There are Hive Bots, which are small, flying robots that swarm near their hives, but they are easily avoided. The real threat are "Hunters" I believe they are called. They spawn randomly and just wander around until you get near. And once they have locked on to you, you might as well be dead. They can kill you in about 2 shots and don't ever seem to miss. AND they travel in groups most of the time, spawning quiet frequently. Maybe they would be easy to kill with a decent weapon, but finding a gun isn't so simple. You usually find PARTS of weapons scattered through the world that you can craft together, but finding all of the essential parts takes awhile, and even if you complete a weapon, ammo is scarce. Melee weapons are a joke, the exploding bots kill themselves, Hive bots can be easily avoided, and Hunters will destroy you the moment you get within range.\n\nEven if poor combat wasn't enough, the world in this game is just so empty. The only place of interest is the giant spire which sometimes (I stress the word SOMETIMES) has good equipment. There aren't any bosses, food isn't a concern, base building is crude and, in the end, pointless, hacking is slow, confusing, and again, pointless. In the end, there just is nothing to do in this game.","September 9, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

At first it seems extremely hard but once you get skill points and improve yourself (or use cheat engine to get em, heh) it gets much easier. The first patch loot was so extremely rare it made it hard. Now theres a bit too much. The base building is already better than rust's, theres a ton of stuff you can do as far as base building. Once you find a few power generators beating the mobs is easy, you see them coming on your RFID scanner and you simply run away. Theres a bunch of work to be done but the sole developer Touz is shuffling out updates regularly, and they improve alot in the game already. Nobody seems to be playing this on multiplayer right now but its a fun hunger games type enviornment.

The Harvestor will actually freeze up in place and not move at all. To where you need to deactivate it and then reactivagte it to get it moving sometimes. Also I do see alot of people complaining about it being hard to find alot of stuff such as guns and ammo and etc. but i could care less cause it is a post-apocalyptic and is meant to be hard to find stuff. Also the AI are nearly impossible to destroy, they are like terminators they kill u in a few shots and u can empty mags out on them and do little damage.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Annexosengen/recommended/312210/","Annexosengen","Annexys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Annexosengen/","58 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Fifth Day looked very promising in the sense that it aimed to be a bit more than the average survival game. It isn't living up to that.\nLets start with CONS:\nThe AI ranges from absolutely horrendous to ridiculously overpowered. You can either run circles around a blind AI that won't do anything to you, or it'll phase a bot through a wall to kill you in a room you shouldn't have been killed in.\nThe overall survival ideology behind it is cool, but some of the systems therof (Namely the fact that as a robot, I shouldn't run out of energy from WALKING 20 feet when I have a nuclear reactor strapped to my back recharging capacitors.) are not at all fun. You can't walk 20 feet without getting winded, you can't find enough reactors to keep yourself charged, capacitors appear to do nothing but weigh you down unless you've found about 20 of those oh so elusive batteries.\nThe Loot Drops are probably one of the best and worst parts, which is why it's separating my Cons from Pros.\nReason why it's a Con:\nSince it's hard for a ROBOT to walk 20 feet without getting winded, those batteries or Reactors shouldn't be so rare. They should be something that you find every 10 loot boxes. You find one every 120 loot boxes if you're lucky. This should be more balanced, or fix the recharge rate on those capacitors.\nWhy it's a Pro:\nThe loot drops are far enough apart to stop you from feeling instantly gratified, but are close enough together to keep you searching without making you feel hopeless. When you find one, the loot isn't always great, but it's never bad. There's always something useful in the boxes, or at least something that you feel could be useful later. (concrete? not early game, pal)\nAnother Pro to the game is the jumping mechanic. While I don't like that the default spacebar tap jump is less than I could do after a full pizza by myself, I enjoy the charge mechanic of jumping. The fact that I can jump over a tall building in a single bound is a great thing, and adds to the immensely enjoyable exploration of this game. Plus, the Dev rewards creative exploring, which is something that I admire.\nThe Hacking tool is something not found in your basic survival game, and for that I applaud The Fifth Day. I also bring a round of applause for the fact that the hacking isn't your average "hold down the trigger or mouse click until it's complete," mechanic. No, this mechanic makes you navigate systems with your keyboard, taking time, and making a hack harder to do in a pinch. If you wanna do it, it better be worth it. Great stuff.\nThe general ideology of the game with a post APOC robo world is an amazing idea. Keep rolling with that, keep with the art style in the spire.\n\n\nOverall, I give this game a 5.5/10. The game is sub-par to say the least and had me raging within an hour of game play. I do believe the game can get better, and I hope to see much more out of it over time. Do I think you should buy this? Maybe. Buy it, put it in your Library, leave it there until it's more updated, or play it for feedback.\nAs it stands, the Pre Beta is not worth 14.00.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nYes.\nDo I believe that you should wait for more updates?\nYes.\n\nTLDR: more Cons than pros, but the game has a good enough idea, and a fairly active dev. recommend\n5.5/10, Alpha test it.","March 27, 2015","true","8.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I haven't played for about several months, when I got back on, I was surprised with the trees. Then there were the new weapons, I have the highest grade weapon right now, and I still haven't found all the parts to it yet. I'm excited for more updates to come out.

It offers a new setting for a survival game, in a futuristic setting. Zomies are replaced with several types of ruthless machines who make survival in this game much easier said than done. Considering the game is only in 0.01 Alpha, it has a bright future and if the deveoper continues to work on the game, it can really become a powerhouse game in the genre. Right now, bugs are plentiful and there isn't a huge variety of items or structures. But if you can look beyond the surface and see a game that, at its core, is very original and enthralling, you'll have no qualms about dishing out the 15$. You won't regret supporting a developer with an exellent concept. The Fifth Day is splendid.\n\nAlso, please message me if you know how to build.

You will (most likely) not regret it.\n\nNow for the more detailed analysis; this game, in its current state, is pretty dang fun. I've fiddled around with all the games major selling points and am pretty satisfied. For example, most survival games have guns that are pre-made and can't be modified aside from, for example, throwing a scope or silencer on it. TFD features weapons that can be modified and upgraded using gun parts you loot from the world. This makes acquiring a weapon pretty hard early on (though you can occasionally find an assembled weapon), but it also opens up many possibilities for your arsenal. Don't like the slide on your pistol? Simply switch it out with another, possibly better, slide. Want to decrease the weight of your weapon? Switch out the handle, shave off a little extra weight. And there's plenty more you can do with this, believe me. There is also a base construction system in place. It can be a little finicky at times, but all over all it's pretty easy to build yourself a structure, granted you get the resources to build it out of. Speaking of which, there is a hacking mechanic involved. I say this now because scattered around the map are harvesters that can be hacked to collect resources for you. Despite what other reviews are saying, it's incredibly easy to hack something. There is a bit of a command prompt, but all you need to do to hack a machine is to type in two commands; one right after the other. That's it. You can hack anything that moves (aside from players, of course). The enemies are particularly hard to deal with, but running away from them is a pretty easy thing to do until you have a gun and ammo. And looting, despite what people are saying, is relatively smooth. Not Rust smooth, mind you, but satisfactory none the less. The community is very small and the wiki is REALLY out of date, so you're going to be learning most of how to do things on your own. And the developers have not abandoned this game, they just released a bug-fix update not too long ago.\n\nAll over all, TFD is pretty worth the money. Yes, you're going to run into a bug or two; it's an alpha, it's going to do that. This is a hard game. My advice, save often and keep going.

One of the few problems I have with this game are the enemies, they are very powerful and Hunters can kill you in 1-2 shots if they manage to get close to you. The game has only 3 types of enemies, but because this is a early acces game thats okay. The Hunters are very hard to kill and killing them eats through ammunition quickly. The other problem I am going to talk about is the harvesting system. Without the hackable harvester, you can't gather building resources except for in crates which never have enough in them to build.

Dev team is one man. Updates are every now and then, and currently, there's not too much to do. That's my honest statement about what we have so far.\n\nBut like I said, pre-alpha.\n\nThe fact that one guy's been able to pull off what's already here? That's impressive in its own right. But the setting for The Fifth Day, the combination of survival/crafting we see in Rust, with a technological, sci-fi twist on how the world operates? This game has potential, and it shows.\n\nEven if it's lacking more than one map over and over at the moment, this game draws me back in day after day, after day.

You are an android and you must avoid or fight the robots that you encounter.\n\nAlthough you do not require food or water to survivel (you're a machine) - you will need weapons, ammo and supplies.\n\nThere is an impressive home/base building system in this game.  You can build small shelters to massive installations (building system is similar to Rust).  The gathering of the building supplies is unique.

The hacking is hard to do becasue there isn't enough intructions to do it. (I had to look it up to figure it out). When you get hit by the hunters, and others. Your shields go down and its hard to find a repair station. Plus when you kill the hunters they dont drop any loot. I think they should drop ammo and gun parts (Also add some broken ones too). Third I find it hard for this game not to have a respawn buttion instead of having to go back to the lobby every time. Fourth and not least. I have a good PC but when the drones come out of that hive thing if I watch it for a bit there will be over 100 0f them. and it lags my PC when I look at it. also add somthing like take metal to repair shields and stuff.\n\nMever the less this game has a bright future I will be palying and will learn more to help out by reporting bugs Esc.

Gameplay is decent but basic at the moment. The idea of surviving as a robot was a brilliant one by the developer and allows this game to set itself apart from other survival games out there. There is a alot of room for improvement so this game is one to keep an eye on.

I kno there is only one creator/dev and thats the problem. This is simply too big a project for one person and it shows. Not only are you dropped into the game with no knowldege on what to do, but you are overmatch, outgunned, and simply over whelmed by the world. 30 minutes in you migh have collected a few things and maybe even figured out how to craft ♥♥♥♥, but then your dropped by a bullet from out of nowhere and your left to start over. And each time you do there is no drive behind it. This isn't fallout or far cry where trial and error are retty much rewarded (either with achievements, exp/$, or just your own reponsiveness to the game itself). This is a Bear Grylls see you later in the wilderness type ♥♥♥♥, cept its boring, the environment lackluster, with typical sound fx and NO MUSIC. Yeah...no music makes a dull open world even more boring.\n\nHonestly wait to see what it becomes through dev video or fan devotion, otherwise spend your $ on something else.","December 11, 2014","false","2.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I understand the developer is working alone to create the game and all of its updates but seriously, 4 months to update! it shouldn't take that long. This game still has potential having the ability to hack and the AI roaming but the developer needs to start paying a lot more attention to the game and needs to play it through himself to see the glitches that we are all talking about.

The game description state that it has craftable bases, hacking, AI, and other goodies, but after 3 hours of playing I saw none of that. After 3 hours I found 2 guns, a book, and some roboty things like power cells and... other kinds of power cells. I've read on the forums that there are some people who have built bases and done all the cool high end stuff this game claims to feature, but if I haven't seen a hint of any of that after 3 hours, I don't even want to fathom the dozens of hours it took those players to get to their point. Basically the game has serious pacing issues. The world though looks passable, is incredibly empty, with little to interact with.\n\nThe game does have some redeeming features. The visuals are passable, the concept of being a robot seems interesting, and I like the idea of all the features... too bad I didn't experience any of them.\n\nNow I know this game is early access and because of that I may come back to this and revamp some of this written impression, but for the time being, The Fifth Day is, at it's best, a "wait and see".\n\nPros:\n- Passable graphic fidelity\n- Interesting idea to feature robots as the playable characters\n- The features sounds interesting (never experienced them though)\n\nCons:\n- Terrible pacing\n- Extremely obviously unfinished and unpolished\n- At the moment, feels generic\n- 3 hours...

Now you have to find 5+ different parts to craft a single weapon to be able to shoot. Melee weapons are useless and pointless. Bots keep spawning on your ♥♥♥ while you scavenge. Once you've stopped you're dead. They always know where you are and they kill you with 1-2 shots. If you won't stop then soon you'll be out of energy and will crawl until they run you down and kill you.\nLoot is now very scarce. Given the fact you have to loot ♥♥♥♥♥on of parts to be even able to craft yourself a weapon it's just awful.\nSo while playing this game you'll be mostly wandering around unarmed sometimes stopping for a couple of minutes doing nothing just so your batteries could recharge.\n\nThis game is dead. Developer does nothing to improve it. Forget about it.\n\n==Old review==\n\nGood idea, but the game is lacking a goal.\nLoot is spawning out of thing air in predefined places. So eventually you'll be camping one spot and lazily shooting down spawining mobs. When you'll get 4 computer chips (that is after an hour or so) you'll build a turret and won't even have to shoot anymore.\nMap is pretty small, but nevertheless there's no point exploring. Graphics is OK. Inventory system is awful, though kinda creative. Big problem is an absence of hotkey toolbar. It's very cumbersome pressing Q or E for 10 times just to equip a weapon.","August 9, 2014","false","6.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It looked great from the trailer and a few gameplays I saw on Youtube. I can't even get the game to start. It opens the first screen saying that it is an "in-development alpha" or whatever. Then it freezes and needs to be forced to quit. The one time it did work I played a few minutes of the tutorial which not only wasn't helpful, but didn't fully explain what it was trying to. Overall I give this game a 1 out of 10 and that's just because the graphics were decent. Otherwise, I'd give it a 0.

What makes this game stand out though is the fact that you're a robot, amongst other robots. Hacking those (AI) robots and collecting energy will be your primary concern...and other than that I'm affraid there isn't much more to say really...\n\nMissing a lot of that surviving element they have been talking so much about, and from what I can read on the forums and news updates they're a lot more focused on implementing multiplayer, which I'm sad to say one of those things that reduces this to just another build-and-fight...

YOU LITERALLY SPEND 20 MINUTES AIMLESSLY WANDERING A BARREN WASTELAND LOOKING FOR ANYTHING OF USE, AND WHEN YOU DO FIND SOMETHING, YOUR ALIVE BARELY LONG ENOUGH TO USE IT.\n\nTAKING A MOMENT TO LIST THE PROS AND CONS..\n\nPROS:\n- ATMOSPHERE LOOKS GREAT FOR BEING A ALPHA\n\n- COOL CONCEPT\n\n- AI HARVESTER CONCEPT IS AWESOME\n\nCONS:\n- BULLET TO DAMAGE RATIO IS TOO STEEP. ENEMY CAN LITERALLY KILL YOU IN TWO SHOTS.\n\n- FLEEING THE ATTACKING ENEMY IS EQUALLY AS USELESS AS THE FIRST BULLET HIT WILL RENDER YOUR FLEEING CAPABILITIES TO THAT OF AN ELDERLY WOMAN WITH A WALKER ON A BEACH. THIS IN TURN WILL ALLOW THE ATTACKER TO LITERALLY WALK UP TO YOUR CRAWLING CHARACTER AND FINISH YOU OFF.\n\n- ENEMY CAN FIND YOU FROM A MILE AWAY. SO HIDING IS USELESS AS WELL.\n\n- BUILDING FORTS IS FUN... UNTIL THE ENEMY COME WALKING UP TO YOUR BASE AND WALK THROUGH THE WALLS. LITERALLY.\n\n- BUILDINGS ARE JUST ABOUT COMPLETELY UNACCESSABLE. DOORS DONT OPEN/CLOSE, AND BUILDINGS WITH DOORS CLOSED ARE PRETTY MUCH EMPTY MODELS WITH NO INTERIOR. THOSE THAT ARE OPEN ARE ONLY BARREN HUSKS WITH MAYBE ONE HALLWAY AND ROOM.\n\n- HACKING CONCEPT IS ATTRACTIVE, BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE NEW TO THE GAME WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND AN OUNCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING. GAME OFFERS A "HELP" OPTION, BUT YOU MAY AS WELL BE READING CHINESE.\n\n- HACKING OF AI TAKES TIME, EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEYRE DOING. IN THE TIME YOUR COMPLETELY OCCUPIED WITH HACKING, ROVING ENEMY WILL FIND YOU AND KILL YOU.\n\n- HACKING CAN ONLY BE COMPLETED WITHIN A 1 METER RADIUS OF THE AI/ENEMY, SO FORGET ABOUT SNEAKING UP AND CATCHING ONE OFF GUARD.\n\n- IN ORDER TO HACK, YOU MUST MAINTAIN A LOCK ON THE AI/ENEMY. ANY BREAK IN THE LOCK WILL RESTART THE INITIAL HACKING PROCESS, FORCING YOU TO START OVER. THIS MEANS THAT ANYTHING MOVING AT ALL WILL BE VERY HARD TO HACK, ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS SHOOTING AT YOU.\n\n- GETTING KILLED DOESNT RESPAWN YOU IN THE WORLD YOUVE BEEN PLAYING IN ON SINGLE PLAYER. FORGET ABOUT FINDING YOUR OLD CORPSE AND PICKING UP FROM WHERE YOU LEFT OFF. YOU DIE, GAME OVER.\n\n- MULTIPLAYER IS DECENT, BUT THERE ARE VERY FEW SERVERS SO OPTIONS ARE VERY LIMITED. DONT MAKE TOO MANY ENEMIES..\n\nOVERALL, THE CONCEPT LOOKS COOL, BUT THE GAME IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO PLAY, AND YOULL JUST FIND YOURSELF GETTING KILLED OVER AND OVER JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOUVE GOT A GRIP ON THE SITUATION. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. FIND A DIFFERENT GAME.","November 15, 2014","false","4.1"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

There are no clear messages on what to do or what happened and although this is a gameplay element I usually really enjoy (Thinking DayZ) I felt that this experience failed to provide that feeling of discovery.\n\nThe color grading and art however is definately heading in the right direction which is a rarity these days however the cities felt far to small with buildings being inaccessible. The natural areas and a large futuristic looking tower looked really good in the landscape.\n\nImho I think that this title should have had a lot more work done before it was released on early access, now it's out though I believe resources should be spent on gameplay atmoshpere and improving the backstory/what kills you/what doesn't etc","September 22, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","2"

I was so hyped up for this just from watching the one trailer bought it as soon as I got home. I did the tutorial and jumped right into multiplayer cause thats where I have most of my fun. Played about an hour of the game 4-5 matches and I can say the only thing I found from walking to 4 different areas was 1 axe, a Glow stick type thing and a book to build a base. But only stopping to pick those things up. I spent the good 50 minutes of the hour I played walking. Not seeing a single other player. First second and third game I got 1 shot by an AI robot trying to go into maybe 3 of the 50 buildings i saw that you can actually go inside. Now on my last game I was being chased by a person or what I think was a person it was only me and him left and he followed me forever. Well i decided to sit and wait for him to come sure enough though I walk around the side of the building and one shot again. Now I wasn't sure if it was a real player or AI but one shot should no kill someone. Also you should be able to walk into all the buildings too loot stuff. Not just look at them like scenery. But the thing that annoys me most about this game is. I want to survive I want to fend for my life I want to find cool stuff on the ground and build a house to post up in. But that will never happen its Walking Simulator 2014 with the occasional angry one shotting AI.\n\nIn all essence the single player works very well but the multiplayer at its core is a great concept. Hell it's the hunger games with robots. But the way he has set up the multiplayer aspect of the game is poor. Poor doesn't even describe what multiplayer is. It's a nonfunctional walking wasteland. You will literally pay 15$ to walk. I mean walk for miles coming across every single building, busted up playground or crevice just to brough down by sadness that there is nothing around for you to use. But wait it gets better along that 30 minutes of walking you will encounter and AI that will follow you until you die. And guess what you have no way to defend youself because yes he does have a gun and of course you have no way  to defend yourself.\n\nSo as the game sits right now it is one word and one word only Trash. There are other survival games that got there ♥♥♥♥ together. I mean look at rust hundreds of bugs at it stat but you know what I was able to find guns and kill people. I could fend myself from all the animals and even when there were hackers I could kill them.

The video that shows you what the game is like contains everything the game has to offer.

This game is very very intresting. Just this Fallout style feel to it makes me like it even more. The game seems to be really hardcore in a few ways. You can get shot once and you're dead or all the sudden out of nowhere there are 5 robots that show up and try to kill you.\n\nItems are extreamly hard to find, atleast the items you want to find.
