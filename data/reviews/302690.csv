If you're looking at this game, buy it! In the first hour I'm already laughing and enjoying this game. I like the art and the music. It's charming.\n\nI don't usually play point and click games, but this one got my attention and the story is pretty dang spiffy to boot! I mean what would a point and click adventure be without story I guess? It's also on sale for it's first week on steam (Basically, seeing as it's supposed to be on sale for 6 days, 6 hours and 6 minutes at 66% off!) I mean. Not to say this needs to be on sale, I'd happily buy it full price. I just happened to stumble upon it on its first day on Steam.\nI'm looking forward to this studios future works.\n\n(After Finishing the game)\nThis game gives you everything you need to finish the story. You just have to pay attention! A lot of "Aha!" moments I must say. The ridiculousness of the story is so great and charming, the ending? Wowzers I cannot wait to see where it goes!

The main soundtrack of the game is a heavy metal low-fidelity music that sounded like crap.  But don't press the exit button just yet.  Wait until you click on the characters and read their dialogues.  It will really crack you up.\nThe game's primary saving grace were the characters in this game because they were so funny and witty.  There are no sounds when they speak though,  it is only text-based.  There are tons of jokes here with a lot of pop culture and movie references.\nAnother wrong impression I made about the game was that, I thought it would be another generic zombie game, but this is definitely not.  It gives us a unique twist on how the zombie plague occured.  It was not viral but something else.  Got you interested yet?\nI'm very proud of indiegame developers who hit the mark when it comes to game development.  Kudos to you Walk Thru Walls Studios.\nThe main character that you play is a true die hard heavy metal music fan.  But for a metal head slacker, he is quite a smart aleck and knows a lot of scientific sheet and stuff.\nThe game is a typical point and click adventure game.  You get your usual dose of of puzzles to solve with a "CLEVER" hint system when you get stuck and don't know what to do.  Your ultimate objective is to escape the building you are trapped-in and to survive the zombie horde trying to enter the premises.  The game has a great and surprising ending, you'll see.\nIn conclusion, the graphics are adequate and unique, the sound is terrible and low quality, the gameplay is a lot of fun and the story is unlike anything else.  I recommend this game.  You won't regret it.","April 30, 2015","true","7.0"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","26","29","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/302690/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","TL;DR Traditional comedy/horror point & click, with a great sense of humour and decent puzzles. If you don't mind a bit of cartoonish gore and some crude jokes in your adventure games, it should provide you around 3 hours of solid fun.\n\nMetal Dead first came out at 2011, as the very low budget brain child of the two aussie developers behind Walk Thru Walls Studios. Despite its very basic art style, the low-fi music, the lack of voice acting, the short playtime and some minor (non game-breaking) bugs here and there, it completely embraces its crazy humour and oddball set of characters and ends up managing to both charm and entertain.\n\nImmediately after your unlikely duo of metalhead heroes manage to crash their car right in front of what appears to be Zombie Central, everything turns from weird to weirder; including your protagonist Malcolm ending up with one of the funniest hint delivery systems in gaming history stuffed right into his pocket. (Feel free to use it now and then even if you aren't stuck, it offers some very amusing moments). Any more story details will, I feel, take away from your enjoyment, but suffice to say that the writing is quite polished. The dialogues are successful in delivering both jokes and a sense of character, and the insane plot ends up holding your interest despite (or because of) its absurdity. There are some unexpected twists and turns to enjoy, plus an oddball cast of engaging folks to save - or escort to their inevitable comedic demise. And while much of the humour could qualify as crude or gross, it somehow still manages to hit the mark more often than not.  As for the puzzles, they are all inventory based and mostly logical. I was happy to see that they tended to be backed up by dialogue and built neatly into the story instead of distracting from it. The difficulty isn't very high, but some of them are clever nonetheless.\n\nThere is something to be said about developers that succeed in making something this fun out of such a low budget, but you should still come to this game understanding that corners were (mostly gracefully) cut. The low-fi metal music has some nice moments, but I was more impressed with the clever use of sound effects that help emphasise the right points in the plot, either for shock value or for comedic effects. Similarly, the cartoonish art style may have character but is nonetheless very basic and doesn't scale well in larger monitors. However the animation saves it and deserves praise for its fluidity.\n\nSo Metal Dead is a fun little game, provided it finds the right audience that will appreciate its wacky sense of humor. I enjoyed replaying it, and I'm looking forward to Metal Dead: Encore[www.walkthruwalls.com], which is expected to stomp into our lives sometime in the next year or so.","November 14, 2015","true","6.5"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

I doubt it will win any awards but you can expect maybe 6 hours of light hearted entertainment from an old school point and click.\n\nDon't be put off by the simple art style or the lack of voicing. The best bits of the game come from the conversation between the eccentric characters and well designed (almost exclusively) logical puzzles. There were enough good one-liners to keep me chuckling all the way through. Some people may be put off by the amount of toilet humour but I wasn't.\n\nTwo negative points:\nSections of the game had some annoyingly repetetive music.\nThe interface used 4 interaction types: look, use, walk and talk. Just like most point and clicks  did back in the 90s. I actually wish more games had this but the designers of this game got a bit fussy over how big the hotspots were so you might find yourself stuck for a while even when you've been trying to do the right thing.\nThere are a bunch of references you won't get if you didn't play such things as 'Leisure Suit Larry'.  I didn't play it so there were a lot of moments where I was a bit confused.\n\nI definitely recommend this to point and click fans\n","November 27, 2014","true","17.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","1"

It's what a point and click game should be, short, simple, and easy to use. The humor is witty, the story is interesting and the characters are enjoyable, but what makes Metal Dead so fun is the freedom for the player to explore and discover which would leave you at over the 4 hour mark.

The artwork was clearly done in MS Paint. There's no voice acting. It's not a game for everyone.\n\nBut it does have something that a lot of modern games lack: character. It embraces the metal music theme (not unlike Double Fine's Brutal Legend) and it's continually funny, although in a dark, macabre way most of the time.\n\nSo if you want a straightforward game to waste a few hours with and you enjoy bad puns, pixelated gore, and absurd situations then Metal Dead is probably worth a quick play through.

He loves beer, cones, blast beats and his best friend Ronnie (Beavis + Butthead + a beard), but he is into death metal more than death period. With the undead apocalypse well underway, we find him sitting in Ronnie's car as they drive into the night - my bad, the Eternal Foreboding Grimdark - until an unfortunate accident strands them at the foot of a building towards which all the zombies seem to be converging, and threatens to separate them for good. Fear not! Science will help them reunite, and they will forge the kind of bond you can only experience with someone when you have spent a lot of time near their soiled underwear.\nJust don't call Ronnie a punk lest he bites you where it counts.\n\nI was surprised to find a very traditional point'n'click experience in Metal Dead. I'm not sure what I expected from a cursory glance; some kind of retro indie shooter/platformer? This is straightforward, old-school adventurin'. My playtime reaches almost 6 hours and that barely includes any time for backtracking and aimless wandering, because I'm that good - and mostly because the puzzles are deceptively well-designed and the flow is logical all the way to the end, even when the environment opens up.\nIn a way I'm sorry I didn't have to resort to the hint system, which is highly original and fun in its implementation.\nIt wasn't 6 solid hours of play though, as I'm so metal that I went to cook dinner IN THE MIDDLE OF A DAMN ZOMBIE INVASION. A meat dinner, of course! I'm not a hippie!

Neither mind-numbingly hard nor vapidly easy (actually quite 'goldilocks just-right' in the difficulty department), the game doesn't revolutionized the genre or anything but it DOES tell a fun and interesting story, and for something so low-frills actually has some interesting characters. I didn't expect much, but my expectations were well exceeded. Only took me a couple of sessions to finish it, but I have no regrets -- I've been burned on steam before by games promising retro-thrills and substance over style -- this is not one of those games. It stands well on it's strengths and delivers on it's promises. It was fun, interesting, and a good "candy" play -- a puzzle game for a relaxed sunday where you won't need a walkthrough, just a little focus and dedication to get the job done. I wish more games like this would get made - value titles that are like the free-fare on newgrounds, but cranked a little further, a little longer, and a little better. No regrets. Would play the sequel! <3","May 9, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is filled with hilarious dialog (well, it's funny once) as two metal heads who somehow found yourselves in the middle of zombie apocalypse, your travel companion, Ronnie, met an untimely end... but not quite. As you encounter zany characters, from mad scientist to drill sargeant and much more, all with hilarious dialog options, and you can interact with objects by touching, looking... and tasting, you'll get even more hilarious reactions.\n\nThe graphics are low-fi, not low as voxel or deliberate sprite-y, but it's 2D, and very 2D.\n\nOnce you're in the game, the game runs the standard gamut of "talk to character, figure out what he wants, which is probably elsewhere, held by somebody, who wants something else, and so on." So the game is basically traveling back and forth, figure out what is available, how to get what you wanted (either a trade or distract and steal), and so on. Obviously, the items you encounter along the way, and the zany characters (some of whom chose to ignore the zombie apocalypse around them)  leads to even more hilarious situations and dialog.\n\nIn other words, the fun of the game is in finding all the dialog gems by doing things not quite right, rather than speed through the game picking the right solution at every turn.\n\nSo if you like adventure games, relatively simple puzzles (no forced "solve this puzzle box to advance" here) and hilarious dialog (at least to me), this is your game.","September 24, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can't reveal spoilers obviously, but it's worth 5 bucks to sit down and just try and play it.\nIt has a certain charm to it in the way that it's drawn and it both can be fun to just look at and can be seen as rather bland. In some instances, the characters look great for how simple the crayon-simple designs are, others not so much like the head security guard. Just something about him seemed off in design.\nThe puzzles are good but seem random with some of their answers and solutions however I was able to figure them out eventually. It strikes me really as a game you'd give to your kids if it didn't have some adult themes. But I do look forward to an eventual sequel.\n\nOverall Review? It's a simple couple hours of clean, harmless fun with corny jokes and silly characters with an okayish ending. The game looks alright and it didn't bug out at all and I tried everything I could think of.

It's fairly simple, light-hearted and fun. It only runs for about 3-4 hours depending on whether you get stuck on any puzzles (I did once, goddammit) but what more do you expect for a few bucks? What's great about it is that you can see the people who made this have a good sense of humour. It doesn't always hit the mark but it's a great opening effort. Add it to your Wishlist and grab it in the Steam sale.","April 11","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game makes a genuine attempt at what it tries to do, but the puzzles are fairly routine,  much of the humour falls flat, the music isn't great, and most of the characters aren't particularly noteworthy.  If you're tempted by this, you should consider "Ben There, Dan That" and "Time Gentlemen, Please".  Much funnier, with some excellent puzzles.\n\nI stopped at what I believe is almost halfway through (according to achievements, and by eyeballing a walkthrough I looked at to check progress), and my playtime was a bit over an hour.  I could have refunded it, but I'd still like to support these devs, as I do believe they have talent and potential.

It can get boring after a little especially if you don't know what to do, the resolution is small, and cannot be changed. It lags/stutters randomly... repetitive music to the point of extreme annoyance... but other than that, it is pretty good. I enjoyed the dialogue, although sometimes it went by too fast. Plot twists, references, gore, a severed head!\nSome people have negative feelings with 'no voice acting', but I don't; lets me read the characters the way I want them to be. I just wish the text stayed on screen for a fraction longer.\nThe art style is Good. It reminded me of the flash games I'd play at school during lunch. It's not bad, just seemed lacking in something.\nAnimations were meh, but good enough I suppose.\nNavigation:  You are given 4(+1) options for interacting: Look, Use/take/etc, Talk, Walk (and using items from inventory on objects in the room-- Standard in P&C). You have to right click to cycle through each one and it can be rather annoying; often over-click and select the wrong one. Get used to it eventually, but still get the odd extra click so I have to cycle through them again just to talk to someone. **I'm not a huge fan of Point & Clicks.\nSound: Music sounds like something you'd get from DOOM. Pretty good soundtrack, but extremely repetitive. Sound effects are decent.\nStory: Plot-twists for your plot-twists.\nOther notes: Random lag/stutters can be annoying. Manual save system, so save often.\n* Only takes about 2-2.5 hours to beat. Maybe less if you follow a guide/know what you're doing.\nEasy 100% achievements if you're into that.. (a few hidden ones that can be locked if you advance in the game too quickly - check a guide)\n\nHighly recommend this game.

The characters are very nice, the game constantly makes fun of classic zombie-film/game stereotypes, which is great. The story was very enjoyable and the whole metal-zombieapocalypse-friendship-comedy combination is definately winning. If you like oldschool point and click adventures, then this is a game for you. Gameflow was also quite  good in my playthrough: when I finished one area the next usually already opened up, without getting stuck too much. I only needed a walkthrough 1 or 2 times. The fact that there are no voice actors would trouble a few people, but I never felt it was necesary, the humor still works. It's the adventure that the DoubleFine oldschool Kickstarter Adventure SHOULD have been.","November 29, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It focuses on the story instead, which is a standard zombie survival scenario, where you and a bunch of other people are trapped in a building (this time a hospital) and try to escape before the undead overrun you.\nMany indie adventure games tend to have problems with puzzles that are either way too obvious or just insanely overcomplicated. Although Metal Dead has parts which need some luck or trial and error (which is a little awkward thanks to the not too user friendly interface), it’s almost impossible to get hopelessly stuck.\n\nIn essence, it may be like a Flash game with a price tag attached to it, but it’s enjoyable and fairly long for that price.","March 30, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Zombies in media have gotten stale after a boom of popularity in the past 8 years, but its to Metal Deads credit that none of the situations the game throws at you seem anything but. The game is fairly short, but is at a perfect length in terms of pacing. The puzzles are enough to be taxing, but rarely will you find yourself getting stuck, thanks to an unlikely companion who can give you a hint for the situation at hand. The game's easthetic and interface looks pretty ugly (as heavy metal should be), although the limited soundtrack can get repetative, and unfortunatlely grating. More music variety would elevate this title to a near perfect point and click adventure that can rub shoulders with Tim Shaffers greats, but even with that one glaring flaw, this game does more than enough right to warrant a recomendation. The laughs are worth it, metalhead or not.\n\nPROS:\nstrong characterization, masterful imaginative writing.\nGets funnier as the game progresses.\nDoesnt cave in to the niche, metlaheads and nonmetalheads will equally enjoy\nhas a distinct aesthetic....\n\nCONS:\n....that is a little on the ugly side\nlooping soundtrack can annoy in certain sections.\n\n9/10","November 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One of, if not the, best point-n-click adventure I've played.\nAnd it's using retro graphics and is about the zombie apocalypse??  Wow, even I didn't see this one coming...  But it really was a great surprise just to see how well done, funny, and entertaining this game was!  Metal Dead is a light-hearted comedy game in the zombie apocalypse genre; definitely not deserving the horror tag Steam has associated with it.\n\nThe Good:+ Logical Puzzles.  Wow -- No random applying inventory items to every object in a room hoping for a random connection to move the story along like so many other point-and-click adventures.\n+ Funny dialog.\n+ Lots of dialog.  You can interact with about everything and the game will give a unique response.  Very well done.\n+ Funny events and situations.  It's just a fun and funny game.\n+ Can't return to areas that are completed.  Closing off areas that are already completed saves you a lot of time exploring areas that have nothing to do with the current puzzle.  It kindly tells you that the area is done and also the general idea of where you should be looking to continue the game.\n+ Hilarious hint system.  Simply the best hint system I've seen in a point-and-click adventure.\n\nThe Eh:~ The music.  There's very little and it's repetitive.  I guess it "sets the mood" of an 80s game since it's using midi, but they definitely could have used more music.  However, what is there isn't distracting, so overall it's ok.\n\n~ Not always obvious what you have to do.  I'll admit I had to resort to a guide on one spot in the game (I couldn't find a pipe to fix the leak, and I was trying to get the wrong pipe from the wrong location), and it also took me awhile just to get out of the car at the very beginning of the game to get the game started.  But these are mostly "on me".\n\nThe Bad:- Nothing.  Can't think of anything really...  I normally don't like 80's retro graphics, but this game suited that style very well and I liked it.\n\n\nAt almost 5 hours exactly it took me longer than most people to finish this game.  This time includes however quite a bit of exploring time (as I really enjoyed the dialog and responses!) and I also repeated one section so I could get a Steam Achievement.  Time I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nI highly recommend this point-n-click, zombie-apocalypse, hilarious adventure game.

Personally, I liked the game, but I would only recommend it for die-hard graphic adventure fans who are also partial to horror comedy. (In this case, I totally fit the target demographic.)\n\nThe Good: Fun, engaging zombie comedy plot -- it plays like the b@stard child of Shaun of the Dead and Maniac Mansion. The story wisely puts characters ahead of gimmicks -- it does not require familiarity with *specific* aspects of zombie lore or heavy metal culture to enjoy. The big reveal in the end made the gameplay feel worth it.\n\nThe Bad: The gameplay is almost never time-sensitive and doesn't quite capture the dread and tension of an ongoing zombie apocalypse. The puzzles lack challenge for veteran adventure gamers. Minimal replay value once you've finished it.\n\nThe Ugly: The stylized character design -- heavily influenced by Jhonen Vasquez (Invader Zim, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac) -- is a niche taste. I was fine with it but I can see why others might not be.","November 7, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/302690/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","A nice little indie adventure made with Adventure Game Studio, which is a pretty old and creaky engine by today's standards, but also has a proven track record of being able to perform miracles (like Time Gentlemen, Please!) in capable hands. Succeeding with AGS demands a lot from the writing department, and this is where Metal Dead shines.\n\nThe story follows the exploits of two metalheads in the middle of an zombie outbreak, and is just about as anarchistic that can be imagined from the premise. The game does not skimp on the gore, but it's all presented with a deftly light and funny touch and endearingly crude graphics. In fact, the game's sense of humor is its strongest asset: The dialogue and writing is generally quite funny and pokes a lot of fun at various pop and alternative culture phenomenons.\n\nThe puzzles are surprisingly logical as well, which does mean the game is a bit on the easy side. I don't really see that as a negative thing, however - It keeps the narrative moving and the jokes incoming, and Metal Dead is above all entertaining throughout its duration. It's not quite as laugh-out-loud funny as the Ben & Dan games, but worth experiencing nevertheless. Rough on the outside, but beats a lot of the generic adventure bulk put out by actual publishers with ease.","October 20, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

In Metal Dead you take on the role of Malcolm. He and his buddy Ronnie are driving through the zombie apocalypse   and crash theyre car near a building. When they enter they find out that theres a helicopter on the roof and theres a pilot which can take you some place safe. So its up to you to clear a path to the roof and escape the zombie madness. So how is Metal Dead ? Its probably the best adventure game i have ever played. The game is a great omage to the classics and its probably one of the funniest game i have played too. The game is quite simple for the most part but some puzzles did leave me scratching my head because you really need to remember what kinda stuff is lying around that will help you. When you enter the building you find out youre not alone and theres a bunch of people who are survivors staying in the building and trying to stay alive. Some of them are weird and some of them scary but it always is funny to see what they have to say. So now for the pros: the game is beutifull to look at and the hand drawn enviroments look great. Outstanding soundtrack. Well thought out puzzles. Funny and Smart writing, Now for the cons: Short. Overall Metal Dead is an outstanding game and i suggest you play it no matter what. I suggest you get this at full price. You wont be dissapointed. I give Metal Dead a 9/10","October 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Unfortunately however it doesn't really live up to this promise either as a game or as a humorous take on the genre and subculture. The game itself is only a few hours long which for the price is about right, but during those three or so hours it doesn't really do much. Your character simply progresses from room to room picking up items and collecting elevator access cards from other characters in a rather dull manner with uninteresting and sometimes annoying controls, making for a rather drab playing experience. This could easily be at least partially salvaged by the story, aesthetic or humour the game clearly aims for but it doesn't really nail this either. Jokes are very surface level and basic but lacking the raw punch to actually produce real laughs. It has a couple of mild smirk-worthy moments, but nothing inspiring anything more and a couple of comments made by characters are somewhat questionable. Dialogue isn't exactly invigorating, characters are stereotypical without actually making jabs at those too much, and most disappointingly of all the comical look at metal itself it seems to suggest is nothing to write home about. Once in a while the two main characters will refer to something as "brutal" in a Metalocalypse-esque fashion and South Park-ish usage of metal to drive away enemies is central to the climax (in fairness the root explanation of the zombie apocalypse is more creative than many, if a little random), but anything beyond that which would resonate with members of that subculture is painfully lacking, and an ending comment by one character on how using image to define yourself and your deeds is no worse than being mindless undead just comes across as tacked on, ill thought out and a little preachy with absolutely nothing coming prior to set up or question the issue. Ultimately it's not an awful way to spend a small handful of hours especially for the price but where there was potential to make something unique, entertaining and memorable there's a merely serviceable game with underwritten jokes and subtext and a whiff of missed opportunity.","October 27, 2015","false","3.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I bought it this morning after smoking my wake up blunt because it was cheap and advertised as hilarious so I figured why not?  It is not hilarious despite being high I dont remember laughing out loud at anything, maybe a smirk here or there.  Also I got all the achievements in under 4 hours, 1 playthrough and then loading a previous save to get the last 3 was all it took.","October 9, 2014","false","3.6"," 1 of 26 people (4%) found this review helpful","4","1","26","0","1"

It's a nice short Indie game. And credits to the makers of the game!\n\nNow\nThe story is a funny (but a question of taste).\nThe graphic: 8-Bit comic style: nice and individuelle (question of taste)\nThe dialog... seemed okay!\nThe music... yeah... 8-Bit (which is nice!) but talking about Metal ... disappointing (there are much older 8-Bit games that can do this much better!? why not reference to that?)\nSounds effect... could be made much better... but yeah sure why not...\nAchievements? Cool!\nGamecontrol... yeah... you can play! but come on... in 2014 that should be made better! (Ever played a LucasArts?)\nGameplay... 4 hours Story time. Impressive and absolut ok!\n\nIn my opinion... there where many steps that could be made just better with a litte bit more gaming expierence from other point and clicks...\n\nSo all in all: OK and Walk Thru Walls Studios GO4IT!\n4,99€ is it not quite worth it... but I am looking for a sequel with a little bit better gaming experience ;)\n\nRecommendation: "Meh" would be the real answer... but since I have to choose one and "No" wouldn't be quite fair: Yes.
