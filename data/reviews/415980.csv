All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEW\nQuatro Luzes  is a third person puzzle platformer, with emphasis on platforming.  lots of jumping, falling to your death, and screen-punching-frustration because this game's fundemental mechanic makes the platforming hard.  the game revolves around the ability to switch worlds (white to red to green and so on), and in each world certain platforms appear or move only in that world, which makes many of the jumping require split second switching between worlds while in mid air.  which has saddly prevented me from getting near the end of the game.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/415980/\n═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONS\nPros: unique world switching mechanic (i actually like it despite the diffeculty\ninstictive collect-them-all element\ncolorful and relaxing to the eyesCons: fixed camera angle (doesn't sound too bad at first, but it screwes you over later in the game)\nsoundtrack is a piano playing constantly (it is calm and reaxing at first, but gets realy annoying after a while)\nheavy feeling to the movement and jumping═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nscore: 7/10\n\nThis game is for platforming fans who like jumping on platformes between worlds in a relaxing enviroment trying to collect blue and yellow orbs.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curtations here!","November 18, 2015","true","3.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","2"

Those problems include leaving the level after collecting 1 wisp and the spaced out checkpoints later on in the game. The only problems that remain are the music and the camera. Now the music is not bad, it’s actually very good, but there is only one track the plays in the levels as I have noticed. It gets annoying after a while. Also the fixed camera can get in the way in a few levels, but isn’t as bad as it first seemed. Despite the problems I still feel this is a solid game. Most of what I said in the first impression still applies. Overall I have to say the game is worth a purchase especially with many of the initial problems being cleaned up rather nicely. It shows the developer is keeping a close eye on the game, which is important.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION:\n\nFrom what I have played thus far, I have to say this is a charming puzzle platformer with neat puzzles and visuals on top of some great music. The game is a simple 3D platforming game with a unique twist which is that you can shift between multiple worlds to help progress in any given level. The concept is simple but it sets up for some really cool puzzles. The controls at first were a bit strange and the fact that you couldn’t control the camera was annoying, but in all honesty it wasn’t that bad once I got used to it. And even if you mess up for whatever reason, the game is very forgiving in that it usually spawns you pretty close to where you died last. Also there are no lives, so you can die as much as you want.\n\nThe other aspect to the game is the aesthetics. While it’s not the absolute prettiest game I have ever seen, it is still visually appealing. The game does a great job with the colors, making them vibrant but not painful to look at. The music is great. So far it has all been piano pieces that fit the games atmosphere perfectly, being calm and serene.\n\nMy only problem with the game thus far is the fact that when you collect a wisp which is essential for moving on in the game, you exit the level immediately. The problem with this is that there is usually more than 1 wisp per level, meaning you have to go through a portion of the level again to get the other wisp. It’s pretty annoying, but the levels are not too long, so it is not a deal breaker. Also most extra wisps are not at the end of the level so you don’t necessarily have to go through an entire level twice to get them.\n\nOverall this is a great little game that is definitely worth the price tag. From what I can tell by the progress I made in an hour, the game should last around 5 hours. I could be wrong with this, but that is my estimate based on the progress thus far. Its aesthetically pleasing and most importantly a fun puzzle platformer","November 15, 2015","true","4.3"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/415980/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Before I begin this nutshell I’d like to give a personal note of appreciation to Jardel Elias. By the time that this Indie Spotlight is posted onto Steamified I will have worked and communicated with over fifty developers and publishers for Steamified this year. That’s a lot of developers for a site that its only January 13. The more games that we post the more Steamified proves itself as a place where Indie developers can get their games exposure on Steam and the better our reputation becomes. It takes guts to place your faith in a new company and a new brand, doubly so when that the representative from that brand is asking you for your hard earned money or the gaming equivalent for developers – keys for the game that they’ve poured their heart and soul into making. However, that is what Jardel – and other developers and publishers – have done with Steamified. Why I like to point out Jardel and Quatro Luzes specifically is that they were among the first to do so before the site even launched again. Therefore he has earned his place on our Great Wall of Thanks Mate.\n\nIf Jardel Elias was one of the first then why did it take so long to post his game to our site? A significant part of the answer is that he was working hard towards a major update for his game, Quatro Luzes. The patch was significant as it featured customizable hotkeys, a profile manager and more.\n\nWe live in an age where developers often stop working on games upon release or worse when they’re not even out of early access. Therefore it is always great to see a developer that continues adding, updating and fixing their games post-release. It’s something that I always admire.\n\nThe greatest strengths in Quatro Luzes is that it is a colorful game that accomplishes just enough artistically to make it easy on the eyes while playing. The piano playing soundtrack is nice enough but I can appreciate where others feel that it would become bothersome and grating. Perhaps its because I gained a great appreciation of the piano from an early age. My mother had a piano and I learned to play. The game world is also very relaxing and the game emerges as a good title to play casually. There is no way that I could have completed the game in one sitting. And I still need to complete things in game.\n\nThere are, however, some weaknesses in the game. For example, I’m not a fan of the fixed camera angle. It makes the game frustrating to play at times as you really need to be able to judge your jumps and your moves in order to advance and I feel that the camera set up impedes that. It’s not an all of the time thing but it happens frequently enough to make it a regular source of frustration. I also feel that the jumping mechanic isn’t as tight as it could be. You need to jump up and scale towers in the game and it occasionally feels as though the mechanic isn’t very consistent. However, I’m willing to claim some responsibility of it being a skill issue rather than purely a technical one.\n\nIn all, I’m very appreciative of Jardel Elias. He has a very solid game in Quatro Luzes. It’s another game that wont win any prizes for best in show but it is a good game to play casually. Fans of jumping platformers will enjoy this one especially.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 14","true","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While the concept is interesting in of itself, that is not enough to over look the many flaws this game has. With a fixed camera, awkward platforming, and piano music that will drive you insane I strongly recommend that you give this one a pass. There are better puzzle platformers out there for you to enjoy.","April 14","false","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
