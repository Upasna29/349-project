If you should play this game, you will. :)\n\nImagine this:\n\nYou are the Captain of a Heavy Cruiser. You are in a space fight. Its your ship against two others.\nThe difference: Your ship is not very manoeuvrable. Its a large vessel. The term "Heavy" is no coincidence.\nThe two enemies are smaller, Less powerfull, but more manoeuvrable.\n\nSo, Captain! Give some orders! What are we going to do?\n\nYou decide to go straight in. Shields up, Weapons up! Give them everything we got!\n\nAfter a short time, you will realise, that this may not be very effective.\n\nWell, Captain. We need a new plan. Decide!\n"Plan B:\nFirst, we are using our lasers! Target for their shield device. Without shields, they are helpless."\n\nHere we go. We are firing. First hit. Second hit. Minor damage to their shield device. Looks good.\nThen, our lasers stop firing.\n\nWhy?\nBecause, as mentioned, the enemies are more manoeuvrable than we are. They got behind your ship. And they keep firing.\n\n(Note: The good thing is, you dont have to press any buttons to turn your ship around. Your ship will do this for you. Tell the ship where to go, and it will do so. Because if you would also have to navigate while fighting, this would turn into a mess ..... unless you are George Takei)\n\nBut here we go. Your Ship-AI activates your thrusters (Yes, you can see them doing so and it looks great). Your ship turns around. Target in front of us. First hit. Second hit. Third hit. Your lasers keep firing! HAHAHA! TAKE THIS YOU B*******!  What?\n...... no damage?\n\nWhy?\nWell, the enemy ship did just turn around. The shield device is located at the top. Your lasers DID hit the target, but the wrong side. The lasers have no effect on the Hull and there is no shield device at the rear of that vessel.\nThe enemies keep firing.\n\n"To Hell with them! Launch the Fighter Squadron!"\n"But Sir, they ....."\n"ATTACK!"\n\n(Note: Fighters and Bombers are very effective in destroying devices. And they are fast. Rotation of enemy ships does not bother them)\n\nYour fighters are going in.\n"They wont know what hit them!"\n\nWell .... your Officer tried to warn you. They have a laser flak system. Perfect for ........\n\nAI Voice: "Fighter Squadron lost!"\n\nDid i mention, that the enemies kept firing?\n\nNow you may say: "What kind of idiot would do that?" I would say: "Vice-Admiral Norbank!" :)\n\nYou will see.\n\n\nThere are a lot of things that can go wrong. Most of the time, it is your fault. But you will learn from your mistakes.\nAfter reloading, you will take down their flak and launch your fighters, or you will focus on their engines so that they wont be able to outmanoeuvre you.\nShields of the first ship are down? Let your laser aim for the devices of the second ship and activate your hull damaging weapons to finish the first one. There are a lot of possibilities.\n\nThere are situations, when you need a lot of patience. Even when flying trough space. Your ships wont charge in an instant after you gave the "Move" command! They are Heavy Cruisers with Fusion Engines! What do you expect?\nIt will take two seconds to heat up, then your ship will start moving.\nSimple rule: The bigger they are, the slower they move.\n\nLast words:\nThe Mission "The Fight for Earth" was one of the most entertaining missions i have ever played in a Space-Sim. And it was one of the hardest missions in this game. (Dont worry, you WILL restart the mission if you play it for the first time)\nAdvice: Dont start with the highest difficulty level. You wont stand a chance.\n\nMy opinion: Yes! It is a good game. I had a lot of fun playing it.\nIt is not a perfect game but it many good moments, it is entertaining (very important for a game) and it has an awesome "Final" Battle.\nTherefore: 6.5 out of 10.","July 5, 2014","true","39.6"," 124 of 131 people (95%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","95","124","131","13","9"

I can honestly say that this game nails capital ship combat, far better than any game I have played before.\n\nShip maneuvering feels solid.  It feels like you are actually commanding a ship with mass, and not something like a fighter.  Don't expect to be moving fast or nimbly.  A great touch is the fact the game designers put a lot of though in the design of the ships, putting breaking engines in front as well as smaller engines around the ships that fire when the ship is adjusting course or holding position.  It's nice to see a game where ships actually follow the laws of physics and don't just stop like someone pressed on the brake.\n\nBecause of the pace of the ships, this game is a lot more focused on tactics than other strategy games.  You have to really pay attention to your mission onjectives and thus ship loadouts, as picking the wrong setup can lead to mission failure easily.  There is a learning curve due to the level of complexity in targeting and ship management, but it is not intimidating.\n\nA bonus with this game is that is moddable, so if you wish you can command a Battlestar or even one of the destroyers from Babylon 5.  I would recommend playing the vanilla game through first before trying out the mods.\n\nIf you are really into tactical strategy games involving capital ships, you can't go wrong picking this title up.  Casual fans of RTS games may want to wait until it is on sale though because the learning curve may frustrate some.","October 13, 2015","true","5.1"," 102 of 103 people (99%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","99","102","103","0","6"

Real time with pause -gameplay works ok and reminds me of old Interplay classic game "Star Trek: Starfleet Command".\n\nDuring a battle, various weapons and resources play differing roles. Lasers and other beam weapons are used mainly for disabling enemy devices. Large missiles are slow and can be shot down with small fighters or FLAK-systems but have massive blast radius. Gatling guns, rail guns, plasma weapons and torpedoes are for hull destruction. Energy bombs are used for anti-shield purposes. Weapon power generators. Sensor arrays for detecting enemy equipment, ECM systems, ECCM systems!! And your battleship can hold few squadrons of small fighters, bombers, gunboats (or shuttles packed with space marine commando teams).\n\nVisually game still looks very good after all of these years! The game difficulty can be pretty frustrating.. Even beginner difficulty level is really hard. Players who don’t manage their fleets very carefully are going to find themselves in pretty terrible situations, fast and brutal!\n\n\nSome useful keyboard shortcuts (not explained in tutorial mode during first missions):\n[ N ] - Yes! You actually can create custom NAV points!\n[ S ] - Select all fighters and other smaller craft.\n[ A ] - Select all large ships.\n[ CTRL ] + [ S ] - Select all fighters from selected large ship.\n[ M ] - Manual control panel on or off.

The tactical battles are difficult but fun and upgrading your ships with new goodies is gratifying. It's even fun to hate Admiral Norbank, who has got to be one of the biggest asses ever put into a video game. The gameplay is unique in that you have a relatively small fleet of large, powerful capital ships that do not maneuver quickly and have multiple weapon systems. They have a weight to them that feels awesome.\n\nThere are a lot of tools available for modding the game but precious little has been done with them... not sure why. I got the game for $2.49, figuring for that price I could hardly go wrong. I was completely stunned at what I got and I can't figure out how I managed to miss this gem. Even if it isn't on sale it's worth every penny. If you like Sins of a Solar Empire or Homeworld then I can't imagine how you wouldn't like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident. Oh... and the Angelwing is simply an awesome craft that you can hardly help getting attached to.\n\nI've seen a lot of bad reviews that complained that the game wouldn't run or that it crashed a lot. I'm not sure what their issue is but I can say that Nexus ran fine on my system (Windows 7, Intel CPU, Nvidia GPU) and I never crashed once while playing. On my original playthrough, the game lost some key bindings when I alt-tabbed out and it didn't have any Steam Integration, so I couldn't use shift-tab to access messages and whatnot. I also had to create my own desktop shortcut, as the game wouldn't run via the Steam generated desktop shortcut. The in-game videos also ran choppy from time to time, which was odd. ALL of this has been fixed with a recent update. Current generation resolutions are supported, it has Steam Integration, and the videos now run smooth as silk, though they are somewhat low res when compared to gameplay resolutions of 1920x1080 or higher. The game always looked good but now it looks better than ever! I'm finding myself just as captivated with the story, visuals, and gameplay on my second playthrough as when I first played it. Simply astonishing! If you have been on the fence about getting Nexus, don't wait another moment.\n\nHint: Read the manual. It won't take long, as the information is very concise, but there are some nuances to successful navigation (how to create your own navigation points), using all your weapons (how to attack multiple targets at once), and managing systems that you won't get from the in-game advice popups.  :)","October 19, 2015","true","35.5"," 41 of 42 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","41","42","0","0"

Metacritics and the score is mainly bashed down due to the learning curve and massive technical aspects.\n\nMission briefings give you fully explorable solar systems, with impressive lighting looking akin to something from KSP.\nShip explosions look really good, there's no magically disappearing models, and they even launch escape pods.\nThe ships can be disabled as well and proceed to drift in space (but can still be destroyed)\nShip systems are fully modular, which is a crucial aspect of the game campaign, these systems can be targeted and disabled as well. (shoot all engines and the ship stops).\nShip movement looks far more real and is far, far less arcade like than the vast majority of mass produced space RTS you find today, they even have small directional engines on board that are fired when the ships turn.\nThe learning curve is indeed very steep, but if you can overcome the vast technical aspects the game offers you'll find yourself a space combat RTS which is Homeworld tier good, it really is worth a try, and this is a game from 2004.","May 2, 2014","true","25.3"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","36","37","0","0"

Well, I don't even know where to start with this game. I first played it when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it right away. The game is difficult, so at that time with hardly any experience in the field I got stuck pretty early in the game, specifically the scout ship mission.\n\nBoy was I in for a ride 7 years later. Everything is just the way I remembered it. Controls are a bit rough around the edges, but it is what would be expected of battleships. Aside from that and a slightly flawed AI, there is nothing I can't recommend in this game to those who love sci-fi. The story is well laid out, no particular flaws. Battles are sometimes easy, sometimes difficult, harsh and unfair, and I can't even start explaining the frustration in the last battle mission (Not to be confounded with the last mission).\n\nYet here I am, 14.5 hours into the game, finishing it for the first time. There are no words to describe my satisfaction, along with my sadness of it ending and the dismay of not ever being able to see a sequel to this magnificent masterwork.\n\nAs a note to the developers, who might never read this review, thank you for such a great game. It's an element which shaped my imagination beyond most books.

When the ship is trying to manuevar around and obtsacle or around an enemy you wil clearly see it firing its reaction control thrusters to spin it or strafe around. The greatest part is if you install auxiliary engines like deflection engines or combat drives then the ship uses main thrusters to get close to the enemy and engages the combat drive and you see it spinnign and dancing around the enemy to make it impossible for them to target specific devices of your all thr while destroying what ever system you have targeted with its own weapon. I like being able to decide what kind of ship I want to fly, for example I can set it up to be deivce killer, get close and knock out there weapon generators and shields with my lasers and bombard them with torpedoes or fit it with bubble energy shells which drains shields then destroy the hull with either torpedoes or mass drivers. If you want to be a bad ♥♥♥ you can equip battleship grade weapons on you little ship like long range CRISIS energy torpedos which (if they hit) will utterly destroy the enemies shields (they can be dodged easily if the enemy has a combat drive equipped), after dropping the enemies shields launch some BIG BANG EM missiles and watch as the brightest explosion you've ever seen destroyes there hull (if their flak system didnt shoot down the missile). Most later missions you get some small ships with a torpedo boat and ofcourse your own unique flag ship, you get to allocated resource points for each ship being able to decide what each will focus on, you could for exmaple have the small quick and agile ships focus on taking down devices like shields and weapons of an enemy with lasers which bypass shields so your torpedo boat can come in and annihalate them or have all of your ships work in unison to bombard their shields with energy shells after which they, in unison, wreck the hulls with mass drivers. I've literraly been playing this game since 2004 and have never gotten tired of it, even with online being down. Its just so good, theres nothign else which comes close to the realism of the zero-g physics which you will clearly see. Theres no game out there that has the cinematic feel this one does, you just sit there as these large capital ships lumber around slowly firing thrusters left and right trying to maneuver around each other to get the best firing position, you will never see any other game that has the same shield ddynamics this one has, a projectile comes towards you and it just smashes in to your bubble shield, the shield reacts, you see magnetic distortion in it as it stabalizes then dissapears and recharges. You wanna be faster? just allocate more power to the engines, you want shields to recharge faster? just give em more power, wait your out of stored energy? turn off support systems and your engines and let the storage batteries recharge.\n\nI've played this game dozens of times, and will play it more and more, its just sad that nexus 2 never got the funding it sohuld have, maybe the creators waited to long to bring it back... Only a select few know about this game, shame.","January 8","true","8.1"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","23","24","3","0"

An almost REAL Capital Ship Simulator!\n\nI played this game when it really came out. I was impressed. The idea has NOT been bypassed yet.\nBut let's take things from the start. With what you could compare this game... Star Trek Starfleet Command, Star Trek: Bridge Commander, Star Trek: Legacy or Homeworld series? NONE of them.\n\nWhat you'll see in this game. Capital ships fighting each other in most cases. There are 6 races in the game: The Vardrags, the Ghosts, the Gorgs, the Raptors, Humans and the Locust. Each one with different ships, classes of ships and they are many and their own weapons and technologies. When you go on a battle you have to configure every ship.\nA ship has power source(Reactor), two or three engines(travel engine,secondary engine and combat engine),pairs of weapons on each side,shield, ECM and ECCM modules,fighters and commandos slots, extra batteries that refill from the core extra power supply,individual distribution of energy to every system.\n\nThe idea... Yes... We've seen many movies and some of us played many sci-fi games. We've seen pilots that can see the space through some kind of glass and guidance of the ship directly. Lies... Those are not going to happen in space battles. Only cameras can give a line of sight, radars and when a ship is in combat in many cases is its computer that decides how to move, because it's faster. But don't worry. You'll see the ships from outside. The ships as presaid have pairs of weapons in each side able to fire in 180 degrees in each axis. The ships have many subsystems as I said upper. Every ship turns itself around itself hiding its subsystems and turning every gun to the opponent until the other one is loaded again. That's why the ships computer does control the ship in automatic mode. At the same time every ship tries to keep a good distance to the opponent for no collision and to shoot at him where it needs.\n\nEVERY ship has 4 Modes of reacting.\n-The complete auto mode that is the main mode. In this stasis the ship completely automates everything. It does NOT overeact to make a difference and it is based completely to the ships main configurations. The ship will try to attack an enemy with all the weapons NEEDED.\n-The fighting one that delivers the most power to the weapons. Like the Auto mode but it will fire with every weapon possible and maybe overload the weapons so to fire quicker.\n-The Defensive or Guarding mode delivers more power to shield and engines, so the ship can hold. Only NEEDED weapons will fire in EVERY target.\nALL THE UPPER MODES WILL FIRE A DIFFERENT TARGET ONLY WITHIN RANGE AND ONLY IF A WEAPON IS LOADED AND THE MAIN TARGET IS NOT AVAILABLE. YOUR SHIPS SHIELDS WILL BE LOWERED AFTER THE BATTLE AND IF OTHER SHIPS ARE IN GREAT DISTANCE. THEY WILL BE RAISED AGAIN IN SOME DISTANCE BEFORE AN OPPONENT.This is extremely bad in some situations because they need time to recharge in FULL capacity.\n-The MANUAL mode. This will be the permanent mode when you'll play a bit. Believe me there is NO other way. You can aim every target individually within distance, enable or disable every system and overload whatever you want.(Overloading systems make them more efficient but they drain the batteries or make other systems work lower or none at all. If there is NOT enough power it will be automatically set to normal for the ship to work. Take EXTREMELY CARE with this function. It makes the difference in battle but sometimes you may lose if your ship fails you)\nYou will be able to make priorities in system repairs if a system have been disabled in this mode.\n\nThere are 3 different types of weapons\n- Energy weapons are the MOST used in every ship. The most of them are Shield Disablers but there are some Hull Destruction weapons too. They have unlimited power that comes from the ships Core. The usage distance is low.\n- Ammo or Missile weapons are limited and are HULL destructive. Not usable with opponent's shields ON. Usage distance low too.\n- Artillery weapons. High Explosive weapons that are LIMITED and can damage HULL even through opponent's shields but NOT much. It is about the ship class too. Completely destructive if the opponent's shields are down. Usage distance GREAT so don't wait a ship to fire artillery next to the opponent. It will try to make a GREAT distance first.\n\nCustomization of a ship is important. Every ship dependant of its class has several slots for enything. Maybe can have two power cores if the first fails or destroyed, two or three engines, several pairs of weapons ,batteries and special slots. You have to know what you'll use the ship before you configure it. It depends on the way you play too.\nGenerally, the large ships configuration has shield disablers and ammo and artillery weapons. Because of the great mass and the limited movement of theirs they'll try destroy the opponent instantly. They also have great HULL and shields. But because of their great mass and limited movement their subsystems are totally exposed to smaller ships and maybe fighters.\nSo small ships those fighters and commando ships but if the ship has no flak weapons to destroy them automatically they can be the success in a battle. Flaks are also destroy missiles, bombs, torpedoes and generally artillery weapons. It's a MUST to have at LEAST a pair in every ship.\nSmaller ships like frigates have better movement but are weaker in MASS, shields, in the amount of weapons and  destructive power. Though they are much valuable.Imagine a frigate with a very strong energy core and great engines. You'll see that it will dance all over the opponent without him being able to destroy it, while the frigate will aim directly to the subsystems. Imagine now a large ship without shield disablers. Their ammo weapons will be for nothing if they can NOT penetrate the shields. Imagine now a large cruiser without engines. Funny? It can't hide its subsystems and it can't turn its weapons against you... So it's completely vulnerable because the next system you'll destroy is the shield one. And then GAME OVER ...\n\nIn combat the most ships use their secondary engine or the combat engine. Very few times in collaboration with the travel engine as it is for travelling large distances. The secondary and combat engines are the ones that turning the ship around all the time. So, if you don't install one on a ship you'll see it can have an efficient fight even with every possible weapon ON.\n\nAs you can imagine here this is NOT a normal game you've seen. The developpers tried to catch reality in most cases. A great masterpiece in simulation gaming.\n\nAnd now let's go to the cons...\n-The game is a little buggy. In many cases does different things but NOT so much for not playing it. The feelings after that game will be... WELL , try it and tell me.\n-Another one is the Multiplayer thing. They made a game SO GREAT but without Multiplayer support. To get to the multiplayer you have to follow the online guide through Steam. Say a THANKS to this guy. Well done to him. But let's go to MORE...\n-Not many maps for Multiplayer. There are very few and without AI the most of them so .. with an OLD game that its public is limited you'll find yourself trying to play WarCraft 2 or 1 nowadays with an internet human player opponent. Sit and wait till... tomorrow? or more?\n-Individual waypoints of a ship. Yes, they forgot to make a fix here. There are times that I want to make the ship take a course that I want. Better battle, hiding in asteroids or whatever. In Multiplayer it would be a VERY HELPFUL advantage. But NO, it does NOT exhist.\n-Completeley lack of saving or remembering the configurations done in multiplayer.\n\nSTILL THE BEST CAPITAL SHIP SIMULATOR EVER..................................","February 9, 2015","true","2.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

It is a stunningly atmospheric game with highly complex, yet easy to use space combat. It is a Space Opera in the truest sense of the word.\n\nYou start the as spaceship captain Marcus Cromwell in command of the Stiletto out on the fringes of the solar system on patrol. Things quickly pick up speed however as aliens, wormholes and other outside forces conspire to put you smack dab in the middle of an epic conflict between various hostile alien armadas and a lost remnant of humanity. As you progress through the game your own fleet grows in size and power, new characters join your side and you will often get little role playing elements in the missions letting your chose how to proceed.\n\nAlthough from the outside Nexus might look like a classic space RTS in the same vein as the Homeworld games the similarities are limited. In Nexus you command a small flotilla, each ship is named and upgradeable. Should one of your ships be destroyed it will be gone for good and you will be that much weaker in missions ahead. You progress through a series of linear missions, each one putting your fleet in a small area of space with primary and secondary tasks to complete. To accomplish this you must use your fleet and their abilities as best you can. Each ship having a number of different controls allowing you to maximize it's efficiency by directing power to various systems, commanding fighters, bombers and gunships, or using various different weapons when appropriate.\n\nIn terms of difficulty Nexus provides a somewhat uneven experience, although most of the missions that involved fighting are balanced and challenging the ones that involved stealth tends to be nothing more than an exercise in frustration leaving you reloading your save game repeatedly until you get it right.\n\nGraphically the game is absolutely stunning. Space has never looked this beautiful, from the asteroids you pass by to the ripples in your shields when they get struck everything in this game oozes atmosphere. In terms of sound Nexus is a very quiet game which only adds to the immersion and experience of silent space although a good soundtrack playing on your stereo whenever you boot up this game is something I can only recommend.\n\nSome bugs and the lack of anyone playing the multi-player, even at release, are the only other negatives I can think of.

YOu can skip to bottom for TL;DR part.\n\nBrilliant! I've spent approx 100 with this game (only in campaign!) and it is incredibly tactical. Maybe Homeworld seems to you too much arcadish? Well, this one is more like hardcore tactical RTS :) You can assign orders even to last single battery on your corvette, but don't forget yourself! Too much micromanagement can kill you very quickly. Solution can be a lot of pausing, or simply giving orders in such manner, your ships will perform well even without your intervention, so you can take care of top priorities. Protect your ships, bring them from mission to mission throughout whole campaign and be sure your crew gathers experience, because experience can be more valuable than guns and armor itself.\nAnd atmosphere is still "realistic". As realistic as it can be in space opera RTS :)) Thanks to music, graphics (right now I mean long trails behind ships, design of Earth ships and other details, not beauty of textures, lights or shadows, more on that in next paragraph...) storrytelling and proportional grow of your forces you get first grade experience. First you start with a single ship that travel from Earth to Jupiter for eight months. That seems to be kinda fast for today's technology, isn't it? Well, wait for your first alien ship that carries you from system to system in no time, compared to Stilleto (your first ship). It takes like ages of ingame time, to get Angelo (if I remember the name correctly), but that makes it even more rewarding. Later you will get another ship to your current one, so you will be able to use two of them. When your fleet grows to number of like 5 ships, you will feel invincible.\n\nToday they released patch (first one after years of inactivity) that brings the game to full HD. I realized how much time passed since I started Nexus for last time. Graphics looks really old, but playability seems to be still very high.\nI really hope in more updates, possibly in remastered edition or even brand new game? (ehm, inspirated by not named studio, right?)\n\nTL;DR\nIf you are fan of space opera where you take care of your ships and where you can really enjoy tactical decisions and story, definitely buy this game while in discount like today's one. For current price 2,49 Euro, it's a must. Even when it's priced on it's full 10 euro, it can be a good buy.","March 21","true","17.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

So why do I prefer this game every day of the week? Realism. With all due respect to EVE and the understanding of technical limitations, etc: Nexus gave me what I needed. MMOs can be great, but for single-player this game is astounding.\n\nFull ship module customization: from weapons to shields to support systems to engines to fighters and more. An actual visible shield bubble around your ship that flashes when hit by enemy energy weapons. The Combat and Deflection engines make for amazing moments, enabling you to narrowly dodge hundreds of battleship-class projectiles that would otherwise shred your frigates and destroyers. The ability to target specific enemy modules, and having to have a good scanner to detect a ship's weapons and systems in the first place. Great fleet battle command controls and more.\n\nUnknown space anomalies, allies and enemies that actually make you go "what the hell!?" A very frenetic but fantastic automated drone/fighter system as well. I'm not a rogue type of player in the least, yet I applaud the inclusion of various stealth drives, cloaking, ECM, ECCM, and even jamming shields. Did I mention how fantastic it is to view a ship taking hull damage, let alone the sectional explosions leading up to the ship explosion? And memorable stories & characters to boot. Phenomenal.\n\nAn under-appreciated space combat game. If you're the kind of gamer that prefers more realism than just pure fantasy in your spaceship-combat games, this title may be for you.

To give you a review that brings it a bit different; Think Homeworld, but now you do not build ships, you aquire some throughout the campaign. For the rest it is very similair, expect you do not have to send out collectors to gather resources. You also have a bit more options than setting an agressive of defensive stance.\n\nThe game makes you expand your fleet throughout the campaign and offers a certain freedom in the upgrades you apply to your ships. Then once you are in a mission you can give very specific orders, or let the ships do as they will. The last probably wont be too succesfull though, but that is pretty much what makes this game good. It allows you do make your ships do all sort of things, target specific equipment on enemy ships, make artillery strikes on incoming enemies, and sooo much more. Often these things can hurt you as much as they can help you, so some thought is required and you should also not forget the AI can do the same to you.","March 22","true","73.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

NEXUS is the best tactical space combat strategy game I EVER played. Yes it has couple of bugs and there are thing or two that they could make better but as concept and following execution of that concept just WOW.\n\nSo let me put it together for you. You are commander of group of capital ships (from one up to ten) starting from corvets all the way to battle cruisers. You do not produce you do not collect resources or any of that crap. You have your little fleet and task front of you. Now that seem pretty dull when you say it but once you get trough the controls (strongly sugget to play tutorial) you find out that you can control each subsystem of each ship and that is freeking awesome!\nHaving limited resouces (means ships) giving this game completly diferent dimension. You will think twice to send your destroyer class against two frigates only to see it blown up. There are no reinforcements there is no help comming and in freezing cold of space noone will hear you scream. You will learn to utilitaze your power creating diversions and new strategies depending from ship to ship. And you will cheer your self for every mauver that put you one step closer to victory.\n\nNow as I did finish all the praises there are as usual some problems as well. Tutorial is ok but still suck. Learnig curve is so steap it puts 90degree angle to shame and menu with hud is ...... well bit chaotic. Graphics are Ok but keep in mind that this was made 2004.\n\nFrankly I still dont understand why the sequel did not come to live or why someone didnt made remake of this beutiful game.\n\nAll and all I would sumarise like this. If you like Kerbal space program this is for you, if you like tactical games with anal attention to detail like men of war this is for you, if you like capital ship battles and your secret dream is to be like Commander Bill "Husker" Adama and have your own Battlestar this is for you.

This game brings tactical 3D space RTS to the next level. Homeworld was one of my favorite games, but the level of detail put into the balance of this game is stunning. Ships compete and dish out damage in a unique number of ways adding some rock/paper/scissor elements I love. Also no giant cruiser ship is going down in a few seconds here so there is long-term strategy involved in battles with time to adjust micromanagement of individual ships. I love that part.\n\nThe big caveat though is there is no skirmish generator to keep enjoying the mechanics after single-player making this purely a single-player experience. I curse fate for not allowing the sequel to make it on kickstarter, but the creators still seem motivated on their facebook page.\n\nPS - back in the day you could never finish the second to last mission due to the massive load on your graphics cards and CPU.

It's unlike any other space rts ive ever played. It's graphics are almost cinematic and like watching a movie, it's level of control is something rarely seen in games now a days. I was particularly amazed with how even my crappy windows xp laptop (as opposed to my more modern desktop) could run the game at full graphics and still play  very smoothly.\n\nThere were 2 negatives to this game that you only really notice later on.\nThe first is the "independentness" of your space ships. i actually believe that the manual explained this was on purpose, and if done correctly, this function could make the game tons more fun and one of a kind. But they kind of failed. The idea is that your ships aren't under your command as much as following your orders and figuring out things for their own. This could have been a highly unique and interesting feature if they had taken it a bit further (for example, having different personalities of captains on your ships. so one could charge right in guns blazing when when u say attack while the other would naturally  bombard the target from a distance and disable its key systems before going in for the kill). they also could have just not implemented this idea and had the ships follow your orders exactly (like manual almost but as an ai) instead the game has an awkward middle ground that is sometimes extremely annoying. I often go manual on my ships and still have problems. I will send my flagship away from, say, the battle base titan or something similar and send it towards an enemy cruiser to keep it safer. then i will come back to find that my flagship has turned arond and is charging straight into the battle bases guns..... and only a single laser beam is firing from my ship as it charges  . This obviouslycan be frustrating. (sorry didnt mean to rant but in the late game where everything relies on timing, this can be annoying and almost game wrecking if you try to micromanage)\nThe other flaw that i will briefly mention is that the game doesnt seem open to creative solutions. It seems to have been designed with a single solution for every level that you have to find through trial and error (especially in the late game). when you have a beautiful game like this with wonderful control styles and an amazing number of ways of options in combat, it is frustrating when in the end only one or two ways will work for the "mission".\nAfter that rant, you probably think the game must suck, but actually in all other aspects this game is awe-inspiring, one-of-a-kind really.

Unfortunately, ship customisations are incredibly limited rendering the ability for completing the story a bit of a crapshoot. At any time, and with little-to-no warning at all, you could find yourself going back to a savegame far before a certain mission which requires very specific upgrades. It's downright painful at times.\n\nOther than that: The backgrounds and environments are incredible, the AI can be rather surprising in its tactics, and it's not a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can do the same thing to AI as you can do to human players and vice verse, there's no compensation going on. The story is nice, and none of the characters are in any way portrayed as "perfect" or "exemplary."

While a few years old, this game is a gem.  In a nutshell it is a space capital ship & fleet command simulator.  You start out commanding one ship, along with some fighters and transports which are used to capture vessles or disable enemy subsystems.  As the game progresses you will get new ships as well as more ships under your command.  You will be able to outfit their ship as well as your own with new gadgets, weapons, shields, fighters and transports.  There is no resource management or building.  You get assigned vessels each mission and prior to the mission start can outfit them.  During the missions you have control over all vessels, fighters and transports under your command.\n\nYou have a great deal off control on how your ship and fleet works, control over combat, power optimisation, behavior etc.  Despite this the game has a relativly low learning curve and the tutorial in the first few missions teach you most of what you need to know.  The rest is through good old fashioned trial and error.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of space sims, have been looking for a game that lets you command powerful capital ships in a nice looking environment then this is definatly worth a look, especially at €10.\n\nGraphics: 7 - Despite being a few years old, the graphics hold up in 2013.  Ships are highly details and the weapon and explosion effects are gorgeous.  Could use better resolution options however.\nSound: 7 - Combat sounds do the job, weapon and engine sounds are crisp and the music, while nothing spectacular sets the mood.  The voice acting is hit and miss, with one character in particular being rather annoying but for the most part is servicable.\nGameplay: 10 - Lots of fun, controls work and you can pause at any time with the spacebar to let you issue orders without stress.  I would prefer a camera with slightly tighter controls but that is just a personal issue.\nReplayability: 5 - The game campaign is based on linear missions and once you played the campaign the only real reason to start over is to try on a harder difficulty setting, try to complete hard secondary objectives you missed or simply to blow stuff out of the sky.  Multiplayer is pretty empty at the time of writing.  The game could have used a random mission creator.  There might be a mod that adds missions but I have not had a chance to delve into that side yet.\n\nAddendum: The game supports mods as from the launch screen.  I personally have not had a chance to look at it yet.","August 11, 2013","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Other than "Homeworld", it's the best space strategy game in existence. It's beautiful and very intense with an engaging story full of sci-fi's best elements. You'll feel the menace of the vast outer space.\n\nWhile "Homeworld" has a more typical RTS approach, with resource gathering and units to manage, "Nexus" has a more "navy" approach: it's about commanding 1-8 ships at a time (persistent along missions), making use of their different weapons and managing the engine and systems generators.\n\nI love both approaches and I think fans of space sci-fi and RTS/strategy games can not do much better than this game and "Homeworld".\n\nNexus 2 coming soon, check news page on steam.","November 8, 2011","true","36.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Sometimes they tend to go next to the ship you ordered to have on a artillery range and just sit there. AI is stupid in massive scale, in big battles you can notice it too.

In theory, I should love the hell out of this game. But I don't.\n\nPros:\n- RPG aspects, level of ship customization - your captains are persistent, and so are your ships. You upgrade both of these, which is costly, and customize them for various roles and against various enemies. You lose a ship, you lose everything you put into them - which is costly. Customization includes a multitude of weapon types (for different roles), different strike craft and various, various equipment.\n- level of control over ships - you can control the ships down to singlar guns targetting different targets, engine throttle, subsystem management, repairs, etc etc etc.... best set of options I've ever seen. If you could only control individual shield quadrants, this game would take unit control to a whole another level never seen in any game. You can blow crap up, you can just disable, or you can board. It's up to you.\n- scale - the battles and scenarios are just the right scale, and just the right escalation.\n- ship design and details - all the different engines (including some on the front), moving parts, turrets... also very utilitarian ship design. I like it.\n\nUnfortunetly, that's it for pros.\n\nCons:\n- relatively boring cliche storyline - good twist around 1/4th in, but that'd be all\n- clunky camera - think Homeworld 1. Unacceptable\n- you can't issue move orders on empty space - yes, that's right. You can only head towards/away from a specified target. As a result, your battle plans are very limited, flanking is difficult, and on more than one occasion I got stuck and had to restart a mission because I didn't have any targets in sight\n- unreliable controls - that's right. The level of control is incredible, but very often ships don't do what you tell them to. They stumble, they pick the wrong direction, randomly stop firing, or decide they won't target X. "Derpy" is a diplomatic way to say it. It happens all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time, especially if you have more and bigger ships. Very often you're stuck manually reloading ships' weapons because they stop firing for no reason.\n- random outcomes - very often if you do a mission and do the same thing let's say three times, you'll get 3 different outcomes. Good on paper, not so much in a tactics game.\n- difficulty - the unfair, random kind. Sometimes you just have everything stacked against you. Enemies roll good dice, your units decide to disobey orders, which happens infuriatingly often, and you just are left screaming at the screen "why didn't you follow my orders". It doesn't help that missions on their own are pretty difficult,\n\nWhile the cons aren't very numerous, the camera, move orders and unreliable behavior of your ships make the game incredibly frustrating at times.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. It was supposed to be my replacement for Star Trek: Deep Space 9: Dominion Wars. Unfortunetly, The Jupiter Incident has even more issues.","March 21","false","18.1"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","6"

Slow slow slow.  And this is coming from someone who loves the Homeworld franchise so you know this is some serious slow motion.  The dialogue and backstory are actually somewhat intriguing (despite some pretty bad voice-acting from some of the characters), but any interest is lost only a couple missions in when the clunkiness of the interface and the speed of ships and action lingers on while you stare and watch for what feels like forever.\n\nThe interface is clean but unhelpful and tiny.  Good luck trying to find your next objective or any object that the narration has mentioned if there are more than a couple things out there.\n\nGraphics are serviceable and nice in some ways, but drab.\n\nMost frustrating is that ships don't do what you'd like them to do.  Tell them to stop, and they decide to move a little.  Tell them to fire artillery and they move away from the enemy and don't seem to do anything.\n\nCouldn't see any way to rebuild lost fighters, which seems incomprehensible.\n\nOverall I was pulled in a bit by the story and atmosphere, but once the missions started my interest faded fast.  I didn't play it long but can't find a reason to want to play it again.\n\nI always hate to say that, being a developer myself and knowing that this game must have taken some good effort to create.

The combat takes forever to do anything at all, especially once shields are introduced.  The strategy is hampered greatly by the lack of proper movement controls as well as super hard counters in the forms of weapons.

Whenever I try to order ships in my fleet around, that automatically means that I really want to look at that ship instead of just ordering it to do what I want.\n\nSecond, the pilots on this ship must be drooling idiots. I'm sorry to the drooling idiots of the world, as I meant no insult. What I mean is that the game doesn't really understand that to fire guns with any sort of accurary I must be closer to the target ship. Or that when I use the "get closer to that ship" command, it really means to stay right where I am, because I'm really dumb.\n\nThird, the pilots on the ship must be drooling idiots. It's not my inexperience, as I've gotten 5 hours on this game that I was truly interested in, but I can't emphasize how bad the control interface is. Lack of grouping of ships, lack of any sort of AI coordination on the part of the crew members thta I was ordering around as the ship's "Captain" make me want to push the pilot and gunners aside and do it myself.\n\nIn short, if I was ever on a ship with a crew this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I'd take the chances on running the ship myself after I'd murdered the grew by 'accidental airlock decompresion.'\n\nDon't buy this unless the challenge you prefer is fighting the interface.","June 24, 2014","false","10.1"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","32","8","25","4","1"

However, I bought this game for a multiplayer experience.. and boy did I get one. Its in the multiplayer that this game falls flat on its face. First of all just starting an LAN server caused the game to crash with a DX9 error (all clients would crash when doing this on seperate computers, so it is not an isolated occurance). After several hours of searching I found the solution to the problem (created by a player.. NOT the developer). The solution was to download a certain dummy file to trick the game into loading and registering it to .net via CMD console. The root of the problem was with the in game voice comms that the game is supposed to support, which it certainly does not.\n\nAfter having to fix a game that I shouldn't have have had to fix in the first place, I was able to start a local server.  That is when I seen how little thought and time went into the multplayer portion of this game. Basically to sum it up, you have about 8 modes however most of them are deathmatches which involves, choose theatre, pick your units, enter game, and fight - nothing more. The other modes invovles Kill something together (team against AI). Which again you just pick units based on a point system, and enter game and kill. No building, no skill trees, no progression, no indepth strategy, just arena fight to the death gladiator style or until time runs out.\n\nIf you are looking for a fresh multiplayer strategy game to kick around with your friends, this is NOT what you are looking for. If you are looking for "yet another deathmatch game", then this is sure to be exactly when you are looking for, that is if you can fix the game before you play it.\n\nA horrible multiplayer game, horrible multplayer experience with lazy multiplayer programming, an embarrassment to multiplayer strategy games and waist of time and money for the social player.","August 9, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

Things that the destination is close to will flash). Don't depend on auto flight or you'll end up ♥♥♥♥ing up later missions.

Gameplay focuses on ship level tactics rather than resource gathering and production found in other space RTS games.  You will generally control between 1 and 8 ships, ranging from fast and mobile frigates, to slow, hulking carriers, and of course support from fighters, bombers and boarding craft. Ships can be customized for specific tasks, like bringing down shields, disabling systems, and artillery etc, but is restricted by the cost of repairs and purchasing equipment between missions.\n\nThe attention to detail on the ships is still unparalleled. Weapons are mounted on specific points on a ship's hull, it must manouevre to bring them to bear on its target. When zoomed in you can even see the weapons firing indivudally. Similarly every system on a ship can be targetted for desctruction individually, with the right tools. Want to clear the way for your fighters? Take out their flak cannon, want to make them easier to target or stop a pursuit? Target their engines.\n\nUnfortunately, some technical issues remain. Occasional scripting problems and crashing carry over from the original release, and can be quite frustrating, given the pace of the game is relatively slow. There is no option to speed up time for the sometimes slow travelling between waypoints. There is no widescreen support, and in fact, changing resolution does not seem to work at all.","December 28, 2011","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never finished it as far as I can remember. Now I have the chance to complete it and I will keep at it till I do! The graphics look great when I think back to the original, the story is OK, not the best but pretty good. The voice acting I assume is the same as the original but I can't remember how they sounded back then; it is again not the best but then I am not playing it for that reason.\n\nIt is very story led with nothing to do outside of the story to speak of but this is not a problem in my opinion. Which is surprising as I normally like much more open play games.\n\nI did get it in the sale but I don't think this is colouring my judgement too much, full price would still be worth it especially if you are looking at Nexus for its nostalgia quality. It was released around 2004 I thnk so it is now about 12 years old. Don't let this put you off though. It has been brought up to modern standards as far as possible I think.\n\nPROS\n====\nMuch nicer graphics than the original.\nCinematic feel as the missions can be quite long. (Bit of a double edged sword maybe)\nDecent physics.\nGreat models, especially Angelwing :-)\n\nCONS\n====\nThe missions can be a bit long. (The distances that you have to cross can be large before you are able to engage.)\nPossibly a steep learning curve. (It is gradually coming back to me)\n\n\nNot many CONS in my opinion, I reckon that if, like me, you were playing Nexus when it first came out, you won't regret handing over the cash for this version.\n\nBTW, it is working fine on my Win 10 laptop with, so far, no crashes or stuttering or any of the other annoying things that seem to crop up every so often.\n\nSo, you've read my opinion, why are you not already paying for your own copy? :-)","March 26","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, you control a small fleet of warships that you customize with different equipment loadouts and with crews and captains that gain experience with every battle. You issue orders to individual vessels, such as targeting components of enemy ships or focusing on stripping shields or launching boarding parties to try and capture enemy vessels. It can become wonderfully chaotic trying to organize your fleet in the midst of a ferocious battle, and its an experience that games liek FTL and Star Control don't come close to matching.\n\nThe singleplayer is the only portion of the game that works, but it works amazingly well. The story it tells is enjoyable and simple, with themes in line with scienc fiction classics. The multiplayer never worked when it was independent, and I haven't had the chance to try it on Steam yet, but it was basically a free-form version of the singplayer game, with all ship","July 12, 2012","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never finished it as far as I can remember. Now I have the chance to complete it and I will keep at it till I do! The graphics look great when I think back to the original, the story is OK, not the best but pretty good. The voice acting I assume is the same as the original but I can't remember how they sounded back then; it is again not the best but then I am not playing it for that reason.\n\nIt is very story led with nothing to do outside of the story to speak of but this is not a problem in my opinion. Which is surprising as I normally like much more open play games.\n\nI did get it in the sale but I don't think this is colouring my judgement too much, full price would still be worth it especially if you are looking at Nexus for its nostalgia quality. It was released around 2004 I thnk so it is now about 12 years old. Don't let this put you off though. It has been brought up to modern standards as far as possible I think.\n\nPROS\n====\nMuch nicer graphics than the original.\nCinematic feel as the missions can be quite long. (Bit of a double edged sword maybe)\nDecent physics.\nGreat models, especially Angelwing :-)\n\nCONS\n====\nThe missions can be a bit long. (The distances that you have to cross can be large before you are able to engage.)\nPossibly a steep learning curve. (It is gradually coming back to me)\n\n\nNot many CONS in my opinion, I reckon that if, like me, you were playing Nexus when it first came out, you won't regret handing over the cash for this version.\n\nBTW, it is working fine on my Win 10 laptop with, so far, no crashes or stuttering or any of the other annoying things that seem to crop up every so often.\n\nSo, you've read my opinion, why are you not already paying for your own copy? :-)","March 26","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't easy to find games like this.  Yes, there is sound in space.  No, the physics are not perfect.  But it gets very close -- closer than just about anything else I've seen.  And certainly strikes a great balance of playability and fun when it makes those trades.\n\nRather amazing that they updated it for modern OS after all these years.  I waited until the sale was over so I could do the publisher the small kindness of paying full price in recognition for the work they put into it.","March 31","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention that even half a decade after its release it still looks pretty damn nice. Only issue is that there is not built in AI for skrimishes and the online multiplayer never took off. Oh, and that it was orginally conceived as a big 4X space game but got retooled half way through. Still great!","December 13, 2011","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
