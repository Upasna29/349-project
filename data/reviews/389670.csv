Not remotely enough content for most buyers.\n\nThe following is based on the Early Access launch version of the game.\n\nFrom some of the original Wipeout developers comes an extremely bare-bones but promising taste of a new AG racing game. At launch there is a single track, one craft, two modes, two weapons and three or so music tracks. Although this is in an early alpha state, the core mechanics are surprisingly satisfying. Compared to Wipeout, the handling is much heavier, collisions are much more punishing, and boosts are more rewarding. Accelerating into turns is not a viable strategy. To my delight, they managed to capture the awesome feeling of gliding as if on auto-pilot when completing three or four tricky turns from Wipeout.\n\nEven as someone with experience in this type of game, placing first in the race took nearly an hour. Collision damage makes it very likely that you'll die in your first attempt. Learning the track and placement of boost pads seems essential to winning. Currently there is one weapon in the game, and it's tricky to learn to use (hold the fire button until the missile locks on, then release). Overall, there is an hour of satisfying content here, obviously not yet enough to justify a €28 price tag.\n\nAs for performance and ease of use, this game is very limited as you can imagine. The menus are not responsive, there's very little in terms of an options menu, but it does feature borderless windowed mode which came at a cost of around 10fps. On my hardware (GTX770, i5-4690k factory settings) I could maintain above 60fps in fullscreen mode on the highest preset. Sound effects don't appear to be implemented, though the music will be appealing if you enjoyed the soundtrack of the Wipeout games. The visuals are great, though obviously could use polish, and the track design seems solid for the first track.\n\nPersonally, I'm very much looking forward to seeing where this game goes and will update this review throughout development. I'm not a big fan of racing, but I always liked the Wipeout games for their arcadey gameplay and split second handling combined with high fidelity visuals. Having played almost every entry to the series, I was disappointed to hear that Studio Liverpool was shutting down, and I'm glad that Wipeout is getting a spiritual successor in the hands of what appear to be capable developers in the form of Formula Fusion.","August 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 101 of 147 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","101","147","0","4"

(can be considered a down point, but it works for the current track)\nIt's very satisfying finally being able to make the corners correct after some practice.\nCurrently no cap on FPS or screen resolution. (FPS hits a stead 60 fps on high end rigs)	Community:\nYou wish to support the independent creators or this game.\nYou are aware the budget of this game is not that of a Triple A title. (There is basically no budget for PR)\nYou have a lot of patience and look forward to every small update to see what the developers might add.\nYou wish to help out in the creator by being a alpha tester and post bugs and feedback on the official forums.\nThe people who kickstarted this game are very passionate fan most of them coming form the WipEout zone forums. the community is a lot of fun to hang out with and discuses game idea's with. It kinda feels like you're in a really big guild.\nReason not to buy at this point in timeYou're expect a version 0.9.0 with a couple of tracks a single player campaign and any form of multiplayer.\nYou just want to play a anti gravity racing game without much hassle.\nYou are expecting loops and barrel rolls.\nYou like it when crafts can make very sharp turns (the current crafts are fairly heavy)\nMight have some issue's running this on a old system.\nYou don't really care about anti gravity racing game.\nClosing words:\nI believe this game will end up being great in the end, but it will take a lot of time and effort from both the developer and the community.","August 3, 2015","true","12.2"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","27","37","0","0"

The concept seemed great, and I was really excited to see a continuation of the Wip3out games.\nLack of communication from the developers and a lack of updates during this Early Access period is bad enough, but they've even gone so far as to permanently lower the price to attract more sales, with no compensation to those who paid full price.\n\nApparently they're posting the odd update on places like Facebook, but neglecting to keep people updated via the most direct medium; Steam.

I've been playing the WipEout games since I discovered the third and went back to play 2097 and 64 and Wip3out Special Edition. I played a ♥♥♥♥ ton of Pure and HD/Fury. A bit of Pulse. I have Fusion but didn't liked it too much. Haven't played 2048 much since I don't have a Vita. So, moving on...\n\nThe content is minimal (one ship, one track, two weapons, two music tracks, prototyped menus) so don't be buying this expecting anything near a complete, satisfactory experience, not even in the user interface. Buy this in order to support the developers so they can add content and fulfill their vision.\n\nWhat you get though, is a pretty promising skeleton of a game. The sole ship is beautifully rendered and the track looks nice (although I hope the floor gets higher resolution textures later on). The handling is based off 2097's. I'm not so sure about that since I liked the "floaty" handling of 3, Pure, Pulse and HD/Fury, it was nice to have some altitude control. This doesn't apply here, ship's altitude is fixed at the same height always. Not a bad feature, mind you, I guess I liked it when it felt a bit like an airplane and not a hovercraft ala F-Zero. The handling has a learning curve, specially if you're used to Wipeout HD, but it becomes second nature.\n\nI liked the boost of the speed pad. The camera struggles to keep up with the ship for a fraction of a second when you get a boost, which enhances the feeling of speed greately. I hope that in future versions they make the camera feel more like a real floating object so this motion becomes more natural.\n\nNO MORE RANDOM WEAPONS, my God, how am I glad of this and I hope it's not just a placeholder feature. This was what was holding Wipeout back. Didn't you hate when you were last place and you got the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed mines? Or when you got the quake while at the head of the pack? Sure, 2048 lets you distinguish between offensive and defensive pickups, but these subsets were still random. No more random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t here, it seems. If you want to see how much this impacts this kind of combat racing games, go play Blur on hard (an awesome and underrated game, by the way). That one opened my eyes. Leave the random nonsense ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to Mario Kart.\n\nTL;DR: I didn't even cared to look at the feature list at this stage of development, I'm a WipEout fan and I'm glad to throw these developers some money so they keep WipEout's spirit alive. But If you're not a diehard, consider waiting a bit more until more features have been implemented (or buy it and leave it in your play-it-later list). What's here, shows promise.","August 3, 2015","true","2.5"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

Day and night variations. No reverse.\nYou can't ride on the rails to go faster now\nUI has changed quite a bit. Gone are the minimalistic UI to a more convinient one.\nThere's also added a pitch to go up and down\nThe only promise they take is that they will release this game as full on August 2016.\n\nOriginal review.\n\nFormula Fusion is a futuristic racing game made by R8 Games partnering with Designers Republic. The game at launched in Kickstarter and Steam with the equivalent buzz of Yooka Laylee. Billed in many gaming journalism websites as a “spiritual successor made by former Studio Liverpool developers”, sleek looking graphics, the intent to ride on the E-Sports bandwagon and delivering high speed antigravity racing game akin to the “agile, complex and nimble” WipEout and not the “straight speed, no turning required” F-Zero.\n\nThey say in Kickstarter that the initial £35,000 KS target was to allow them to create the “‘base game’, which will feature eight tracks created by the WipEout 3 track team and an early-access version featuring one fully developed track”. They actually doubled the goal to £79,656 and in 3 Aug, 2015, they launched this game to Steam.\n\nLike any alpha, there are lots of bugs that has yet to be solved and content that is lacking at launch. You can wall ride your craft without care about the hull integrity without getting penalised by slowing the craft down. The UI is minimalistic; the bad kind of minimalism which you need to squint down the screen (not up!) to see the important information like the amount of weapons tokens to deploy your weapon, the time of your lap as well as the energy level that you’re in.\n\nThe replay value are also lacking. There are currently three tracks to choose from, all of which are reverse or reskins of one another. The 3 additional “QA tracks” exclusive to “Test Pilots” were textured in bare bones grey. One of the tracks struck me as amateurish and so basic that I personally doubt it's been made from some AAA developers like Studio Liverpool. The craft design were nice but currently all the teams selection are cosmetic and doesn’t affect the stats of the craft.\n\nThe weapons selection? Two. Just two different selections of weapons. One is a hold-space-for-three-seconds-to-fire rocket and the other is the fire and forget “force wall” in WipEout 3.\n\nThis would have been ok if the game is updated in a consistent time with a solid roadmap. Maybe monthly? Bi-monthly perhaps?\n\nNope! The last update of this game was in 25th August 2015. Even when they secured new investment on the 5th of November, there’s no update from the time this review was posted. There are no guaranteed dates for the next update.\n\nAll of this while some of the development staff and 2 community managers (one of which I will vouch on being extremely supportive) were laid off as their contract ended.\n\nFormula Fusion itself is nice, shiny and cool to show off your friends your GTX 980’s capabilities but from the content, the update schedule and stability as a company, it’s plainly not worth your $20.","December 17, 2015","false","13.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

It lacks what I thought really made the WipEout games fun: The atmosphere. It really felt like you were in a near future, deadly racing competition with high stakes. All the cool looking ships, the high tech dangerous weapons, and the smooth, fast steering of the ships. The OST added hugely to the experience, and add it althogether, you had an incredible, atmospheric, futuristic, intense racing game.\n\nI don't know what the road map is for this game, but as it stands, it has none of that. There are long stretches of road where you have no music. Just the quiet noise of the engine. When you grind against the wall, it doesn't feel like there's any impact, you just slow down a bit. Additionally, it sounds like dragging a cinder block across concrete. Not very inspiring. While the steer stays within the ballpark of the previous WipEout games, it doesn't feel as good. It doesn't feel like there's much impact, and the, as it stands, calm enivironment of the game takes away from the intensity of the games that this claims to be the spiritual successor of.\n\nAs it stands, I can't recommend this. Slap it on your wishlist, and wait. I've been told by a reddit user that the game will likely have a full release in Q3 2016, because, as he said "That's when the budget should run out."

Well there is generally a method to get a game made correctly and efficently. R8 games have nailed it.\n\nFormula fusion has used the correct method getting a very solid foundation, they have great ai(albeit a bit hard for a rusty ag racer), working races, a stable engine, solid performance etc. Well what does that mean, it means you can skip that whole buggy mess phase and move straight along into throwing in more and more content knowing that your game will handle it fairly well, of course more work will be needed but organisation and stress will be lower, lets give an example, dirt rally built a foundation, launched with little content and people were confused, its been 4 or so months since that game came into early access and its doubled in content. I see the same with this game.\n\nAs it stands there isnt a lot of content, there isnt a whole lot of anything to do apart from race or time attack with the single vehicle and track. Its closer to a tech demo then anything, its not worth £20 as it stands however it works and the devs are close to the community, they take everything we ask and provide some form of response telling us whats possible and what isnt.\n\nThis could be a gamble at the moment but r8 games nailed it with the wipeout games but their legends have come to an end and in its place we receive what the devs believe is going to be the ultimate anti gravity racer. Time will truely tell if that is possible for now out of sheer trust regarding past titles ill recommend this.\n\nEdit: So its nearly been a year since this came out for £20, now reduced to £15. What have see got, next to nothing and the game full content roster can be seen within 15 minutes, there is barely anything after a year and its a massive disappointment. Therefore i resent my judgement and no longer recommend this game.","August 3, 2015","false","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is SOME frame drops in some of the much larger circuits in normal races against opponents, though this can easily be fixed with LoD models of the crafts.\n\nOne thing that mainly annoys me is the particle effects emitting from the craft when going over boost pads. The speed in which they travel backwards makes the craft look like its moving slow, not faster, and the rockets not having better particles. But again, can easily be fixed later on.\n\nIn lower graphical qualities, the settings appear to be rendered at a lower resolution and then scaled up, which is something I personally don't find very appealing to the eyes.\n\nThe crafts' sounds are very basic, and could do with something new to make them sound a bit more powerful. Maybe something similar to craft sounds from WO2048. Maybe something different with every craft speed class to make it all sound "fast", rather than a low-pitched hum.\n\nOther than the "issues" listed above, I find this in-progress game very fun. Keyboard controls could do with a little tweaking, though!\n\n\nTL;DR: negative reviews are mainly existing because this is an Early Access title. Don't let that be the deciding factor for you, This game has serious potential. You won't regret it.","May 7","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I, instantly, became a fan of the franchise. There were many other games that tried to copy it´s formula but, the never managed to get it´s spirit. When i saw that a game was being developed, i thought to myself "I must have it", it was so nostalginc. I become even more exited when i found out that the developer of this game had worked on the wipeout series, i couldn´t be more happier.\n\nI bought the game, had some races and, even thought the game was under developet, i could see that this is trully a wipeout game. But it happens that almost 5 months have passed and there´s no updates at all. I mean, they changed some menus, the game´s physics (which are terrible now) and nothing more. I payed for this game and feel robbed. There´s no feedback from the Dev´s, the game is basically on the same state as when i bought it months ago and I can not have a refund.\n\nI strongly recommend NOT to buy this game. There´s no development at all! And no feedback from dev´s! I payed for this game and i feel i was robbed!","December 30, 2015","false","5.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The developers are working long and hard to bring us the next-gen anti-gravity racer we fans have been itching for and Formula Fusion does not disappoint. Be aware that as of the release date, there is only one track available. However, the level of refinement of both graphics and gameplay both indicate to me that FF is sure to be the new gold standard in AG racing games. Handling is new and unique (possibly subject to change). AI skill level varies realistically and definitely presents a challenge as you move up through the ranks.

The visual refinements are already in place, the sense of speed, manueverability, and rich environments are there along with a refined and unobtrusive interface.\n\nThe Challenge:\nMake no mistake, this is a "demo" based on an "Alpha build"--its incomplete, its a mere snapshot, there are bugs, and not a lot of features. Most of the people already playing it bought it thru the Kickstarter and the Test Pilot Program.\n\nThe Benefits:\nFormula Fusion had a successful Kickstarter\nPrior to the Kickstarter they raised money selling early access through Test Pilot Program\nMany of the developers are from the former WipeOut team at Sony Liverpool, formerly of Psygnosis\nThey have lined up The Designers Republic from the original WipeOut series to work on the visual design of the game\nThey have lined up additional funding and licensing on top of everything else\nYou already know if Forumula Fusion is "your thing." You can buy Early Access now, and participate in the game's development, along with all its bugs and glitches, or you can buy at release, when the game is clean, refined, and bug-free.\n\nI bought into the original Test Pilot Program and the Kickstarter, because I want to play a version of the anti-gravity reacing games I love on the platform of my choice, and not be locked into a console development cycle.","August 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Then things got very, very quiet for a while, no updates, no word from teh devs here on Steam, maybe one new map. Now it looks like they are staying in touch with the community through multiple channels, and the game is progressing nicely, updates are more frequent, we've lost a couple maps for revamped versions, and the newer tracks look absolutely stunning in my opinion.\n\nIf you are on the fence, I say try it out, you'll likely enjoy it if you are even considering a purchase. The handling takes some getting used to, and it's not set in stone teh handling model won't change before final release, but I think they will end up keeping that drifty handling they have now, or maybe tighter handling for some ships, who knows?

I'd give it 2-3 more major updates before diving in(Who knows might only need one).\n\nCurrently there are 3 tracks simply put 2 of the 3 for me remind of Wipeout HD/Fury for PS3, but one is a snoozefest(Niagara GP) at least atmosphere wise.

It may not seem like much but the devs do a good job keeping me playing with competitions for fastest lap. There seems to be a bit of disagreement on the handling, but honestly I have that same feeling coming into a new racer each time, and after a couple of hours around a bunch of tracks I think I've learned how to handle the new craft.\n\nSame goes for this one. At first I felt like the f4000 was too much like a floating tank, but now (and after some apparent tweaks) I realize just how nimble the craft can be. The f3000 however, was like a warm knife through butter, and the sensation of speed was unreal.\n\nThe camera itself is what took getting used to most. Rather than directly follow the craft, it angles based on ship position on the track. Initially this is quite disorienting and unwieldy but again, you learn the benefits soon enough and can really use it to your advantage. There's also a full-detail pilot view which just looks rad (and I look forward to trying that with VR support.)\n\nIn terms of track design each one gets better and better, with a very strong start. You don't always need airbrakes, but at times they are a godsend. I like this direction myself, as it means on the right line you can blitz a corner at near full speed and never come off the accelerator. And when you've hit a few boost pads beforehand, this can be a really awesome experience.\n\nIn terms of collision, I still think this could use a bit of work. One of my fondest memories of AG games is how in Wipeout 64 you could graze walls if you were pointed just right and not lose all of your speed. Sure, it doesn't punish you as hard for missing your line, but it made it feel so much more intense to scrape by on the outside line to steal a position. But I do understand why they've got it as it is. It's also refreshing that even on slimmer tracks it still feels impossible to pinball.\n\nOverall, what we have now is awesome, and I'm glad I got in when I did. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys these types of games, and even those who haven't tried them for sure.\n\nI'll update this review when there's more to report on.","April 10","true","19.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

From the first one on a PS one, then to 2097 on my PC with my Voodoo2 card and then on my PS2. So i backed this up...\n\nCONTROLS:\n@ the devs. Seriously. Do you have magnets on your walls?! I found out today why i really REALLY dislike this one so far.\nIt's not that it doesn't have the aesthetics of the franchise it aspires to be (even though it has the same people that did them what they are... still eartly access. Character could come further down the line.)\nIt's that the craft slides left and right even if you are not touching the controls. It's not a flight sim! Yes they are hovering vehicles, but the core gameplay is racing. I'm expecting that if i don't hold the stick, then it'll go forward, not forward and carry momentum sideways. I ended up trying to correct the flight path only to hit like a ping pong ball left and right.\n\nCAMERA:\nWhen i hit on a wall, the camera jumps left and right to simulate the hit. Understood. But it does that in so few frames that is almost instant and alienating/jarring to watch. Put a couple more frames in it, or just don't shake it as much. Put some spark particles on the side of the wing that touches the barrier and put a "sssshshhrhrhrhrhhsshsh" sound.\n\nAnd why is my gamepad controlling a mouse pointer in the menu? I'm not playing a PlayStation 1 point and click adventure game. I was going left and right with the stick waiting to see options being highlighted only to realise that i was moving a circle.","April 10","false","0.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I think it was Screamer that got me hooked on PC racing, and I remember it was because I could put my own music in the tray and race around to whatever I felt like listening to. To this day, if I'm in my car and "My name is Jonas" by Weezer comes on the radio, I'm really lucky if I'm not pulled over for speeding. When Wipeout XL came out, it came pre-packaged with its own music that fit its unique graphic style, one of the first and fondest things I'll always remember about Wipeout XL is the music.\n\nAt the time Wipeout XL came out, graphics accelerator cards were fairly new, and I was always excited to try a game that made use of the new hardware. I couldn't believe the night and day difference between the pixellated oldies and the smooth high res new hotness. It felt like game designers could communicate more to the player through their graphics than they could before, that they could present the world they wanted to present as they wanted to present it. Everything felt very futuristic and authentic and this went a long way towards immersing the player.\n\nIt's been a long time since I played a wipeout game, I have wipeout pure for the PSP which was okay, but not a modern title that utilized my hardware and just didn't quite ring with me like Wipeout XL, and then I came across Formula Fusion. I was hesitant at first, I've been burned with early access titles, but I saw that they just released a new update and strong was my jones, so I figured I'd pick it up, try it out for a little bit and if I didn't like it, I'd just return it.\n\nI installed the game, loaded up the first race, the music hit, the damp uneven track of New York raceway spread out before me, a familiar grin began to spread across my face. I realized that if they stopped development tomorrow, folded up their company and hid from lawsuits for the rest of their days, the $20 has been worth this one brief taste of it; the Wipeout XL of the modern era.","December 28, 2015","true","0.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Formula Fusion is being made with the utmost care and attention from past Wipeout devs and will surely be an amazing game once it's done. Even the glimpse you get from this current alpha build is very promising, visually, audibly and gameplay wise.\n\nTo those who can't resist complaining I'd suggest you stay well away from this until a few months down the line when there is more on offer. If however you are a kind human being who is passionate for the future of this kind of racer, throw them a bone and sit tight.\n\n(UPDATE REFERRING TO APRIL COMPETITION BUILD)\n\nWhat did I tell you folks? :D\n\nGameplay-wise things are starting to shape up, the handling is getting closer to what the devs are aiming for and if what they're saying about the future garage implementation it will be very interesting indeed. I've been playing properly for the first time since buying the early access, having some fun going for the competition time trial, I can feel the Wipeout addiction creeping back, trying to perfect those tricky turns of the new beautiful Atlas track. Fans of Sol 2 from Wipeout HD won't be disappointed, can't wait for the return of a photo mode! Honestly right now I feel like the in-game graphics are so good they don't need working on.\n\nIt should be noted too that since getting a new community manager news updates have been coming regularly, with active feedback discussions with the community, teases of future features, competitions and build releases, JOY!","October 14, 2015","true","3.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It's still very early days for this early access game featuring just one track at time of writing, but already I can see that this is likely to be a worthy successor to the Wipeout games; In fact this is being made by a number of former developers of Wipeout so it should be.\n\nAs it currently stands the controls could do with tigthening up a bit and I hope the tracks that are coming will offer more variety.

Despite having a GeForce 740m with 1GB of memory, i'm able to run the game at 40fps with high setting. Even during some fast turns or with all the crafts on screen, the game is real smooth and fluid.\n\nHowever, racing is not that satisfying right now. The craft feels heavy with a horrible collision detection, and sometimes the camera does not properly follows you. Turbo pads are much more powerful than they should be and weapons feels useless (at least in my opinion).\n\nOpponents have differents AI, changing from really slow (those on the last positions) to Sonic the hedgehog fast (usually those in the first three positions), so the race is challenging enough to stay focused for all of it.\n\nIn the CURRENT state i would not recommend this game if you're paticularly into racing games (expecially AG racing), since the lack of contents and a good amount of bug is not worth the price.\n\nHowever for being an alpha state this game looks really promising, with many changes coming in the future, support to eSports and much more. Additionally, if you're a fan of the WipeOut serie you should buy this without even thinking. The feeling, the design and the sensation are exactly the same that is present throughout all the WipeOut games.","August 3, 2015","false","0.8"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

Mechanics seen in the Wipeout series, such as Air-braking might feel strange at first because of the lack of drift, but after a few sessions you become accustomed to it. Collisions can also be unforgiving  (similar to those in wip3out) where one bump into a wall can cause a massive slowdown, emphasizing the need to remember where speed pads are placed and to optimize your racing line accordingly. Weapons are also included in the game, allowing you to pick from either the offensive missile to lock on and attack opponents in front of you, or a barrier that can be placed down to slow those behind you. Keep in mind that these are weapons you choose to take before the start of a session, so you appear to be limited to a single weapon type during a race.\n\nOverall i wasnt expecting too much at the start of EA, so i was a bit pleased to see the game functioning rather nicely (aside from the occasional crash between sessions). If you do decide to jump in and buy the game now, beware of the songs that are currently added. You'll probably go insane hearing them loop endlessly. :D","August 3, 2015","true","69.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

I also watched the arcade scene in Hackers a lot.\n\nThis is the best looking AG game I've played yet.  VR support, when it comes, will be mind-blowing.  I like the graphic options that they have right now, but I'm sure other PC players will want more options.  I really like that you can set the rendering rez apart from going full screen.  If I'm not mistaken, you can enter a 4k resolution and this will render the game higher than your current res for a little more polish.  This feature will make for some pretty nice screenshots.\n\nAs it is in early access, there's not a whole lot of content yet, but I have faith in this dev team.  I don't really put faith in any dev team these days, but these guys have a pretty good history.  Every Wipeout release was always extremely polished.

However, what is currently present is certainly promising.\n\nAt the time of writing, there is only one or two tracks, one craft, two songs to the soundtrack, and two weapons. The quantity of such features are sure to rise once the game reaches higher stages in development. You are able to select colours for your craft, which is a nifty feature and it would be nice to see it expanded upon in the future.\n\nThe user interface does require a bit of work. At first I found myself clicking on a UI element which didn't display anything due to the fact that I didn't click on the previous one, and it wasn't obvious at first glance. However once I had it figured out, it did the job well enough.\n\nThe gameplay was pretty good! The turning took a little getting used to but once mastered, it became an easy task to pull off. The speed pad boosts are much more rewarding than you'd find in the Wipeout games. The in-game HUD could have been a bit better. Most of the information regarding the ship (such as armour, speed, etc.) is shown right behind the ship, which is constantly moving and turning. At times I was unable to tell how much armour my ship had left, and when I attempted to check I was often thrown off course. Though that may just me me, other people may tell you otherwise.\n\nAs it stands, this game is on a good path and has tons and tons of potential, and I can't wait to see what becomes of it in the future.\n\nGood luck, R8 games!","August 12, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Keep an eye on this one if you like AG racers.\n\nI am a Wipeout fan since Wipeout XL. I've been playing almost all games from series (apart from Fusion - just a few races there) and I was really sad when I heard that Sony decided to drop Wipeout project. I was really happy when I found out that devs are comming back with Formula Fusion. I backed up project on Kickstarter, set my expectations high and waited.\nWhen early alpha became available I was disapointed. Music was bad, steering was terrible and tracks looked boring. In the mean time GRIP came out and by looking at these two I was sad that devs from FF cannot deliver the same quality as GRIP team. Luckily, from last two releases (with Niagara and that new skyscraper track) it seems to be getting much much better.

An update is planned the next month for Niagara GP, and I hope for a good revamp of the track.\n\n- Ships are separated in classes, which is a good thing for racing and time trial competitions. This choice prevents a single ship to prevail on the other ones, and gives the opportunity to try different competition settings. F4000 is the main ship they're working on actually, and it feels really good to drive. The ship sliding feels natural and fun to play. F3000 is a lot faster than F4000, but it has similiar physics to the last I mentioned, so it feels a little uncomfortable to drive for who has never tried it. Just make some practice, and you'll find out it doesn't feel that bad to drive.\n\n- Game's graphics looks amazing for this alpha stage; details for the two available ships and for the tracks themselves are truly curate. Graphic effects are still a bit strange, but for this alpha stage they're pretty good. I couldn't imagine how the game would look in it's complete release.\n\n- The actual OST of the game is good to enjoy, I would like to hear something more like this in the future releases. More Drum 'n' Bass, please!\n\n- Practice Mode is good for those that don't understand well the physics of the game, making you avoid to touch walls with antigravitational waves that pull you at the center of the track. Give it a try if you just bought the game and you want to get into the game a little.\n\nLet's now talk about the game negative aspects.\n\n- As of now, there are only two items available, and you could set just one of them available for a race. They still feel weird to use, as they don't slow you down when you get hit by them; you just lose shield. I hope they will add more of them in a Mario Kart way, and that they will be revisited with the full release.\n\n- A single boost pad sometimes could give you a double boost out of nothing. A glitch that needs to be fixed soon.\n\n- Passing between two near boost pads with the ship could cause you to get a doubled boost. This compromises/randomizes a little time trial competitions, and could be extremely clutch on races when you don't except to get a double boost.\n\n- Opponent's AI is still a bit easy to beat. Also, the frame rate drops and then fluctuates between 25-45 fps on tracks like Niagara GP and Atlas Torres when AI is moving. An issue that needs to be fixed soon.\n\nI also want to talk about neutral aspects of the game.\n\n- The ship's handling feel ok by now, but it's still a bit woody, especially when you're trying to countersteer. But R8 Games is actually working on it, releasing with every patch a refreshed and refined handling system.\n\nEven if there are a lot of things to fix for this game, it's still in early access, and to see an huge work like that drives me to think at what the game could look once it's finished, and to tell you to buy the game if you like racing games.\n\nAlso, there are a lot of features that are coming to the game in the future, like online multiplayer races, endurances, more items and a lot of stuff like that, so the game will have a lot to offer.\n\nIf you like Antigravity racing games or the Wipeout series, give Formula Fusion a chance, you won't be disappointed once the game will be released.\n(This game review will be edited until the full release of the game, to match up with early access releases details.)","April 12","true","111.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I'm just as amazed by how soon I got to play the spiritual successor to Wip3out as I am the scope and vision of the project.\n\nLike you've probably already read, YES this is extremely spartan and early access. The controls screen is a low resolution mockup. The menu (while simple and elegant) does indeed have problems with spacing, and even though controller support works in-game, don't expect to be able to map inputs or even use it in the menu. That's nothing to say of the buginess of the actual game. Audio glitches are regular, player ship falls through the track, the hud needs work, and optimization needs a looooot of work (consistent low fps across all setting levels).\n\nAll of this goes without saying. Do not buy this as a game. The only reason to buy this is if you didn't kickstart it beforehand and/or really want to track the progress of a game very deep in development. Not much point to unless you're a Wip3out/AG racing game fan. Then, it's actually really fun. Very simple, but very fun.\n\nHowever, what I can say of where I see this game going, this is gonna be amazing. I can already feel the smoothness (barring bugs) worked out, the controls feel natural to me, and the graphics are fantastic for such an early build. I'm actually very impressed. These devs KNOW what they're doing. They have a vision, and thankfully, they know how to craft it. I'll be keeping a close watch on this. At the moment the bugs and general glitchiness leave this barely a playable demo, but it is playable, and (will be) very awesome.","August 4, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The gameplay is solid and smooth but at the moment the game has very little content:  New York Map (Normal, Reversed, Night) and asingle ship with 5 colors, to test out track and AI.\n\nThe game looks overall good, as an Early Access, but it lacks of speed. Not sure if the vehicles are slow or it totally lacks the sensation of speed, but is still extremely far from the greatness of F-Zero (or Wipeout high difficulties).\n\nHowever the game is still in Early Access (much more like a tech demo), it will probably have more modes once completed, maybe with a proper anti-gravity speed.\n\nIt's a good bet for any Wipeout fan, the others can wait though.\n\n---------\n\nAl momento è probabilmente l'unico successore spirituale a Wipeout presente su Steam.

WipEout is the pinnacle of high speed anti-gravity racing, surpassing F-Zero and any other contender with ease.\n\nWith that being said, what Formula Fusion promises to bring to the table is a successor to this franchise that can exist outside of the PlayStation brand.\n\nThe graphics look great, however the ship design is lacking compared to the original WipEout series and the handling model is most similar to WipEout Fusion for PlayStation2 which is generally considered as the the least impressive game in the entire franchise. The soundtrack is not up to par with franchise standards either, though this was predictable since the developer no longer has access to the massive library of Sony-owned music.\n\nI want to recommend this game, but I feel as though the future of this game is uncertain. R8Games steam profile has 48 hours on CS:GO, 25 hours on CS:Source, and 0.4 hours on Formula Fusion. Thats not very encouraging.\n\nI plan on keeping this review updated, but right now I would only suggest purchasing this game if you are familiar with the WipEout franchise and want to see this title succeed. For those who haven't had the pleasure of playing one of the previous games, I would say; enter at your own risk.

Plus sides: decent music so far, especially as of the latest update. The handling is pretty good, though it takes a bit of getting used to. Really, really nice graphically, especially the Niagara GP circuit. You can notice the different teams handling differently (personal fave so far is the team "OK") so there's nice variation. You also get the same sense of adrenaline rush and reward after practice that you get in Wipeout, which I love.\n\nDownsides: As mentioned, the controls take a bit of getting used to. At first it's very easy to over-steer, making it feel like drunk driving, but once you get the hang of it, it's not so bad. Could do with being a /little/ less sensitive though IMO. The game also seems to have mixed performance. I can run it smoothly on highest settings, but it seems like every so often the game ♥♥♥♥s itself for a few seconds and lags really hard, and then goes back to normal. Optimisation problems maybe? Turning the graphics/resolution down has not fixed this. Also, the rockets seem really overpowered as a weapon. If you get hit by one when your shields are at 3/4 full or less, it seems like you just die instantly, it's ridiculous. Unless I'm just really unlucky.\n\nProblems aside though this has serious potential and I'd really love to see it succeed. It's nice how the devs listen to feedback from the fans too (if you're reading this, hi, R8!). Might be a bit pricey for the average gamer due to its Early Access status, but if you're a racing game or especially a Wipeout aficionado, it;s well worth the buy.","February 25","true","5.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Thankfully, this airbrake system is a lot smoother, and once you get the hang of it you don't need to let go of accellerate. This is also the first racing game I've seen to make full use of the arrow keys. As many people have said. This is in very early development and you can only get 1 track (day/night modes are available). Personally, in the future, I'd like to see skin customisation like there was on wipeout pulse, but that's probably a long way off.

The problem is it feels like it's going nowhere, and that the game was mean't to be released in 2016, and I can't even tell if this would be considered ready for a 2017 launch, every (the few) updates they had, the physics were completely different every time, it looks like they can't consider sticking to 1 set of physics without changing it again on the next update. The current version lack massively of content, and is extremely buggy, unpolished and doesn't feel stable at all. The only + I can give to this game are the graphics of the only tracks there is.\n\nTo those you don't even know what wipEout is, do not buy this. To those who knows, buy at your own risk.","June 5","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
