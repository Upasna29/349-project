Ignore the haters.\n\nHitomebore is a love story visual novel that, from my understanding, was made mostly by one person. Originally released last year at COMITIA 107, the Steam version comes with improved CGs and an English translation by Sekai Project. Hitomebore runs on Renpy, which is fairly uncommon for a Japanese production despite its status as the go-to visual novel framework in the West, so that's quite interesting.\n\nThe game's strongest point (by a considerable margin) is its creepy look. There is a short animated clip whenever the chapter changes. Unfortunately, like so many other visual novels, the game runs natively in a low, 4:3 resolution.\n\nMusic is MIDI-tier at times, but not unpleasant to listen to. I kind of like the main theme in fact, but it's not something I'd listen to outside of the game.\n\nStory is where it all falls apart, both in terms of length and writing quality. Without spoiling anything, let's just say that the game never takes full advantage of its fairly unique theme of having a girl with one eye. You could replace it with a different condition without having to rewrite much of the story, which by the way is high school drama that we all have seen a thousand times before. Highlights are the scene where the MC feeds Sachi, and the scenes where he touches her scars. You will be getting about 2-3 hours of story, which for its price tag is quite short.\n\nFor 10 bucks I can't recommend it due to its length and writing, but since Sachi is such a likeable character and the game is an indie product, I can't regret spending 10 bucks on it either.","May 23, 2015","false","3.1"," 202 of 246 people (82%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","82","202","246","15","0"

The story is a somewhat normal high school drama. About 2-3 hours long. No paths or alternate endings. The extras include CGs, character sprites, and music. Unfortunately the text on the character profiles isn't translated (According to a comment from Sekai Project, this is coming in a future patch). There are also a few silly bonus scenes in the extras, and some history of the development as well.","May 18, 2015","true","3.4"," 126 of 154 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","126","154","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ziferoth/recommended/353330/","ziferoth","TrollANIMU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ziferoth/","50 products in account","A short kinetic visual novel, Love at First Sight: Hitomebore is a solo project by the artist Ray-K.\nThe plot is a fairly standard high school love-story/drama with an unusual character; Usui Satsi (or Sachi, as this official release has localized her name as). The story is warm for the most part, and touches on typical subjects in high school that come with being an "odd one out".\n\nThat being said, there isn't a whole lot to get out of this read if you aren't already predisposed to a few things:\nA) Liking Ray-K's cute and macabre artwork.\nB) Finding cyclops girls to be the most precious thing in the world (who doesn't?).\nC) You don't have stupidly high expectations because you've actually read (or tried to read) more than just the popular, cream of the crop VNs (with even some of those not actually being that good).\n\nI'll be frank, $10 is a steep price for this short read. There's nothing new or unprecedented here, just a small solo project that's well put-together for the most part. Ray-K is responsible for everything except some of the music and of course, the Ren'py engine.\nHowever, as a fan of Ray-K's art and general curiosity after skipping through an untranslated demo he released a while back, I was pleasantly surprised to see it translated and released here. I didn't hesitate at all to purchase it.\nThe game actually includes some nice extras: character profiles, stages of development, and some bonus scenes, but some are left untranslated at the moment. Hopefully that will be changed in the future.\nThe creator, Ray-K, admits it wasn't ultimately near his original vision in an Afterword that's included, but is very satisfied he was able to make a game featuring his character, Usui Satsi.\n\nBut yeah, buy this game so you can learn to love cyclops girls if for some reason you already don't and earn some cute trading cards.","May 19, 2015","true","3.0"," 74 of 89 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","74","89","3","0"

There's no ero in the game itself, but it has a few ero-guro undertones that might be off-putting for some. Even so, there's a certain soft grace to it all; Ray-K's painterly style brings warmth and tenderness to every scene, catching the restrained giddiness of young love in a way that might be lost with cleaner, flatter designs. It is, in a word, comfy.\n\nThe characters are likeable, for the most part, with Sachi standing head and shoulders over any run-of-the-mill moeblob love interest. She invites sympathy and the urge to protect, but her vulnerability never really grates. The music doesn't stand out by any means, but its gentleness supports the cozy atmosphere well.\n\nThere is very little beyond the story's single path, unfortunately — about two hours of content in all. Even the most casual reader will chew through it quickly, and depending on their tastes, they'll probably be left wanting more. It's perhaps not enough to warrant the full $10. But if it's on sale and you have five bucks to spare, time spent on crisp autumn back-streets with a cute cyclops girl is time well invested.\n\nAdmittedly, I might be biased here; that wide, bottomless eye will ease open your chest and grope the scars. But isn't that the point?\n\nPick this up if you enjoy cutely macabre aesthetics, monster girls, romance, and if you see it on sale.\n\n---\n+ Cute monster girl heroine\n+ Cozy autumn setting\n+ Warm, comfy art style\n+ The extra features serve as a fun little epilogue and development backstory\n+ When you're done with the story and extras, check the creator's Pixiv for a bit more\n\n- Only one story path\n- That one path is a little bare-bones and straightforward\n- At 2-3 hours, the VN is extremely short — perhaps too short to justify a $10 price tag","November 7, 2015","true","3.5"," 46 of 49 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","46","49","4","0"

Surely there can't any room left in that head for a brain? Ah, whatever. The only thing more bizarre is her choice in clothes. A melon wrapped in pink meringue springs to mind.\nThe story is quite cute, but I found something slightly disturbing about it. It's a very typical Japanese anime relationship that develops very slowly and is really gentle. All good so far. It tries to deal with the issues of a person who doesn't conform to norms…. but you get the idea that the female protagonist was made that way to appeal to the small number of males who find solace in the belief that if normal girls don't like them then maybe they can find an abnormal one that will.  Maybe I am being too harsh, but I have never really liked the overly demure female characters that seem fairly popular with Otakus. The novel goes so far to refer to the player as the protagonist at several points in the game, making it very clear who this game is aimed at.\nIn short, I think this novel will appeal to a niche market. It is very well produced, the illustrations are just fine, and while some will find the story very cute, others will be perplexed by it. I do recommend it, but with a lot of reservation.","May 21, 2015","true","3.9"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","39","47","7","0"

I'm happy that I didn't.\nI didn't hesitate to buy this, desiring something fresh, and found something that not only feels fresh but also kept me smiling through to and beyond the end.\n\n"Love at First Sight" is a short yet extremely charming visual novel,  set within typical school life, but with atypical characters.\nThe characters are few, but they all endearing and all contribute to the flavour of the story\n\nSachi, the heroine, is a timid and quiet girl that is "ocularly challenged".\nMamoru, the protagonist, is a transfer student who happens to be easy going, kind and is immediately, yet inexplicably, drawn to Sachi.\nTomoyori and Akemi are Mamoru's friends, both individually unique in personality, yet caring and accepting of each other and those around them.\nLesser of the cast of characters is Sachi's aunt, Mayumi, and of course, the bully Rui. However, these two offer support to and insight into Sachi's character and condition.\n\nThe graphics are refreshingly unique in style, working well within the context of the story and create a captivating atmosphere. Creepy cute.....\n\nAlthough basic and synthed, the soundtrack works well, adding texture to the unvoiced story and supporting the unique atmosphere. I feel it possibly has more variety than some titles that have higher production budgets or larger support staff in spite of the DIY nature of the music.\n\nAlthough a short and unvoiced story, it is nonetheless captivating and character attachment develops easily. The protagonist isn't a complete imbecile, and stays true to the name, Mamoru  (Japanese for "protect"). The heroine, Sachi, may be "ocularly challenged", but is a very cute character that is easily loved.\n\nEven though the author makes apologies for his creations shortcomings within the extras, I find no need to criticise the work.\nRather, Love at First Sight is a new favourite of mine, was time well and enjoyably spent, with a pittance of an investment required.\n\nDon't hesitate. Buy it. Enjoy it. Love it (at first sight)!","May 19, 2015","true","5.6"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","34","45","3","0"

The story is told through the lens of Mamoru, who one day meets Sachi, a pupil who is regularly bullied and has lost sight of her dreams. When Mamoru first contacts her, she is very shy towards him. However, they end up seeing eye-to-eye on many things, and their relationship is magnified as a result.\n\nSince this is a kinetic VN, most of the story is told through one point of view, and the exploration of themes is a bit near-sighted because of its short length, but for what it's worth, this is a pretty decent feel-good game that doesn't lose focus on its artistic vision. Because of that, I can turn a blind eye on its faults and recommend it.","May 8","true","5.0"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","100","17","17","15","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Schir/recommended/353330/","Schir","Schir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Schir/","516 products in account","Love at First Sight isn't very good. I'll start with that. The game's story is nothing to write home about. It's a boring, standard, high-school romance. Now, sure, there's nothing wrong with a clichéd story, but if a story's going to be cliché, it needs to make up for it in some other area.\n\nOkay, so if the story's cliché, how about the characters? Well, they're just as two-dimensional as the story. The protagonist is a VN protagonist. He's 'nice,' kind of, and that is all there is to him. The cyclops girl, Sachi, is the shy one who doesn't have any friends. The supporting cast is comprised of the loud one and the cynical one. That's all I remember about them. The antagonist is 'the bully', who I'm convinced only exists to justify the writer ham-fisting his fetish for scars into the game.\n\nDid I mention that the author really likes scars? Because there are at least three different scenes in the game where the protagonist touches Sachi's scars. Each scene is written with the sort of lurid prose you see when you know that the writer is masturbating furiously to what they're writing.\n\nMoving away from the author's fetishes, let's talk about the soundtrack. It's even worse than the story. Every song is made using bad MIDI instruments that don't mesh well. The songs themselves have no sense of what constitutes a good melody or harmony, leaving a soundtrack that manages to almost be mediocre at its very best.\n\nThe art's interesting enough, it has a decent, sketch-like aesthetic, but I question if that's intentional or just a result of the fact that the game was made in the space of two months by a single guy.\n\nNow, length: The game is an hour and a half long. It's an appropriate length for what it is, but certainly not worth the ten dollars it's charging.\n\nAll in all, this game is really not very good and there are so many things better than this that you could be spending your money on. Hell, there are visual novels better (and longer) than this at the same price point or lower on Steam right now.\n\ntl;dr: If you really, really like cyclops girls, amateurish storytelling, and scars, I won't stop you from buying this. For everyone else, give it a pass.","May 20, 2015","false","1.6"," 131 of 219 people (60%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","60","131","219","32","11"

As a personal fan of Ray-Kbys' artwork, this piece displays some of his most inspired 2-D animations, which are short, but are used to astounding effect. This being a fairly short piece (I finished all content within 5 hours), hearing that this may have been a full-blown dating sim game with a branching story (if Ray-K hadn't procrastinated until 2 moths before) raises my hopes that Ray-Kbys may try his more determined hand at a full-blown dating sim one day.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who likes vanilla romance visual novels, people who like cute anime games, people who like unique artwork, people who are into injury/cyclops girls/sickeningly sweet romance fetishes, and just people with good humor, as this VN displays all these qualities and more. Just enough character development is placed into the story to entice veteran 2D romance enthusiasts and critics of the genre alike. As an added benefit, the cards for this game sell for nearly as much as the game itself on 50% off atm, assuming you don't wish to collect them for the rare adorable-cyclops-girl Steam backgrounds, so buy away!\n\nWell worth $5, still worth $10 for VN enthusiasts.

The only complaint i have is that it's too short and that it's lacking polish in some parts of the story.  But other than that the game is amazing.

ALOT of those flood the market nowadays.  and although there is a bully character who harasses Sachi,  This game more of a heartwarming boy-meets-girl where the girl just so happens to have only one eye rather than a dramatic "Good People Die get over it" story such as Game of Thrones.\n\n'Eye' recommend this game to anyone who loves heart-warming romance stories with a happy ending.\n","May 26, 2015","true","4.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","7","7","5","0"

More than once there were times you would expect there to be more shown, but he just ends up alluding to events and then skipping right over them (presumably cuts made to get the game done on time). The story with the main antagonist ended in a very unsatisfactory manner, though I will refrain from expanding on that any further to avoid spoilers. Most of the side characters also didn't really get as much time as I would have liked in order to get to know them better. Also -- unless you share in some of the creator's fetishes for things like injuries -- a lot of the dialog will seem forced, weird or unnecessary as they are mainly tacked on to serve his own indulgences. Last nitpick about the story is that, while this is tagged as a visual novel, it would be more accurate to call it a kinetic novel due to the linear nature of the story and lack of any choices along the way.\n\nThe art style is nice and the main selling point that drew me to this title. Though as with everything else about this game, it would have been nice to of had more of it, for instance there was very little by way of CG stills/cutscenes. However, it does have a far more coherent and enjoyable aesthetic than most other amateur VN offerings and deserves a fair bit of praise for that alone.\n\nSound was just so-so. Some of the music could use a bit of work, there were some grating off key notes thrown in inexpertly throughout a few of the tracks that detracted from my enjoyment, but otherwise the soundtrack was ok and fit the story well enough.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it, but the creator really should have came back and put another 2-4 months into this before bring it to Steam, then this would have been well worth the asking price and a highly recommended title for those who enjoy quirky VNs. But as it stands I can't recommend it unless you find it on a pretty decent sale, as you just wont get your money's worth otherwise.","May 18","false","5.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Its a nice change from the usual dating a childhood friend, school friend, senpai or a workmate and has you dating a Adorable girl by the name of Sachi Usui who was born with only one eye.\n\nMost Dating sim visual novels dont have monsters girls in them, i do know visual novels that do have them but this visual novel wouldn't be considered a "Monster girl" dating sim because the Sachi is anything but a monster. Just a misunderstood girl who was bullied all the way through school because of her eye, and this really hits home on a personal level for me (not the eye thing) and made me grow to like Sachi even more. I wont ruin the story in this review/reccomendation but if you are looking for a Visual novel dating sim with nice artwork, lovely soundtrack and a very adorable love interest you should definately buy this game.\n","November 1, 2015","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The pacing and story is great with only a few dull moments here and there.\n\nThis isn't a typical romance VN. Its not overly cheesy, has more going on thematically then just romance including some kind of unsettling moments, and other characters (well 2 out of the 3 more minor ones) actually have a significant role to play in the story, so you don't  feel like you're trapped following a hapless protag around while he tries to get laid.\n\nPros\n- Great art style. which is mostly what caught my eye about the game (heuheuheuhueh)\n- Music is pretty decent too.\n- The story is interesting enough and has some pretty cool moments\n- SACHI!!!!!!!\n- Short and good for when you don't feel like taking on a 50+ hour epic with 1000+ choices.\n- No choices (could be a pro or con)\n- Got oddly aroused during a certain scene and now find myself asking some hard questions.\n\nCons\n- It could be a bit longer but by the Devs own admission, he rushed the game to reach a deadline and didn't get to add more routes/ choices etc.\n- Sometimes the protag is kind of annoying, but hey, writing facless yet relatible characters that players can project onto is hard.\n\n\n10/10 would date a cyclops gorl again.","March 15","true","2.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Like reading a book or short story on a tablet or your computer.\nSome give you the option to make decisions while others are simply telling a story. There are plenty of Visual Novels on other places besides Steam. Some good, bad, serious, funny, all-ages, and the more adult oriented ones.\nIf you'd like you can check out more here Visual Novel Database[vndb.org]\n\nI am still very very VERY new to the VN scene.\nI have a few more VN's stashed away for a rainy day, but my Japanese is at level 0\n\nAnyways\nThis isn't actually a review, but more of a "my experience with this Visual Novel"\n\n\nSo the overall Story:\n(I'll try to not to go into detail to spoil any of it. So I apologize if my review seems a bit blunt)\nThe story takes about 2 - 3 hours to complete and gets to the point rather quickly.\nAs most of you already know from the pictures on its Steam Store Page, it's about the girl with 1 eye.\n\nThe Writing:\nI wouldn't say it's the best, but I feel that it could have been worked on better.\nThe dialogue describes the characters couple that with the character design and you can easily make out which and what kind of personality a character has.\nI did get a few laughs from some of the dialogue though.\nThe Author himself said that he felt that he wished he had more time to work on the game before the deadline to turn his work in.\n\nThe Characters:\n(Sorry can't go into too much detail with this!)\nYou have the\nEmotionless\nHappy-Go-Lucky\nTimid/Shy\nThe Antagonist\nI really wish the Creator took more time to flesh out the Characters more. There are hints that provide what kind of past 1 or 2 characters have had, but as for the rest the Creator doesn't really go into detail about the others.\nThere seemed to be a lot of potential to give the characters a ton of background story. But I guess the Creator didn't have much time to do that with the deadline so close.\n\nThe Music\nThe music in a Visual Novel is supposed to set the tone for current events in the story.\nBut in this case it's a bit of a "hit or miss"\nSome of the music just doesn't seem to fit or could have been done better to better fit the mood to either tense it up or bring it back down.\nThere were some scenes that didn't need any music at all like some of the classroom scenes.\nAnd certain scenes that needed its own special music different from the usual ones that come up throughout the story.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nThe Story itself had a lot of potential to add a lot of things.\nLike different endings, different routes, and maybe even more chapters\n\nIf the Creator had more time to flesh out the game more I'm sure he would have made something even more amazing.\nIf only he had more time.\n\n***I really wish more Visual Novels would release on Steam\nAnd I really wish that people took the time to play through the VN and review it instead of leaving stupid comments like "SO CUTE WOULD WAIFU AND FUG TO OBLIVION LOL"\nI get sick of seeing people with less than an hour of playtime reviewing the game and giving it a review similar to that.\nPlease try to avoid being these kind of people.\nIt's an Anime related game on Steam. I get it, but at least try.\nIf you want a perfect example of what I'm talking about just look at some of the reviews for other VN's on Steam.***\n\nThey are trying to tell a story, but there are people that think it's a joke because they see a side-boob.","May 19, 2015","true","2.8"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

The heroine is really cute (not sure whether I should say "even with" or "because of") her conditions, Mr. MC is -quite surprisingly- not a dense piece of junk and all the side characters are unique and fun (lets just ignore Miss SBJK(props if you get this) for now).\nThe story pretty much goes as you'd expect (some might call it 'generic' but I think it's simply the best way to go about a story like that in most cases) and the development is fun to watch (although it DOES feel a bit like it was too fast at times).\nIt's a Kinetic Novel (=no choices/paths), but I didn't mind as I wouldn't have want the story to have any major differences from what we have now, the only thing that's a bit sad is that it's only about 3 hours long (4 if you take your time and look at all the extras and stuff)\nOverall, i really recommend this VN if you have the money and want to die of cuteness.

A cute story about Sachi Usui, a Cyclops girl and her first love, you, Mamoru.\nA sweet story, with no choices or alternate endings, which is slightly unfortunate. I was hoping for maybe at least two endings for $10. Alas.\nIt does feature small cutscenes that are partially animated, which are a sort of creepy-cute sort of thing.\nI'm having a good time with this game, but I feel like I won't play it again\n7/10","May 19, 2015","true","2.5"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShabozEngine/recommended/353330/","ShabozEngine","Heresy Magic Master Shaboz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShabozEngine/","213 products in account","Love at First Sight is a simple romance visual novel, and its a very adorable one at that. While it may not have the action, cast, or production budget of bigger name VNs, I actually prefer small and simple ones like this. The whole thing is over in about two to three hours, but it manages to tell its story well enough.\nStarting with the positives of the game, the between-chapter animations are adorable. The very first time I saw one I let out an audible squeal that I am not ashamed of. Theyre simple but well executed in ways that will make your heart melt. Continuing with the uguu-train, Sachi herself is a very adorable love interest and easily one of my favorites, even out of bigger name VNs that Ive played. Although her character isnt anything new, the person who made the game knew what they were doing and how to use Sachi for maximum effectiveness. I would take one Sachi over a hundred Sakura Matous any day.\nThe supporting cast of the VN is also very enjoyable, however scarse they are. There is only six named characters in the entire VN, and while that is a disappointing thing, the cahracters are all likeable enough that you wont even care. Akemi and her explosively cheerful attitude and Tomo's indifference play off of each other like poetry, and I really enjoy seeing characters like them. As stated before, Sachi is one of my favorite VN characters. She makes my heart sing. The main character, Mamoru is bland as white bread, but that is of course to be expected of a VN protag so that the reader can realte more. If he went around kicking puppies, then I dont think many people could relate.\nUnfortunately after the good must come the bad, and Ill start with the worst offender that youll be dealing with the whole game: The music is terrible. It sounds like a cheap MIDI on a fifteen second loop. I understand that the game was made by a single person, and I understand that you might not be an author AND a composer, but its still a negative.\nThe plot is a standard VN highschool plot: Boy transfers in, boy has small or nonexistant group of friends, finds outcast girl, helps her come out of her shell, kiss kiss fall in love, and then help her overcome her main issue in the story. If youre expecting twists and turns, then you are a fool. While the plot and character archetypes are all very known by this point, I do have to mention that they are all well done, especially for how long the VN is.\nFor the praise I gave Akemi earlier, I must tack on some sins as well. The game doesnt allow her to be as expressive as she is due to the limited facial expressions and poses that it provides. This doesnt detract from her character of my enjoyment of the VN, but it does leave me wanting more out of her that I will be unable to have.\nNow we have to get to the elephant in the room: Why does Sachi have two tear ducts when she only has one eye? Huh? Seriously though, the elephant is the scar scenes. I had no idea I was into that kinda thing, but it's said you get a new fetish everyday, right? While the "normal and well adjusted" people playing this will inevitably be very weirded out, I welcome the scar scenes for all they are, and enjoyed them. I didnt see it as Mamoru just being a creeper, but instead as a show that Sachi trusts him enough to let him touch her in places she's been hurt at. That being said, the fact that Mamoru himself points out to the reader how strange it is to be doing it does not actually make it any less strange. In fact, shining a light on it like that only brings more attention to it, as opposed to letting the scenes flow natually as they should.\nOverall Id say this visual novel is fairly high on my list, as I enjoyed it immensely. It may just be my love of monster girls and apparently scars talking, but I give this game a very deserved 8.5/10. Id highly recommend this game. I look forward to seeing more of this creator's work in the future and wish the best for him.","October 8, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Short. simple and sweet. Love at First Sight is, as you all know, about a girl with one eye and an average student who fall in love. Music is pretty average, but if you take the time to go through the extras you'll know why, this game was made in under two months, which makes me love it even more actually. Art style is absolutely amazing, fell in love with it at first sight, heh. The story itself is also very well written, it feels rushed at times, and I wish I could've seen more of Mayumi-chan and Rui, but I guess that's what happens when you have a very short time limit for making a VN. I give Love at First Sight a 9/10. If you have $10 laying around and want to read a heart warming, cute story, you cannot go wrong with this.

I will try to keep this completely spoiler-free, which means I will probably not talk much about it story-wise.\n\n- Story and Characters\n\nYou must have noticed that the heroine of this VN isn't your mainstream moe heroine, she's way more cute and interesting. I won't say anything else about her, because I found out that actually getting to know her through the story is what made this such a great experience for me.\n\nThe story is short and the cast small, but I loved every part of it, even the slightly strange ones.\nYou have two very likeable characters as your support casting, who are not just filling up the space, but instead have their own things going on. Their personalities are also built very clear, so that the way they act and interact with you and the other characters feels very natural.\n\nAlso, don't forget to check the Extras after you finish. There are a few extra scenes there.\n\n- VN\n\nNow, for the technical stuff.\nThis is a linear visual novel with a single route. Which means it's more like a digital book than a game itself, and to be fair most visual novels are exactly that. I would say the greatest selling point of this kind of product is that you get an experience similar to those you would get from reading books, comics or manga, but with the extras allowed by the medium used to convey the story.\n\nA story can be conveyed in many different forms. A linear visual novel allows you to attach shifting scenes to every piece of dialogue, with characters in different poses over backgrounds. You are also allowed to place pictures drawn for special events, and in this game's case, even small cutscenes for every chapter title. And finally, wrap it all up with music fitting for every moment. This is an experience that is most close to reading a novel, with many additionals you'd only get from it being digital.\nIf this is what you came here looking for, then Love at First Sight is indeed what you want.\n\n- Art\n\nAs for the art, I feel particularly drawn to the hard lines and the painting style, which reminds me of another VN that I live very much, which is Danganronpa. The animated cutscenes are very well made and looked really cute. I enjoyed it.\n\n- Music\n\nThe music in the game feels really nice to the ears and blends well with the ambience. Most of the times, I barely even notice it's presence, as I felt it was part of the scene itself and not just something on the background. My regards to kyou1110 for the great work, though I did like every song of the game.\n\n- Conclusion\n\nFinally, I want to congratulate Ray-K for making this great game. Making a game isn't easy, and making a game by yourself is a hard challenge. But, making a game of this quality by yourself is no short of heroic. People like you and Toby Fox are what I consider heroes in this industry. So, in short, thank you very much.","May 2","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

An enjoyable reading for a relaxing afternoon.\nThe story itself is a pretty straightforword romance tale. There're no surprising plot-turning events. Everything goes exactly as you expect it would be, yet in a very delicate and graceful way.\nSachi is extremely adorable depite her extraordinary look, and I fell in love with her at the first sight just like the protagonist did. Her character development is also smooth and believable, and gets you attached to her from start to end. Unfortunately other characters could use a more polish, maybe especially for Mayumi.\nArt design is the selling point here IMO. Ray-K's heavy, rough and somewhat eerie style gives the game a distinguishing look just like the heroine. It may not look as exquisite as some of the other VNs, but it's stunningly beautiful and fits the theme very well.\nMusic is  pretty simple, nothing stands out but certainly not annoying. Missing Love is a nice little piece.\nThere're also some fun stuff to check out in Extras after finishing the story if you are interested. They give some insights about the game's development, also some mini episodes that add to the main story.\nTo sum up, if you like a sweet, peaceful romance story with a very adorable girl that makes you urge to sympahize and protect,  definitely give this one a try.","May 2","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found the characters likable, the story enjoyable, despite being completely predictable, and the art decent. As far as dialogue is concerned, it fit and made sense, yet I still found it slightly dull somehow, with exceptions for all of the puns and reoccuring themes.\n\nIn the extras the developer said that he rushed the game for a release date and procrastinated for some time. This is evident in a few places, which are not that horrible, and for which I was surprised for him to site as examples of this. The greatest effect of this though is actually the limitation of certain characters in regards to their presence, the scope of their personalities, the amount of scenes that they are in, their actual appearance in the game, and segments of story that would make sense to include, or would have been nice to have in it.\n\nFor some reason despite wondering why the affection object character, Sachi Usui, was depicted as being constantly injured and wearing bandages in screenshots before buying it, I didn't realize how much of a fetish game this is. It contains no nudity or purely sexual content, however Sachi is almost entirely based on fetish fufilment, and fetish interests are very heavy throughout the story. It didn't bother me, however it did catch me off guard. The fetish themes are: cyclops(obviously), scars/injuries, feeding, and protecting/nurturing someone helpless.\n\nBeneath the fetish fulfillment there is a very sweet and endearing story which I will remember and am glad that I experienced.","May 5","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's not a bad thing per se, although I'll admit it would have been nice to have some choices.\n\nOverall Love at First Sight is a cute little visual novel that'll take around three hours to read. I enjoyed the story as well as the characters. The art is nice and I found myself engrossed in it's story. Since I bought this on a sale I don't know if it's really worth ten dollars, but if you're a fan of romantic visual novels then I definitely recommend checking it out. My only real complaint is that there are a few typos in the English version, but since it was originally in Japanese it's a bit understandable, and the typos aren't very common.\n\nSo if you're a fan of these types of games then I recommend it, it's cute, and I certainly enjoyed reading it.","May 7","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nThe game itself is a very limited Visual Novel. There's only one path to take, you have no conversation options and it's basically just a pimped out graphic novel for you to click through. The story is a bit lackluster and "typical" as far as <insert yourself here> VN's go.\n\nEven after all these faults, why do I recommend this game? Because I learned a lot about the process and how this game came to be via the bonus content that you unlock after finishing the game and I have a lot of respect for the creator and how he handled his situation. This is basically a one-man-show and he created it in the shortest time period. Mad props.\nAlso: The art style resonates with me. It's creepy-adorable and I kind of want to see a full color graphic novel type manga from this creator.\n\nPS: I'm glad the creator specified in the bonus content that he has a fetish for feeding and scar touching. If you find those things a bit odd, some scenes might make you a bit uncomfortable. I got a bit weirded out but hey, who am I to judge.

I finished one playthrough on a leisurely pace in 1 hours and 30 minutes. $10 for less than 2 hours of playtime is undeniably a steep price.

It's not deep, but it has some amusingly self-aware fetishy moments (eyes, scars) and a neat concept for anyone who likes the whole moe monstergirl thing. Unfortunately, I'm not able to recommend it. After less than two hours of play, I'd seen every scene and acquired every achievement. There is no replay value, there are no alternate routes. There is no clever twist - every plot development is visible from a mile away, and there aren't very many of them to begin with. The characters are flat, one-note cliches, and the final conflict in the story consists of the antagonist (who has no motive) just... deciding to leave, forever. It's cute, sure, but it's also short and kind of boring.\n\nAt £6.99, I absolutely can't recommend it.

Published by the folks at Sekai Project, this high school romance chronicles the blossoming relationship between a shy girl named Sachi Usui and a transfer student called Mamarou. What is so distinguishing about this generic plot I hear you ask? Well, if the game’s picture hasn’t given it away already, Sachi happens to be a Cyclops. The novel’s leading lady was born with a single giant eye and no nose… although that isn’t too odd, as anime characters tend to be lacking in the schnoz department. Love between a human and a monster girl sounds weird to me, but then again what do I know? Monster Musume sells by the bucket load so clearly there is a market out there for geeks who lust after mythological creatures.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nOur unorthodox tale of love begins with Mamarou bumping into a tearful Sachi. The ocular challenged cutie is feeling low, as a nasty classmate has been tormenting her. Although taken aback by her distinct appearance, Mamarou cannot get Sachi out of his head after their inaugural encounter. Wanting to get to know her better Mamarou begins to meet up with Sachi during recess. After learning that Sachi is an avid reader he begins to woo her with a stockpile of manga before eventually asking her out to a movie. Ah, so that’s what I have been doing wrong. I keep wasting money on flowers and chocolates. Next time I try to court a beauty I will shower her with comics instead.\n\nLove at First Sight’s supporting cast, which you can count on one hand, includes Mamarou’s two best friends. Akemi is a bubbly lass blessed with a motor mouth and is the polar opposite of Tomonori who is much more reserved and sombre. Although likable, Mamarou’s chums are fairly one-dimensional and no I’m not talking about the way they are drawn. The same applies to Rui – the bully who picks on Sachi. Always seen with a scowl on her face, she is presented as a stereotypical troublemaker who preys on the meek. Perhaps the most fleshed out character from the bunch is Sachi’s aunt. She is initially presented as a cold-hearted foster parent, but the novel’s later chapters reveal that her relationship with Sachi is a bit more complex than that.\n\nVERDICT\n\nMy rating for Love at First Sight is three stars. It’s a sweet short story brought to life by some striking artwork. Creepy Cute is the artist responsible for creating the novel and it must be said that he lives up to his moniker. Although the graphics have an eerie quality to them he still manages to make the scar covered Sachi look adorable. Even though the story is sold on starring a mono-eyed girl the narrative doesn’t dwell too deeply on Sachi’s looks and reads like a standard teen romance. The only thing weird about the plot is Sachi’s fondness for having her wounds caressed. Is this a clever way of exploring intimacy without resorting to potentially controversial sex scenes? Nah. In the extras section the author openly admits to having a scar fetish.\n\nI would award Love at First Sight a higher score if it weren’t for its steep asking price. The whole thing can be read in just two hours, which isn’t great given that the download costs £7.00. A bit more content would have been nice, especially as Sachi’s final confrontation with Rui feels a tad rushed. Due to time constraints (the whole project was made in a couple of weeks to meet a convention deadline) there are also no branching paths to explore, which hurt the title’s replay value. Those quibbles aside, I still give Love at First Sight a thumbs up. Sachi’s plight should resonate with any readers who suffer from shyness, victims of bullying or anyone who has self-esteem issues pertaining to their physical appearance. Don’t let the cost put you off sampling this treat. If money is an issue “eye” recommend waiting for an inevitable Steam discount.","June 5, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't care about branching paths (of which this game has none) since i usually just put myself in the main characters's shoes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rinshankouhai/recommended/353330/","rinshankouhai","utsuro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rinshankouhai/","321 products in account","Let's get this out of the way: Yeah, it's pretty short. Everyone's touched upon that. I'm sure Ray-K feels that it should be longer, too, but as he lays out in the afterword, he gave himself too short of a deadline. Having to make almost every aspect of the game himself, from the story to the art to some of the music, it fell short of his own expectations. Honestly, even I was a little disappointed by the way the story abruptly ends without resolving some important and interesting plot threads, but after reading the included words from the creator, I felt a little more sympathetic.\n\nHowever, even if it's a little stunted, it's extremely charming. I don't remember the last time a VN like this has made me go "HHHNNNNGGGGGGHHH!!!!" over a character so many times. Sachi is unbelievably cute, with irresistably sweet moe elements slathered on so heavily I think I almost went into cardiac arrest. The protagonist's name is 'Mamoru,' or 'to protect,' and you'll almost certainly end up following that sentiment. Once I learned about Sachi's problems, I immediately had a burning passion to protect her and make things better for her. She's mind-bendingly cute. I don't know how she wouldn't melt the ice around your heart. The artist clearly has a deep passion for her, and it shows; the romance with her has a lot of impact. Others have mentioned that her one-eyedness isn't 'utilized' enough, and she could easily have any other disorder; however, I feel like not focusing too much on her specific disorder made the romance feel less directly fetishistic, which worked out well.\n\nOther than the heart-explodingly adorable heroine, the art is very charming and somehow satisfying to look at. The story is a little simple, but it's very sweet, a heartwarming sort of tale with a few little surprises and victories to keep you going. I found the banter between Tomo, Akemi and Mamoru to be a little tiring sometimes; as much as I liked the three of them, they kept going through the same tired routine of chastising Akemi for being too energetic over and over again, and their banter felt a little hackneyed. Still, they were charming, too, and it all left a good impression.\n\nThere's an antagonist character, and I won't give too much away, but you'll absolutely hate her at first. Then there's a section which might change your mind a little, and then just when it seems we'll get some character development... the game just ends. It ends on a much-anticipated scene, too, so again, I can't say the ending wasn't a letdown, but the rest of the game makes up for it.\n\nWhat else? Well, there's not much else to it. The music is a little discordant at times, but not unpleasant, easy enough to listen to. The backgrounds are all nicely drawn, there's some nice little animations in between the chapters, and the cute bandage-themed UI really adds to the game's charm. There are some surprising moments of fetish play related to stroking Sachi's scars, but it actually turns out to be pretty cute, and the game never veers too much into indecent territory to ruin its sweetness. While the protagonist was a little generic, I really appreciated that he wasn't creepy or perverted like most VN protagonists. He had a sincere desire to protect Sachi, and it was easy to empathize with him.\n\nSo, overall, it's a short story and it could use a little more fleshing out, but I certainly don't regret the purchase. It's totally bursting with charm, and will definitely lighten your mood. I'd love to see Ray-K try his hand at a longer work without so much deadline pressure, and I would absolutely adore seeing more of Sachi in general. I highly recommend this game if you need a sweet, heartwarming pick-me-up; a good, old-fashioned heaping helping of soul-cleansing moe, with just enough of a macabre twist to give it a unique charm. That gleaming eye will definitely stick in my memory for a long time to come.","July 3, 2015","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had always wanted him to continue this game but after I played it myself I see why he didn't. This game is simple, the creator even bashes himself for doing this in the afternotes, however I like the game more cause of it. There's no way to fail this game, no way to go down a path you didn't want to take, no way to mess something up. The music, as simplistic as it is, is very nice and catchy and changes somewhat frequently, my most favorite track was when there was drama with Rui. The story is nice and simple, shy girl who has no courage or anything like that and gets bullied, falls in love with a boy who loves her back, she slowly comes out of her shell and even stands up to her bully, an almost cliche type of character development but at least it's there, some games the characters develop so little during hours of gameplay if at all. The only thing that really makes Sachi different is the fact that she's a cyclops, other than that she's no different from anyone else, and as a guy who doesn't judge on appearances I easily see why Ma-Kun (don't want to type his name wrong) was attracted to her, heck I'd date her if she existed. Could this game be longer, yes (note it says I have like 7 hours into the game but I had left it running while did other things) but just because it's short is really only something that an individual has to decides is a good or bad thing. Do you want a game that you play for hours and not get anywhere significant (like most rpg's) or do you want to play a game that's short but be entertained while you play for those few short hours. Is this a perfect game, no but most aren't, I personally would've liked to see Tomo and Akemi get more and more intimate and actually admit how they feel, round 2 of Ms. Bully (Rui) and Ms. Upbeat (Akemi), and even a b*tch slap delivered to Rui via the small scarred hand of Sachi, but those are personal nitpicks, maybe in a continuation of this story and again I would prefer it this style, simple straight to the point, just something that you'll sit down to for an hour or two just to enjoy a nice little romance story without the filler of anime or the images of manga or the complexity of a dating sim (cause let's be honest some of these styles of games can be pretty complex with their choice/path system and all sorts of flags) I would personally rate this a 4/5, it's simple, fun, no hassle, just an overrall carefree game. I recommend this to any fan of anime, manga, and vn's who just want to a nice time and relax.","March 25","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The feelings that the story gave me were quite immersive, as well as beautifully written in a simplistic--yet poetic--style to where I could feel my heart melt with each click of a page. Without spoiler, I will simply say that my heart had sank, stopped, and melted with every emotion under the sun with the help of this wonderous piece.\nThere are some strange sub-text fields, I'll admit--but having of known several 'quirky' individuals everything is actually all the more authentic. If you've ever enjoyed a heart-felt romance manga or anime, I'd highly reccomend this.

I do think, however, that the developer should create a sequel to this visual novel that depicts Sachi and the main character advancing in their relationship.

The artstyle is really nice and well done. The music is a bit meh but it does what it needs to do. Though there's nothing explicitly NSFW in the story, there are a few on the nose moments; it kinda makes the game feel more innocent and cute.\n\nUnfortunately the game is really short, about one to two hours, maybe three if you're a really slow reader or just admiring the art. Furthermore, the game feels rushed (what with its two month development period) and incomplete with lots of things being left out, it feels as if the game is like an unfinished canvas, it just needs a little more.

Art is nice, and although it is not ero the girls are cute, and you don't need to patch in ero bits to complete the story.\n\nTotally get it if you can get it for a good price.","April 17","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though it isn't an interactive game, I think it's a pretty heartwarming story. The fact that there are shorter parts where you can see the story from another person's side, is very well done and brings some dimension into the story.","May 22","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game was rushed, as the developer mentions in the extras menu he ran out of time and he agrees that the game was rushed thus he wasn't able to use all of his ideas for the story. However the game was still worth the read. I hope that in the future this guy will make another game with improvements, such as character&story interactions... maybe even a sequel? A remake of Teaching Feeling perhaps? Who knows. Overall the game was fun to read and totally worth the buy. Eye-guarantee it.","May 30","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it when it was on sale and considering the entertainment I got out of it I can safely say that it was money well spent. So if you enter this game with the idea of it just been a relaxing story that you can spen an hour or two with it is definitely worth a purchase.\n\nPros:\n\nAmazing art, the style simply is gorgeous, and the small cutscenes are wonderfully handled\nInteresting story and characters, every character feels like an actual person with consistent behaviours\n\nCons\n\nFeels like there are elements of the story that may be missing\nEnding is not quite complete (Definitive, but those looking for an ending that ties up all loose ends may be disappointed).\n\nSo in conclusion, should you buy this game... well it depends, I enjoyed it and can easily recommend it to fans of the genre, but it is worth going in with the expectations that it is a short experience that will leave you wanting more. Having said that though the fact that it leaves such a strong impression means that if you ever see it cheap don't even hesitate to try it, what it does it does well.","May 17","true","3.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
