Will be looking for more games from this Croatian developer. Looks like Artifex Mundi has some competition!","December 11, 2014","true","3.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The areas were well done, it actually felt like something was at stake in the game. I had to skip some of the puzzles because the controls were a bit wonky, but it's a small quibble for something that was otherwise quite fun.\n\n...is there some rule I don't know about that a casual HO game must contain two pieces of flint that start a fire?  If all you needed was moving flint, mountain ranges would be spontaneously combusting death traps. Oh, well. Recommended.","January 4, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Immersive, with a storyline that added just enough purpose without being intrusive (I hate games that have tons of dialogue). The animation is beautiful, a cross between cartoony and realistic. It was generally clear what to do with objects and how to progress. The mini-games were great, too -- it has the traditional mix of create-a-pathway, do a puzzle, follow the pattern, etc. but has some different twists. Just challenging enough to make me work, but not enough that I gave up or resorted to the walkthrough (okay, I did that once, but because I missed a hot spot...my only complaint is that the "hot spot" areas are very big, like an entire wall -- so if there are two close together, you might not find the second one because you're thinking, "that magnifiying glass will give me the same close-up I've gotten 10 times already, so what's the point?" but that's minor). I liked that you could customize your difficultly level. Unexpectedly, this HOG/Adventure game has four "boss" levels where you have to mix speed, accuracy, and problem-solving. Definitely got my heartrate up! Decent length, too. And the first thing I did when I finished it was to look for other games from Cateia!","February 8, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
