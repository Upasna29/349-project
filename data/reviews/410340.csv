Maybe coming from a RC background it would be easier, but having never flown a quad-copter before, being put in a box with one window to exit from is the equivalent of learning to pick locks by handcuffing yourself underwater. A typical gamer will need at least half hour in a large open space, preferably with a guide and controller indications explaining how the drone works by performing simple maneuvers ie "Take off, hover  at same altitude for 10 seconds" "Now fly forwards and backwards maintaining altitude" etc until the basics are natural.\n\nNext up, there really needs to be some sort of pre-made drones that handle differently for different levels of skill. Begin with a slow and sluggish drone that is forgiving and easy to fly, then work your way up as your skills improve. I know there is a workshop where I can edit my drone, and options to set motor speeds etc. but these should really be options I fiddle with after I have learned what is what, not while I am struggling to stay horizontal as I smash into another hay bale.\n\nSpeaking of hay bales. The maps. Seriously, I could be flying anywhere in the world, but here I am in some unbelievably dull locations. I am sure more maps are on the way, but even for RC enthusiasts this can't make much sense. Here are a few map ideas I would be excited to see in the final release:\nBoat (sinking titanic?)\nMusic festival (maybe Woodstock?)\nTheme Park\nHot Air balloon Show. (Take off from one balloon, and there are 30 others just floating about)\nConstruction tower.\nLiterally ANYWHERE! I understand that this is trying to be realistic, but a game like this also gives you the ability to do things you wouldn't usually be able to do, like fly in public areas full of people, or dangerous locations, and the lines required the fly for racing could be a lot more interesting than markers on the ground, like ducking behind a waterfall to emerge near a roller coaster track, which you must follow for while before shooting into a ghost train tunnel. Gimmicky? Yes, but if just a couple of unrealistic tracks were included, it would be a lot of fun.\n\nTL;DR I am enjoying the game, and hope to see it become more approachable, without losing it's realistic simulation edge. I recommend for anyone interested in FPV drone racing.","March 14","true","45.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","2"

The copter is way too floaty. It feels like gravity has been dialed down to 80% or something. Even with the props idle, the copter takes way too long to fall to earth. Doing sharp turns around flags, the copter slides as if it was weightless.\n\nThe collision model encourages bad habits. You can't just fly through a tree canopy in real life and keep going. Props do not take damage and then "heal up". They either break, and you crash, or they don't break.\n\nThis is an okay video game, but it is a bad simulator. I can't recommend this game at this time (0.2.2) for learning to fly. It will not teach you what it actually feels like to pilot a quadcopter.","December 23, 2015","false","3.6"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","29","45","4","4"

It's already a ton of fun to play and good practice for the real thing. The graphics are locations are especially impressive, and the workbench aspect adds a lot to the experience.\n\nThe things I would like to see prioritized moving forward are continuing to tweak the physics and adding at least a simple lap timer (ala freerider) so that it is more useful for training, even before the racing aspect is available.\n\nOverall, a great sim with lots of potential that is definitely recommended at this price.","December 27, 2015","true","5.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Several users have expressed issues with Transmitters not calibrating correctly or at all with the software.  If you have an RC Transmitter, there are a few guides already posted and several discussions with topics discussing how we've worked through some of those matters - but there are ultimately a LOT of cables and variances in how they're produces, and even more Transmitters that users have. If you're  having errors connected, post it and let's get you flying!  I personally have a Spektrum DX6, DX6i, Taranis Plus, and Turnigy 9x and all work well using a USB cable. The Spektrum devices took several calibration attempts, and then additional Sub-Trim manipulation, but work well after.\n\n* * * * * * * *\nAll around - I am really excited to see how they progress with this game. The 3 current levels are already beautiful and the multiplayer is going to be very exciting. Two thumbs up! (Then back to the joysticks!)\n\nNote: While this game does work decently with 360 or similar gaming controller, I do not recommend spending time to get used to it. Gaming joysticks are meant to center themselves when you release pressure. This is ideal for most game situations, but not with throttle. While I did use the 360 controller for the tutorial and first test level, and it was decent enough, once got my Spektrum transmitter connected to the game and calibrated - it was a night and day difference. Much easier flight, it was much more fun and it was much smoother feedback from the camera also as you won't be bobbing up and down.\n\nThis will be a must have for pilots that want the FPV experience without ruining their setups or going through tons of props in the early learning stages. Would also be great for teaching purposes.\n\nI have Real Flight, Phoenix RC and FMS Flight Sim that I have been using all three for quite some time. For a game delving into the FPV realm digitally - my first impression after 45 minutes of play: This is going to be amazing!!","November 12, 2015","true","10.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

I've spent well over 49 hours to date on this game and love it even more with every update.You can choose all your parts, set your sensitivity, tune all your PIDs and everything else that goes along with miniquad racing.

Overall the game looks really polished and fun to play. The customizable controls allow for complete control over my drone, besides that setting it up is very easy. I like the playable maps and I'm excited to see what's coming in the future!  The trackbuilder makes it easy to build my own tracks in a fun and easy way.

Maybe about 80% of it because the performance of the quadcopter in-game is way better than the entry level quadcopter i bought. The physics feel good enough, but still any simulator cannot fully emulate real life physics.\n\nIf you are a new FPV pilot looking to try out this hobby, I highly recommend you put some stick time into this simulator before trying it out in real life. If you are a seasoned pro FPV pilot, I also suggest getting this because it is a good tool to practice your skills between charges or if the weather doesn't permit you to fly.\n\nThats all for my review, have fun and fly safe!","May 15","true","39.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

However, this game is really close to it, gravity needs a little more effectiveness, at the time it feels like the drone floats a bit too much, but I know the guys at LuGus will eventually implement it perfectly. The game is a great tool for practicing without obliterating your wallet in props and other gear that would otherwise get damaged in accidents in real life flying.\n\nI love it, and I'm very much looking forward to the next updates with hopefully more tracks and awesome extra content. Amazing job, I'm veeeeery happy with it.\n\nFWIW, I'm flying with a RadioLink AT9, using the PengFei USB dongle set on AeroFly, I used manual preset creation to configure it, not a single issue.

I fly quads already but I'm trying to learn how to fly more aggressive racer quads. This game is helping me learn to fly with the tilted camera and with more power than I'm used to. The devs are very quick to fix any kind of problems and have improved the physics much since launch.\n\nThe physics overall feel pretty solid. It would be nice to see some wind or other factors that make the quad feel a little less on rails. It's not bad at all, though. Flying in the game feels pretty similar to real life.\n\nI'm using the Taranis controller. Quick note: the game doesn't take negative inputs from the taranis, so make a new model, modify the curves to only be 50, and offset by 50. This means your left roll, for example, is really at what is normally the centerpoint (0) and your right roll is what is normally full right (100). You'll have to do this for all channels.

Great job you've done there guys!!!\n\nAt first I wasn't able to map controls to my DX6i, what turned out to be my own fault in the end. But I was really impressed how well you could actually fly this thing with such a piece of crap of a controller like my totally worn out 5 years old 360 gamepad. This was already so much fun that I flew quite a while without worrying about setting up my DX6i properly.\n\nWhen I finally tried with a real rc transmitter I was blown away how great this sim handles and how much fun it is. Compared to yesterday it's a completely different experience!\n\nI was happy to see that it's possible now to turn off the OSD but couldn't find an option for changing the camera angle. But I#m confident this will be implemented soon.\n\nThe flight model feels good and kind of natural, but still is too easy compared to the real thing. I was able to pull off some maneuvers that would have had me crashed in real life. The quad also is not as "snappy" as I like it and PID tuning feels still a bit weird but again... I'm confident this will be fixed in the future.\n\nSo all in all this is a must have for anyone interested or already involved in FPV Racing!!!\n\n\n\n\nOld Review from yesterday:\n\n\nAt this point I cannot recommend this game for people who fly real fpv racequads...\n\nLooks like a good start to me, but a few things annoy the hell out of me and will make me stick with hotprops for now:\n\n- the hover point is way below stick center and cannot be adjusted. (Tested this on my old DX4e, my DX6i and my 360 Gamepad - Hover point is at around 25% throttle) I prefer a hover point at the stick center and afaik that's how most people fly\n\n- feels like zero throttle in fact isn't zero throttle... quad falls way too slow compared to real life experience\n\n- camera angle cannot be adjusted\n\n- no way to turn off the OSD ... I prefer flying without OSD\n\n\nThese are all things I'm sure will be fixed soon and besides those the flight model feels promising but needs more fine tuning and more real life feeling (for example jittering when decending into own propwash). There are quite a few sims out there that come near the feeling of piloting a fpv racequad and I really hope this one will come close or even spot on.\n\nTime will tell\n\n(this review will be updated once liftoff gets better)","November 9, 2015","true","21.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","8"

I love its drone simulation. The DIY Drone Workshop is very interesting, although I'm not sure how it affects the actual drone performance! The controller calibration and setup is very to use.\n\nThis game supports the Steam Controller, you can either use the standard Gamepad template as-is, or you can bind the gyro to the Right joystick, which means pitch and roll can be controller by moving your Controller which is an awesome way to control a drone. Make sure to bind a button to enable Acro mode which is super fun!\n\nThe only downsides I can think of is the weird max height (60m or so?) which you cannot turn off or raise, and super small map boundaries - not actual map boundaries, but artificial ones, so even if it looks like you have a huge map, you can only fly in 10% of it or so. This makes no sense and hopefully will be fixed. Of course, there need to be some boundaries, but they can be natural, like some super high mountains or something, or just make at least 80% of the map accessible, instead of what seems to be 10%.\n\nAlso, a great feature would be wind simulation - it would be nice to get some practice flying against the wind.","January 9","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are race tracks set up that you can blast through in Self level or Acro mode (toggled by pressing the A key).  There isnt much choice in the way of Quads to choose from, but in FPV mode it makes almost no difference what frame you use.  The motor, prop, battery selection in the workbench is very good. Lobster motors, quiet clever.\n\nI love God mode, changing props, batteries etc is for Actual reality, dispencing that chore triples your play time.\n\nThe physics are right on the money for my experience.  I have always used self level mode (comming from a Photography/Phantom background)  and I would almost never used full throttle but spending 10 hours on this in Acro mode and full throttle upto 60% of the time..... and I dont think I will go back to self level on mini quads, except maybe in the carpark level, thats pretty enclosed for me at the moment.\n\nI have my graphics set to HD and on Good (on a laptop). It is smooth enough to weave around on the forest level at speed, the depth of field is sufficent to pick a good line through the trees.\n\nLift off is handly learning tool or something to help you get a flying fix on a rainy weekend.\n\nI found it was alittle trick to set up my controller but there is a tonne of videos on how to get it going, so a bit of paitence goes along way.\n\nYou can use you own music where you kind of load it into Steam. It wasnt as easy as it could be but I did get a couple of tracks working so I could get in my "Zone".\n\nIs it worth the money, well yes.  They have made a couple of updates which included an extra track, which is something you would have to pay extra for on a small mobile device. I have read they are activley working on multi player which would be pretty fun.  And it means you can fly with a bunch of friends with out all of you having to by expensive Base stations and those low wattage VTx's.\n\nWhat I would like to see is Eagle mode.  Where you have to pitch your flying skills against Natures finest...\nBut then maybe the Dutch police would ban that.\n","June 5","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/410340/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI’ve long been fascinated with flying. It’s been a passion ever since I was a child. One of my dreams was to be a pilot. Had it not been for my poor eye sight I’m certain that I would have had the drive and the ambition to have been a proud member of the Royal Australian Air Force. My father served in the army and I’ve always had a deep honor and appreciation of every member of our military regardless of what branch they have served. Unfortunately, it wasn’t to be and so I’ve had to find a way to enjoy my passion through other means. As the technology has improved drone flying has become an increasingly popular hobby. Of course the barrier to entry at a higher level is prohibitive to many because of the costs involved. This is where LuGus Studios have stepped in and made it accessible to anyone with a modern-ish PC that can run their game, Liftoff.\n\nIt did not take long at all for me to gain an appreciation that the LuGus is not only deeply passionate about their game but of the actual flying of drones. They are a Belgium-based company that prior to Liftoff had only ever released one other title onto Steam though they have made other titles for mobile devices. They released the positively received but criminally underplayed Runes of Brennos a title completely unrelated to the drone flying sim.\n\nThe developers have worked hand in hand with some of the most experienced professionals in the world of drone racing in order to deliver the most realistic experience possible to market. Making such a realistic simulation is a long and drawn out process and one in which they have yet to complete. This, I am assured, is what LuGus deems to be the most important aspect of their early access developmental cycle. The team continues to work on this arduous process in order to perfect it. The team wants to perfect the simulation aspect of the game before moving onto the implementation of other game play features. However, what is already featured within the game is sufficient to provide the player with an appreciation of just how dedicated the studio is to delivering a premium experience.\n\nSomething that I’ve found very impressive has been just how open with their community the development team have been. I have had contact with several people who have played the game and who are unrelated to the studio beyond playing the game. Each has had the same story when offering their thoughts on the game. The studio has taken on board their critique and constructive criticism and made an immediate – or very close to it – effort to improve the area of weakness discovered by the player. At no point has the studio been rude or abrasive. This will ultimately make the game more accessible and increase the potential player base. I have no doubt that while this will appeal most to drone experts that this will be a title that everyone will be able to take something away from.\n\nMost impressive is the fact that the developers have put some of their focus into the various VR set ups that are being released later in the year. Furthermore, they’ve also implemented a system that will enable drone controllers to be utilized within the game. I can only imagine what the possibilities will be for the title when these systems are fully realized. The game is also fully playable with your standard controller. Due to the nature of the game you must have a controller at the very least. However, I am definitely considering the investment in a drone controller. It would definitely seem to be the best way to play the game.\n\nSteamified looks forward to returning to Liftoff as advances throughout its development cycle.\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 27","true","8.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

As of right now it is a fun distration and something to get me through the winter.\n\nPro\n- The ability to build custom quads with different lipos, props, motors, etc.\n- physics - feels almost real\n- graphics\n- fpv noise\n- fly the Vortex Pro\n\nContra\n- workbench is still very limited with the best lipo being a nanotech 45c and the best prop being a 5045 Gemfan carbon fibre. I fly HQ triblades or HQ 6045 paired with 70c Thunderpower lipos, so there's a huge difference in power\n- the physics of a damaged prop do not feel real at all. In reality a slightly damaged prop will be compensated by the flightcontroler and not make your quad almost impossible to control\n- needs more models than just Vortex and Vortex Pro with different electronics","November 23, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They’ve done such a good job on this game. The tutorial sucked though, it’s a really bad way to start someone off who’s never handled a drone before. It’s difficult for someone who hasn’t had any experience. The tutorial level is really confusing and hard to tell where stuff is because the whole of the map is the same colour with no definition or shadows. I was playing the tutorial for ages not getting anywhere with my skill. But then I played the actual maps. The forest is the best map because it’s fun and easy! After playing on the forest map for a short time I really got the hang of the controls and synched all the other maps including the carpark witch is apparently the hardest. The graphics are stunning when camera sound is off, terrific use of shadows. Overall the game takes a bit to get use to but if you keep persisting by playing the tutorial for an hour or two then move onto the forest map you’ll be pro in no time! And this simulater is actualy helping me upskill with my IRL fpv drone.","November 27, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I preety much learnt and gaining confidence flying Acro. Floatines, not always breaking props are not an arguments really when it come to learning how to fly. It just feel like very light and powerfull quadcopter. You will learn correct reactions and stick movements without thinking about it and that's the most important! FreeRider for comparision - feels like driving a bus - slow and heavy. There are already examples of people learning to fly in LiftOff and taking skills outside and flying real racing quadcopters succcesfuly!\n\n\n\nAfter some time spend adjusting values in Player.xml file I have achieved behaviour which is very close to TheX I have build. It may not be a Vortex but it's fast, agile and on rails!\nFor some still will be floaty but that more less like my copter is with HQ6045 cos is light and powerful. Mass can be changed a bit more but it will affect speed, lift and drift - more mass more drift. Rates are more personal settings so go ahead and adjust them to your liking.\nTry it and let me know if you like it.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3qFMjmh8KjgZ3E1elc5ejZnUGc/view","January 22","true","39.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onyxstone/recommended/410340/","onyxstone","ON-X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onyxstone/","168 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is me:\nI've never flown a quad copter or any airborn RC vehicle in my life but recently took a strong interest in FPV quads. So after a bit of research I discovered this simulator and bought it to help me get used to the controls while I begin buying/putting-together my first quad.\n\nAs of 03/05/16:\n(using Xbox 360 controller)\n\nSummary:\nI'm really enjoying this early-access simulator. It seems to be very well put together and is a realistic (within reason) FPV simulator.\n\nThe physics seem to be near spot-on compared to footage I've seen of FPV'ers, though I have to agree with some of the reviewers here, they do seem slightly floaty. The collision and prop damage models are good, but I found myself wishing for a less forgiving collision model when it came to tree branches. Perhaps there might be a 'difficulty setting' regarding the damage model in future?\n\nThe visuals are fantastic for a performance-oriented simulator. The models are well-made, and the film grain and distortion prove to be highly immersive and make me feel like I'm actually controlling (and crashing) the quad.\n\nSound design is passable, as is par in most realistic simulators in my experience. It would be nice to hear some improvements here but definitely not neccessary.\n\nThe UI is well laid out, though not free of small issues. I suspect they will be remedied swiftly and easily.\n\nConclusion:\nI'm looking forward to multiplayer and any of the other features/improvements to come. I definitely plan on continuing to practice using this simulator for many days to come. Also, I'll update this review once I have a transmitter and have flown an actual quad so as to compare the physics.","March 5","true","92.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It completly blew all my expectations out of the water. I was a noob, never flown a quad fpv style. The only experience I even had flying was a small blade nano qx flying line of sight.

By then i had enough confidence so I went out and bought the real deal a Vortex 250 pro and some Headplay Hd goggles. Maiden flight went off perfect, I was so impressed by how much the simulator actually feels like the real thing. All i have to say is THANK YOU LIFTOFF!!!!.  This Sim is worth every penny spent.

I've put in almost 50 hours in this game and I can for sure notice an improvement in my real flying skills. It's really helpful to learn a new trick on Liftoff then try it out for real. It'll save you a lot of money and headaches. the track building feature is my favorite part about the game, because I can recreate tracks for upcoming races that I am attended to get an upper hand against the competition.","February 25","true","52.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The copter reacts like real copter. The simulation is very realistic.\n- You can use it for learning and training\n- You can change the setup of the copters in many ways, PID, Props etc. and you can do an expo setup for you controler to make a setup which works like your real world setup.\n\nSome things which a really bad (in the pre-alpha!)\n\nIf you set you screen to a low resolution the fonts and the dialogs doesn't scale. So everything is unreadable. This is very bad, cause you can't make any changes. For realistic training, I use a small 8" HDMI monitor with a resolution of 720p or lower. This gives a realistic flight situation. But then, it is impossible to do any changes. I always must switch back to my office monitor change the resolution to the changes and then change everything back. This need some fixing.\n\nThere is a beginners training mode, but the colors are so terrible. Light blue walls and white bottom. This is so crazy. There is no contrast in the colors. I never used this, cause it is nothing for beginners :-)\n\nI think this a alpha problems which can be fixed.\n\nFacit: If it goes to the final stage this app will be the the best training app you can get for race training. Please make a final version soon as possible (before the next winter :-)\n\nGreetings\n\nBTW: I read some reviews of people who have no understanding who the acro mode works. This is a simulation game with real pyhsiks. Yes, it is hard to learn at the beginning, also in the real world. Most people with racers started at the beginning with permanent crash session. Thats a part of race copter flying :-)","January 23","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Darksouls is a cakewalk by comparison. This is impossibly hard for quite a long time and the tutorial doesn’t help. This game is clearly made by drone pilots, for drone pilots.\n\nThe games starts with the controls screen and you have to input what you want to use for what straight away. Not the most intuitive menus either. It then throws you into the main menu. Not as bad as the controls menu, makes sense. I thought the game might be hard so I started with the tutorial.\n\nSweet lord christ. Stupid tutorial. One of the worst I’ve ever played. Doesn’t tell you how to do anything, just what it wants you to achieve. Completely pointless.\n\nAfter that, I tried to fight for what felt like most of my life before I could get the drone to kinda go in the direction I wanted it to go. I thought this would probably be good enough for the first race as it would probably be really easy. I was very wrong. The first race is astonishingly hard. And you have to do 3 laps without crashing. When I finally finished the course three times in a row (After enabling god mode in the gameplay options.) I was met with my three times and a total time. That’s all. I have no idea how well I did in that race. Probably really badly but that’s not the point. I then attempted an underground parking lot level that was ridiculous, quite honestly.\n\nRegardless of all this, I’m going to recommend it because me sucking at the game does not mean it’s a bad game. However, this could be 100000000x better if the respawn times were WAY faster. Super-meat-boy fast. Really really fast.\n\nSo, overall, the music got on my ♥♥♥♥, the controls got on my ♥♥♥♥, the insane difficulty got on my ♥♥♥♥ but it’s still a good game already. That’s really saying something in today’s early access market where you pay the price of a full game to watch a peep show through a layer of ♥♥♥♥ just to see what the game might be like if the developers didn’t suck. These developers don’t suck, just so you know.","April 11","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
