I used to have this years ago on my PS2, but I don't play that anymore. I finally decided to get it for my computer, and it's just like I remember: plenty of crashing and destruction!\n\nIt's better than FlatOut 1 in the fact that there are better/more cars to choose from, and the same with tracks, but not with free roam. In the first FlatOut, you were able to go backwards on tracks and drive around the area. You sadly cannot on this game, but the racing is still fun nonetheless.\n\nAs for the demolition derbies, they are also plenty of fun. It's nice when a game isn't too easy, so I do like the fact that there is a contact timer of about 44 seconds, meaning you have to smash into someone at some point. The AI is also certainly smarter than the first FlatOut, thus adding to the difficulty of derbies and races. It only has 3 more derby arenas than the first one, for a total of 6, so there certainly could have been a few more arenas.\n\nLastly, you can't forget the minigames! There are oddities such as Royal Flush, Baseball, Bowling, and a few others where you have to fling yourself out of the car. These are pretty entertaining, especially with friends. It can get slightly monotonous by yourself though.\n\nAll in all, this is still lots of fun for a game made in 2006!","November 30, 2013","true","9.4"," 123 of 137 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","123","137","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fherrera/recommended/2990/","fherrera","Fherrera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fherrera/","153 products in account","This game is sequel for original FlatOut, and this game is one god damn good example how to make sequel.\nFlatOut was awesome or should i say "perfect" arcade racing game. Though, its from 2004 and still, its kickass game with good driving response system, good and challenging AI, awesome tracks, derby bowls and stunt tracks.\nFlatOut 2 have all these same things, but it is made thousand times better!\nThere is three car classes: Derby class, race class and street class.\n\nDerby cars are cheap and durable and meant for the first class of FlatOut racing. They can take a beating and deliver a powerful punch, but arent as fast as the rest of cars.\n\nRace cars are powerful and they are from competitive price range offer the 'best bang for buck' in the though in second class.\n\nStreet cars are tuned up for the most competitive tier of FlatOut racing. Fastest of their kind, but a little less durable.\n\nIn total there is 34 cars in game.\n\nGame race tracks are great. you can choose from many different enviroments to race and they are: Forest, Field, Desert, Canal, City and Race. In total there is 30 race tracks in game. There is also 9 special track events in game.\n\nStunt tracks are also fun to play. There is 12 different stunts to do and they are: High Jump, Bowling, Ski Jump, Curling, Stone-Skipping, Ring Of Fire, Field Goal, Royal Flush, Basketball, Darts, Baseball and Soccer.\n\nDerby bowls is one of the best things in this game. Its all about earning wrecking points by dealing damage, destroying cars and ultimately surviving the challenge.\n\nThe ragdoll physics in the sequel have been greatly updated. During the race, the driver may be thrown out of the car if slammed into a wall at a high speed.\n\nAI in this game is fine. You compete with seven bots in race at same time. They are challenging and fun, but they can be sometimes really cocky.\n\nSoundtrack is awesome in this game, it contains rock and metal music from Nickelback, Megadeath, Papa Roach, Mötley crue and many more...\n\nI dont know any bad sides on this game. Well, if you choose male character it looks like Paul Walker and it makes me sad sometimes to see it. But i dont think its bad thing, its just opinion.\n\nIm forcing you to buy this game because its so awesome and its definitely worth of few bucks. Love this legendary game!\n\nSorry for my bad english!\n\n10/10","February 20, 2014","true","28.1"," 77 of 88 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","77","88","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/princess_gay/recommended/2990/","princess_gay","Princess Gay X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/princess_gay/","287 products in account","FlatOut 2 came out just 2 years after its predecessor and was released in June 2006. That would make it around the time when I actually first played the game with my friends. Man, the game was good. Recently I have decided to try it out again, and to my surprise the game still rocks!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351920548\nFlatOut 2 is by far the best racing game of it's kind that I have played. Long time has passed since the release, but everything about the game still seems really good from graphics to gameplay. Unfortunately there's no online but LAN via other software is possible. Do not fret though, single player is extremely fun. The AI is scripted very well. By the end of 2-3 cups you will understand how every individual AI drives. They don't always want to win now, some of them want to crash others players cars. It does not mean that it will always be you though. So expect some random stuff happen to you during the game. Never under estimate the opponent.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351388646\nThe  soundtrack just blew my mind. I do like the type of music that this game has, but to think that I know almost all of the songs in the game just makes it so much better. This game has lots of big names  like Rob Zombie, Wolfmother and .... Nickleback. But what's more important is that the car engine sound like a boss, the noise is so sexy, sometimes I just lower the music volume.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351883258\nIt been almost 9 years now, but the graphics will not hurt your eye, in fact this game probably eclipsed a ton of racing games which came out around the same time. Car details are very good, both brand new and half destroyed. The maps look just awesome, textures still look good to this day. Human ragdolls are a bit on the downside again, but you do not tend to fly out as often anymore. Overall, I am extremely happy about the graphics and how they are still so good even eight years after.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351276072\nWhat else is important about the racing game for PC players, a game that was also realsead on consoles? The answer is controls. Finally, I played a game, where you can easily steer just by using your arrows on the keyboard. Game is very playable without a joystick. It also feels that the developers made it easier to control cars in the first place.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351276142\nBy now your thinking that there must be something bad about the game. Well, I am going to tell you that there are non big things that will off put you. There are minor things about interacting with physical objects, but that's about it guys, this game is almost perfect!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351137260\nReplayabilty is massive, once you discover the LAN.\nTo conclude, this game deserves the price. If there's no sale then just buy it. You will not regret it. The game is so good, you will end up driving at least for the next 5 hours before taking a break.","December 9, 2014","true","16.1"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","51","54","0","2"

This game is from the childhood. Oh yes. The first second I booted up the menu the music memories just all came back instant. Like if they always were there somewhere. FlatOut 2 might aswell be one of the first video games I've played on the PC. I don't even remember the year when I played it. Around 2007-2010 maybe? But mah lawd is it a good game for me. Maybe a couple years/12 months ago played the Ultimate Carnage with my friend. Too bad the multiplayer ain't working no more. Would've loved that.\n\nThe only downside I get from FO2 is the textures. Usually the textures don't really bother me but in FO2 the textures seem to blur the road so it's hard to see where you drive. Or it might just be the resolution, I dunno.\n\nOverall.

I can't recommend it enough!\n\nI was dying for a new racing game to play and happened to have a few bucks in my Steam wallet from selling cards and on a whim bought it for a mere $2.49! Which was an out right steal for this game. If I had known how fun this was I would of gotten it sooner, its regular $10 asking price is still a steal for this!\n\nFun:\n• Slamming into people feels nice, heavy and like you're really doing some damage to'em.\n• It has variety in spades. Be it flinging your driver across water, through burning hoops or for playing poker. Demolition derbies, short simple circuit tracks and the varied longer race courses, theres a lot here.\n• The sound design is astoundingly good. It has probably the best tire squeals I've ever heard in a racing game. Most games have 1 long squeal which sounds more like the car is doing a burn out than struggling to maintain grip. In this it has a nice stutter to it, like it really is struggling and about to give. You can hear rocks knocking around your wheel well and under your car on the dirt tracks, something I notice games overlook a bit.\n• The cars are a great. With a heavy focus on muscle cars for the most part, which is great cause I lost my taste for racing games when they suddenly became mostly about nasty little rice burners (looking at you Need for Speed.). Only about 1~2 cars handled bit squirrely- *coughSpeedevilcough* -and the real only customization to the cars is being able to pick a color.\n• The AI actually will crash and wreck without you around, and the follow the same rules you are ei. getting hung up on random track debris and not taking turns perfectly all the time! They maintain a nice difficulty without ever truly being fustrating. Though I'm sure Sofia Martinez will be on your list of people you want dead.\n• It. has. Cheat codes.\n\nMeh:\n• The soundtrack is just well.. meh. At no point will there ever not be a guitar or drum playing. It tends to get a little grating to listen to near constant noise. Overall its not the worst soundtrack I've ever heard but its nothing I'd listen to outside of the game.\n\nFlaws:\n• Only real flaw I can think of is that the menus would not work with my controller.\n• Also you really don't get anything for 100%ing it. Quite the shame, least its a fun 100% to get.\n\nOnly thing I wish it had was weather and the abilitly to mirror and reverse the tracks.\n\nIn the end you should just get it.

There are so many fantastic features of FlatOut 2 that make it so exciting and enjoyable to play.\nIn the game, you can race in the forest, desert, city, and more. You can start a derby in various locations where you try to wreck other cars and become the last driver standing. Lastly, there are 12 different mini games where you launch your driver through the car windshield and try to score (with the human) in a soccer net, basketball hoop, dart board, and 9 more different targets. These three game modes are also in the career.\nThe destruction feature is great too. It brings less frustration to the game because when you hit a pole, you can break it and drive through, instead of putting the car in reverse, changing direction and then accelerating forward to your destination.\n\nThe only downfall that I have found in this game does not even involve the gameplay, it is the music. The soundtrack is too small so the songs are played repeatively. This is something that happens in most games though.\n\nHUMAN DARTS!!","February 6, 2015","true","7.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","20","23","6","0"

You can race, derby, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, blow yourself up, and the world's favorite: stunts!\nOn the subject with racing, you can aggresively race, smashing people from their windshields, and smush them under your tire, or you can just drive on by.\nIf you don't want to race, then try some derbies! NOT what you expect when I say derby. You have 45 seconds to ram into someone, otherwise you are "timed out," and disqualified. Derbies have no rules, other than: 1. Don't die, and 2. Make sure your clock doesn't hit zero.\nAh, stunts. Glorious stunts. You can participate in High Jump, Ring of Fire, Royal Flush, Stone (People) Skipping, and so on. Each one of them has a different physic. But, in general, Pick up speed, drive foward, vault from your windshield, and reach whatever you need to.\nMaybe you want all three of these in a glorious interval. Try Career mode, which has you start from a ♥♥♥♥-hole, and gain money, to get more cars, upgrade said cars, and win even more money.\nDid I mention cheats? No? It would be a spoiler, so GET YER OWN DAMN CHEATS!\nOn a seperate note, their is only one thing wrong: Online mode has been discontinued. [Insert millions of boos and sad faces here] But, overall, I think that this game deserves an 11/10.

Races with modern cars were a little bit more fun for me. Game soundtrack was amazing and well-matched to gameplay.\n\nNow, i bought it after those years and i want to play it again. I have to wait a little bit more since my dormitory internet has 4 GBs of download limit (ridiculous, isn't it?).\n\nedit: After 6 hours of gameplay, i can say it's worse than first Flatout. Physics a little bit crazy, some cars are unplayable because of that, even if you upgrade and try to drive them carefully, that's no use.\n\nAfter a while tracks become repetitive.

Driver characters in every race also makes it more personal - if someone pushes you out of track or something, you can hunt him down afterwards, because every driver is different.

Game gives you variety of tracks in different environments such as deserts, forests, suburbs etc., and and big variety of cars witch performance you can upgrade, however sometime it feels pointless, because opponents with same cars as your's still are driving a bit faster. Also sometimes feels that enemy's have mystical speed boosts and you'll have hard time loosing or catching them.\nGame gets a bit repetitive after time, but it refreshes it-self with funny events which often aren't really about driving. Game also has some well simulated physics for the time, however sometimes you have the feeling, that it works against you.\nOne of the notable things in game is music. Game features bands like Audioslave, Fall out boy, Nickleback, Yellowcard, Wolfmother etc. These styles of music fits very well and I can't imagine electronic or hip-hop music in it.\n\nSo at the end, game is ok, but sometimes frustrates you and isn't forgivable for beginners. You'll have a lot of fun with it, but there will be moments where you will wan't to punch the screen. I gave it 7.1.\n\nThanks for reading.\n","March 14, 2014","true","16.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The graphic can play basically nothing much to criticize, perhaps only occasional overlapping parts of the car (if you have a car with platform, here there passes a piece of the floor of the chassis, through the wings from time to time you see a piece of the wheel). The roaring sounds about as well as they should, hitting a metal pipe sounds metallic, into a tree and woody in all thunders powerful engines, which does not sound like the neighbor Fichtl. The musical accompaniment is composed of more than twenty stock from authors such as Papa Roach, Nickelback, Megadeth and Rob Zombie, and it certainly is not the item you off in the menu first. HW requirements are within the limits of endurance, which you can read in the table under review.

Even though some of you might want to prefer power-ups as in Mashed or Blur, the amount of destruction in this game compensates for it sufficiently. If you want to play singleplayer, I think you won't be bored either, the opponents are quite clever and nasty.

I have played this game long before I even joined Steam and all I can say is that FlatOut 2 is one of the best derby games out there.\nPros:\n- Great Soundtrack: In my opinion, the majority of the soundtrack is epic that'll put you right in the racing mood.\n- Replay Value: No joke, this game has so much variety it'll take a long long time before you'll get bored. From races to derby matches to even stunts, it seems endless. For example, you may have a Single Player race in the forest lands. Well there are 3 maps of forest or so to chose from. This applies to everything in Single Races, like racing in the city or racing on a track.\n- It's Hilarious: If you crash your car at a certain angle your driver ejects out as a ragdoll. It's just hilarious. The stunts involve ragdolls as well, which makes the stunt aspect challenging as you can move your ragdoll in the air- or give it a little 'nudge' to go farther or higher.\n- Handling: The steering isn't too hard. Playing with the keyboard isn't too difficult to manage. if you get used to it, you can go off with a victory without using a gamepad.\n- "Realistic": In moderation, of course. You can lose a wheel and driving the car becomes more challenging. If you use a 'street' car in the forest the handling won't be so easy. Pieces fly off your car, doors fall off, windows break, muffles unhinge, it's a joy ride if you love crashes!\nCons:\n- Since the world on the race track is practically destroyable in every way some things can cost you a first place finish. For example, if a fence falls apart and finds its way on the road it can interact with your car differently than say.. some tires! The fence can slow you down as your car hits it compared to the tires just bouncing off. Some ramps are sudden and it can toss you all over into the car or into a wall. But it's all for the fun of it really, crashing is a part of the whole game.\n- Some Racers have an advantage over you: this is quite an interesting thing in the game. If you were to go into a derby with clunky cars, Frank Malcov will be, most likely, the last one standing because of the heavy car he uses. However, in a race, he won't come near first because of the disadvantage of having a big heavy car. Each car is different and so is every driver. This isn't so much of a con but something to be aware of!\n\nThis game is the best for games that involve crashing. It's fun to crash into others, it's fun to demolish everything because everything is practically demolish-able! For the price, it's something I would get for sure.","December 26, 2014","true","35.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It had a fun variety of game modes; although some of the mini games can be very frustrating.  The racing itself is a lot of fun though, giving the player a choice, generally, between speed and handling.  There are also a variety of tracks in different locations.  The road surface affects the handling of the car.\n\nThe soundtrack is noteworthy, and fits the theme of the game perfectly.\n\nIf you're looking for a racing sim however, this is not the game for you.  The mechanics are solid, but not realistic.\n\nMy only real negative was that you couldn't edit the play list, nor skip or chose your favourite song while playing.  Only a small bug-bear, but still.\n\nGame ran absolutely flawlessly on my phenom II x4 955 & 550GTX ti.","January 23, 2014","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You will rage mostly. (Like I did), cause sometimes just flew up and crash somewhere,\n\n• More cars to look for. Now you need look at handling and other things, so it fits your racing style.\n\n• Game includes game modes like Race, Derby, Events and Stunts\n\n• Career is just all-in-one. You win one race event (3-6 races), you get stunt or event (like Figure 8, Superbowl in previous game)\n\n• Derby is one of the reasons, why the game is so good. Derby is the best thing in this game. Only thing there's no much of them\n\n• Events are fine. There's bit more of them. Drive in Figure 8, Superbowl, Triloop and others.\n\n• Stunts disappointed me this time. Stunts are cool, but almost impossible to get highest score.\n\n◇ Music is one of best parts of the game. Absolutely nice selection of the music. Even I'm not big fan of the rock music, I really liked how it gave nice atmosphere to game.\n\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nAs a big fan of FlatOut series, Bugbear (developers of first and second FlatOut) still nailed the second installment of FlatOut.\n\n\n\n","May 22, 2015","true","19.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bassemb/recommended/2990/","bassemb","Bassem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bassemb/","1378 products in account","My first instinct is to put a NO on recommending this game. That's because it's so often infuriating.\n\nThe racing here is all about physics and destruction. You can crash into the scenery and your fellow racers, resulting in detailed and wild destruction.\n\nThis is what makes the game both fun and frustrating. More often than not, finishing in first place is a matter of blind luck, thanks to all the scattered debris all over the tracks. I mean ALL over everywhere. The slightest bump will send you careening off into the side of the track. Same if you get bumped by a fellow racer.\n\nThat's basically my only gripe with the game. Otherwise it's tons of fun. The damage model on the cars and environment is pretty great (I know, I was just complaining about them!) The career mode is nice and simple, varied, with a great selection of tracks and game modes and cars.\n\nEach car can also be upgraded in various ways. You could focus on speed and just go for the finish. You could focus on strength and make your car a high powered ram rod, disabling the competition.\n\nThere's also the stunt levels where the already-filmsy realism is flung out through the windshield, just like your driver will be, flying into bowling pins or a velcro wall for points. Very silly, very difficult (at least for me), very fun.\n\nI haven't played other FlatOut games. People say this one is the best of the series. Check out the spiritual sequel, "Wreckfest / Next Car Game", here on Steam.","April 9, 2015","true","16.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The named opponents and different driving styles also add some personality to the career mode.\n\n---\n\nHowever on the whole this game left me more frustrated than entralled, so now I'll get to the bad news:\n\nThe handling in this game is just bad, to the point that it feels like you're driving a hovercraft rather than a car, and a single shunt or slight oversteer can sent you off the track into a wall. This is also counter-intuitive to the design of the game since you're encouraged to drive aggressive and crash into things, but when the margin for error is so high it's usually safer to avoid taking jumps or smashing into traffic lights.\n\nThe single-player mode relies on the catch-up effect to prevent a single spinout from taking you out of the race, but in the (now-defunct) online multiplayer this is nonexistent - meaning a single oversteer or ram from an opponent in the first minute of the race can take you out, which is frustrating rather than fun in an acade racer.\n\nAside from that, the game's musical score feels out of place for a destruction-oriented racing game, consisting mainly of pop punk, emo, and alternative rock tracks - it seems to have taken a cue from the Burnout series here. The graphics are also a little too bright and cheerful for my taste.\n\nThe final notable flaw is the unbalanced cars. The game is divided into 3 classes of cars, and each class has 1 or 2 high-end cars which are far-and-away superior in every respect to the others in their class. In multiplayer this means that nearly everyone will just end up driving the same car in every race, while the others just go unused.\n\nWhile this isn't a terrible game, on the whole I consider it overhyped and overrated; though the single-player mode may offer a casual racing diversion to some.\n\n","October 3, 2015","false","99.4"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","6","23","0","1"

I naturally tested 1,2 and UC in a week term and I must admit - this particular game is boring. To begin with, it's built on the same engine from the original flatout with addional post-effects thrown on top of it. And those are not good post effects, but some cheap brownish-orange overblurred sepia, like in GRID. They took the first game, increased the speed and added explosions, basically, they made a BurnOut out of the good game. Honestly, I tried. I finished the first tier for all golds, and on the second tier I realized it's overly boring. The original FlatOut was way more catchy and it was unique at the time. FO2 is on the other hand just a copycat of other popular arcade race games.","December 22, 2015","false","7.3"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","0"

Missing as well, is unlocking the entire tier of cars in one go, rather having to unlock individual cars as you compete, entirely precluding you from being able to save up for the car you want, and carry it through the tier with you, as with the previous game. Vehicle upgrades are also severely limited when compared to the first game as well, with only one tier for each upgrade, and many upgrades from the previous game being entirely absent. All the vehicles more or less handle the same, despite this game having differences between FWD, 4WD, and RWD cars, with weight and strength not coming into play at all with the exception of during derby events.\nLevel design makes no logical sense, with entire structures appearing and disappearing with track layouts that are supposed to be in the same location. All the tracks feel as though they were designed as race tracks first, and the copy and pasted into the game's various locals, rather than designed from the ground up to suit that location. As a result, all of the tracks feel more or less the same, with different scenery adorning each one, rather than different and unique challenging locations.\nGone as well is the previous game's unique soundtrack, replaced with generic pop and rock music. While I have nothing against the songs themselves, they take away from the "country and backwoods" feel of a derby-style racing game, and replace it with something that feels like it belongs in Need For Speed: Underground.\n\nAll and all, I cannot recommend this game. It is held aloft almost entirely on the success of its predecessor, but with about half the production budget. I recommend buying the first game, and forgetting this travesty ever existed.","May 16, 2015","false","2.8"," 0 of 13 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","13","0","0"

I don't care to be honest - I'll find a more up to date driving game with out of the box controller support that just works.\n\nYes, I know that this game predates the Xbox 360 controller and that you can configure your 360 controller to act like it would for any other driving game - but having to use the keyboard to get from one menu to the next when you're used to simply pushing a botton on a controller gets really old, really quickly.\n\nThumbs down from me.","September 26, 2014","false","1.6"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","18","0","0"

Bugbear certainly published a winner with this one.  I don't normally write reviews for games but in this case I simply had to.  Also, I normally don't go for arcadey types of racing games but this is so much fun that I had to purchase it and I am not a bit sorry that I did.  I've only got 6 hours into it and I'm still at the demolition portion of the game (can't afford the big boys yet!) and I know that I have hours left in order to finish it but am determined to do so.  I'm 65 so I hope I last that long.  Now, I'm sure that the purists would point out many flaws in the physics, and I'm sure that the grafics aren't the prettiest but damn, I don't care this is FUN!  I have all the other pure sims (Asseto Corsa, Grid2, Grid AutoSport and so forth, but for pure, fun family games to me, this takes the cake. Thanx BugBear for producing it and Steam for offering it.

A lot.\nWill run on anything circa 2005, integrated or not (They made it run on PS2, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it), still looks decent.\nIf youre buying into this series, i`d suggest Flatout Ultimate Carnage first, because of added AI players, reworked graphics and extra content (which comes at an increased price of not running on anything circa 2005), but this works too. Original multiplayer is dead (GameSpy), but if you do your homework on Google you should find some solutions.\nUltimately, this is worth the asking price and basically a steal if discounted.\n\nGr8 Game R8 8/8 M8","November 30, 2014","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bugbear certainly published a winner with this one.  I don't normally write reviews for games but in this case I simply had to.  Also, I normally don't go for arcadey types of racing games but this is so much fun that I had to purchase it and I am not a bit sorry that I did.  I've only got 6 hours into it and I'm still at the demolition portion of the game (can't afford the big boys yet!) and I know that I have hours left in order to finish it but am determined to do so.  I'm 65 so I hope I last that long.  Now, I'm sure that the purists would point out many flaws in the physics, and I'm sure that the grafics aren't the prettiest but damn, I don't care this is FUN!  I have all the other pure sims (Asseto Corsa, Grid2, Grid AutoSport and so forth, but for pure, fun family games to me, this takes the cake. Thanx BugBear for producing it and Steam for offering it.  Buy it and rev it up!   Thanx.  The Managment.

Burnout is all about crashing at speed, whilst Flatout 2 is much about racing with anyway possible. Whether it's smashing the opposition into trees or smashing through shops to gain nitro, every race is different, fun and action packed.\n\nIf you enjoy burnout and/or Flatout, then this is perfect. Although Flatout based around 70's American muscle derby racing, Flatout 2 expands into tuner and exotic classes and even a school bus (best vehicle in the game). This gives it more variety and a more satisfying time. Of course, being a Flatout game, the bonus games are as silly and unique as before. Only this time the stunt cars have the minor addition of jet engines. There is also a character system, which tells you who is ahead and who you just T-boned off into a river. This can cause serious grudge matches and is useful for long championships.\n\nOverall, this game is simply an expansion of Flatout, with twice the destruction, twice the action, and of course, twice the fun.","May 4, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a singleplayer game it's definitely fun enough, with pretty solid gameplay and very satisfying physicsy environmental destruction mayhem, to say nothing of the absolute lunacy of the stadium events... but now take all of that and add in online multiplayer with your friends and you have one of the most balls-to-the-wall incredibly hilarious hyperkinetic vehicular carnage events you could hope for.

It is racing game which handles a good balance between simulation and arcade and players who prefer either of the genres still will admit that it is an excellent fit.\n\nThe game is playable on multiplayer and has several different types of single player modes. The most important is naturally the career mode. It contains thoughout its progress all other modes in a well mixed compilation.\nOne cannot choose a difficulty, however the game has a very fair difficulty development which never gets unfair, but is mostly challenging. There are three types of car classes. Each has its own event plan and you have to beat all the events of one class to unlock the next one. The cars of every new class are harder to handle since they are getting faster and faster. Within the classes there is a development of the difficulty too because in each class you unlock better cars which raise the difficulty for the above stated reason.\nYou can choose between four car types. There is the light small one with a good acceleration. The big and heavy one favourable for crashing. The normal inbetween which is balanced. The fast type which you usually unlock in each class after a few races. Specially the first three types have have different types of gameplay according to their strengths and weaknesses wherefore you have a different gaming experience in each of them. Each car can be also performance tuned with various parts which you can buy (visually the cars don't change).\n\nThe career consists of trophies which consist of normal races. But there are also (Destruction) Derbies where your main challenge is to survive as long as possible while crashing other cars and gaining points to win the competition. Moreover the career has every now and then fun events which gameplay bases on launching your driver through the front window in different games which are generally based on different real world sports.\nYou have seven opponents throughout the game which have their own names and portraits and each of them has his own an unique style of driving and usage of car types. The opponents are getting better with further progress in the game as you do. It is also worth to mention that your competitors in the races don't react any different to bots than to you.\nThe tracks you drive on are very various and are always well mixed when compilated in trophies. There are no parts which repeat unnecessarily which is a reason why the gaming experience is till the very end so much fun.\n\nVery much in the game is about crashing other cars. You get star ratings for each crash which results in higher income. It is possible to wreck your opponents totally which upmost important in derbies. Also your nitro charges with crashing into opponents as well as into evironmental objects. Specially towards the ending of the game it gets a strategic character to gain nitro. The fun events are often really challenging and if you beat them you still have the urge to beat highscores.\nBut FlatOut 2 is still a racing game. If you don't want to crash you don't have to. This counts for the trophies. In derbies and fun events you obviously have a different main task.\n\nAnother point that has a huge impact on the gaming experience is the tracklist (music) that is played in the races. It fits perfectly and it emphasizes the characteristics of the game strongly.\n\nThe best way to play this game is with friends with in local network. You can create tournaments with all the different tracks and events you like and it has because of its competitiveness a similar multiplayer experience like Mario Kart.\n\nSince the game is not very expensive anymore and appears often on sales I warmly and highly recommend this game for everyone who is at least slightly interested in racing games.\n","January 8, 2014","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels amazing to slam into your opponent at high speeds and send them flying, and I dare say that it feels pretty damn good.\nOverall, stop reading the reviews and buy the damn game already!","May 18, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Me and my friends played this game on the PS2 endlessly, particularly the stunt mini-games, which are still hilarious. Now I bought this off Steam and I have no regrets. Because I'm not only reliving memories, but also that I can't find today's equivalent of this game (unless you consider Next Car Game: Wreckfest, also made by Bugbear). It's better than many racing games today. It's truly a one-of-a-kind. Not only is there racing, but there is demolition derby, where you wreck other racers, and stunt mini-games, where you eject the driver out of the car and use him/her depending on the game. For example, in bowling, HE/SHE has to hit the pins! The environment is also very destructible. My only gripe with this game is the difficulty; it's one of the hardest racing games I've played. I lose control of my car many times, but that's probably just me. And you start off with cars that look like crap. Seriously, the initial cars are built with junk parts; just so you know. And as you progress, you get great looking cars. It's $10 on Steam so you have no excuse to not get it.","May 22, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chicknduck/recommended/2990/","chicknduck","Chick'n'Duck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chicknduck/","624 products in account","While the first game was hard FlatOut 2 is beyond easy & hard. It is arbitrary, luck decides if you win or not and you as the player have little influence on that.\n\nThere are two main issues\n\nThe engine/the car behavior\nYou cannot predict how your car will react during a jump or hitting an obstacle. Sometimes it runs smoothly, sometimes you will lose your position or advantage. Therefore there is little space in getting better or master the game, because you don't get proper feedback which action benefits you and which one will be punished.\n\nYou will find at the bottom a video I've done about two stunts. The only thing I do is pressing throttle without pausing it, so there is no room for variation. I do this in both stunts. Two exact same actions from the player result in different outcomings.\n\nThe AI/your opponents\nSome of them are trolls, not interested in winning the race just ramming other cars and putting themselves at the tail end while giving you a hard time.\nThe other extreme are the flawless ones, usually using one of the higher level cars which you have to unlock first. Catching up with them happens rarely. They usually drive clean and boost forwards if you are getting close. Starting at the last position puts you in huge disadvantage against those.\n\nThe other thing is that the AI adapts to you. Are you driving faster or have you upgraded your car? They get better as well, so the difficulty seems to stay stable. At least to a certain point. Buying a new car with much better values makes the races easier, but not as much as I expected.\n\nSome small annoyances\n-The starting position varies, but most times I got the last place or something near that.\n-Later in the game you may have to repeat races a couple times to collect the amount of money to buy a car you've just unlocked. Winning all level 1 races doesn't guarantee you having enough money for a Level 2 car.\n-Strangely a Level 1 car isn't necessary good enough to compete in Level 1 races. I once had to grind for a better one and repeated the races.\n-NPCs get fixed cars from the start of a class and some of them get ones from a higher tier. It would be fairer if everyone would use a car from the same level.\n\nAll in all: Driving good doesn't get rewarded, you need a certain amount of luck. Both, losses and victories, felt cheap and latter one never satisfied me. I was just relieved to be over the current race.\n\nNow the most important point:\nDoes this all make the game unenjoyable? It depends.\nAre you looking for a serious racing game? Is anything but 1st place not an option to you? Then skip this one. It started pretty easy and was fun, but the further I got into the game the more the races turned into bitter and teeth-gnashing hours of retries which felt more like playing roulette and waiting untill the ball hits your number.\n\nIf you don't care about the mentioned issues, because just beating the game is enough for you or you just want to have a bit random wanky car physics fun, you might wanna try it. At least it won't hurt as long as you don't take it too seriously and bite your teeth into it.\n\nVideo:\nhttps://youtu.be/y9nAsEfCIX8","January 4","false","77.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have played the game many years ago on ps2 and you liked it back then, I would not hesitate to buy it. Now a quick pro/con.\nPros\nNostalgia waves\nGreat racing music\nDifferent game modes and race types (derby/race/street)\nStunt modes\nNot too difficult or easy\nReplayability. I put a ton of hours in on console, I hope to do the same.\nCustom single events.\nCareer\nUnlock/upgrade cars\nControls simple\nIf you aren't a good driver there are also demolition derbys\n\nCons\nTakes a few races to get used to the controls\nAI stunt scores feel impossible to beat sometimes\nNo online multiplayer player\nNo steam achievements or cards (if that matters)\nYou need to unlock events (its not too bad imo)\nToo hard to find cons\n\nSummary\nIf you're looking for a racing game, want to do a demolition derby, or even ragdoll your body into a high jump, this game is for you, its a parody for most racing games. Its pretty much a mix between old burnouts and need for speed but more fun as a party game.  Keep in mind this has no multiplayer online, but it has offline pass and play for stunts, which is fine.  The only reason I wouldn't buy it is if you want to play online multiplayer, other than that..... stop reading and buy the damn thing","March 30","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty much every day I would play through some of my favorite cups, racing the same maps over and over again, trying to get the biggest crashes, the nicest drifts and new track records. It's hard to say how many hours I wasted on it back then, but I'd wager at least 200.\n\nToday, I booted the game up on Steam for the first time, and I'm glad to report that it still holds up.\n\nFlatOut 2 is a game from an era when game developers still hadn't forgotten that games are supposed to be fun, and indeed, it still stands as one of the most fun and manical arcade racers you'll find anywhere.

Just buy it already.\n\nThere are 3 classes of vehicles: derby, race and street. The career mode has you starting out with the derby class, earning money by doing well in races. You buy a vehicle, upgrade the vehicle and you can buy more vehicles if you want to change cars depending on the track. There are no power-ups or other BS like that, which is a great thing IMO.\n\nIn my mind, this racing in this game is mostly about trying to screw over your opponents and avoiding danger. You may start to develop a bit of a rivalry with the AI. Nothing feels quite as satisfying as performing a PIT maneuver on JASON WALKER, THAT OVERPOWERED PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥. That said, it should be noted that the races are a bit easy to begin with and there's no real way to make it more difficult other than getting to the race/street classes.\n\nAs well as races there are special 'events' such as bowling, darts and football/soccer. These mostly just involve flinging your driver at high speeds into something. These are extremely entertaining, but good luck winning 1st place!\n\nFor the most part, the physics feel pretty solid. For some reason the handling feels weird with the chase cameras, so I would recommend using the 1st person or nose camera (if that's what they're called).\n\nI use a wired Xbox 360 controller to play this. Unfortunately you have to navigate the menus using the keyboard.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty darn good; I'd suggest looking it up. It's nice to have some old favourites to listen to, although it may start to get repetitive after a while.\n\nWhile there are some minor annoyances/issues, this is still my favourite arcade racer ever.","February 17","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Try to pick the game up on sale because this was the best $1.14 I've spent on a game. It's just realistic enough to get you immersed into the enviornment but still has that wonderful arcade like style! The hard body damage looks great and is pretty convincing and the car physics aren't too shabby either. The only bad this I could say about the game is that the AI can be savage in derbys, but that just adds to the fun! Just a heads up to those on newer hardware, set the resoulution to something x32 or else it might not play (happened to me when I launched the game).\n\n","February 19","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy it. In a long review, this game is like rubbing mayonaise on your balls. I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. The controls are a bit sluggish but tight nonetheless. It's fun to just smash the ♥♥♥♥ into people in a race and then participate in a stunt course where you can pretend to be Paul Walker by crashing your car, flying out of it and smashing into somthing. The soundtrack consists or mainly rock and pop punk, with a touch of metal and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ band we call Nickelback. But just because the game has a couple of songs by Pennyback, doesn't mean the soundtrack is bad, because you get songs by bands such as Rise Against, Fall Out Boy, Underoath, Megadeth, Yellowcard and Papa Roach.\n\nOverall rating: 8/10\nRecommended if you like: Racing games, especially ones like Destruction Derby, as it is a similar game.","April 14","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's been a childhood game of mine, brings back many memories! Multiplayer is down, but that's okay! Single player is still fun especially when you install the mods! These mods are easy and simply add custom cars and tracks, as well as options for races that where originally locked in multiplayer, aliong with new features! This game has an amazing soundtrack! Featuring artists like Yellowcard, Rob Zombie, Zebrahead, Alkaline Trio, sadly Nickelback ;) But anyways yes! great game! Many people complain about how its a sensitive racing game, meaning if you hit something, you spin out quickly. Apparently poeple dont know games come with options and settings for a reason haha, just simply turn down the sensitivity and keep the force up, dummies! Aaaaaaand that's about it. Fun racing game with awesome cars, tracks, and goofy stunt modes where you launch your driver! And all of the mods on top of that. Fantastic. Interested in the mods? check out www.moddb.com\n\n10/10! My favorite racing game ever! You guys should absolutely give this game a try, I reccomend modding it for more fun, and give it a shot! Especially if you got a deal on FlatOut 2! and remember, this is the best one along with Flatout: Ultimate Carnage! It's literally FlatOut 2 but HD.

It gives you a lot of fun with its car-wrecking features, with stunning graphics of the cars and the environment, mostly destroyable. Also great physics and nearly realistic driving. Like most racing video games, it has nice soundtrack songs, but it will be greater with more songs (too few songs, I think). And the part I liked most is its suitability for low-end PCs.\nReally, this game is awesome. With minimal PC specifications, you will get great experience.\nIf only you could enjoy the scenery in-game, you would admire its beautiful graphics. But I guess once you race, you will completely ignore the graphics and focused to the race, while screaming angrily and swearing over the AI drivers driving your car out of the track.\nVery recommended","August 12, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once I figured out a good control scheme for my Xbox 360 controller that he can use with his tiny hands (steer with Left analog stick, accelerate with A and Brake with B) he got the hang of it. The music is pretty much inoffensive hard rock, the gameplay is super simple and the graphics are decent. All in all FlatOut 2 is a solid racer and especially good for little ones who want to play "big kid" games. There's also a ton of crazy special modes like trying to fling your driver out of the windshield and through flaming hoops and stuff.

The controls and physics in the FO2 games and events are way too hard and wonky to ever win unless you spend hours upon hours practicing. The variety of games is nice though, even if the high-jump now has ridiculous new requirements and obstacles in order to actually post a score xP\n\nFlatout has always had really random physics. You can run over some fences and cones, but hit a box and suddenly it gets underneath you and you're suddenly facing the wrong way? And everything will turn you the wrong way! I flipped end over end for a good 100 yds, spinning around twice on my trunk, and without fail landed facing the wrong direction. Every single time! The walls and barriers have magnets in them too, so all the metal in the front of your car instantly finds the nearest one and is plastered there - unless heaven forbid you hit the brakes and\nThe racing from 'derby' through the 'racing' class is fun, even though the tracks get old. Once you hit 'street', prepared to be  ♥♥♥♥♥♥. As the cars get lower, everything will mess you up as it gets under the car - which makes sense. But what doesn't is the seemingly nothingness that will send you spiraling out of control. "Ohp, you hit a small bump; better not over-correct and face the wrong way!"\n\nThe street class upgrades are a joke too. 4300cr for .1 handling!? Really?!\n\nAll in all, a fun game and infinitely better than Flatout 3! Best to only do a little bit of the 'street' class and just max out 'derby' and 'race' to keep the game at max fun - and do demo derbys! You get really adament about smashing your most hated rival, lol.","February 11","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just buy it already.\n\nThere are 3 classes of vehicles: derby, race and street. The career mode has you starting out with the derby class, earning money by doing well in races. You buy a vehicle, upgrade the vehicle and you can buy more vehicles if you want to change cars depending on the track. There are no power-ups or other BS like that, which is a great thing IMO.\n\nIn my mind, this racing in this game is mostly about trying to screw over your opponents and avoiding danger. You may start to develop a bit of a rivalry with the AI. Nothing feels quite as satisfying as performing a PIT maneuver on JASON WALKER, THAT OVERPOWERED PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥. That said, it should be noted that the races are a bit easy to begin with and there's no real way to make it more difficult other than getting to the race/street classes.\n\nAs well as races there are special 'events' such as bowling, darts and football/soccer. These mostly just involve flinging your driver at high speeds into something. These are extremely entertaining, but good luck winning 1st place!\n\nFor the most part, the physics feel pretty solid. For some reason the handling feels weird with the chase cameras, so I would recommend using the 1st person or nose camera (if that's what they're called).\n\nI use a wired Xbox 360 controller to play this. Unfortunately you have to navigate the menus using the keyboard.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty darn good; I'd suggest looking it up. It's nice to have some old favourites to listen to, although it may start to get repetitive after a while.\n\nWhile there are some minor annoyances/issues, this is still my favourite arcade racer ever.","February 17","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Try to pick the game up on sale because this was the best $1.14 I've spent on a game. It's just realistic enough to get you immersed into the enviornment but still has that wonderful arcade like style! The hard body damage looks great and is pretty convincing and the car physics aren't too shabby either. The only bad this I could say about the game is that the AI can be savage in derbys, but that just adds to the fun! Just a heads up to those on newer hardware, set the resoulution to something x32 or else it might not play (happened to me when I launched the game).\n\n","February 19","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chicknduck/recommended/2990/","chicknduck","Chick'n'Duck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chicknduck/","624 products in account","While the first game was hard FlatOut 2 is beyond easy & hard. It is arbitrary, luck decides if you win or not and you as the player have little influence on that.\n\nThere are two main issues\n\nThe engine/the car behavior\nYou cannot predict how your car will react during a jump or hitting an obstacle. Sometimes it runs smoothly, sometimes you will lose your position or advantage. Therefore there is little space in getting better or master the game, because you don't get proper feedback which action benefits you and which one will be punished.\n\nYou will find at the bottom a video I've done about two stunts. The only thing I do is pressing throttle without pausing it, so there is no room for variation. I do this in both stunts. Two exact same actions from the player result in different outcomings.\n\nThe AI/your opponents\nSome of them are trolls, not interested in winning the race just ramming other cars and putting themselves at the tail end while giving you a hard time.\nThe other extreme are the flawless ones, usually using one of the higher level cars which you have to unlock first. Catching up with them happens rarely. They usually drive clean and boost forwards if you are getting close. Starting at the last position puts you in huge disadvantage against those.\n\nThe other thing is that the AI adapts to you. Are you driving faster or have you upgraded your car? They get better as well, so the difficulty seems to stay stable. At least to a certain point. Buying a new car with much better values makes the races easier, but not as much as I expected.\n\nSome small annoyances\n-The starting position varies, but most times I got the last place or something near that.\n-Later in the game you may have to repeat races a couple times to collect the amount of money to buy a car you've just unlocked. Winning all level 1 races doesn't guarantee you having enough money for a Level 2 car.\n-Strangely a Level 1 car isn't necessary good enough to compete in Level 1 races. I once had to grind for a better one and repeated the races.\n-NPCs get fixed cars from the start of a class and some of them get ones from a higher tier. It would be fairer if everyone would use a car from the same level.\n\nAll in all: Driving good doesn't get rewarded, you need a certain amount of luck. Both, losses and victories, felt cheap and latter one never satisfied me. I was just relieved to be over the current race.\n\nNow the most important point:\nDoes this all make the game unenjoyable? It depends.\nAre you looking for a serious racing game? Is anything but 1st place not an option to you? Then skip this one. It started pretty easy and was fun, but the further I got into the game the more the races turned into bitter and teeth-gnashing hours of retries which felt more like playing roulette and waiting untill the ball hits your number.\n\nIf you don't care about the mentioned issues, because just beating the game is enough for you or you just want to have a bit random wanky car physics fun, you might wanna try it. At least it won't hurt as long as you don't take it too seriously and bite your teeth into it.\n\nVideo:\nhttps://youtu.be/y9nAsEfCIX8","January 4","false","77.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's been a childhood game of mine, brings back many memories! Multiplayer is down, but that's okay! Single player is still fun especially when you install the mods! These mods are easy and simply add custom cars and tracks, as well as options for races that where originally locked in multiplayer, aliong with new features! This game has an amazing soundtrack! Featuring artists like Yellowcard, Rob Zombie, Zebrahead, Alkaline Trio, sadly Nickelback ;) But anyways yes! great game! Many people complain about how its a sensitive racing game, meaning if you hit something, you spin out quickly. Apparently poeple dont know games come with options and settings for a reason haha, just simply turn down the sensitivity and keep the force up, dummies! Aaaaaaand that's about it. Fun racing game with awesome cars, tracks, and goofy stunt modes where you launch your driver! And all of the mods on top of that. Fantastic. Interested in the mods? check out www.moddb.com\n\n10/10! My favorite racing game ever! You guys should absolutely give this game a try, I reccomend modding it for more fun, and give it a shot! Especially if you got a deal on FlatOut 2! and remember, this is the best one along with Flatout: Ultimate Carnage! It's literally FlatOut 2 but HD.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spitfiredwod/recommended/2990/","Spitfiredwod","Spitfiredwod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spitfiredwod/","17 products in account","Here it is, the sequel to a timeless classic, but is it better or worse?\n\nWell, a large majority will likely say the former, while looking through a pair of rose-tinted Nostalgia-brand glasses.\n\nMe? not so much.\n\nThere are some big improvements over Flatout 1, but some problems have been made significantly worse. First, lets start with the driving.\n\n\nDRIVING:\nThe driving feels overall pretty solid and nice, arcadey, but not to the extent of say, need for speed. Its sort of a blend of realistic behavor with physics breaking abilities. So far, its pretty good. Front-wheel drive cars tend to understeer into corners, rear-wheel drive tends to slide around more, oversteering, and 4WD is a bit of both, mostly understeer though. All well and good and as it should be.\n\nHowever Sometimes it can be very very unpredictable. Sometimes when landing a jump, your car will smash into the ground, either bouncing into the air or veering to the left or right, causing you to wreck, sometimes your car will completly flip upon landing a jump. THis all depends on the car, but really it can be complete luck weather you land a jump and keep going or crash and have to restart the race, which you will be doing, ALOT.\n\n\nNext, the tracks\n\nTRACKS:\n\nOh, dear lord did they mess this one up badly.\n\nYou know that thing i said in my Flatout 1 review?\n\nOriginally posted by Spitfiredwod:Some objects are badly placed on tracks, like excavators,trucks,tractors ect all being placed in bad areas, wich can cause unneeded or undeserved wrecks, it also makes it harder to get a good driving line through certain corners. Sometimes even the tinest of objects like cones, can cause huge wrecks too.\n\nYeah, well imagine that, only about ten-thousand times worse.\n\nHoly moly did they go overboard on the smashable props! It wouldnt really even be so much of a problem, if said props dissapeared or became uncollideable after being smashed into, but, no.\nThe props just go everywhere, all over the track at critical points before turns or after jumps, and ALL of them will cause you to wreck, every single one, even the cardboard boxes.\n\nThese props are everywhere, on every track in the game, and they are nearly impossible to avoid.\n\nId say, out of the hundreds of wrecks that ive had in the game so far, 98% of them have not been my fault, 78% is likely due to the props, and at least 20% are due to the bad AI, which we'll get to later.\n\nNot to mention, the unbreakable solid objects badly placed on the edges of the track are still here, though, they are usually just boulders instead of trucks or diggers. However they are all pretty much completely hidden by grass, you wont know its there until you've hit one, and half the time you'll be saying "What the f**k did i just hit?" as you restart your race for the 17th time in a row, and no, thats not and exaggeration.\n\n\nTHE AI:\n\nIm just going to be blunt here.\n\nThis game has the worst AI rubberbanding ive ever seen in a racing game, ive been playing racing games for 12 years, many have had AI rubberbanding, but this one tops them all.\n\nTo give a little explanation on this, ill use Gran Turismo 1/ Gran Turismo 2 for example, games nutorious for having AI rubberbanding.\n\nIn GT1 and GT2 The AI would speed up or slow down depending on how much you were beating them, or them beating you. THis is used in an attempt to keep the racing close and fair.\n\nIf you got 2 seconds a lap ahead, the AI would speed up a bit, usually matching your speed, your able to stay out in front, but if you make a really bad turn or crash, they will catch back up, or pass you. If your in a really fast car, you can outrun the speed boost. The same thing applies if your being beaten, the AI cars slow down by 2 seconds, giving you a chance to catch up, or pass them if you wrecked.\n\nThats essentially what its like here, only its done way, way worse.\n\nInstead of your cars being equally matched, In street class, the AI cars will be almost twice as fast as your car, no matter what car it is or if its fully upgraded. The race starts and your left in the dust. then they brake a bit, allowing you to pass, only to smash you to bits or fly right past you once again.\n\nBasically, it doesnt matter how good of a driver you are, no amount of perfect driving lines or well timed boosts is going to give you an edge. The AI is basically there to stomp you, and you have to either get out in front and drive nearly perfect to stay there, which due to the AIs speed, wont last long, Or you and try and smash everyone who gets near you to peices. Either way, its racing hell.\n\nFinally, the multiplayer.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:\n\nThe multiplayer is where the real fun lies. No garbage AI to ruin your day here, and usually less props get involved, due to  less people smashing into them. (though some are unaviodable and automatic, like the rock slide on Pinegrove.)\n\nThe game has, or, had real online multiplayer, which was a huge plus over Flatout 1. However in late 2012 rumors that GameSpy, the company responsible for Hosting Flatout 2's online servers, and many many other games , would be shutting down. This would sadly prove true, as on May 31st 2013, Gamespy shut its doors for good, and took all of its servers with it..\n\nHowever, its not all bad, nowadays you can use many different programs to play GameSpy hosted games online, Flatout included.\n\nThe multiplayer on Flatout 2 is very fun, you can race with, or smash other real players to bits. You can host lobbies with up to 8 players. As a host, you can change what tracks will be raced, what derbies or events will take place, what cars players will be able to use, how many laps a race will have, and so on.\nTheres also text, and voice chat in lobbies. Ive never seen anyone using a microphone though, so i cant really answer to the quality of voice chat.\n\nOTHER STUFF;\n\nThe Soundtrack here is pretty great, aside from the 2 Nickelback songs that is. Theres songs from, and not limited to:\n\nMegadeth\nPapa Roach\nFall Out Boy\nRise Against\nWolfmother\nRob Zombie\n\n\nThere havent been any really noticable bugs in what ive seen so far, aside from one minor glitch, where you can drive through a wall on a City track, however the glitch is useless, and wont give you a competitive edge.\n\nOVERALL;\n\nWhile i do reccomend this, because it can be quite fun, its also very frustrating at times. Be prepared to restart races 10-15 times to win.\n\n7/10.","May 20","true","43.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are different forest, farmland, canal, race and city tracks, which are very similar...what's the difference between "pines" and "logging camp" for example...pretty minor. The most interesting tracks only appear toward the end of the game, which is a shame, since the game is tiered into 3 different "classes" (derby, sports and street or sth. like that) and 1 class gets obsolete once you're done with it, only to buy the next best car in another class. Despite winning every race and event I still didn't have enough money to consistently buy new cars and fully upgrade them...and oh boy, do you need the new cars. Some cars are simply way better than others...sad story. I wasn't even bothering with the late game stuff. A pick up truck carried me throught the last 50 races or so.\n\nThe driving and physics are ok, but FO 1 required a lot more senstivity. This game is for the most part pedal to the metal. Only in later classes and tiers will you ever need breaks, which is a shame. Or you could just rely on your AI opponents to simply crash into you to slow you down. I mean, yes, it is a "crash" game, but the AI is just nuts and a really bad driver. They will CONSTANTLY try to crash you, even if that means they wreck themselves (i.e. kill). They don't drive to win, they drive to crash. You. They go out of their way to get you, which is very annoying to be honest. I don't mind the crashing, it's fun, but there should be a race underneat, not a rubber band AI that crashes itself after every use of Nitro. The AI is bad. Very bad. Towards the end of the game it's so bad, that out of your 7 opponents, only 2 (sometimes 3) even pose a "challenge". Why? Because they constantly rubber band 1st and 2nd place. In. Every. Race. Unless you wreck them or crash them enough, so that they may only be in 4th or 5th place. This puts enormous amounts of pressure on the player to win every race, which is very hard if you drive perfectly, the AI crashes constantly, but still catches up multiple times. It makes no sense.\n\nWhat also does not make sense is the absurd amount of debris on the road, which your car either ignores or (perhaps when the game thinks you're doing too well) which flip you around like a leaf in the wind...inconsistent imho. Anyway, 14 hours for this game's SP mode...too much imho. Damn. The event games are cool, though, once you get the hang of them.","May 27","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This makes the game more fun.\n\nThe physics in the game are OK, it feels realistic to drive the cars, and ramming your opponents look awesome! But, be careful when driving fast, because even the tiniest objects, like sticks and rocks, can just bring your car to a wheelie and then crash, allowing your opponents to pass you.\n\nThere are a variety of cars to choose from, within 3 categories; derby, race and street. The cars are upgradable which is cool, but you cannot customize your car.\nThe soundtrack for this game is epic! There are amazing tracks featuring Alkaline Trio and Yellow card etc. I think you'll enjoy the music, and old, classic racing game soundtracks sound great.\n\nYou might not like this game if you just want to race, because in this game, you will need to crash other cars as well, to get nitrous.\n\nI really enjoy this game! And it's at a cheap price, so even better! This game is so recommended for fans of Burnout, like myself, and other car-crash and other action games.","February 21, 2015","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
