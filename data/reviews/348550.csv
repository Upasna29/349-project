In Guilty Gear you don't stop thinking at the jump. Will the jumping character attack, air-block (or air-instant block, a sort of semi-parry) any ground normals, spend meter for blocking anti-air specials, double-jump, air-dash forward/backwards? (Not counting character specific stuff as triple jumping etc.)\n\nThe character (mechanics) design is quite extreme too, since almost every character has one or more exception from the standard game mechanics, like: triple jump, double air dash, parry, delayed wakeup on sweep, not being able to dash, being able to level up specials and supers, having a heat gauge that allows for more damaging normals but also running the risk of over-heating unless venting steam (yeah, really) and more...\n\n\nOf course, my recommendation is quite biased:\nI was a casual arcade game scrub since the start of the 1990s and took a liking for 2D fighting games. When I came across the console version of Guilty Gear XX #R and more importantly, people who played it seriously, GG almost became more than a game to me.\n\nI played the game with my friends for hours on a daily basis. I went to tournaments, domestic as well as abroad. This was before there were any real prize money to speak of, meaning that VERY few (if anyone) would actually have their expenses covered. Still, I have zero regret for the time and money I have spent playing this game!","June 27, 2015","true","6.8"," 48 of 51 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","48","51","2","0"

But still got it, since its a really good fighting game...\n\nThis is the lastest version of GGXXAC series, but not GGXRD. Though its usually good news when more Japanese publishers pour games into steam!\n\nThe steam version though is pretty much like playing on PSN, 4:3 format with the 2 bars on both sides of the screen.\nNot much on graphical changes since this game was on PS2 but the GGXXAC+R has its changes from the last update.  It does change the game quite a bit.  Brings back good memories at the arcade. SP plays just fine, MP is a lagfest but didn't expect MP to be great anyway (My expectation from PSN for MP wasn't great to begin with). Hopefully games like GGXRD will fix that... right???\n\nAny way, I'd recommend this game for hard core fighting game fans and if you like Blazblue series, you'll like this diverse game.\n\nIf you're into SF Series, give it a try, it may surprise you.

If you want to go back in time, switch to AC mode in the Game Options menu.\nAdds arcade-only sidebars!\nDev team seems committed, some issues already patched out in the first 24 hours.\nSelf-published, adds a glimmer of hope for future releases.\nControllers and arcade sticks recognized by default, and full keyboard bindings are available as well as a separate menu.\nNetplay allows inviting via Steam friends list.\nConsConnections always read as 4-bars, and delay is significant across the board. Connections that were acceptable on PS3 are slower here. (Upside: connections are significantly smoother, no bursts of delay. Hopefully the standard delay is fixable.)\nNot much in the way of resolution support, and playing in fullscreen has issues. (If your monitor is >60Hz, the game will read 60fps but run faster. Fullscreen also seems to add additional input delay.)\nWindowed by default, and resolution options are limited. (Default is 1280x720, native res, good enough imo.)\nGame reads controllers, but assigns buttons incorrectly - though prompts will read "B" to cancel, you need to press "X", for example.\nWindows decides who is Player 1 and who is Player 2 - the game does not ask you to select a side when you start. This also leads to issues like Windows treating you as Player 2, forcing you to bind keys for that side, while netplay only uses Player 1's binds. Only a serious issue re: netplay, since every offline mode works fine as 2P.\nTabbing back into the game if it wasn't on top causes brief (1-2s) slowdown.\nSummaryIt's AC+R on PC. As things stand now, it's only good for offline play, but netplay stands a decent chance of getting fixed. Keep your expectations realistic (we won't be seeing GGPO, for example) and it's absolutely worth a purchase.","May 27, 2015","true","28.7"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","34","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlothFactsFGC/recommended/348550/","SlothFactsFGC","SlothFacts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlothFactsFGC/","654 products in account","In fighting games, the trend has always been that a game's released, the game isn't well-balanced or very fun to play in-depth due to the unpredictable nature of meta-game evolution and a lack of understanding of the systems that were being implemented in the original release, and so the game receives update after update, refining it and adding new characters and concepts built with the understanding gained from previous releases. The updates each do worse commercially than the last, because refined things aren't as sexy as brand new things. It's hard to sell people on a better version of a thing they already have. So eventually, the carefully polished game is pushed aside for a brand new one, full of imperfections but fresh visuals and ideas.\n\nThose final versions of those games, however, tend to remain loved by a cult following. After all, they're the result of years and years of player feedback. Sometimes close to a decade of it. Fighting games like Super Turbo, 3rd Strike, The King of Fighters '98. They're all final love letters to their most loyal fans before their respective series ventured off into brave new directions.\n\nAccent Core Plus R is that love letter for fans of Guilty Gear XX, and it's written so well that it's hard for newcomers not to swoon over it, too. It's a game literally ten years in the making. With the exception of newcomers Kliff and Justice (who had previously been included as bonus console characters with no consideration for balance), the characters as they're represented in Plus R are based on years and years of player feedback. When Xrd was released later, it turned back the clock on its returning characters in an attempt to simplify them and not overwhelm players. As Xrd continues to see updates, that'll change. But for now, most of the Guilty Gear characters' Plus R iterations are the most interesting and fun they've ever been.\n\nThat said, there are definitely problems with this package. Getting the game to run without heavy input delay requires some fiddling with settings, both in-game and via NVIDIA Inspector (though you could get away with only adjusting the in-game settings). Additionally, the netcode is bad, and makes playing online both a chore and, often, a much, much less pleasant experience than playing someone offline. Lobbies are limited to two players at a time, and there are no replays, either. Meaning there's no way to watch others play, and potentially learn from them.\n\nStill, though. Plus R is the most fun fighting game I've ever played, and is fun enough for me to happily put up with those shortcomings. The game's an absolute joy, and if you've got people to play it with locally, then you absolutely have to at least try it. If all you've got is online play, I'd still encourage you to give it a chance! There are Steam and Discord groups specifically for trying to find opponents with good connections!","February 20","true","32.0"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","22","23","2","0"

Easily the most well-balanced entry of the series and sports the largest cast as well coming in at 25 combatants. For gameplay modes it sports Arcade, story, vs, team vs, mission, survival, training, & online. There is also a gallery in which you can view at atwork and other content you have unlock while playing.\n\nThe online play is touchy subject of this title as it can be really good or really bad entirely based on the distance from other players. For example the online feels next to perfect playing against my friend who lives about 40 minutes away by car but playing random people online, it can show some seriously bad input lag. It should also be noted there is no spectating or lobbies for that matter if that was something which interested you.\n\nAs for the port, it runs a lot smoother than the steam store page would lead you to expect with the high recommend specs, so much so i'd guess the real recommended specs are much lower. The only serious port issue i've encountered at this time is no way in-game to exit the game, but that is said to be on a 'To-Do' list. Its also nice that they throw in the OST for the game as an added bonus (though it should be noted certain shared tracks in the game itself are in the included Guilty Gear XX #Reload OST instead of this one, so view this more like an OST expansion).\n\nI really recommend this game as the ideal starting point if you want to get into Guilty Gear, though it should be noted Guilty Gear does have a learning curve, so don't expect good results running up blind against a seasoned player. At $14.99, you will get your money's worth on content.","May 27, 2015","true","7.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","0"

It is still being worked on so there's that to look forward to.\n\nFor people who have no idea what is in Accent Core Plus but have #Reloaded. Accent Core has overhauled most of the characters and brought Kliff and Justice into tournaments mostly by limiting their mobility. Justice can't sprint, dash, airdash, or triple jump unless you use a certain tension thing, also her bombs are limited to point blank range for countering or just corner ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then Kliff just tires out quicker. All characters have a "Force Break" which is an improved version of certain specials that consumes 25% tension.\n\nUpdate: Data is not stored on the steam cloud so if you are starting from a different computer either bring a copy of your data next time or zip it up and grab it whenever.\nI change my score to an 8 from a 9","May 31, 2015","true","31.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

(I was looking for them from the first time I saw it on the Japanese arcades.)\nYes – you can thank me. Here is a proof:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/348550/discussions/0/617336568071954048/\n\nAnd I ve been playing Guilty Gear since GGxxReload – now it’s almost 10 years…so trust no one but me ^_^ – 100% honest review!\n~~~~~~~~~~\nNow the review.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe overall score is 9.5 from 10.                                 ~\nI would not rate this high ANY other fighting game.    ~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nProS!:\n\n+Stunning port from the consoles. Even better than the original console version! I know it’s hard to believe guys but…I could not find any single lag input…frame drop (system recommendations are too high – the game itself will work perfect on much weaker pc.\n\n+Improved imput method for the keyboard players. You will be surprised how smooth the imputs for the special moves are.\n\n+ALL console bugs were fixed! They even added arcade borders portraits when I did ask them.\nI could not wish for more. My legacy for the Guilty gear series has been completed.\n\n+Amazing artwork…surprising satisfaction - cos the “style” is so well kept and evolved. The ac core style combine with some xxreload(previous series etc.) – and boom shakalaka.\n\n+Great memorable soundtrack that just fits the game PERFECT. I personally never-ever wanted to shut down the music in the game. Another thing that comes to surprise.Some tracks are like well…street fighter ken stage for example – are immortal.\n\n+The gameplay is hard to master but not by the ugly controls. It’s all about the skill. The more and better you become – the more you want to play. Again…I remember this kind thing only at the Primal Rage arcade (when I was a kid) and Ultimate Mortal Kombat from sega mega drive…sweet childhood. ^_^\n\n+Almost perfectly balanced game. This actually comes to surprise when you see that almost in every tournament with +R almost always played with different chars at the grand finals. I would dare even to say that there are NO CHARS in this game that s@ck a@@!\n\n+Almost perfect netplay! You can find and play come really good matches!\n\n+If you love an Anime – you are gonna love this game even more.\n\n+If you don’t love an Anime – this game will make you love it and you will want to watch it ^_^\n\n+TONS of offline modes. You will N-E-V-E-R get bored in this game. And there are none which I can call lame…delete this plz etc…surprisingly amazing job done.\n\n+25 chars roster. Anybody will be satisfied and pick the char they will like and love to play. Again I could not find any bad or any “out of place” chars.(Xrd for example Bedman…Jack’o – looks like Blazblue rejected chars)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n++Better than Guilty Gear Xrd!™~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nNow the cons:\n~~~~~~~~~~\n-(-0.25) While I said –“almost perfectly balanced” – some chars got some nerf since the last version of ggac core(Testament for example my char). While I do welcome the balancing – some moves are nerfed beyond common sense. The “startups of the special moves” are too slow…same goes to some other chars…and reverse boosting some other chars: Zappas for example knife summon got huge buff and looks overpowered sometimes… Chipp Zanuff looks ridiculously fast. Baiken’s counter hits could be a real nightmare. Millia Rage if played well is almost unstoppable…same goes to Dizzy…yep >.<  I ve played a LOT vs pros using this chars…and if they are mastered…the game is starting to look as “almost” balanced..\n\n-(-0.25). The netcode is good. The netplay is good but a little clumsy. We all do need a lobby via XXreload style.  The delay is good but tricky sometimes…sometimes I do host and when we play I have a little delay…sometimes I don’t have any(!) delay( I have 75mbit internet).\nAlso looking for a ggpo online infected. Or some custom network patch like it was in ggxxreload online that was made from a scratch by a Japanese guys(yes this game has it’s own cult)\nJust so I could rate this game almost 10/10!\n~~\nOverall don’t be scared about my last statements…the online mode is still good! Very – very playable and enjoyable. I just wish that it was perfect as the rest of the game.\nAnd the balance is solid…just some really stupid decisions about some minor moves.\n~~\n\nWell – did you read all of this? Thanks if yes.\nIf not just buy this AMAZING game and read the review!\nStunning fighting game that no one even come close!\nLet’s ROCK!\n\nALF™.\n\nP.S.\nYeah & add me to the steam friends if  you wanna play some online guilty gear +r!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nP.S.S.\nHere is my "little" Guilty Gear AC Core +R Guide :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=463914818\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","June 30, 2015","true","375.6"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","17","28","3","0"

Not at a level the game really and truly needs, but honestly no netcode out there is.\n\nRegardless, Guilty Gear is another one of the classic fighters to hit Steam. It was one of the first fighting games I played more than a little bit and the one that got me hooked on to the fighting game genre. The game is fast paced and even now remains one of the most technically complex 2D fighters out there. If you're looking for a "deep" fighter with a diverse cast, look no further. Guilty Gear has it all and is a pleasure to play at both low and high levels. It is quite a time sink though if you take it seriously, but still enjoyable casually. I honestly feel that the game is more accessible than something like Street Fighter 4 since it generally relies on chain combos rather than links making lower level combos not too bad. But at the same time the combos at the higher end can be much more difficult.\n\nUnfortunately the port doesn't really polish much (or anything?), though the only real glaring age issue is that the sound effect audio quality (not the soundtrack) is extremely low. Worse than I remember the original XX in fact. Don't let that scare you off though!

I'd say that (assuming that both players have a "good" connection) while playing within 500~600 km is just awesome, playing with people at idk, 900~1000 km or more makes you feel input delay, quite too much probably.\n\nNetcode aside, everything I wrote reviewing the older GUILTY GEAR XX #Reload still stands, with the exception of Steam integration and setting customization since this latest release fully features both.\n\nTo conclude: a must have for fighting games enthusiasts, highly recommended for anyone intrigued by video and screenshot previews, worth buying actually just for the bonus soundtrack alone.\n\nAlmost forgot, this game runs flawlessly on linux though wine after installing and overriding directx9. By flawlessly I mean constant 60fps everywhere and no visible/audible glitch of any kind.","May 27, 2015","true","47.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Everyone from earlier installments in  the series and some new ones are playable in this game.  Xrd -SIGN-'s missing a lot of these chraracters, and -REVELATOR-'s still going to be missing a fair amount of them as well.  If you play this game locally, you're going to have a lot of fun, but don't expect to play it online.  For one thing, the community's moved on to Xrd, now that that's finally out on Steam, and secondly, the netplay in this port is bad.  It turns the game into Street Fighter, it's just that slow.  But judging the game on its own merit, it's easily one of the best fighting games ever made.  You can't go wrong buying this.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are the same as you remember them, but don't scale well at higher resolutions.\nBest soundtrack in the series.\nIt's Guilty Gear at its finest.\n\nCons:\nUnless you play it online.\nAudio quality seems tinny compared to the console version.

I cannot count how many hours I poured into these games by myself doing survival mode struggling to unlock secret characters or constantly urging my friends to play with me until we all where sporting callused thumbs like badges of courage.\n\nFor me This is not just a good game, its down right nostalgic.\n\nGuilty gear X2: Accent Core Plus R is a fast paced hyper fighter. Its your stylized anime type of fighter and probably has the claim of being one of if not the first. This particular version is the most up to date version of a game that began back in 2003 and while it shows its age a little I cant help but have nothing but love for it. With this particular version you have a rather extensive roster each character with perhaps the largest move set they've ever had, exceeding even that of their modern day variations in Guilty Gear Xrd. Also present in this version is the much desired online functionality with suitable net code. Its nothing to write home about but gets the job done.\n\nAs I mentioned before however the game can show its age at times. Sprites arnt as slick as one might remember, also lacking is a "challenge" mode method of training present in newer fighters so if you want to pick up a character learn their moveset and hash out some combo's be prepared to spend some time in training mode.\n\nFor its price however you are getting one hell of a deal with more then enough content to keep you entertained for quite some time.\n\nGamepad or Fightstick strongly encouraged.\n\nSolid 10","May 29, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/348550/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account",""Give in to your guilty pleasures and start fighting for Heaven or Hell in the best version of Guilty Gear X2."\nGuilty Gear X2 Accent Core Plus is the definitive version of all things Guilty Gear X2 related. And trust me; there is plenty of stuff related to GGX2. For the record, I don't count Guilty Gear Isuka as part of the Guilty Gear X2 re-releases. I don't care how many A.B.A. fans I upset when I say that, either. After Guilty Gear X2's initial release, fighting game fans got hit with plenty of remakes of Arc System's crazy chaos combat contest. Thus, you might be wondering if you should bother picking up this game. Well, yes, you should. Look at it this way: do you want the most up to date character roster, the most balanced move set, the most information regarding the Guilty Gear mythos and the most modes alongside the classic arcade and versus? Of course you do! Anyone can see that GGX2ACP is the game to get for those who want the most out of the world of Guilty Gear. Trust me when I say that there is plenty of “most” for everyone.\n\nThose new to Guilty Gear might be a bit lost in terms of story. The cast of Guilty Gear is eccentric and wild; the types of people you want to hang around with at a party. Due to the aggressive and dangerous nature of Gears, bounty hunters and The Sacred Order of the Holy Knights alike waged a century long war to end the existence of all Gears. Tournaments have been held in the past to extinguish any remaining Gears and the ruler of all Gears: Justice. In doing so, the victors are granted money. Lots and lots money. That's the basic premise behind the Guilty Gear world, but the characters and their eccentricities are what make the game so special. There are no Ryu/Ken types here, thankfully. Instead, you have a huge cast you'd never expect to find. There is Bridgette, a transvestite who fights with yo-yos, stuffed animal and roller blades. There is also Slayer, a vampire with more power than a generator that controls a continent. Seriously, he blocks attacks with smoke from his pipe! We also have the beautiful Millia Rage, an assassin trained to use her gorgeous hair as a weapon. All of your favorites are back and one of the draws of Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus is the fact that two fan favorite characters have joined the roster: Kliff and Justice. While these overpowered jerks are rarely used in normal play or in tournaments, it's still great to see familiar faces and have such a huge variety of characters. With the up to date story mode, you can find out more about each unique character as they battle the entities known as Gears and the mysterious figure known only as “That Man.” All characters have multiple endings in their story modes. Since each arc is short, you can see different sides of the tale.\n\nAlongside Story Mode, there is a new Survival Mode that allows you to level up your characters as you battle the computer. You can also play the regular Arcade, Training, Versus, M.O.M, Versus Computer and Two-vs.-Two Modes. Accent Core Plus will let you go on-line provided you have the proper PS2 attachments. Once a mode is picked, you select a character and once a character is picked, the fun begins again. The fighting is as hectic as ever yet still retains the familiarity of all of the predecessors. Characters have a variety of attacks, skills and the potential to chain them all together to create impressive combos that demand respect. All characters have strengths and weaknesses, but knowing how each character performs will lead to huge combos and a better understanding of how to battle other opponents. As usual, there is plenty to offer in Accent Core Plus in terms of strategy that goes beyond a standard combo. Techniques such as Faultless Defense, Roman Cancelling, False Roman Cancelling (more on those in a minute) and others are needed to fully get the most out of the fighting. All in all, fighting is a blast. The computer controlled AI does not pull any punches even on the easier difficulty settings. Practice makes perfect when it comes to picking a character that's right for you. This leads me to my biggest complaint about the game: the lack of a good practice mode. Sure, Training Mode gives you some options but it would have been nice to include a mode that gives you hints about the basics of 2D fighting, combo ideas and strategies. Considering this is the best version of Guilty Gear X2, an extra mode would have helped to sell the package and set it apart from the other releases. One of the good things that the Training Mode offers is that it allows you to learn the input of executing a False Roman Cancel. False Roman Cancels, or FRCs, allow you to stop most attacks mid-animation and either follow up with an impressive combo or dash away in case an attack missed. They're very important, but also very trick to learn. Since all characters have different FRCs, learning the timing for each of them will take effort. However, this effort is worth it and it was a good move on Arc's part to include the FRC practice feature.\n\nDespite the lack of a more involved Training Mode, there are some great things to point out that you can only find in Accent Core Plus: bonus material. As you complete the various challenges, you'll unlock stunning artwork. Fans know that the illustrations in Guilty Gear have always been amazing and what better way to see them than as a reward for winning a tough match? Get ready to see the Game Over screen and hit the start button while a countdown begins. Luckily, the rewards for your troubles are well worth it. Once again, anime is the central theme in the graphics department. Animations and scenery look like they should: excellent and full of vivid details. The rock and roll inspired soundtrack is back in full swing, as well. For those of you that buy the game new, you will get the OST on a separate disc so you can rock out with your...well...you know....when not playing Guilty Gear. Finally, all of the voice acting is in Japanese.\n\nThe best thing about Guilty Gear X2 Accent Core Plus is that it has everything a fan of the series could want with just enough extra stuff to set it apart from other remakes of X2. To me, the best part is the free soundtrack. However, even without it, this is still an excellent 2D fighting game from a legendary franchise. All of the characters and their crazy moves, the gorgeous graphics, the awesome music and the endless amount of options available to you make this game one worth checking out. Having now fully immersed myself in both BlazBlue and Guilty Gear, I can easily say that Guilty Gear is the better of the two. Both series are great, but there is something about Guilty Gear that sets it just above its counterpart. If that's not going to convince you to purchase Guilty Gear X2 Accent Core Plus, then nothing will.\n\n\nReviewer's Score: 9/10","May 29, 2015","true","3.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Guilty Gear is freedom in that if you can imagine it, with practice and understanding, you can probably do it. The game allows for some of the greatest flexibility in any game, and you'll derive as much enjoyment from discovering its nuances as you will beating opponents senseless and rocking out doing so.\n\nThis is the game that got me playing fighting games, made me appreciate game design, and made me appreciate Queen.

Thanks Steam!\n\nThe good\n-----\n-Large cast of characters that are quite diverse in terms of what they do and what their backstory is. A rule of thumb, the farther from the center of the character selection screen the character is, the more complicated that character is going to play. You'll sure to have a unique experience with many of the characters in the game.\n-The game goes through constant rebalancing as the devs know this is a game that players like to compete in.\n-Awesome soundtrack and art design.\n-There is much to do in terms of unlocking. Each character has an alternate EX version that plays in a "similar but different" form of the original.\n\nThe Bad\n-----\n-Limited graphic settings. The game is locked to 4:3 (understandable, the original was in 4:3 back in the last decade). If you play in full screen, the only way to exit the game seems to be ALT-F4 at the moment. Thankfully, the game runs fine in 144hz, unlike some other 2d fighters released on steam.\n\nThe Ugly\n----\nHaving to reunlock the EX versions of the characters yet again if you played earlier console versions (All of the original roster is unlocked from the get-go, including Justice and Kliff).

I like this more than Bloody Roar 3, Street Fighter IV, BlazBlue, Sküllgirls, and anything else that comes to mind. All the characters are lovable, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, the gameplay is absolutely perfectly balanced between casual and competitive, and is just outright fun to play. It's just fun. The characters are entertaining and look good, the animations are good, and the voices are good too. They're all extremely unique, too, and as soon as I started the game up for the first time I immediately connected to them, unlike, say, Street Fighter. I have way more hours in Street Fighter, and yet I can't say I care for 90% of the characters. Ryu's okay, Sakura's cool, and I kind of like Guile, and some others... but when I opened up Guilty Gear, and went straight to the versus mode, I just looked at everyone, and said, wow, these are some awesome characters.\n\nI pretty much picked May once, and then immediately decided she would be my main from then on. But I still can't help but like everyone else, still, they're all just really, really cool, and all feel like they have their own stories and personalities, all of which I can kind of get just by playing as them. And then there's all their story modes, which I haven't even got around to yet...\n\nSome of my other favourite characters are Johnny, Baiken, Bridget, Sol, Ky, I-No... and then, honourable mentions to Faust and Dizzy. And then everyone else. But I guess I can say those first five are my secondary favourites, though I just kind of like Faust's hilariously weird theme, and then I just find Dizzy cute, and oddly interesting as a character. And everyone else is cool too. Just, I don't care for them quite as much obviously.\n\n... But yeah, if you want an amazing, top tier fighting game, that you probably will never ever get to play online, because the net code is terrible, then... here you go!

If you want to buy this game solely for online mode, forget about it. It's not that GGXXAC+R's netcode is bad or anything (it's actually quite decent). Fighting games are meant to be played with friends, face-to-face. It's way more fun to play with a bunch of guys, sitting behind the screen, cheering for the underdog,screaming when something dope happen etc you know what I mean. Plus, network delay is one of the main reason I dont bother with playing online anymore. It just doesnt feel right at all when you're used to playing with delay-free situation (this is what gamer usually aim for regardless of what game they play). However. spending a bit of time with online mode isnt so bad. But still, I'm not recommend playing on online mode.\n\nSo, if you're not buying this game because of the online mode, why should you buy it then? Well, for starter, It's GUILTY GEAR ffs, the game  that havent released a new version on PC for like 10 years. New story to be discovered. Believe me when I say this, but GGXXAC+R's story is absolutely awesome (yeah, I kinda went through the whole story mode when there was a GGXXAC PS2 rom on PCSX2)\n\nWhat's more to add? Arcade mode's got enhanced with the addition to the hidden Order-Sol Boss (that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is really hard to chew), Boss I-no's got a quite few tweak herself with the addition of disabling Instant Kill, making it more challenging\n\nSurvival mode is quite cool as well, you have to ability to power-up your character after defeating each boss. Still. no save function. But hey, it's survival mode. Why do you even need a save function for?\n\nSaving the best for last, we have the major gameplay update. More balance than the previous versions, more mechanics to vastly improve the "every-situation-has-an-answer" property, namely throw break, slashback (this one is quite hard to use effectively though). Then we have 2 new characters (A.B.A and Order-Sol) and 2 re-balanced character that was consider OP and was ban from every Tournament (yes, I'm talking about Kliff and Justice)\n\nTL;DR: 10/10 would buy for the game's content","May 28, 2015","true","101.7"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","1"

Overall a good improvement from GGXX Reload and Isuka for Arcsys to bring to steam, since it has both better mechanics then both and the multiplayer isn't so difficult to use (Talking about the Reload netplay patch since Isuka didn't have nuthin').  It's important that some of the fighting game and arcsys fans on steam purchase this one and Blazblue continuum shift so Arcsys realizes that if they release their games at or near the same time as on consoles they can still get a good amount of sales on PC, it works for Street fighter so why not Arcsys?\n\nEither way, even if you're looking for online Core +R is still not the most optimal choice, in it's first few weeks of release on steam it the ranked and player match queue were full of people but the hype died soon after and you'll be able to get matches after waiting for long periods of time. However, if you have friends who play consistently you'll still have fun because in player match you can just invite them and have match right away so it has it's good side still.\n\nAnother reason to purchase this over Reload is it has many more gamemodes even for single player, so you can always just mess with those when you're not finding matches in multiplayer.","November 11, 2015","true","49.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Guaranteed to provide fast-paced, action-packed battles.

Variety is all over the place in this one.\n\nOnline matches can be dodgy, due to delay and could be a lot better with proper server connection.

Odds are, if you're even on this store page outside of a recommendation, you've already played this ages-old game, and are looking to play it again. Do it.\n\nGuilty Gear is a well established fighting game series which comes to us from Arc System Works, veterans of the genre. Both their other franchise BlazBlue as well as Guilty Gear have much to offer. Characters are extremely well designed, with each one boasting their own select set of skills and moves. The best part of Guilty Gear, and the feature that sets it well apart from other fighting games, is the balance of the fighters. Nearly every game I play with friends ends up with one of us on a pixel left of health by the end of the match. This makes the fights feel EXTREMELY intense, and any game that can actually get my heart going is a game I'm interested in. Button mashing isn't enough, and you'll come to learn all sorts of new techniques and mechanics as you play.\n\nHIGHLY recommended for ANY fan of fighting games.","July 14, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since the Mechanics to explain can fill entire Pages, i recommend visiting the Dustloop Wiki for more Infos.\n\nBesides the Mechanics, also the Characters and the Music (made both by Daisuke Ishiwatari) contributed to the huge success of this Series. It is easy to say that it belongs to the Top 3 of Fighting Games (Tekken, SF and GG)\n\nAccent Core as a Revision was also completely redone with new Looks (GUI, Menus, Character Portraits, etc.) and also the Voicing of all Characters are remade. Since Core Plus there is also a new Story Mode (2 Paths for each Char except Justice, Kliff and Holy Order Sol) and the R Revision received a brand new GUI which replaced that of Accent Core.\n\nAs a Side Note, BlazBlue is also made by ARCsys (Only Music made by Daisuke) and shares some Mechanics but hasn't the same Depth.\n\nIt offers many Modes such as a Story Mode, Missions, Survival, etc.\nThe Story Mode is recommended to grasp the Personalities of the Characters and to see which suits you the best.\n\nHere are some of my Pro/Contra Points:\n\nPro:\n-Good PC Port from the Consoles\n-Variety of many Characters\n-Awesome Rock/Metal Music\n-Voiced Story Mode\n-All Stages from Slash/#Reload Revision are included (must be unlocked through Story Mode)\n-Good Game Mechanics\n-Network Mode! (#R has only Fanmade Network Mode)\n-Latest Revision with new Moves and Balancing for all Characters\n\nContra:\n-Slightly higher Frame Delay than the #R PC Version (5F while #R has 2F set)\n-Slash/#Reload Stages can only be used Offline and not in Network Mode\n-Announcer and some Voices of the Characters (for Example: Baiken has now the Voice of an old Grandma, etc.) are poorly redone. They were better in the Old pre Accent Core Revisions.\n-Network Mode is suboptimal at Times (It uses Frame Delay Input and not GGPO which is faster but has also its own Flaws)\n-Steep Learning Curve while progressing\n-Not much Players online depending on Times. Check the "Find Player" Thread in the GGAC+R Steam Forum for Players in your Region\n\nThat's all. KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE!\nAbayo...","July 10, 2015","true","122.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike its release on PS3, the PC version can be made compatible with 4:3 screens like CRTs, which is important because it is a native 480p game. In that respect the PS3 version was actually a downgrade from the previous PS2 title, Accent Core Plus, because it scaled everything up to 720p and forced you to use sidebars of some kind.\n\nI would definitely recommend this over any of the console ports. The PC is compatible with more arcade sticks than any other platform, and you can run the game with any kind of display, which makes streaming and recording a breeze.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a much more difficult game to master than BlazBlue or the newer Guilty Gear, Xrd. There are certain moves that require precision on the order of two or three frames, which is a very small interval at 60FPS. The era of internet play, wireless controllers, and laggy LCDTVs has made GGXXAC+R less relevant in the mainstream, but for shoulder-to-shoulder play, it simply cannot be beat.","May 31, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike its release on PS3, the PC version can be made compatible with 4:3 screens like CRTs, which is important because it is a native 480p game. In that respect the PS3 version was actually a downgrade from the previous PS2 title, Accent Core Plus, because it scaled everything up to 720p and forced you to use sidebars of some kind.\n\nI would definitely recommend this over any of the console ports. The PC is compatible with more arcade sticks than any other platform, and you can run the game with any kind of display, which makes streaming and recording a breeze.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a much more difficult game to master than BlazBlue or the newer Guilty Gear, Xrd. There are certain moves that require precision on the order of two or three frames, which is a very small interval at 60FPS. The era of internet play, wireless controllers, and laggy LCDTVs has made GGXXAC+R less relevant in the mainstream, but for shoulder-to-shoulder play, it simply cannot be beat.","May 31, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since the Mechanics to explain can fill entire Pages, i recommend visiting the Dustloop Wiki for more Infos.\n\nBesides the Mechanics, also the Characters and the Music (made both by Daisuke Ishiwatari) contributed to the huge success of this Series. It is easy to say that it belongs to the Top 3 of Fighting Games (Tekken, SF and GG)\n\nAccent Core as a Revision was also completely redone with new Looks (GUI, Menus, Character Portraits, etc.) and also the Voicing of all Characters are remade. Since Core Plus there is also a new Story Mode (2 Paths for each Char except Justice, Kliff and Holy Order Sol) and the R Revision received a brand new GUI which replaced that of Accent Core.\n\nAs a Side Note, BlazBlue is also made by ARCsys (Only Music made by Daisuke) and shares some Mechanics but hasn't the same Depth.\n\nIt offers many Modes such as a Story Mode, Missions, Survival, etc.\nThe Story Mode is recommended to grasp the Personalities of the Characters and to see which suits you the best.\n\nHere are some of my Pro/Contra Points:\n\nPro:\n-Good PC Port from the Consoles\n-Variety of many Characters\n-Awesome Rock/Metal Music\n-Voiced Story Mode\n-All Stages from Slash/#Reload Revision are included (must be unlocked through Story Mode)\n-Good Game Mechanics\n-Network Mode! (#R has only Fanmade Network Mode)\n-Latest Revision with new Moves and Balancing for all Characters\n\nContra:\n-Slightly higher Frame Delay than the #R PC Version (5F while #R has 2F set)\n-Slash/#Reload Stages can only be used Offline and not in Network Mode\n-Announcer and some Voices of the Characters (for Example: Baiken has now the Voice of an old Grandma, etc.) are poorly redone. They were better in the Old pre Accent Core Revisions.\n-Network Mode is suboptimal at Times (It uses Frame Delay Input and not GGPO which is faster but has also its own Flaws)\n-Steep Learning Curve while progressing\n-Not much Players online depending on Times. Check the "Find Player" Thread in the GGAC+R Steam Forum for Players in your Region\n\nThat's all. KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE!\nAbayo...","July 10, 2015","true","122.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was a fantastic fighting game for its time. It outclassed Street Fighter IV, Mortal Kombat vs. DC, and was on par with the likes of BlazBlue and KoF 13.\n\nHowever, unfortunately, the game of 26 characters and hard-to-master, yet competitive and fun gameplay, is now outdated somewhat, as Guilty Gear Xrd SIGN has come to the market for a reasonable price of $33 CAD. But, if you can't afford that game, are a GG collector, or if you want the pure nostalgia this game brings, it's for you. Also, it's a better purchase at just $17 CAD.\n\n+PROS+\n+Great storyline, it's very unique to its competitors and has a multiple choice outcome\n+The sprites are fantastic, and look like they've jumped out of an anime, at a good framerate and 720p graphics, they're great to go along with the menus, stages, and life bars\n+Netcode is great, if you can find somebody to play with\n+Unique roster of characters, such as Sol (typical fighting game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, has a sword to make him cooler), Ky (police officer, except French, not stereotypical, and has a sword), Jam (a girl who works a restaraunt joint, has a build you'd cream your pants over), Chipp (American, but he's a wannae Japanese ninja, still cool), and Bridget (crossdressing nun kid who can kick your pedophilic ♥♥♥ with his yo-yos)\n\n-CONS-\n-The game is outdated with the release of Xrd\n-A nonexistent amount of people play this game online nowadays\n-Using sprites, some people say that the game is 'outclassed' for its time; I don't neccesarily agree with this since it's the way the devs wanted it to be\n-Too many storylines to complete, they also overlap and it starts to get boring\n-Gameplay is extremely difficult to master, if you play online with noob status, you'll most likely get sent to hell and back\n\nIn the long run, if this were earlier in 2015, I'd give it a 94/100, but since it's getting older, I'm gonna give this, albeit fantastic game, an 86/100.","December 22, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Odds are, if you're even on this store page outside of a recommendation, you've already played this ages-old game, and are looking to play it again. Do it.\n\nGuilty Gear is a well established fighting game series which comes to us from Arc System Works, veterans of the genre. Both their other franchise BlazBlue as well as Guilty Gear have much to offer. Characters are extremely well designed, with each one boasting their own select set of skills and moves. The best part of Guilty Gear, and the feature that sets it well apart from other fighting games, is the balance of the fighters. Nearly every game I play with friends ends up with one of us on a pixel left of health by the end of the match. This makes the fights feel EXTREMELY intense, and any game that can actually get my heart going is a game I'm interested in. Button mashing isn't enough, and you'll come to learn all sorts of new techniques and mechanics as you play.\n\nHIGHLY recommended for ANY fan of fighting games.","July 14, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
