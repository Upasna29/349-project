The main premise of the game is that you must find out what has happened to your family, while exploring the enormous mansion. Along the way, you'll discover a backstory about your character's sister named Sam, and her relationship with a girl named Lonnie (yes-love it or hate it-the central characters are lesbians). I must admit, while I was playing, I was excited to see what would happen to Lonnie and Sam.\n\nYou play by walking around and examining objects by clicking on them (I liked the ability to rotate objects to see every little detail on them). Set in 1995, this game has tons of references to pop-culture from that time (my favorite is the X-files reference). Keep in mind that there are no enemies or scary pop-ups throughout the entire game (excluding one somewhat creepy easter egg with a cross). I personally didn't find this bad at all. In fact, I felt that the night-time atmosphere without having to worry about any pop-ups contributed to helping me enjoy the game for all that it had. Being able to look at all of the small objects is my favorite part of the game. Mainly because there are a ton of notes (which usually have something to do with the story) to read, or because the retro objects are just fun to look at.\n\nOne of the main criticisms that people have with this game is it's length. It's a rather short game which you can beat in less than 2 hours. While this is one of the biggest problems with this game, it's not as bad as you think it is (well, depending on who you are). I spent my time on my playthrough [as mentioned before] looking at all of the objects in the game, and also looking for the tapes that explained more of Sam's backstory. But to be honest, once I was finished looking at all of those cute objects and beating the game, I had very little reason to play through the game again. It was nice while it lasted, but unfortunately, this may not please most people. So if you're reading this, let me give you a message: if you don't like exploration type games where you just observe objects and don't fight any enemies, stop reading this and don't even buy this game (everyone else, read on).\n\nBut without a doubt, the biggest fault with this game is the the price tag: $19.99. While I enjoyed this game on my first playthrough, $20 for such a small game is just flatout robbery. If you're really interested in this game, I suggest that you get it when it goes on sale, because $20 is really not worth it in my opinion.\n\n\nSo to sum it up: Gone Home is a nice game to play. It has an interesting story that is worth playing for, and exploring the 90's themed house just fills me with a special feeling that I've never had before. But in the end, it suffers from being incredibly overpriced, and the fact that most people can beat the game really quickly. For those reasons, I can not recommend this game to any normal gamer. HOWEVER, if this game is on sale, I would give it a try.","January 28, 2014","false","2.0"," 1,236 of 1,623 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","236","1","0","41"

Due to this I decided to give indie developer Fullbright's title a whirl. After having played through the game though, I found out how overhyped this game truly is. It didn't come close to what some of these critics were claiming it was. They acted as if it was something turely amazing and worthy of title game of the year. Let me tell you here first, It is by no means worthy of such a prestigious title like that. It's actually an insult to the gaming industry for it to even be considered for game of the year in my opinion.\n\nThe only thing you even do in this so-called "game" is walk throughout a house looking for clues/specific items that when interacted with will trigger voice recordings from Kaitlin's "missing" sister. When the recordings are triggered they will give you some small backstory on your sister and they will also give you a hint as to where you can find the next clue/item. This is what the entire game consists of and it became repetitious rather quickly. It got so repetitious to the point where the game became a chore to complete.\n\nNow repetitious gameplay isn't Gone Homes only flaw, It also has a terribly uneventful conclsuion. Before I go on to talk about that though, let me give you a brief premise of the story first. You play as Kaitlin Greenbriar who returns home to find her parents house empty. Her mom, dad, and sister are all no where to be found. YOU and only YOU must find out what happened to her family.\n\nNow that we're all caught up, let's talk about the games uneventful conclusion I spoke of. Obvious SPOILERS ahead. So it turns out Kaitlin's mom and dad are not actually missing but happen to be on a camping trip while she decides to return home. So it's just a case of she's at the wrong place, at the wrong time. Very captivating ending so far right?  So if something so interesting is going on with Kaitlin's parents something equally as interesting must be happening to her adorable little sister as well right?  Well, let's dive right into it. The reason Kaitlin's sister is no where to be found is because she decided to run away while her parents were on their camping trip due to her being in a homosexual relationship in which they didn't approve of. Yes, she ran away with her girlfriend and also decided to drop out of high school to live happily ever after in La La Land. How anyone can find this to be a good conclusion to a mytstery title is beyond me.This ending left me so unsatisfied. It is just so bland, boring, and anticlimactic. The ending did not pay off, plain and simple. I have watched episodes of Scooby Doo with more interesting endings than this for crying out loud.\n\nI truely believe the ending to this game is the entire reason Gone Home got any recognition from the critics. It really has to be because this game surely does not have reviting gameplay. It got the recognition and universal praise simply because it tackled a controversial subject like homosexuality. The ending to Gone Home  just me left exremely unsatisfied and nothing more. How so many critics thought the ending was "great" will alawys be a mystery to me. It just angers me that critics were most likely praising Gone Home  just because it tackled a controversial subject all while they ignore the games biggest problem, repititious uneventful gameplay.\n\nNow this game left me disappointed in many ways but what I am disappointed by the most though is that this game could have been truely great if it went in more interesting direction. Gone Home had a truely great atmosphere, it really did. There were creeks, faint creepy voices, and thunderstrkes that would all occur as you would walk throughout the house finding the clues. The first half of the game even hinted at the paranormal and seemed as if it were going to go in a completely different more interesting direction. However, instead of taking full advantage of the great atmopshere and making this a great mystery title Fullbright decided to go with an uninteresting teenage love story. It really saddens me.\n\nSo in conclusion I somewhat enjoyed the beginning of Gone Home due to its a great atmosphere but the games unintersting ending and its very repetitive gameplay left me throughly disappointed. So in humble opinion this game isn't worth buying by any means. It definitly isn't worth the $20 price tag that's for sure.\n\nTL;DR: This game has very repetitious gameplay, has a very anticlimactic uninteresting ending, and is terribly overrated by critics.

I also purchased the game via the Humble Bundle and have played it all the way through. It took about 2 hours, so please excuse my Steam playtime.)\n\nSuffers from a bad case of the Eight Deadly Words. "I Don't Care What Happens To These People."\n\nI dislike leaving negative reviews on Steam products, especially for games like Gone Home. It's not an awful game, by any means. But I certainly didn't enjoy it either. Honestly, I wish Steam had an "Ehhhhh" option with a yellow, wiggly, indecisive hand for its icon 'cause that's how I feel right now.\n\nI've got no objections to the gameplay (or lackthereof) in Gone Home. In fact there was something about being left on my own in such a detailed environment that I rather enjoyed. Rather than having puzzles in the traditional adventure game sense, the challenge of the game comes from piecing together the jigsaw-puzzle of a plot from the environment. Despite not having any mechanics to enforce progression (such as conventional puzzles), it still feels like you're accomplishing things.\n\nNaturally this comes with a trade off: if you aren't interested in the details, then you're not gonna enjoy Gone Home.\n\nBut I think my biggest problem with Gone Home is that the atmosphere of the game just doesn't match the story. You arrive home late one night to find your house empty. There's a distraught message left on the answering machine, a note from your sister pleading your character not to "go snooping like [she] always does", and a turned-on TV playing a severe storm warning on repeat. All in all, it feels like the setup to a horror story, or at least a tragedy. I thought that something happened, something terrible, and caused whoever was at home at the time to leave in a hurry.\n\nIn reality, nothing even remotely tragic happened. The reality of the situation was a teenage romance story that, for me at least, bordered on glurge[tvtropes.org].\n\n...Admittedly, I am not in the target demographic for love stories so I might be biased in that regard. But moving on.\n\nGone Home builds up a tense atmosphere, then doesn't do a whole lot with it. Presumably the "worst-case scenario" buildup was meant to make the main love story plotline feel like a relief, but it just doesn't work. Sam's narration throughout the game also detracts from the mood. Her stories contain very little conflict and are, to be honest, pretty sappy.\n\nThe entire narration mechanic just baffles me, honestly. Why bother letting Sam narrate her life story when you're just gonna rifle through her journal anyhow?\n\nThat said, the game is not totally without its charm. The object tooltips ("Grab Cup", "Read Note", etc) often changed to more personal observations ("Sam had this when she was like four" for a folder, "Gosh, Dad" for a dirty magazine, etc), which was a touch of detail that I absolutely adored. Even though the protagonist was silent for most of the game, it still felt like I was playing as a character with a personality. But these moments were few and far between, and the main character might as well have been faceless for what a pitifully tiny role she played in the plot.\n\nTL;DR: this game is... somewhat enjoyable, but there's just not enough good parts for me to be able to recommend it.","October 15, 2014","false","0.1"," 992 of 1,340 people (74%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","74","992","1","11","27"

Considering that the game has a retail price of $19.99 and yet can be beaten in just over an hour is a little absurd in my mind. That being said, I've been hearing mixed reviews on this game and I'm a sucker for a good story, so I bit the bullet and picked it up when it was discounted.\n\nI could not wait to play, turned off all the lights, put on my headphones and started up the game. The atmosphere in this game is really creepy and well done. There were so many times I felt someone was right next to me and I really started getting spooked out. Sadly, that ends what I enjoyed from the game. There are so few times I don't enjoy a video game story, but this was one of them. From the very beginning it was obvious what the big twist was going to be. I thought because of that, it had to be something else so I was excited to continue. When I found out I was right all along, I was quite disappointed.\n\nI can see why this has been getting mixed reviews, and I commend Full Bright for trying something different. Sadly in this case, the game just fell flat for me. I was really hoping I would fall on the 10/10 side of the discussion, for I hate being negative about video games. The game is hit or miss in my mind, so even though I don't recommend it, you may still enjoy it!

It's an interactive short story, and I do mean short. The script for the written notes and spoken dialog probably wouldn't amount to more than 10 pages. The characters are very broadly sketched with only the smallest hints of depth and complexity. The focus of the narrative is a really pretty mundane love story which presents little in the way of surprise.\n\nWhat Gone Home does well though is provide a powerful injection of 100% pure, high grade nostalgia directly into the bloodstream. Nostalgia both for childhood and adolescence in general and the 1990s in particular. A story for the ages this is not. A story for people who were teenagers in 1995? Yes. Maybe.\n\nThe writing is good and the voice actor who played Sam did an excellent job. That, coupled with the introspective and tender mood, is enough to carry you through at least one playthrough (80 minutes for me). That said, there's certainly no reason to play again. In fact, when you start looking back over the experience you begin to resent the numerous red herrings whose sole purpose seemed to be to obscure the real focus of the story for as long as possible.\n\nIn the end I found Gone Home to be atmospheric and touching in a simplistic way, but also fundamentally shallow. The asking price of $19.99 is way, way too high. I'd recommend purchasing only when a big sale comes along, and then only if you're a fan of this genre of entertainment.","November 27, 2013","false","1.5"," 1,874 of 2,653 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","874","2","0","26"

Not like Myst or Shadowgate, but like a first person shooter where you can walk around like Dear Esther or Half Life 2 without the guns. If you like to explore, read notes, listen to audio journals and be immersed in a fiction you might enjoy it. The basic premise is that you're in an empty house and you need to discover why. There's no real emphasis on why, you just explore. The house has a history to it and so do the characters you'll hear about. You'll never see the characters outside of a photo here and there. Heck you never even see yourself outside of a passport. There might be 3+ bathrooms in this house but there are no mirrors.\n\nThe story is set in 1995 and while I'm not into story, the developers did a good job of presenting it as immerse as they could. You'll hear 90s punk music, find Super Nintendo cartridges and see plenty VHS movie names. It hinges heavily on 90s nostalgia and lesbians. Most of what you will find goes through a history of a teenager's love interest with another young woman. There are side stories such as the house's history and the previous owner's death.\n\nThe house is pretty open from the start, you are able to explore freely with very little limitations. You'll find secret paths, compartments, visit several rooms, turn on dozens of lights, read notes, listen to well voiced audio journals and examine things, but never really do anything with them. You can open doors, throw objects and put them back. Again, your job is to discover what happened. Unravel the story. The only real challenge is to find half hidden notes under couches, keys and combinations to locks and safes. There is no way to lose, you will get through Gone Home if you keep going.\n\nThere is no run button, just walk, look, crouch and zoom in. Again, its an exploration experience. In the menu you have a map of visited rooms, a list of journal entries, and a small inventory that you don't really need. You just collect keys. Its not like you need to see the keys, because the game recognizes that you have them when you look at a door.\n\nGone Home is over in under 2 hours and that was with me exploring and reading everything. It is an easy sit through and play, but for $20 there is no way I can recommend it. Even for $10. It is interactive fiction, with zero replay value.","September 9, 2014","false","1.5"," 473 of 689 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","473","689","0","7"

Gone Home is a first-person exploration game taking place inside a single abandoned house filled with the memorabialia of its former inhabitants . You pick up objects and examine them for clues as to how to proceed. You'll read through lots of notes, scrapbooks, and other pieces of written material, which will serve as clues/puzzle pieces as well as convey details about the story. Picking up certain objects or entering certain rooms will trigger a voiceover which also explains the story to you. The interface is similar to the Amnesia and Penumbra games, in that you'll use the mouse to pick up and rotate objects, as well as close or open doors, closets, and drawers as you rummage through the house. It's well put together but by the time you get to the end of it you'll really feel like you've wasted your time. The story doesn't develop much, and since you're uncovering snippets of information about something which has happened in the past, there isn't a lot of impact here. You as the player don't have a role in the story - you're a passive observer and there is nothing for you to actually *do* besides trying to figure out what happened.\n\nThis game has received a lot of attention, both positive and negative, and a lot has been written about it. At this point it seems like most people are playing it just so that they can feel like they have an informed opinion about it. If you're one of those people who needs to know what "Gone Home" is all about, then sure, go ahead and play it since it's relatively short anyway. For everyone else; don't waste your time. It doesn't work as a game and as a work of art it's shallow and feels insincere.","October 31, 2014","false","3.5"," 489 of 715 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","489","715","2","2"

I must give credit for the great voiceacting, though, the actress who voiced Sam did a pretty fantastic job throughout.\n\nFurthermore, it annoyed me immensely that a lot of the clues are found in highly illogical places, it complete breaks immersion for me to think that someone would leave information of a certain nature in a highly visible place, or that notes that are decades old would still be found where they would surely have either been destroyed, or removed by the persons living in the house.\n\nThis is even more compounded by the fact that the developers have done a pretty good job of making the house seem very real, more or less all drawers, closets, microwaves etc. can be opened to search for clues, but then again, this was most probably done to further the longevity of the game, you spend a lot of time opening stuff that have no items of interest in them.\n\nAll in all, I can't really recommend this game, its an interesting way to tell a story, and if the story had been better, it could really have been an experience, but as it is, this game should in no way be a contender for a GotY title.","December 22, 2013","false","2.4"," 1,303 of 1,975 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","303","1","0","20"

However, if you have ~3 hours to devote to navigating a well developed environment, with tons of details and a good story to tell, then this may be for you.\n\nThere are no weapons, puzzles, or dialogue options.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solarflare/recommended/232430/","solarflare","squiddingme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solarflare/","169 products in account","Gone Home is a fairly straightforward game. Through a standard first person control scheme, you are Kaitlin Greenbriar, eldest sister in the Greenbriar family, back from an extended European holiday only to find the Greenbriar family home utterly empty. The crux of the game is uncovering the mystery behind the disappearance of Kaitlin's family.\n\nSPOILERS BELOW. YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED. IT'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING GROUNDBREAKING OR WORTH KEEPING A SECRET, THOUGH.\n\nGone Home's story is innately personal, which is why it ultimately feels hollow to witness it through the weird, voyeuristic second-hand experience of sorting through notes, filtering for meaningful information. Occasionally uncovering a milestone piece of information results in a narrated excerpt from Sam's diary, which frankly feels a little bit like cheating since the vast majority of Sam's story arc unfolds through these excerpts, rather than the notes.\n\nSam and Lonnie's relationship is the primary story arc of the game. It evolves from a subtext-laden friendship to a romance around the half-way point. I am nothing but sympathetic for this kind of thing; and it did hit me hardest when Sam described her mother, Janice Greenbriar, insisting that Sam was going through a "phase", "did not know what she wanted", and "just needed to meet the right guy", but this isn't a story about runaway lesbian teenagers, it's a story about an observer finding out about runaway lesbian teenagers after the fact.\n\nThis also isn't to mention the story arcs for the other characters--Terry's writing career, his obsession with the JFK assassination, his dead-end job as a hi-fi hardware reviewer, his alcoholism, and his wife's unfaithfulness--are more interesting than the relationship between Sam and Lonnie.\n\nGone Home's limited interactivity and 90s culture nostalgia aesthetic don't quite fill the gaps in a story loaded with cliches. In another medium, Gone Home wouldn't be considered anything remarkable. It also suffers from outdated visuals and poor engine optimization (pretty much the entire house is loaded into memory, physics objects and all).\n\nIt's important that as the video game industry reaches a larger audience and matures, we must also understand where mature criticism is necessary, where not to lump blind praise, and where to hold a game to the same standards that everyone else receives. I do not think Gone Home's praise is deserved, but I do not think its hate is either.\n\nGone Home is an interesting experiment in taking the kind of environmental storytelling dating all the way back to System Shock to its furthest conclusion, but not much more than that (and I feel a little insulted that the first number code in the game is 0451).","October 8, 2015","false","3.8"," 373 of 555 people (67%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","67","373","555","15","14"

Surely, some people might enjoy this interactive museum, but I cannot help but feel like it could never ever be wirth 20 bucks. My recommendation could have been different had the price been as well.\nTo make it clear - this is a story that can certainly resonate with certain people, however the price makes it not worth too try and find out whether you are one of those people or not.\n\nThis is a poor man's Penumbra; the game has 2 primary ways of conveying the plot (for what it's worth - more on that later) - audial diaries and various letters spread about in the house. A diary entry plays in the background each time the player finds the next plot clue, and is then added to the player's library/journal, from where they can play the recording again or read the transcript. Other than that, the house is full of various letters and cards, which can be read if so desired. The content will provide for 2 hours of play time, if explored fully.\n\nThe aforementioned house is, by the way, the only location in this game. It's not very large, but has enough dark corners to make the player revisit some rooms; mostly, however, all the clues are pretty straightforward and won't require any particular pixel-hunting.\nThe environments not very interactive, as the most a player can do is move several small objects (which represent no plot value most of the time) around. With the exclusion of a few exceptions, all interactivity boils down to opening doors, reading letters sticked on surfaces, and turning the lights on. The amount of objects that had any relevant information on them that required examining in 3D can be counted in single digits; for the record - there is an option in this game to rotate some objects in all 3 axis.\n\nThe plot mainly consists of one main storyline about a girl (main character's sister). There is also a branch going into the stories of the rest of the family - the writer father, the mother and her colleague ♥♥♥♥, and finally her mysterious brother the pharmacist. There is not much to be gathered all in all, but these branches do provide for a nice distraction from an otherwise monotonous story.\nIt is hard to comment on the main story itself without going into spoilers (there are not much to be made however). It cannot brag with clever twists or an ability to create a strong emotional bond, even though there were a few unexpected moments. The ending is particularly dissatisfying - it does not solve any problems raised during the game and just reaches an easy deus-ex-machina conclusion, if such strong terms can even be applied in such case.\nSpeaking of the social commentary side of the plot, there is not much to be either. There is only 1, perhaps two moments where some societal problems are pointed out. That is fair enough - but no further commentary has been made on these topics. Even the reaction of the characters isn't described with more than 2 paragraphs of text.\n\nThe graphics are relatively stylised, yet it can still be often seen how poor they are. This game is in many ways comparable to Dear Esther, and the latter has done a much better job at visuals.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the game is quite glitchy. I got stck at one point because, despite having a key to the next stage, so to say, I wasn't able to open an appropriate door. I tried restarting the game, only to see the "New Game" button - my save file didn't like my hard drive, apparently. Having turned to the forums, this seemed to have been a pretty widespread issue.\nFurthermore, objects sometimes would glitch when picked up, and not be displayed.\nGladly in Gone Home it is easy to reach a previously achieved point in the plot, so even after losing my save file I wasn't set back too far.\n\nAll in all, I must say that even thuogh I wasn't bored to the point of quitting the game halfway in, yet that is only due to my having nothing to do at the time. Your time is much better spent playing other games, including indie ones - it is very easy to find a better way to spend your time. If you are interested in such an interactive museum type of game, I suggest you try Dear Esther, which had managed the implementation of it much better. Finally, there is always Bastion with its narration - though that would require more actual gameplay.","October 28, 2014","false","3.2"," 352 of 531 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","352","531","2","2"

There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it.

It really wasn't very good and I got it in a humble bundle thankfully. If I had actually paid for this, I would not be at all happy. The game starts out with lots of tension, suspense, and mystery but ultimately boils down into a sappy, under developed story that was hardly worth the time it took to bait out. I enjoyed the atmosphere of this game, which was kind of creepy, but that is about all it has going for it.\n\nThere is literally zero gameplay, all you do is walk around the house. You can pick up items and inspect them, but this is hardly even useful and some of the plot points are redundant enough that you don't even need to inspect items, just read letters.\n\nAt first I thought the tags were a joke, but honestly, this isn't a game, it really is a "walking simulator". And that is coming from a guy who absolutely loved little inferno (another game with less developed gameplay elements).\n\nAll in all, you would be wise to skip this one, it is really a snooze fest.

It would be different the game was impactful and deep and visually beautiful like brothers a tale of two sons (which was also very short), but this game has absolutely no redeeming qualities to make up for its short duration, lack of gameplay, $20 pricetag, and lackluster story.\n\n4/10 They tried.","October 24, 2014","false","2.3"," 426 of 654 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","426","654","3","1"

Suffice it to say, these critics are indeed correct―overwhelmingly so.\n\nIgnoring common sense and logic, I purchased this game in the offshoot chance that I’d experience, at the very least, a reverberation of emotion.\n\n(Spoilers ahead.)\n\nThe player controls Kaitlin 'Katie' Greenbriar, who incidentally returns from her overseas trip in Amsterdam to an abandoned château in rural Oregon. A presumably Methodist household, you are also introduced through various letters and business cards, your parents, Terrence and Janice Greenbriar. Terry is a failed author dabbling in mediocre political thrillers about JFK. He opts instead to write album reviews for a Home Theater aficionado magazine. Jan is a senior conservationist working at the local Forestry service. Her dedication to her career leads to estrangement from her family, leading her and Terry to leave that week for counseling.\n\nKatie also has a younger sister, Samantha, a fiery, sharp-tongued teenage writer who sends you on an 'adventure' to see where she’s inexplicably waddled off to. Wonderful.\n\nWhat follows is a menial tour of a well-designed dollhouse. Expect opening and closing doors, turning on lamps and other fixtures, searching over and under floorboards in an attempt to discover― a plot. Immersion is a touted feature by many reviewers, but not once have I felt immersed in the nostalgia-filled world of '95. All the proclivities and details in these rooms are offset by their distractingly mindboggling placements. (Tell me, who in their right mind would leave private letters randomly scattered all around their house?)\n\nThe plot revolves around your sister and her acceptance of being hopelessly in love with Lonnie, an army brat and oddly enough, a rebellious punk rocker. They go to costume parties and riot grrl concerts, dye their hair, and protest patriarchy in all forms. Eventually, they kiss and thus sets the stage for their ill-fated Shakespearean tragedy. This not-so-subtle progression of sappy lesbian love is doled out over a painful length of an hour and a half.\n\nThen the game just ends. Lonnie elopes with Sam, abandoning her duties as a servicewoman and wanders listlessly throughout the New English coast. A misplaced hodgepodge of saccharine, sentimentalist music swells over the credits to provide a supposed, illusionary feeling of a heartfelt and revelatory experience.\n\nIf you’re going to make a narrative-driven 'game' about the characters, make sure we actually get to know them first. Not through what we’re told about them, but through actual experiences that the character, as well as you and I, experience. Real emotional connections are possible in games, but not through the use of force or tedium. This trend of masturbatory, preachy kitsch (Dear Esther, BioShock Infinite, Dream) should be quickly stamped out and be replaced with games of genuine heart and depth. Don't give these hacks your hard-earned money.","December 27, 2013","false","2.3"," 1,071 of 1,714 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","071","1","0","43"

I smelled "a game for the critics" art experiment.\n\nI'm fine with short games. I'm fine with stories with little to no actual gameplay. I'm fine with short stories with no actual gameplay if the story is any good. This is not a good story. It's hard to explain exactly why without spoiling anything, so I will put the spoiler at the end.\n\nThe thing about this game is that it's built entirely on false dread. It tries very very hard to make you believe there's supernatural horror elements at work. The official blurb describes it as a mystery. Within the first minute of gameplay, you find a note on the front door begging you to not find the missing people and mysterious answering machine messages of some frantically sobbing girl. Written notes of mysterious shadows, possible ghost sightings, flickering lights, haunted house histories, and other stuff.\n\nThis all turns out to phoney red herrings. The ending is one big "LOL just kidding" and you feel ripped off. If you took away all the false dread, no one would finish the game because the actual story is just too boring. Stories can be very effective with red herrings, tone shifts, and subverting expectations, but in Gone Home's case it's all just so tacked on and phoney. The supernatural mystery elements desperately wave their arms around like a rodeo clown trying to distract you from the fact that it's all just a mundane story about dumb teenagers.\n\nThe one thing the game does well is recreating a house of the mid 90s. I think this is where a lot of the praise comes from as critics were suckered in by cheap nostalgia thrills of seeing Street FIghter II references, Super Nintendo games, VHS libraries, X-Files posters, and Riot Grrrl fliers. Maybe the game's creators have a bright future in retro interior decorating, but not in writing or game-making.\n\n$20 is insane for this. $5 would have been about right if the ending didn't leave you feeling cheated. I can only recommend this game if you want to spend $5 (no more) for a virtual 90s household simulator.\n\n\nSPOILER: So you find out very early on that your sister is a lesbian and took her new best friend from school as a lover. Fine, whatever. I thought Brokeback Mountain and Blue is the Warmest Color were very well done movies so I have no problem with a homosexual love story. Gone Home is not a good story. Whereas Brokeback and BitWC focused on the conflicts of the relationship, Gone Home just rolls around in it like a pig in the mud. There's no meaningful conflict to it and the end makes nothing of the fact that Sam just threw away her 75% scholarship and her girlfriend is now a wanted felon for going AWOL. It's like a more ridiculous veresion of the ending to The Graduate, and even that movie acknowledged the end as farce. It's manipulative, it's dishonest, and it avoids any conflict because the authors seem to think that giving lesbian characters or relationships any flaws would make them bigots rather than human.\n\nJust go watch Blue is the Warmest Color for a much better version of the same story. You get to see meaningful conflicts and a more honest look at relashionships that explores the ups AND the downs. The movie also features exactly as much gameplay as Gone Home, and won't cost $20.","February 15, 2014","false","2.7"," 675 of 1,075 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","675","1","0","13"

Most of the major video game websites (i.e. IGN, Kotaku, etc) gave it a 10/10, and/or stated Gone Home was a, "must play." The fact that Gone Home could be beaten within a time span of 2-3 hours got my attention, and even though I'm not much of a horror/thriller fan, I decided I wanted to put my mettle to the test.\n\nIt's amazing how our current generation of gaming no longer needs a 30-60 hour play through to give us some emotional experience or meaningful thought.  I love Journey, the Unfinished Swan is good for all ages, and who would argue against Telltale's Walking Dead series? Unfortunately, Gone Home is not that memorable: it's a game with the facade of a haunted house, but it's only when you reach the end do you feel the disappointment and general weakness.  Gone Home (without spoiling too much) acts as more of a "Dear Diary..." than Amnesia or Slender.  Sure Gone Home has the classic setting of an empty cabin in the woods during a thunderstorm, but the ending is a bait-and-switch that tries to shoe-horn in something corny, than something a little more scary--an actual poltergeist or serial killer would've been a welcomed site.\n\nI bought Gone Home for $20, and I've regretted it ever since.  Gone Home isn't even worth a Steam sale.  If you really want play it, find someone who bought into the hype (like me) and ask to play it off of their Steam account or PC.  Trust me, you'll save some money, and you can thank me for it later.","November 26, 2013","false","5.4"," 248 of 387 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","248","387","0","5"

That probably will not surprise anyone, but I feel it is an important distinction to make. Not being a teenage girl, "Gone Home" does not resonate with me in any way. Hell, it doesn't even resonate with me despite the fact that - once upon a time, back when dinosaurs still roamed the earth - I was a teenager.\n\nUnfortunately, this rather trite tale of a lost girl's discovery of her own sexuality requires you to emphasize with her plight. I suppose it is all sort of touching in a way, but it is not a particularly riveting story, especially given her otherwise sheltered upbringing. And it certainly does not make for an interesting game, or whatever "Gone Home" is supposed to be. There's something to be said for the slow and methodical exploration of her (unrealistically spacious) home, but it also feels rather mechanical as you scour the rooms for clues. I suppose voyeurs might appreciate the ability to stick their fingers into every closet and crevice, but I don't even like looking in the medicine cabinets at my friend's house, much less poking through the virtual belongings of a strange family.\n\nMuch fuss has been made about how "accurately" the game represents mid-90s Americana, but that's not very hard to achieve. Keeping dates on a wall calendar or scribbling notes on scraps of paper are hardly long-lost arcana (I only tossed my mix-tapes a couple years ago). Heck, the lack of any computers in such a well-to-do household as presented in the game is actually an incongruity; by 1995, almost everyone I knew had a computer in their house already. I suppose for pre-teens the '90s may seem like some exotic far-away land, but for most gamers (average age: 36 and rising), waxing nostalgic about the 90s makes about as much sense as reminiscing about last Tuesday's lunch.\n\nI get that "Gone Home" is intended to be more mood piece than game, more art than entertainment. It follows in the footsteps of games like "Anna" and "Dear Esther". And as an experiment intended to take virtual worlds in new directions, away from the ordinary run-n-gun format of our Call of Duty and Elder Scrolls games. But both as a story and an experience, the hour-long story of "Gone Home" fails to entertain and captivate, being a dry, lackluster and unrewarding adventure that neither inspired nor evoked any emotion other than yawning ennui.","December 19, 2013","false","1.0"," 179 of 281 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","179","281","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesseguarascia/recommended/232430/","jesseguarascia","Slim Thicc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesseguarascia/","1005 products in account","Games for a very long time have been about fun, enjoyment, a leisurly pass time that people use to escape the harshness of reality, or to acheive something great and experience something unique to them. Recently, though, a lot of game journalists and critics have started to talk about the need for less violent, less action-heavy, and more original games focusing on things we've never seen in games. As a result, games like Gone Home were created to fill the niche people have been looking for. What should have been (and would have been) bottom-of-the-bin indie story games have since become critically acclaimed classics. I'm not one to bash any game, since the creation of more unique games is never a bad thing, but to praise this game among others in the same genre who did it better, is ridiculous.\n\nThis game was basically the almagamation of the perfect parts to create a game that appeals to exactly everything critics were looking for at the time; 2 parts visual novel, 1 part taboo story, and 99 parts contrived. The phrase "oscar-bait" really comes to mind when I think of Gone Home, almost as if it were a paint-by-numbers on how to create a game critics will love for that year. It delivers nothing we haven't seen already, while delivering it in a way that we've seen more than a handful of times, but it was released at just the right time and played by just the right people to get it major acclaim from journalists and critics, something alot of the other games in this genre didn't get.\n\n"Gameplay"\nGone Home is an interesting beast in that it delivers all of it's gameplay in a way that we've seen before, and is still not interesting in this format either. There is no gameplay other than picking up letters, cassette tapes, random household items, and keys (to name a few) and observing them or adding them to your inventory to advance the plot. While observing these objects, you can read the text on a note, or rotate the objects to observe all sides a la L.A. Noire, and sometimes find information like lock combinations and secret locations on the map. In that respect, the game does the minimal investigation very well, but then it faulters over it by placing a million objects in the game that serve no purpose. Since the game has no direct way of really determining what is important, it's just as likely that a three ring binder could have valuable information than a book with some information on it. You could spend a lot of time picking things up hoping to get something important only to find out that everything is pointless to interact with, and only a few key elements are there for any real reason.\n\nUltimately, it's a game that lacks any real interaction, and real mechanical substance, and leaves the player feeling as though they're not being engaged and have 0 agency in the game world they're a part of. All of these facts can be a great way to present an interesting story to the player, one they have no control over and have to experience no matter what decisions they make. Sadly, though, the game doesn't take that opportunity and just creates a bunch of hoops the player has to jump through to experience the rest of the narrative. You have to work for the narrative by way of abitrary hoops, but the game hands you the solutions, then you can continue and "experience" the rest of the narrative. Had they simply added some challenge, some actual thought, something like piecing together clues instead of just having the clues handed to you, there would be a very interesting mechanic in the game that would have really pushed this closer to being a game than a "jump through the hoop to advance the plot" story.\n\nAtmosphere and Story\nGone Home is something that got stuck between being a movie and being a book. As a movie, it would've been terrible since it has nothing of substance for the person to experience other than seeing the character experience something. As a book, it has very little build up and is nothing more than just reading about someone reading some notes with very little internal dialogue and character devleopment outside of the few audio/text logs given by the sister. It delivers it's narrative in a way very few games have before, but is in such a way that no game (or any narrative) should ever be delievered. The story is presented entirely through narrative set pieces, naration by the sister of the main character, and notes scattered through-out the game. As far as I'm aware, story writing 101 is to not give the entirety of your exposition by way of indirect narrative (i.e. something the audience can't actually see occuring). If the game was you playing as the lesbian sister and seeing all of the consequences and making the choices and experiencing the hardships, this could have been a perfect story, and something we truly had never seen in video game format before.\n\nIn terms of atmosphere, this is barely at "visual novel" levels. It has set pieces and locations that can be interpreted as showing off the mood and personality of different characters. Other than the maybe two or three set pieces that really evoke this emotion, there is very little to help visually tell the story other than creating a set-piece to something mentioned in a note or audio log. Something that really broke the immersion (or lack there of) for me, was the fact that there were a million notes scattered through this house that's supposed to be somewhat realistic. No one has that many notes in their house. It's almost as if the house is just a big collection of "ooo look, something from a classic movie that realistically makes no sense"! There's trap doors, walls that just seemingly open up for no reason, and a totally stable cavern under the house that also makes little to no sense in reality. The atmosphere of the game is completely broken when you take the few poorly implemented "gamey" elements that the game tries to include, and apply them to the serious narrative the game tries to put across.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this whole game, and the biggest flaw in it, is the fact that it sets up so many possible scenarios and gives a really tense, almost horror-like feeling. A lot of people have attested the feeling of constant tenseness to the feeling the character has when they arrive home to see a life they know very little about anymore. That would be acceptable if the game was invoking a sense of anything other than tenseness/anxiety. Creating a constant tenseness or minor anxiety for the sake of making a narrative point is just annoying, and results in the player feeling mentally exhausted and getting little payoff for it. Ultimately, the game taking an approach that was the exact ending it seemed to be setting out the whole time seems lazy since it doesn't match up with the eery atmosphere the game was evoking the entire time\n\nConclusion\nWhat it all boils down to is a game that, if it were released any other time, would've been extremely niche, and avoided by a lot of people. It's passable at best, and presents nothing we haven't already seen done better. The atmosphere is confused, the narrative is boring and presented in an extremely unengaging way, and the lack of gameplay leaves the player in an empty "jump-through-the-hoop" scenario to just advance the plot to see if anything interesting ever happens. If you're looking for a game that is a visual novel, I'd aim more towards a game like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons or any Telltale game since they deliver in all of the aspects this game fails to (plot progession by more than arguous tasks, real character connection, a feeling of agency, and a real plot that is more than just some "cute" dialogue between characters). If you can guess the plot of a story game because you've seen the exact same elements in other mediums, then there is something inherently wrong with calling it the game of the year.","January 2, 2015","false","3.1"," 195 of 309 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","195","309","5","0"

It fairly quickly becomes apparent that the creepiness is meant as a misdirect and all those dark empty rooms hold little more than 90's nostalgia and a coming of age story that borrowed a little too heavily from the typical "movie of the week" schtick. Which is an even more apt comparsion considering how little playtime the game offers, because about the length of your average TV movie (minus commercial breaks) is about all you'll get out of this title.\n\nStill, I wouldn't go so far as to the game entirely bad. It may be short and predictable, but the time you do spend playing is mostly enjoyable. But not nearly enough to be worth the price. If you enjoy 90's nostalgia and low intensity exploration then wait until they put this game on sale, if you can catch it under $5 it might be worth the investment.

It tries to tell a moving story, but I really didn't enjoy it. Maybe it's just me, but come on, a 16 years old girl running away with her girlfriend? That's a terrible thing to happen, and not touching at all! I was irresponsible at that age, everyone is, the ending is plain sad. I don't want to sound like a bigot, but think about it, what will happen to them? If Samantha really cared about Lonnie she would have to just let her go. Because losing your 16 years old girlfriend is not a tragedy at all, and i'm sure everyone can agree with that, unless you're still 16. The story the game tells it's actually realistic, in such a situation the two girls could act like they did in the game, but if you're mature enough, you just can't agree with their decision.\nThat's why I didn't enjoy the story, but looks like there's a lot of people who enjoyed it, and maybe I'm wrong.

I decided to ignore all the commentary after that to make sure I had the greatest expereince I could possibly have by preventing myself of reading spoilers and all decussion in general by just ignoring all threads about this game. Has that given me high expectations on the game? Possibly, but I've learned that many of the reviews are extremely mixed on this game. And I can easily understand why.\n\nI wont spoil the story since it does have it's positives, so I'll keep it vague. The story itself is extremely well acted and flows well for an indie game, but the game is extremely linear akin to "Dear Esther" where there isn't any actual gameplay  other than walking from Point-A to Point-B. It is indeed a very relaxing game that requires little to no player requirements other than being able to listen and pick things up occasionally. The story itself is rather bland with a predictable and cliched plot that you can figure out in the first 20 min that only becomes surprising in the last 15 seconds of the game. And even then it's not too surprising. Many of the ingame items are crafted with an extremely high level of detail and flows well into the scenery of the house. But a few times things are placed in a way that make no sense on a proper timeline and are only there to complement the documents scattered about the house. Often having little to no relevance on the plot as a whole.\n\nIs this game bad? No, it's just passable. If you want to sit back, listen to a good (but not great) story for roughly 3 hours of your time. Then go for it, but I can't recommend a price point of anything higher than $5 dollars, which is what I purchased the game at. I still feel slightly burned by the price to enjoyment ratio. But I'll live. The story did have it's good points, it just had too much filler to make it shine. If the game wrapped up it's various plots into one single converging finale this game could be fantastic, but in the end, 90% of the things the game asks you to read are worthless. But that 10% is where the game really shines. It's just a victim of it's own details.","November 27, 2013","false","2.3"," 87 of 132 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","87","132","0","0"

Does that sound like it's worth the price? Gone Home has been sitting on my hard rive for more than a year, and today I learn why.\n\nI'll start with what I liked, since the experience was more like a template to fill something much larger and far more intriguing. The set design was good, as were the object locations. Strange that I should comment about that, but everything makes sense as to where you find it.\n\nOn that note, they do a fantastic job of making this house a home. You really understand people live here and their little quirks and habits are present everywhere. The argument between mother and daughter on the cork board was a nice touch.\n\nThe sound design is also very well done for the atmospheric touch and constantly had me listening to every little bump and creak in as I made my through the house.\n\nI can tell this is a character-driven drama and one that takes the writer's heart and soul, so I'd heavily recommend the writer adapt this to a screenplay or short story. A short film would be a much better use of a subject matter that clearly means so much to the designers.\n\nThus it pains to have to say what I'm about to say.\n\nThis is worth ten dollars, and that's strecthing it. There's NO payoff at the end. The whole time the story is building to something, but the overwhelming majority of all the interesting bits turn out to be mostly red herrings. If I may compare this to Alone in the Dark: the New Nightmare for a second. In that game, there were books worth of story detailing the history of the island, the Morton family, the Abkanis culture and religion, Carnby himself, and even the corrupt Bureau 713. Little of it was actually necessary, but to gain a full understanding and context for the events of the story, you needed to read all of it. In Gone Home, all but one of the characters are dropped, and everyone else had equally interesting stories. The biggest letdown comes about an hour in after you've been expecting a turn to some type of survival horror or even suspense. Instead, I'll give you a nice spoiler I noticed as soon as I started: there is no "run" key.\n\nI'd probably understand who was who better if I had more frequent exposure to character's faces. Instead, I have to fumble with names, and I'm terrible with names alone.\n\nAs you traverse the house in a fashion similar to Castlevania but far more contrived (it's called "padding" ladies and gents) you'll notice the art style actually changes. Later, you'll stumble upon half-eaten potato chip bags with fresh-lock clips. The clips look like they're from a different game altogether with a notable drop in textures and model detail. One thing that threw me on characters was how portraits and photos supposedly showed the people, but each time it was like a different artist rendition. When you first start the game, go to the left side of the stairs and look at the family portrait. Notice how the girls appear to be in a completely different style from the father?\n\nI spent most of my "investigation" wrestling with god-forsaken controls. I ended up spinning several times and getting hung up on doors. Navigating becomes a pain when you need to worry about boxes, which are EVERYWHERE. The game flat out tells you when you need to use certain commands in a given room, almost remosing the need for player input. In order to sift through the multitude of ultimately meaningless documents, post cards and notes, you need to select them on the tables or in the drawers. The "crosshairs" to do this are so specific, you WILL need to hold the little four-pixel dot in the center of your screen over absolutely everything just to make sure you don't miss anything. The "Scooby-Doo Effect" cherished by classic horror fans that told you something was usable is absent, which means opening a drawer does not make it obvious if something is in there you can use or read. You have to 1 be close enough, and 2 carefully move your pointer over every single scrap of paper in the jumbled mess of things in the drawer.\n\nThat's another thing. When you open a door, cabinet, or drawer, you, the character, can actually block the door from opening all the way, creating the illlusion of a jammed door when all you really need to do is step to the side. And here I thought Slender: the Arrival's click-dragging doors was annoying.\n\nThere are no puzzles, minimal characters, about a half-dozen dropped side stories, controls that basically fight you with with a combination of OCD and ADHD, and an ending you see coming a mile away. This game is not worth the price tag and I'm happy I got it on sale last year.","November 14, 2014","false","5.6"," 133 of 210 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","133","210","4","6"

I'm all for LGBT rights; I'm bisexual myself. Gone Home has easily one of the worst stories in a video game I have played to date.\n\nThe game's two cenrtral characters, Sam(antha) and Lonnie, are completely one-dimensional and Lonnie's sole purpose seems to be being loved while Sam is the lover, and the two both seem to have been created to appease the media and Social Justice Warriors. Disgusting. On top of that, the relationship the two get into is almost too perfect, with barely any tension and only mild interference between their parents and Lonnie leaving to join the military. There's the whole "Waaaaaah my parents don't support it!" thing and, again, Lonnie leaving Sam to join the military, which makes Sam sad, but saying that gives the game's love story depth is like saying a kiddie pool can be as deep as the ocean. The mansion you explore is boring and aside from looking for clues left behind by Sam, there's no real point in exploring. You do hear creepy sounds such as creaking or thunder occasionally, but it just seems there to try scaring you. The house remains pretty boring throughout your wandering. To their credit, though, some of the noises did catch me off guard a few times.\n\nThe game also heavily relies on 1990s nostalgia, being set in 1995; cassette tapes (le only 1990s kids remember dis xDDDDDDDDDD) featuring '90s songs are strewn throughout the house and there's even a Super Nintendo with several games, and Sam mentions Street Fighter II several times in her writings. I'm a '90s kid (born 1993) and didn't feel nostalgic about them at all. Mostly because I still own a lot of these things, I don't need a video game to give me nostalgia over the era I grew up in when I'm perfectly capable of giving myself this nostalgia.\n\nOh, and the ending... one of the biggest disappointments in gaming. Basically, Sam runs away from home so she can be with Lonnie forever after Lonnie goes AWOL, just before she goes to Basic Training. Why? Because they wanted to get away from their families and all their troubles and live a perfect life together or some ♥♥♥♥. I don't even care that this is spoiling it, it's just bad.\n\nThis game is just garbage and doesn't deserve the praise it gets from the media. One-dimensional characters with artificial development, a boring house and trying to ride on '90s nostalgia. It's just... ugh. Not worth it.","December 8, 2013","false","1.5"," 122 of 192 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","122","192","0","0"

You play as Kaitlin, a student returning home from world travels to see her family, but nobody is at home. You walk around your empty home, in first-person exploration style and you have to find objects that uncover bits of your family's past.\nThe actual gameplay consists mainly of exploring an environment and checking out every item available. The game is also very short, it can be finished under 3 hours.\nThe graphics are not the greatest, though they get the job done.\nGone Home takes place in 1995 and the sound reflects that. Strewn around the house are cassettes with typical mid-nineties rock on them. Taking into account the main topic of the game, the selected song are very appropriate. There are also some ambient tunes which are there to highlight certain events and plot points. A nicely done effect is that the ever present thunderstorm raging on outside constantly accompanies the game's protagonist throughout the house, sounding louder or softer depending on her location. Gone Home also features some good voice acting.\nI can not recommend Gone Home, the story is not interesting, it is too short and it is also boring.

I went into this, not knowing what it was about really. On the one hand, it challenged my gaming expectations, the conventions in games that I have become accustomed to. It led me to believe something horrific would occur at one moment or another and sent chills down my spine as I expected a physical oppossing force to stand in my way. If I'm to be honest, I feel this would be more suited to the medium of cinema than videgames as it's story turns out to be (SPOILER ALERT) a coming-of-age tale about the main character's (the player's) sister who discovers her sexuality. I found it's story somewhat pretentious and cheesy at times, feeling contrived and almost adolescent in it's attempts to tell a "deep" story. Once the finale reveals all, I had mixed feelings. I felt somewhat relieved, knowing that Sam (the main character's sister) was alive, I felt slighlty frustrated realising the implied JFK time-travel angle was nothing more than a writer's ideas and that the paronormal element would never be explored despite supernatural occurences being firmly implied and their aftermath shown in parts of the game.\nThis is a game that felt far too pasive to be considered a videogame (by the scientific definition) and what I find worse still, is how everything you investigate throughout the 2 hour experience is all retrospective, there is never an impactful action by your character. That is to say, you never ever have any bearing on the story, as you are merely discovering what has already transpired. I felt relieved that this was not a horror game. I was intrigued with how it toyed with what I, as a gamer, am used to experiencing and expecting (generally negative things, like bad guy will show up or a ghost will attack etc.) but somewhat frustrated by it's pretention, trying to be a game deeper than a game.\nIf you want a deep story in a videogame (that is actually a videogame as opposed to an interactive museum), play a "Metal Gear Solid", "Red Dead Redemption", "Heavy Rain" or "The Last of Us". If you want a far more fun "game" that pokes holes at gaming conventions and points out how gamers think etc., go play "The Stanley Parable" which uses humour rather than pretentious misdirection to show just how predictable gamers expectations can be.","December 19, 2013","false","1.8"," 74 of 111 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","74","111","0","0"

If I'm to be frank,it's way overrated. This is not to say the game is bad, it accomplishes what it sets out to do quite well, but there is very little mechanics to speak of.\n\nNow, I do realize that this is what some would call a narrative focused game, and that's a fair statement, but it's $20 for less than an hour of gameplay. There is also no incentive to revisit, no extra play modes, and simply speaking from a value stand point, Gone Home is not worth it's full asking price.\n\nThe lack of mechanics is not what I dislike about the game, I have no issues with games that is narrative driven, my biggest issue is that it's simply asking for too much for too little. It's not even as long as a movie, hell it might not be as long as an episode of your favorite show, yet it cost more than a movie ticket to an IMAX showing.\n\nI feel Gone Home came out during a time where indie darlings were still some thing special, and those who raised it so high on a pedestal only saw the superficial value of Gone Home and never considered consumer value in it's praise.\n\nGone home is ONLY for the most curious, or at a heavily discounted price.","December 25, 2014","false","2.6"," 102 of 160 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","102","160","0","4"

Gone Home really does not manage this.  Without giving too much away (really, there's not that much *to* give away), it's rather mundane, somewhat angst-ridden and extremely short.  Some of the story (and the other side-stories) are told via various notes left around the house you're exploring whilst a large chunk of it gets told via letters to your character that are unsent.  As a plot-revealing mechanism, it works well, but it's let down by the rather shortcomings in the actual tale being told and by the side-stories lacking any depth.\n\nGraphically, its fine, if nothing amazing and sound effects are appropriate and reasonably well done.  Many will find the music in the game a little inaccessible - it's riot grrrl stuff which, whilst having meaning in terms of the characters, was never great music.  Thankfully most of this can only be heard through cassettes that are found through the house and can be switched off as quick as they're put on.\n\nIt's not bad and its not good, Gone Home is officially in the 'meh' category.  This would be fine if the game was priced at 10-20% of the price that it's at now, but at £15 a throw, avoid like the plague.  If you're a Linux user, you may want to also note that it's a Unity engine port that was, for me, full of hang-ups, crashes and general mouse craziness.

If you have something to say that would help me improve it, please make a comment.\n\nSummary:\n\nIt's a game about exploration, in a very non-standard way. In fact, it is only a game because there is some interaction, with minimal thinking required to go forward. You are back to your house after a long time being abroad, but nobody's home.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay consists of looking for clues about what happened to your family, and the game succeeds partially by being able to tell a story using bits of text, pictures, and audio diaries from the main character's sister.  The fun part about the gameplay is exploring the house and discovering each family member's story, and there are several items and songs to discover in the house that will appeal to people who, like me, have lived as a teenager in the 90's.\n\nStory:\n\nThe game kept me wondering what happened to the family, why there was nobody home. Due to some elements in the game (sound, music) and in the story that had something to do with the supernatural, I kept thinking something very cool and surprising would appear at the end. Some people will relate to the drama that is being told in this game, but to me the story was not interesting enough and  there was no surprise at the end . I will describe most of what happens in the story below:\n\nThe story is focused on your character's younger sister, who is a teenager, her conflicts as a  lesbian and her adventures with her girlfriend. You also learn about their father's problems as a writer to get published, among other problems that everyone has. The only character that gets a voice is her sister, and even though the lesbian subject could lead to some interesting plot twists, all you get is a final message in the end from the younger sister, and that's it. Nothing really amazing happens, no one dies, nothing supernatural or even extraordinary.\n\nSo I felt that the game was a wasted potential due to the lack of a great story to tell.\n\nFor your reference, I am a very experienced player, and a fan of Interactive Fiction games, with or without graphics, as well as Point'n'Click games in general. So yes, I like playing games that are more about the story than the gameplay, and this one disappoints because there is not enough drama, only a regular soap opera story.\n\nSound\n\nThe sound effects are really good, and the soundtrack is amazing. In fact, I recommend buying the soundtrack for this game if you can!\n\nValue\n\nI got this from a bundle, so it was not a big deal. If you are like me and, despite negative reviews, want to see this for yourself, get it on a sale but be aware that you might be disappointed with the fact that the game promises too much, and gives too little. As a side note, you'd spend your time and money better playing games like "The Novelist" and "Richard and Alice", where you are actually given interesting characters and both are also about real life dramas, and both actually make you think about life and the choices we make.","October 11, 2014","false","3.7"," 55 of 80 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","55","80","0","0"

Started & finished Gone Home in a single sitting. Cannot remember a previous time doing this. Game is very short which is not automatically a bad thing, mind you. Easily shorter than 3 hours on a first run. And that by collecting all Journal entries, cassettes, pins and whatnot.\n\nSo, my thoughts. I went in with pretty much no knowledge of the game beforehand, so the game being a lesbian love-story was not expected. It's a light exploration game with minimal interaction and a focus on passive character development. I do enjoy exploring places and learning about the world via audio logs and texts when done right. This is a mixed bag. First of all, there is too little variation in characters with basically only two people having exposure, Sam, your sister and Lonnie, her love interest. That is a shame since the general cast of people is already very small, less than 10. With only Sam and Lonnie getting spotlight the exploration and adventure portion feels underused. Even though there are tidbits here and there about your parents and the previous home owner, it is just held too superficial with few, unvoiced texts and feels way too overlooked by the writing itself, so it looses any importance it could have had. The love story is done OK with an emphasis on emotions but all other characters besides Sam and Lonnie are done without any emotion at all which makes them look like robots. A real shame since slowly seeing more and more of the house would have fit very nicely by weaving various character arcs into the layout of the home. On that, the many secret passages became a real immersion breaker not by the idea itself - which fits an old, big manor with an interesting previous owner - but by sheer amount and usage. They just got away with it bearing in mind the previous owner but then again, like with other stuff it falters by underutilizing that as well. A little side story about the past owner would have been fitting. But alas, the house feels not enough like a real home but like a playground for Sam & Lonnie who only used those places. It almost feels like neither parents nor the bigger sister are a part of the house at all.\nJournal entries (audio logs) were done OK. It's a very little story, written OK as well. Couldn't connect towards the very ending, thinking two kids basically ran away. They are only seventeen. Feels like writers took a very cliche easy way out with the ending by making it overtly emotional with that runaway. A little inconsistency in logic with Sam was also there. At the beginning she writes her sister not to rummage around (and possibly learn anything) but towards the end she explicitly has left her messages in places only accessible by turning over the whole house? Eh, gotta throw a bit of sense out of the window to have emotional ending I guess. That goes for the whole very short game. High on emotion, at times feels forced by sheer lack of any other aspect.\nNot sure I'd recommend this. It offers very little in substance and variety. If you can overlook the narrow focus and at times forced story events, you will have some fun exploring the big house and basking in 90s nostalgia though. Wish there was a neutral option on Steam reviews.","February 27","false","3.0"," 55 of 80 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","55","80","0","0"

As a matter of fact, I love "The Stanley Parable", and many claim that that game is not a game as well. However, the reason I disliked this game is because of the massive build-up and pretty much no payoff at the end. The game introduces tons of creative ideas and tons of things that you have to figure out by yourself. However, none of it is ever explained in any way. For example (spoilers),the kids at Sam's school have all this strange talk about the house they moved into and they call it "The Psycho House". Eventually, we assume it is because of the previous owner of the house, who happened to be a bit crazy. However, although this mystery is really compelling, it never fully gets explained and instead focuses on Sam's story, which, to tell the truth, wasn't even close to as compelling.\n\nHonestly, as I went through the game, I got more wrapped up in the Dad's story than in Sam's story just because Sam's story is just really stereotypical and something we have all heard before in a basic love story.Even though the characters in the relationship were both girls, it honestly didn't matter. The story would be the exact same except for some minor changes in the journal entry in which her parents find out about the relationship.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I did enjoy looking around the house and trying to discover the mystery of why the family members left and about the previous owner of the house, but the only story that wasn't compelling was the character whose story was focused on the most. However, at this point, I still felt that Sam's story could be really interestingwhen I heard she was going to wait in the attic for Lonnie to return and I started to think that we would find Sam dead. It might have been a cliche, but it would have at least gave me something to think about. At this point, I finally felt that the payoff was going to happen, as I finally saw a twist that I could never have seen coming and was about to sing the praises of how good the game was and how it manages to make me think for at least just a bit. However, it completely psyches you out and delivers a stereotypical ending that leaves more questions about the story and let me down completely. Yes, it was a twist, and yes, I didn't expect, but that doesn't make it a good twist. It would be like if during "Jurassic Park", instead of the T-Rex making the water ripple, it was a giant clown. Yes, I didn't see it coming, but that doesn't make it good.\n\nOverall, the game was fun when you were collecting things at the beginning and for stories such as the Dad's story, but the game never risks anything and simply delivers a basic love story that was not that interesting to do.\n\nAlso, I forgot to mention: I beat this game, explored a bit after winning to find the logs I missed, and only missed 1 audio log in total, all in 88 minutes. That means I can essentially beat this game 100% in probably a little more than 1 hour and 30 minutes without a walkthrough to find the other audio logs. All in all, 2.5 out of ten.\n\nAfterward: People gave this game a perfect score, and some even gave it a "Game of the Year" award. It just goes to show that critics arn't always right, and while you should consider the opinion of a critic, don't base your interest in a game on that only.","June 27, 2014","false","1.5"," 40 of 55 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","40","55","0","2"

It's hugely overpriced for a game which is literally an hour long. Don't even wait until this game is cheaper to buy it, just don't buy it.\n\nThe story was really dreadful, you know what's going to happen after you read the third letter and then the rest of the game seems to just drag it out for as long as possible. It's just "person falls in love with person" and nothing else happens, wow such depth. I have had more fun pooping than I have had experiencing the 'story' in this game. And yes, the story is important in this game, because mainly what you do is explore the house to find objects which, once examined, give you another letter which tells you more of the story. There isn't much more of an aim than that, apart from just picking up objects and examining them, which usually I find is a fun mechanic in most games but in this game it just wasn't.\n\nI think they like to think that including lesbians in the story makes it deeper than it actually is, and  they try to use that to detract from the deeply uninspired and boring story, which I think is pretty offensive. How about writing a decent story about lesbians instead? Maybe they actually deserve decent representation instead of this absolute trash half ♥♥♥♥♥ attempt.\n\nThe rest of the house serves as 90s nostalgia which is only interesting to Americans who were teenagers in 1995, and it just feels like it buys into the whole 'nostalgia sells' thing that's going on right now because for some strange reason people like looking back at things and claiming they were better than they really were. Which is how this game is, everyone is claiming it is better than it actually is. What is with all the positive reviews? Even giantbomb gave it a good review and I thought that usually they don't give terrible games 5/5. I mean in that review the writer literally praises it because you don't have a gun in the game. What a ♥♥♥♥ing nonce.\n\nAlso, you can't jump, you press space and nothing happens and knowing you cant jump is like being robbed of my own physical legs irl and there are no mirrors in the entire house. wtf sort of house has no mirrors? ♥♥♥♥ me i'm out 2/10 at best","December 9, 2013","false","1.9"," 126 of 204 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","126","204","0","7"

It's that good.\n\nThis is one of the most overrated games of recent time. Just because a game is controversial and nostalgic doesn't make it stand on its own. If it was released as a free project, then I would think this was an achievement. So many people praise games and movies when they do something out of the "norm" in the story or otherwise. But why do people consistently do it. Its like people who claim they listen only to indie music because it makes them special. But really all they do is hang out with other "indie" people and hate on those who don't understand them. So much for being independant.\n\nThis game has great voice recordings, the texturing and the modeling are also good. I found my self smiling and almost giggling with memories as I went through the house for the first 5 minutes. But after that, I lost it. I found my self just needing to complete the predictable game just becuase I had heard it was short and I figured I might as well see the whole thing.\n\nOne thing that really bothered me is that even though it is supposed to be an open exploration game, it is extremely linear, so much so that it takes away from the whole point. How am I supposed to feel like I am exploring a house, when I have to unlock sections of the house by completing certain "find the key" sections of the game. And to explain why this was such a bother was because so many of the plot developments (notes) about the family progress in a chronological manner over a year, in notes that are already in the correct order as you find them. Why are notes that are more recent near the end of the game, and notes that start at the beggining of the chronology are found at the beggining sections of the house? Did the mom live in the closet during the 6 month mark and then move a month later to the kitchen so she could leave behind another piece of paper. I know there needs to be a fine line of guiding the player, but I felt the devs missed it. I understand why to an extent, but at the same time It didn't take me long before I figured out I was being spoon fed a story in a faux-exploration manner.\n\nAll though this game was short, it was a time consuming very short story that overstayed its welcome.\n\nI would say go though this game once because some of the few 90s references are great for anyone who grew up during that time. But it is not as great as people say it is. The house is huge, but just feels empty, and I don't mean devoid of people, just that it feels lifeless by itself. Everything feels structured in its layout and there are not that many props, just a few striking 90s references, and then a bunch of light switches, toilet paper, towels, and coffee cups. In so many ways this "coming home" experience could have felt more powerful. This game can't survive on the narration of a journal for the whole 15min total of narration for almost 2 hours of walking from lifeless room to lifeless room.\n\nMaybe I'm spoiled, I just finished the Vanishing of Ethan Carter and I had my self pouring over every item I found, all the while being emotionally touched by the way the story actually came together in my mind alongside the actual plot, and not just as the naration dictated. In this game I got tired of hearing the whiny sister talk and explain while I looked at glass coasters with a fern on it. Thing was I never felt like I was involved in this game, and the character you play seems just as distant. There are so many better ways to tell a story and create a depth of feelings the player can sense in the visual medium of video games, other than to just put a bunch of objects in front of me and then tell me about the objects as I chronologically come across them.\n\nNostalgia: + (for about 5 minutes but somethings are really cool, like the inclusion of magic eye papers)\n\nVoice Recording: + (even though the subject annoyed me like someone elses slowly released fart in a small room, to me it was still very tenderly and emotionally delivered)\n\nAtmosphere and Sounds: ~ (okay, but mostly bad, good lighting, the house is lifeless though and doesn't feel like anyone could ever be home even if the game put them in there, and the thunder claps seemed really off and badly recorded.)\n\nStory: - (bland, slightly intriging for a second, and then it turns into, walk here, unlock this, walk there, while narration complains and explains)\n\nGameplay: - (It's hard to have an exploration game where exploration really matters if I have to go through the story in chronological sections anyways, I never felt like I was figuring anything out)\n\nThe only thing that made this game worth it to me was flipping the cassete case around, and around, and around, and around.  It's mesmerizing. But not worth it enough to gain a thumbs up. Give it a shot, but do not under any circumstances pay any more than 2 bucks for it.  Try and get it in a bundle.","October 9, 2014","false","1.1"," 76 of 118 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","76","118","0","1"

Gone Home is the latest example of games being more than their gameplay. You won't run from monsters, lose your sanity, or track down a serial killer, but you will become immersed in a surprisingly believable, very human tale.\n\nWithout spoiling too much of the plot, I will say that Gone Home is the definition of a "coming-of-age" story. It's about having the courage (or recklessness, depending on how you view the plot's conclusion) to follow your own judgment, and the story itself is very well-written.\n\nYou play Katie Greenbriar, a young woman just returned from a European trip, who finds her family's Oregon mansion completely deserted. The main plot involves finding out what happened to your younger sister Sam, who tells her own story via a series of voiceovers throughout the game. You wander through the house, interacting with various items (papers are especially important) to trigger the next voiceover. Along the way, additional items tell other stories: about your parents, your extended family, and the house's previous owner. New paths open up around the house as you collect keys, find secret passages, and acquire the combinations to your family's locked containers.\n\nThe voiceovers themselves are well done. The voice acting is a match for the script (a rare feat, especially indie games), and its content is poignant without being pretentious. I applaud The Fullbright Company for representation of queer characters that isn't gimmicky. Chris Remo's score is wonderful, especially the track that accompanies the voiceovers. The game also features music by Bratmobile and Heavens to Betsy.\n\nSome critiques: mostly these relate to things I know the dev team had no control over. It's not the prettiest game you've ever seen, but given that it was made with Unity, it's not terrible. There's also no player marker on the pause-menu map. The section of the house you're in is highlighted, but at a couple of points it's hard to tell where exactly in the house you are.\n\nSome people are going to knock the lack of action in this game, but I personally think that's a bit shortsighted. Some games are like action movies. This game is more like a book. It's the clearest example I've ever played of video games as a legitimate story-telling medium, and it does so without additional gameplay elements to shore it up on a technical level. It takes some serious gumption to hang your hat on only the story a game presents. That just isn't done, not even in story-driven games like the Mass Effect series.\n\nAnd Gone Home does it well.","December 25, 2013","true","2.2"," 752 of 1,302 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","752","1","4","7"

As a gamer who prefers great story, atmosphere, and/or characters to gunplay, Gone Home caught my attention for precisely that: making gameplay as bare-bones as possible to make you focus on what was happening in the story instead of what was attacking you. The downside to this approach is the story must step up to the plate and be great to compensate for the lack of combat. And that is where Gone Home falls flat on its face.\n\nIt initially sets itself up as a kind of murder mystery, since you come to your house, alone, with no one there at all during a storm. The reason no one is there is just poor timing on the player character's part, so that mystery is a bit of a let down. Beneath that, there's uncovering the family dynamic and secrets that have been accumulating since you left. And, quite frankly, that's almost as boring as why everyone was gone. Finding the clues is exciting at first, but that's nothing but a sense of achievement speaking. The clues themselves paint a picture based on stereotypes we've all heard a dozen times before in books, TV, movies, and every other medium out there. One voice throughout tries to make it better by adding emotion to it all, but trying and doing can be two very different things.\n\nOverall, very disappointed and very confused as to why this did so well critically.","March 28, 2015","false","2.3"," 145 of 242 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","145","242","0","0"

But Gone Home doesn't offer an interesting nor important story, or anything new at all. It just has a different focus than any other game. For the interactivity mechanic, it even lacks standard features like a little jumping or maybe faster walking that you'd think would not detract from the immersion and theme and general experience it has, but yeah it's just a minor problem.\n\nIts storytelling mechanic is only above Kinetic Novels (Visual Novels without any plot branching paths)—you just pick and read things like notes and scraps and uncover the story without a single dialogue; it's fine on its own, some other "walking simulator" games are also like that—but it is very short and offers very little in a less interesting and less important story than other "walking simulators" or regular VNs. At the same time you'd feel it has potential to offer more, but it simply doesn't. The plain "real" teenage story you unravel shouldn't be a plus point either just because other games rarely pick that theme.\n\nOn the plus side, Gone Home has okay graphics and good polish (including great voice acting).\n\nAll in all, Gone Home is just a below average experience. The "story" is nothing special, it's very very short, I feel like it only depends on an unusual topic for a video game and it doesn't even do it well enough. It has a potential to be better telling its story, but it doesn't.\n\nI would not recommend anyone to buy this, except if you think you would be impressed by a plain teenage life story told interactively. But even then, I'd only recommend a price of a US dollar max or in a bundle.","December 27, 2014","false","1.6"," 60 of 97 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","60","97","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/T_ConX/recommended/232430/","T_ConX","OctoChan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/T_ConX/","1356 products in account","Grossly overrated.  This is easily one of the worst games I have ever played.\n\nBut it didn't have to be like this.  Gone Home certainly constructs an interesting premise.  You're exploring the house your family moved into while you were "studying" in Amsterdam for a year.  No one else is here, so it's up to you to try and figure out what your family has been up to for the last year, and why everyone is gone.\n\nAnd the short answer is [SPOILER ALERT] nothing particularly interesting.\n\nYou uncover the story by examining every loose object you find.  The vast majority of these have no use or meaning to them (how many times have I seen this 3-ring binder?), but some are essential for understanding what little plot the game has.  The fact that you can pick up and examine so many objects is certainly impressive, but it adds little or nothing to the actual game.  Some objects will trigger a telepathic message from your sisters diary, which is how much of the games plot is delivered to you.  Unfortunately, a lot of these items are miss-able, some very easily, so it's possible you'll finish the game with a few holes in the narrative.\n\nThere are certainly threads that suggest something interesting.  The game hints at the possibility that some malevolent force is present, but in the end it just turns out that normal teenage girl drama is the primary cause of your families unexpected absence.  It's kind of a downer, since the game does a pretty good job of building a genuinely haunting atmosphere, but decides to waste it on something so mundane and normal.  Imagine playing SIlent Hill 2, but the only ending the game has is the joke ending with the dog at the control panel.  Well, that's what the endgame of Gone Home feels like; the joke ending of a much better game.\n\nA lot has been made of the developers previous experience on titles in the Bioshock series, and the influence is there.  One of the most interesting parts of the first two games was exploring the ruins of an experimental civilization, collecting clues (mostly audio-logs) that would help you understand the events surrounding it's downfall.  Gone Home works similarly, but while Bioshock used this idea as a fun side objective, Gone Home tries to build a full game around it, which results in making the entire experience somewhat underwhelming.\n\nParts of the story don't even make sense.  The game ends when you find your sisters diary, which she been writing with the intention of having you read.  Since she knows you'll be home soon, she decides to leave it in the the most obvious place; the attic.\n\nExcept she never tells you it's in the attic.  Also, the attic is locked.\n\nOK, so you got to find the key.  Where is it?  It's in the secret room that only your sister and her friend know about!\n\nBut don't worry!  There's a map showing the location of this room.  The only problem is that it's on the far east side of the house, and that half of the house sits behind a locked door!\n\nThankfully, you can also get to the east side of the house by way of a secret passage in the basement.  SURPRISE!  The door to the basement is also locked.\n\nWhich means we'll need the key to the basement.  You're sister left that in her room... inside a locker...\n\nOh, but you can open the locker.  You just need the combination!  It's on a piece of paper that's been ripped in half, and both pieces are hidden behind wall panels.\n\nIt would seem your sister, who says she had no time to explain her sudden disappearance, found plenty of time to construct one of gaming's most pointlessly elaborate scavenger hunts.\n\nThe layout of the house doesn't even make sense.  When you compare the maps of the first and second floors, it becomes obvious that the second floor isn't being supported by anything below it (save for one of the secret passages).  I know this is a really small thing to bring up, but it kind of killed what little imersion I had.\n\nGone Home's aethetics are incredibly bland.  The models and textures scream 'first year CG Art student', but the use of light and shadows are certainly impressive.  The music largely consists of 90s riot grrl acts, a genre that relied on half-baked messages of social rebellion to make up for obvious lack of musical skill.\n\nGone Home is the Emperors New Clothes of video games.  It seems like every game critic on the planet is tripping over each other trying to shower this thing with praise, lest they be considered too ignorant to understand the games brilliance.

It only tells the story from one person's view and not her family members. You walk around "explore" every room in the house hoping to find something new and interesting to know whereabouts the main character's family members are and what is going on with her family members. It is somewhat both predictable and unpredictable at the same time. I find myself not knowing whether it is a "love story" or a horror game judging by what you find in the house and what you hear in the house. The ending was very simple, not telling what happen to the rest of the family members. I do not see why this is even a video game, making a book about it I bet it would be much more interesting. I do not know why this game got a high rating review from known gaming websites; IGN, Gameinformer, The New York Times? bahahaha.

We'll focus more on this later.\n\nThe map it's surprisingly good looking, and there are lot of stuff you can interact with, and most of them will bring you back the 90s feel (such as VHS, cassette tapes etc). Most of the models looks very good, and the graphic is fine.\n\nI don't really know what to say about the soundtrack. Sometimes it's really really good and it work well with the moment, sometimes well.. it's just silly. A sad song pops up almost out of nowhere, or you find a cassette tape with a song that will make your ear bleed and grow a mouth that will ask you to stop playing the game.\n\nThe voice acting it's good, but in the end, there is just 1 actress, the main protagonist talking. She's good, but doesen't help the story to look interesting. Also, her laugh makes me unconfortable.\n\nAnd now, the main thing about the game. The story. Short, predictable and pointless. God-♥♥♥♥ing-demmit.\n\nYou have this setting: you're Sam, a girl that it's coming back home after a while to find out that no one it's home. But why? We'll see that later on.\nYou have to explore the home to find out more about your past and to what happened to everyone. Turns out you're "not attracted to men" and you had a long complicated story with your partner. A love story that for most of the time it's ♥♥♥♥ing akward to listen and really made me unconfortable BUT NOT because of the sexual iterest into someone of the same gender, don't get me wrong, it was akward BECAUSE IT GET REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING RIDICULOUS FOR MOST OF THE EVENTS SHE'S NARRATING. And most of this event ends up with her crying. What a surprise.\nIn the end, to be honest, the story could have been interesting or a little more enjoyable if something big whould happen, like some trama plot. But nope, in the end they tear apart, they never saw each other, teh edn. Boo-hoo ending I guess. Not working at all.\nOh and what happened to the family, why they leave the house? I dunno. Why, do you care? Should we care? I think the story it's already good without some explanation. Effin-great.\n\nAlso, this game looks easy as it can gets. There are almost no puzzles, just a bunch of combination or paper that tells you where to find hidden spots (just 2 or 3 in the whole game) and it's super short. I've beat this game in 77 minutes. And what's the best part? If you like to mess around, you could easly find the main hidden spot, get the key, go to the attic and beat the game in 3 minutes! Who designed this ♥♥♥♥? Aha!\n\nFinal rating: 2/10\n\nYou probably need to be some Tumblr feminist girl to enjoy this story. Probably even them find this game offensive.\n\n\nOh, almost forgot, this won "Best PC game" over "Paper, please" and "Stanley Parable".

Considering I would not personally tell my friends to play it I'm going to vote "No" but it's by no means a poorly created game, just not a game I would recommend.\n\nThe game is an interactive story-telling experience. You get to wander the house, find secrets, learn about the history of the family, and the entire time learn about your little sister and her high school experience. The entire time you hear noises in the house, the clasp of thunder, voices from nowhere, the moving of tables/chairs, and so much more. You would expect at one point for a jump scare to happen as the ambiance is set up very well. I was a little disappointed nothing happened but I can't say I expected anything.\n\nI guess my chief issue is the story seemed like it would appeal to a younger audience and I really shouldn't have been playing it in the first place. So if you're a teenager who is having trouble with authority and want someone to relate to, then pick this game up! Otherwise, you're better off letting this one by. Sadly I felt like I was strung along waiting for a plot twist that never happened. I mean... in this game they talk about ghosts and hauntings for the first chunk of it, the family leaving on various trips, the "psycho brother" losing all contact with the sister he loved and locking everything away, a grandfather who showed two-faced approval for his author son... and yet the entire time none of this was relevent to the story at all. You find out that the house is apparently haunted but that doesn't mean anything... YOU EVEN FIND A PENTAGRAM THAT MEANS NOTHING.\n\nI will deem this game "teenage angst simulator" or "no one understands me: The Game"","March 4, 2015","false","1.9"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","33","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sethgmacy/recommended/232430/","sethgmacy","sethgmacy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sethgmacy/","99 products in account","Sometimes I worry when my opinion on an especially beloved piece of work differs from that of the overwhelming majority of game reviewers. I wonder if perhaps I've missed something along the way. I think to myself "Did I play this the wrong way?" or "Was I not paying close enough attention?" BioShock Infinite, with its near universally high review scores and fleeting comparisons to Citizen Kane, was a recent example of the difference in opinion I felt with professional game critics. I found Infinite to be uneven, with the emphasis on narrative being overshadowed by the disconnect between it and the gameplay.\n\nAnd so I find myself again in a situation where I have to wonder if I've done something wrong. Due largely to the many positive comments I have heard regarding the importance of Fullbright Studios' "Gone Home," I felt that I needed to play it now rather than later. The buzz on this plucky indie title is that it should be experienced by all. In some ways, I can't disagree with that. It should be experienced, but the urgency to do so is misguided.\n\nThe game opens with Katie, the player-controlled character, returning home after a year abroad. While gone, her family moved into a new house, a sprawling manor with dark wood paneling that drapes every room in an appropriate sense of Hollywood mystery. The front door is locked, and taped to it is a note from Katie's sister, Sam, urging her not to try and find her, nor to snoop through her things.\n\nPlaying the game is a matter of moving through the house, examining objects and unraveling the mysteries within. There are several stories to discover, from the relationship between Katie's parents, the changing courses of their careers, and a story about the original owner of the home. But the main focus of the story is on Sam, and where she has gone.\n\nClues to what has been happening for the last year come in the way of written correspondence. Notes, some formal, some on post-its, some on desks, others torn and crumpled, move the narrative along. It doesn't hit you over the head, which is refreshing, save for Sam's story. Other than one notable surprise moment in a bathroom, I felt early on that I knew just where the story would resolve. While it didn't necessarily roll itself out as I expected, the outcome was where I knew it would end up.\n\nWhen I finished the game, I didn't know how to feel about the experience I had just had. The story was satisfying, if not a little predictable, and I appreciated what the game did in regards to a novel approach to storytelling. But I still felt conflicted before I could fully render my final assessment.\n\nThe title builds a spooky ambiance through the ever-present rain and the sprawling, empty house. Such a decision on the part of the designers is not without merit: coming to a house you have never seen before, on a rain-soaked Portland night, would probably give anyone a feeling of uneasiness. But the game seems to rely on the haunted-house tropes to convey a level of mystery, and it doesn't really work once the game is said and done. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't immediately know how to feel when I finished the game. Part of it was realizing that the elevation of the house's atmosphere to a "spooky" level was not a needed inclusion. It never played out, and leads to a false feeling that something is there when it in no way is. It was a cheap way to build tension in a game whose setting exists in the same universe as you and I.\n\nAnother problem I have is that I found the secondary stories to be more interesting than the story of finding Sam. Katie and Sam's parents, their strained relationships, her father's decline and seeming rebirth as a writer, these things piqued my attention more so than the story of Sam. To the game's credit, it allows you to make your own assumptions about how these side-stories resolve, and I find that approach to be more engaging than the straight-forward reveal of Sam's fate.\n\nNotes such as this one help move along the narrative and help nail a sense of place and time.\nMy biggest problem with this game is that it cost me $20, was over in 3 hours, and has no replay value. I didn't get all the details of the stories, but I also don't care enough about them to go back and play the game anymore. All the mystery has evaporated from it now that the narrative has concluded. I largely followed leads for the other stories to see how they intertwined themselves with Sam's fate, and knowing Sam's fate has made me lose interest in the other stories.\n\nThis is my inner struggle with this game: I know it's a good game. I know that it takes an interesting approach to storytelling, and for that it should be lauded. I have long felt that stories in games are largely superfluous (BioShock Infinite being a prime example of a critically successful game where the story and gameplay exist on two independent planes). Where Gone Home succeeds is in making the story the game itself. There's nothing magical about the exploration-based gameplay here, but it's the execution that makes it work. Without the gameplay elements, the story would not be as compelling, and vice versa.\n\nGone Home is an important, if flawed, foray into the world of interactive storytelling. Its implementation of certain game elements feel forced, like shoehorning door unlocking "puzzles" in, and while the story itself is interesting, it concludes too quickly and predictably. It lacks sufficient variety to warrant a second-playthrough, and from a strictly value-based perspective, its twenty dollar price tag is more than most gamers would be comfortable spending. I recommend this game, but wait for a Steam sale.","November 28, 2013","true","10.3"," 566 of 1,022 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","566","1","2","5"

Being released on PC in August 2013, before a planned release on PS4 and Xbox One in early 2016.\n\nI wouldn’t say Gone Home is a game, because there is the only thing you do in this game is walk from room to room interacting with notes and books, that’s it. This game has often been marked as being a walking simulator, and to be honest, people aren’t far wrong with that notion. From start to finish there the only sort of action or puzzle, or anything really worthy of being called gameplay, would be a short puzzle involving finding hidden cupboards.  I was quite honestly bored after five minutes of starting the game.\n\nGraphically, the game is quite nice though. There are some really nicely done lighting mechanics in the game, and textures are all really high quality as well. Even items that you pick up have really nicely made graphics and textures on, such as bottles in the kitchen or bathroom. There isn’t any animation to be found in the game though; you come into contact with no moveable objects throughout the game. Gone Home is narrated well too, the voice acting is done really well, and there is from memory no sound effects that standout, just a lot of ambiance sounds of the storm going on outside.\n\nThe only really shining light to come out of Gone Home is that it has a fairly compelling story. As a mid-twenties male though, I couldn’t relate to anything that was happening. You are basically reading a ton of notes, letters, diaries and posters. I was quite interested to follow the story until completion but I can’t say that I really enjoyed it all that much. It’s a very slow paced story which only really gathers paced towards the end of the game. You can get even more lore and plot from the game by searching high and low for more notes and letters if you want to.\n\nA complete run through Gone Home will take you less than an hour to finish. This is with finding most of the extra notes for more stories as well. There is no replay ability, because to be quite honest, it’s a stretch to even get one run through out of it.\n\nTechnically I didn’t run into any problems. The game runs smooth and there are no glitches or bugs. Although there isn’t really anything that complicated going off on screen anyway…\n\nTo sum up, I am not going to recommend Gone Home. How this “game” is priced at £14, 99 are is astounding. I picked this up when it was on sale for £1, 79 a while ago, and even now I think I have been ripped off. There is a string of pretentious reviews on this “game” that quite honestly make me cringe whilst reading.  Gone Home is quite literally one of the most boring and unexciting “games” I have played this year and cannot recommend it to anyone.  Fully expecting a wave of flame and hatred from this review, so bring it on! :)\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JtapVFy5Ohs\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

And even that's stretching it some - you're not really interacting with the story itself, you're just finding bits of paper and such that trigger audio clips. I bought it, on sale, without checking the reviews (I read that it was originally an Amnesia mod, thought it would be scary, and bought it as a blind 'let's play' sort of thing) and was sorely disappointed. I'd expected something...frightening, or upsetting at the very least.\n\nEven disregarding my own mistake, it was still a disappointing experience. The atmosphere is lonely and tense and foreboding, and for what? So I can walk around the house, keyed up, and find notes from my teenaged sister?\n\nFor that matter - the main story merely made me mildly nauseated. Kudos, that the developers made it a lesbian romance, but while some might find it cute or touching...To be honest, I just found it frustratingly cliche. Of course our sister's name is Sam (yes, I know, it's a nickname), lesbians are all named something masculine. Of course she doesn't fit in at school. Of course she's all gurrrl power.\n\nOf course she does the incredibly stupid thing of running away from home to be with her girlfriend.\n\nIt's like I'm reading a textbook romance, in lesbian flavor. There are a few sweet moments, but overall I merely wanted to slap the hell out of my sister for being an idiotic teenager. I was more interested in my parents' stories, although that's not saying much.\n\nSo, to recap: This is a "game" that wastes its potential atmosphere in favor of a boring romance between two teenage girls. Not recommended unless you have a serious need for 90's nostalgia or happen to identify strongly with Sam.","January 5, 2014","false","2.8"," 101 of 176 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","101","176","0","2"

The basic storyline is 'you come home and nobody is there, find out why' and not 'zombies have taken over the house and lurk in the basement'.\n\nYes, "Gone Home" is short, once you know where to find the information and the keys, you can play it in a little over 10 minutes ... but that means only going through the house and triggering the ending sequence, that kind of playing will not give you the complete story. The story, however, is not just about Sam (the sister). You can also find out about your father's troubles with writing, about his weird uncle, who owned the house before the family moved in, and other stuff. Basically, the game lets you catch up with the family history during the time you were in Europe.\n\nIt's an everyday story, not something great or heroic or scary. It's just the unease everyone would feel alone in a house they've never been in before, at after 1 a.m. on a night with a thunderstorm, not atmospheric horror like in "Amnesia."\n\n$20 might indeed be a little much for the game... and 'game' a little too much of a word for "Gone Home" but it does not deserve all the bad reviews it has gotten. If you want an action game, this is not for you... but that should be obvious from the description.

The radical feminist "Fight the patriarchy" stuff is nowhere as bad as some dummies would have you believe. Its a minuscule little magazine that is quickly forgotten about and is not part of the games overall message in anyway. Now onto the game,\n\nThis is an explorative story game about young love as a homosexual, and if that is to "SJW" for you just f*ck off and play a different game. Although honestly I'd suggest most people to play another game anyway because this is a very very short game.\n\nGone Home doesn't really dive into much more than the young love story, but it tries to dip its toes in other bigger topics... That is where it fails for me not properly handling the big topics, and glancing over them like there no big deal. I will say I did have a lot of fun exploring the house and the atmosphere was superb. There were times I genuinely felt like I was in a dark stormy house all alone. For me the story didn't grab me like I felt it should it just came off pretty bland, but the potential for a story is all around. It could of been a lot more if it truly dived in and tackled the big topics instead of using them as a light seasoning. Overall I didn't get why this game is the punching bag people have made it into its not really worth that level of hate. This isn't anywhere near the level of atrocious as something like Dear Esther. Its just a short explorative story driven game... with a sub-par story.\n\n\nPros:\n- Nice Explorative Gameplay.\n- Great Immersive Atmosphere.\n- Coming to terms with homosexuality was handled and built up well.\n- Made me feel like I was in 1995 again.\n\nCons:\n- (As a homosexual) The handling and dealing with homophobia wasn't great, only slight passing references.\n- Awful garage punk rock music.\n- Sub-par Story / Extremely short.\n- Made me feel like I was in 1995 again.\n\n6/10 - Alright, not really worth your time.","November 26, 2015","false","1.4"," 58 of 100 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","58","100","4","0"

I suppose if you'd like to jump on the band wagon and pretend to be some 'gaming intellectual' who played this game and felt it was 'so deep' then by all means buy this game and play it into the ground.  Alternatively, I imagine that this game is similar to young adult novels that deal with all those confusing feelings pre-teens and young teens have about themselves.  So if you like those, do the same.\n\nIf you don't want to act like a shallow elitest, or you don't enjoy young adult fiction I recommend against wasting your money.  You would do better finding a copy of any 90's TV show featuring a teenage female lead and get the same experience for what is probably a fraction of the price.\n\nThe suspension of disbelief wasn't there, the themes were confusing, and the story itself was paper thin.\n\nI spent half the game waiting for it to be a different game, and it never accomplished that.  Instead it was just a casual walk through a house on a rainy night while reading your little sister's diary like a nosey sibling and rummaging through your parent's personal business.  It is the most boring plotline ever.\n\nIn the end?

If you're looking for a spooky, dark mystery with some "boo!" moments and at least a bit of horror, well... sorry. What you get instead is, as FABIO stated below, a big red herring, setting an atmosphere of dread and anxiousness, with absolutely no payoff. None.

Hoping, HOPING that this game with such atmospheric reviews has some good tricks up its sleeves (it doesn't).\n\nThough I won't spoil the story entirely, it turns out to be a half-hearted love story that feels like more agenda than actual emotional attachment.

The concept is simplistic and surprisingly engrossing. The atmosphere is great, it’s a very interesting period piece, and a lot of the story is pretty engaging; however, the main problem with the game is that everything ends up feeling artificial. For those unfamiliar, you play as a young adult returning home a little past midnight and finding out that no one is home. As such, you let yourself into the house and begin exploring. Through your exploration you will slowly unravel the mysteries of where everyone is, the house, etc.\n\nHonestly, it is a very interesting game and pretty well done. There is a sense of wonder exploring a relatively deserted and unfamiliar house—one your family calls home. The biggest gripe, though, is that the house doesn’t actually feel like a house at all. The layout and floor plan of the home you are exploring doesn’t really make much sense. I assume the home was designed in such a way as to guide players in the ‘correct’ direction, but honestly the house doesn’t really feel like a house. It feels more like a series of rooms that are connected by a maze of hallways. The room locations do not seem to make much sense, the hallways are incredibly long and winding, and honestly it just doesn’t feel like a home so much as it feels like a couple rooms held together by a thing wire.\n\nFurther detracting from the immersion is the fact that apparently every single member of the home has left incredibly personal papers, letters, and memos all over the house. For a family with so many secrets, you’d expect the mom to hide letters from her friend hinting at something sinister in a better place than any random cupboard in the house. Likewise, a note that isn’t exactly hidden at all saying ‘let’s do it at this location and this time’ more or less in plain sight makes little sense. This is pretty frustrating, particularly because there seems to have been a lot of effort put into the many different family storylines.\n\nPerhaps most annoying is the character that is your sister. The letters she writes back and forth between her classmates and love interest are incredibly juvenile. Instead of presenting her as a highschool student graduating relatively soon—which she is--- the notes and slips of paper she has written read as though a third grader just found out that you can write an pass notes in class. It’s incredibly ridiculous and, for lack of a better word, lame. What really is disappointing is that your sister isn’t even the most interesting part of the story. What’s going on with your mom and dad is much more interesting, better paced, and frankly more believable. This is not to say that the story involving your sister is bad. The problem is that you can’t help but feel disillusioned by the juvenile and amateur writing of a supposed highschooler  with aspirations of attending a college for creative writing.\n\nGone Home could have been a really great game. Instead, it’s an okay game with a really interesting idea. In general I guess I recommend the game just to try it out and form your own opinion. There is a good deal to like. I just wouldn’t expect too much.","September 10, 2014","false","1.9"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

There are a lot of things I wish I would have done, instead of just sitting around and complaining about having a boring life. So I pretty much like to make it up. I'd rather tell a story about somebody else.” ― Kurt Cobain, Journals\n\nKatie Greenbriar comes back to her family home, one year after the mysterious suicide of grunge god, Kurt Cobain. Is this info relevant at all? Nope, not really. It's just a nostalgic anecdote to remind you that it's the 90s. The world is simpler, slower, a bit more isolated; and runs through passion and imagination for most teenagers. Internet is dial-up, we listen music from cassettes, watch movies from VHS and getting out to town on a school night is a big issue. Without the dominating grasp of absurdly advanced technology, the world is innocent compared to today. How do I know? I've been there.\n\nBut this isn't my story. This is Katie's story, returning from a year's trip to Europe, only to find no one at home. Where is everyone? Mom? Dad? Sam? As any considerate sister and beloved daughter of a family would do, we explore the newly settled home of the Greenbriars to find some answers. Since the family moved into this place in our absence, everything is alien, new and even... uncanny.\n\nI'd love to tell you more about the story - and interwoven side stories, but my hands are tied, since this game is all about stories to be uncovered. I find it hard to believe that many people in the forums and countless reviewers found this game to be an exaggerated thrash. I believe this game to be a revolution in the sense of storytelling in games, utilizing no more than a basic environment, written information and some audio records to tell the story of three generations, and maybe some more.\n\nIf you are in expectancy of a hideous horror game with eerie jump scares, no, Gone Home is not it. Gone Home is more like an experience, sharing a period in time, a moment so ordinary and so real. It's nothing supernatural, or extraordinary. It is a home, maybe your home, thus defines the exact description of Freud's Uncanny. From the moment that Katie comes into the front porch until the last moment of realization of the game, we really become Katie. The situation is nothing extraordinary. In fact, it is so ordinary that it can happen to anyone of us, in any household. It all is so friggin real, and the real is the primary strength of Gone Home.\n\nWithin this story driven exploration game, you should expect to find out just one silent reality of a household, as powerful, as troublesome and as beautiful it can be. I strongly advise for you to avoid any kind of spoilers until you'd go through the game at least once. If you are in for basic human feelings - like worry, anxiety, shame, frustration and passion; you will love this game.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 4, 2015","true","3.6"," 116 of 209 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","116","209","2","12"

To make matters worse, it is told in a completetly nonsensical way that has it progressing in parallel to the progress that the player makes as they walk through the house.  Why the notes and letters are scattered in such a way throughout the house makes literally no sense, but it sure was convenient.

This is no game at the end of the day, it feels more like a tech demo of sorts.\n\nGraphically, it does the job that it sets out to do I suppose, with nothing awe-inspiring to be found within. Everything is presented as you would expect with most 'home' locations in games these days. The rooms are very well decorated and do feel very realistic in their layout.\n\nAudio-wise, there's not a lot really besides a fair few audio dialogues throughout the game. They tell the story of why the house is empty, mainly through letters written by the protagonist's sister. She gives brief details on the father and mother but mostly talks about what's been going on in her recent life and ultimately, reveals nothing of significance to the person playing the game. There's nothing found within the storyline laid out before you that actually impacts upon what you're experiencing in the house and as a result it feels a very dis-jointed experience. If anything, it's extremely mis-leading as what sounds and feels like a horror game of sorts becomes... nothing. A simple traipse through an empty house.\n\nIt's hard to say how the game plays when there's really no game to be found within. It's like a 3D version of those mind-numbing hidden object games, except you aren't exactly given clues in 'Gone Home' as to what you need or why.\n\nReviewers apparently went crazy for thise game, and awards were bestowed upon it. I just don't know where the hype and praise came from because deep down, it just feels like a more advanced version of HL2's 'Lost Coast' mod, or 'Dear Esther'. If you have come to 'Gone Home' expecting some kind of survival horror, or heck, even just a game with a beginning and an end, you won't find it here.\n\nIn a word?

While the graphics and enviroment are beautiful, the story isn't that compelling. I found myself waddling around the house interacting needlessly with garbage and toothbrushes. Seemingly enough no one was home upon my return, all the lights were off, and a creepy side-story felt like an attempt at adding horror and suspense to an otherwise lackluster story. It's got some funny content, which adds a lighter side to this game, however, I felt as if the narative was very predictable. The narrator did a beautiful job at voicing and the music was decent.

You never come across another entity in the game, nor do you interact with anything except turning on a faucet or flush a toilet... other than that it's open a door. You can grab an item and interact with it, like you would in a Telltale game (spinning it around), but there's no reason to, ever. It's also an incredibly fast playthrough.

If ever there was a game that completely punctuated the difference between those who critique games for websites/magazines and those who actually purchase and play those games, it is Gone Home. The critics absolutely adored this game and the gamers despised it. Hmmmm. This tells me to never trust a metascore ever again and to stick to the reviews written by those who have actually purchased the game and played it. (Thank heaven for Steam reviews!)\nThe description of the game states, "No Combat, No Puzzles: Gone Home is a nonviolent and puzzle-free experience, inviting you to play at your own pace without getting attacked, stuck, or frustrated." And I am usually OK with games of that sort IF they can hold my attention and are somewhat engaging. Gone Home was neither attention holding nor was it engaging. Walk around, read notes, listen to a story that clearly has an agenda to it, and that's all. The story line felt rather forced and unnatural and perhaps even a bit silly. After an hour I began to get bored with trying to reveal this preposterous story by digging through every drawer in the house in the hope that there might be another bit of info that would help the story progress a bit, I just gave up.

The game is boring. That's the best term I can think of for it. It's just flat out boring. A close runner-up term is "overrated". I truley think that the only reason this game won any Game of the Year nominations is becasue *Spoilers from here* it has a homosexual character that is not a blatant sterotype or a negative caricature. I agree that it's an important step to have characters like this in modern storytelling, but raving about it and handing out 10/10 scores is just misleading to a consumer.\nThe story is an extremely standard one of teenage romance with the only true difference being the homosexuality. It's so paint-by-the-numbers that I had called the plot after the first two or three notes from your sister. Initially I was not too annoyed by this because at the beginning of the game they start with an atmosphere of a horror game and I thought perhaps the gay sister storyline would take backseat to something far more interesting. Unfortunatley as the game went on it became more and more clear that the horror aspect was just used as a way to pull people in enough to listen to what turned out to be a dull and cliched story. I was really, desperatley hoping that at the end the writers had done something different, such as finding out that the sister had commited suicide in the attic after her lover leaves her to join the army or something completley out of left field like her demon-ghost uncle ate her, but no. No, we just get the "Oh, she changed her mind about joining the army and now we're going to live happily ever after away from our parents who just don't understand our love blah blah blah" boring, cliched ending.\nIn the end I just felt cheated by this game. There are vague rumblings about a much more interesting story within this game (ghosts, crazy uncles), but they are complete Red Herrings to keep you interested enough to suffer through the teenage angst story. Even now, several months after playing this, I still get angry when I think about my wasted time and money. I am disappointed by the game so much that I wish I could remove it from my game library, even if I didn't get any money back for it (Thankfully I got it during a sale and did not pay the outrageous $20 that the game normally costs).\n\nSeriously, if you want a purely narrative driven game then there are games that do so much better than this (Walking Dead, The Stanley Parable, The Wolf Among Us, Myst, Monkey Island, etc.). Please look anywhere else if you want a game that makes you feel, unless you love the feeling of boredom.","February 14, 2014","false","1.3"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

I'm not motivated enough to organize my thoughts to the extent that I can fully express my disappointment with the game, especially given that I will likely be repeating what previous reviews have said, but after completing it I am simply bewildered that Gone Home has received the acclaim that it has.\n\nUnderstand that if you buy this game at full price, you are being completely ripped off. I went through the game very leisurely on an afternoon and finished it in a couple of hours. It is also pure narrative, containing no puzzles of any kind. I didn't find the story particularly engaging, and I realized long before its conclusion that the reason no members of the main character's family were home would not be remotely interesting. I do appreciate when games (and media in general) touch on themes that are underrepresented, but this game does so in a way that is far too obvious; if the player was 15 minutes into the game and then learned what unfolds in the rest of the narrative, he/she would not receive any surprises. One specific thing I did appreciate about way the story of Gone Home was presented was the subtle presentation of the nature of the parents' relationship, allowing the player to reach his/her own conclusions about, for example, the irony of the tumult present within their marriage despite their harsh judgment of their daughter's relationship.\n\nI hesitate to refer to Gone Home as a game, as it truly just amounts to walking through the house, reading notes, and listening to recordings of the main character's sister. Picking up objects in the house adds nothing to the game, so if you are hoping at least for item investigation in the vein of L.A. Noire crime scenes, you will be completely disappointed. Gameplay-wise, the one thing you do in the game, walking, isn't even particularly fluid. Walking through the house was not a fun experience.\n\nEven if this game had been free, it still wouldn't have been worth the time I spent playing it. Do not let the high review scores fool you into thinking that you should at least play this game so that you can know this segment of the video game canon. Its sole contribution is having a story that revolves around adolescent homosexuality, and it does not even do that in a way that is remotely interesting or innovative. Not only does this game not do anything new, it strips out all elements that make a game fun to play (or that actually make a game a game).\n\nThis is coming from someone who loves video games of all kinds as an art form, considers unique indie games such as Braid and Limbo among his favorite games: I would not recommend buying this game at any price. I would not even recommend spending the time playing this game if you receive it for free. If you must, look up the audio recordings and listen to them, and you will truly have just about the full experience that you would if you had spent the couple of hours that it takes to trudge around the house. I think the reviewers who gave this game so much hype are completely mistaken about its quality, and I will never fathom how it could remotely be in the conversation for Game of the Year in the same year that saw the release of The Last of Us.","June 24, 2014","false","3.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xarnis/recommended/232430/","xarnis","Xarnis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xarnis/","284 products in account","I'm surprised by the near unanimous praise this game has received from the game critics. There is, essentially, nothing to really like about this game. At its core, Gone Home a simplistic means of giving a story, one that is pieced together through wandering around a spooky house and retreiving keys to open locked doors, revealing letter fragments, postcards, and magazines which inform the player on the story at hand. Specific items will cue voice-over readings from "Sam's Journal" (Sam, being the player character's younger sister) which are the essential bits of plot. So, it's an explortion, plot-driven game dealing with societal issues. Sounds like a winner, right?\n\nIn theory, I suppose so.\n\nThe game starts off well enough, with an eerie introduction to the "psycho house" and the first 15 minutes or so are pure exploration. We see the reamains of the father's book writings and the mother's job as a park ranger. It's interesting to slowly learn about this family's life... until you go upstairs. (a light spoiler or two may follow, so be warned. Nothing serious, just conceptual stuff). The plot begins its course, revolving around Sam, and her love life. What began with such a promising opening becomes a series of "pseudo-exploration" journeys (you're really just looking for the next page to move the damn plot along), while Sam delivers an incredibly sappy and cliche love story through her diary pages. And my, how saccharine it is. Just because you change the gender roles of those involved does not automatically make a stroy like this "innovative and unique." Sure, it's a change in perspective, but it follows the same beats, the same events that drive nearly every other teen romance ever. All the creepy atmosphere and dark undertones are completely wasted by the end. It really is unfortunate.\n\nA few other minor gripes plague my view of Gone Home. There is no player marker on the map (which, admittedly, isn't used too often), which had me lost a few times. Thankfully, the house isn't too complex so the confusion wasn't a huge deal. Another downside is the game's runtime. It can easly be beaten in under an hour, and the maximum amount of time one can spend in this game cannot be more than 2 hours (assuming they just play through the story once). There's little reason to return, and no interesting plot threads to keep you thinking. Such a short runtime has had me wonder whether this would have worked better as a short film, or a music video or SOMETHING other than a game. Although, in that case, it would probably be worse than it already is, because the story would be given directly, as opposed to the more "vignette-esque" presentation in the game. In any event, the game is too short to be a game. If it had to be this short, and the story could not have been told in any other format, I would argue the game should not have been made at all. I don't want to spend money on a game that will only keep me entertained for one hour, and it's even worse considering this is not a particularily good one to begin with.\n\nIn short, Gone Home is a lackluster title that showed brief glimmers of promise. It was rather disappointing to essntially watch a game crumble before my eyes.\n\n2/5","September 18, 2014","false","1.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

The Stanley Parable was funny and very enjoyable, as was Jazzpunk, Fract OSC has a great music element, Naissancee had some great platforming and interesting exploration, and Kairo had some cool, minimalistic puzzles. Correction, I like walking simulators if there's something to do in the game.\n\nThere is nothing to do in Gone Home. Going into this game, I expected a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece the way the review scores were mapped out. Every reviewer was basically giving this unlimited amounts of praise. Turns out that this was a poorly written short story disguised as a "game."\n\nIn Gone Home, you play as a person who goes home to see their family, but realizes no one is home. You go inside and walk around, to try to find journals to piece together a "story". The game takes around an hour to finish and it will be a thoroughly unenjoyable one. First of all, there really is no gameplay. If holding the W key and clicking the Left Mouse Button often is called gameplay to you, then you'll have a fun time. I appreciate the design, but if you're making a short story, MAKE A ♥♥♥♥ING SHORT STORY. If I pay money for a game, I'm paying money for a game. Don't give me this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about how it is an experience, or something like that. This is supposed to be a game. I expect a game. The other only thing that the game really has is story. And boy, they couldn't even do that right.\n\nIf people tell you the story is engaging, they are certainly lying to you. The story is something I person cannot relate with , and I doubt 90% of people will be able to either. It also doesn't help that this is the most cliched story ever. You'll probably be able to guess the ending halfway through the game, and if you can't, you haven't read enough sappy love tales. This game probably would have been better IF they made a good story. If a walking simulator has a fascinating story, then I will be able to enjoy it. Unfortunately this falls in the same category as garbage video games like Dear Esther, which have the worst of both worlds when it comes to gameplay and story. I'm sick of people saying that this game is amazing, because this isn't even a game. This is an interactive story, that sounds like it was written by a Grade 6 child who was forced to write a story about life experiences or something like that.\n\nIf you were even thinking about purchasing this game, turn away and buy something else. Luckily I had this in a bundle, but please don't drop 20 bucks, or 5 bucks even for this game. If you search up "Lesbian Love Story" online, you'll find thousands of stories better than this.

Why? Because in the (roughly) two hours it took me to complete the game I did little more than walk around the titular home flicking on light switches, examining objects and listening to diary recordings. The problem, in a nutshell, is that there is not really any actual game play.\n\nWhile I am completely for games expanding the gaming medium and giving us deep, well crafted stories the fact that the medium is games requires there to be some actual game in there. Gone Home does not even require you to solve puzzles. Indeed, you need not examine any of the objects in the game at all to reach its end as simply wandering around the house will eventually lead you to the conclusion. Yes, if you did that you'd miss a wonderful story and some subtle back story on the characters but the point it is can be done.\n\nGone Home tried something different in being all about story and very minimum game play. However, this is to the game's detriment because (I would assume) even the most casual of gamer would expect some kind of game play element and Gone Home simply provides none.\n","February 13, 2015","false","1.9"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

I'm reluctant to recommend Gone Home because I could not relate to it at all. I got all the 90's references but I had a very hard time empathizing with the experience and the characters. Maybe I had to be a teenage girl in the 90's to grasp it. It was just uninteresting to me. By comparison, Dear Esther was more appealing and that was dry.\n\nThat said, the narrative devices are very artfully implemented. The structure truly demonstrates the way that only an interactive medium like games can deliver such an experience. I liken it to a Janet Cardiff & George Bures Miller walk.\n\nI enjoy experiencing interactive narratives but I'd prefer a more interesting narrative than Gone Home.","December 20, 2013","false","1.7"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

I tried Gone Home to see what it was all about, and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI won't go into too much detail for spoiler reasons, but the main story is you return home from a lengthy overseas holiday to find the house empty. It's a big house, a mansion, and it's up to you to piece together what happened while you were away. At least that's how I saw it.\n\nIf you can suspend your disbelief long enough (a full year holiday is a bit of a stretch of the imagination these days, not to mention the coincidence of the whole family moving houses while you were on holiday!), it's a very thoughtful set piece - an example of how circumstances and relationships can change radically when you aren't there.\n\nGraphics are ok, considering most everything is a static object. Attention to detail can be good sometimes, and there are several nick-nacks that could be considered easter eggs. Things like a mess of bills on the kitchen table we can relate to; finding condoms eliciting a very specific reaction, post-it notes and little notes to other family members reminding them of things, or telling them off. Some may find it a little dark in the literal sense - for me it became a quick fumble for light switches upon entering new rooms. It's understandable though - a storm was brewing outside and no one was home. A nice touch was a note I found to the protagonist's sister along the vein of "Don't leave the lights on like your sister does", especially since that was exactly what I was doing...\n\nThe story progresses as you find your sister's journal entries. I found the voice acting superb for these, but felt that once I was done and the game had ended, I was left wanting to know what happens next.\n\nUltimately I think it needs more for you to do, more story and more gameplay for me to truly consider it as a game, but it makes a nice effort.","December 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 46 of 83 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","46","83","2","2"

It will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior games clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis.\n\nWhen the headphones peel off, and it occurs that real people created this, it's clear that The Fullbright Company must be the greatest developer alive, if not the best since Romero.

That is the first thing that comes to mind, when I think about the story of Gone Home. I was pretty disappointed by it, tbh. After what I heard I expected way more and eventually it just fell pretty flat. It gets points for touching upon topics we don't see often in gaming, but ultimately, for a story-game, or an art-game, or whatever weird modifiers it has tacked onto it, the story sure feels very cliched.\n\nIn some ways it feels like every story I’ve ever seen. It is told in a unique way, yes, but it could easily be the plot of a teen comedy about “finding yourself” and “becoming who you are,” or something. While the exploring and the nostalgia trip into my youth of the '90 was fun, it is not worth the high prize of 20 bucks. At all. Especially not, since you get only two up to three hours of gaming out of it, tops.\n\nIf you really want it, I would recommend to wait until it is *really* low-prized during a sale to justify its purchase.","December 25, 2013","false","3.8"," 50 of 92 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","50","92","0","0"

That's the best way to describe this.  Would have made an ok short story, but as a game it's just dull.  Pick a thing up, read something or someone talks to you, move to the next thing.\n\nThis tends to be my view of all walking sims, they're picture books you interact with, and honestly I'd rather just read it if there's no meat to it.  No real puzzles, no challenges and most importantly no failure state means I just can't support this being called a game.   And YES there could have been plenty of little challenges to make it a "game".  This is the story, from what I remember, of a teenager, they couldn't have owned a puzzle box or two to hold their things?  Couldn't have had some diary entries or notes written in code?  Couldn't have had a story item hidden and put 2-3 clues for a neat scavenger hunt?  Yes I did these things as a teenager, and yes it was fun.  You can have walking sims (which are interactive books, not games) and add content that will make it into a game.  It's not hard if you try.\n\nNow I love me the hell out of narrative, story is the most important thing in a game to me, but when the story wouldn't even be 20 pages if it were in a book, then why am I paying so much for it in "game" form?  If this were 2-3 bucks I'd probably say to give it a try if you like this sort of thing, but for 20 damn bucks?  No, not on your life.  When you can watch the game on youtube and get the EXACT SAME experience as playing it yourself, then: 1 it's not a game and 2 the dev failed to even try to make it one.\n\nTL;DR:  An interactive pop up book basically that's not terrible like some people say, however charging 20 bucks for this "game" is a sure fire sign that the devs are too damn full of themselves.  5 bucks MIGHT be ok for this but not 20 bucks.  There are hundreds of much MUCH better games out there with stories as good or better than this that feature actual game play.

I can respect that as a genre, but I feel this game could've been so much more. I don't care what PC Gamer or IGN said, I honestly wasn't blown away by the story. I didn't find it nearly as deep or immersive as the critics hype it up to be. The characters feel flat because we're not really told that much about them. You're supposed to go hunt around for notes and things to learn more about them, but even then, I felt like I was missing something. The in-depth character development just wasn't there. Overall, as a story, it's just too broad and underdeveloped. I dunno; it just feels like Thomas Was Alone and Papers, Please did a better job of evoking character depth and emotion than this game did.\n\nI think part of the reason I was disappointed was because I went in expecting a game laced with horror elements.  That's how it opened, anyway; dark and stormy night, a lot of lights turned off... But then it just gave me this. There's virtually no gameplay to speak of other than wandering around from place to place and occasionally interacting with things to keep the story going, but that's really it. I could've forgiven that if the story wasn't so shallow and confused (Actually, I really can't quite find the right words to describe the story). I also feel I spent too much time wandering around trying to figure out where I'm supposed to go or what to do.\n\nI wouldn't say this is the best indie game of the year. I'd give that title to a game like The Stanley Parable or Papers, Please. Those games really mess with your mind and make you question yourself as a person. Gone Home is a reasonable concept that fell short in execution. If you're really curious, wait for it to get cheaper; this game is not worth full price, and I can't really recommend it even then.","February 14, 2014","false","1.2"," 42 of 77 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","42","77","0","0"

Hell, the whole setting and ideas are cliche that I've already seen in movies and better games.\n\nThe story is nothing original, it's just another melodramatic story that was already told before.  The narrative is told through voice over journal of Samantha, letters and paperworks that you'll find in the house, I will give props to the voice acting for the character Samantha as she does bring this character to life with her performence.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/recommended/232430/","suspectfenster","fenster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/","150 products in account","Gone Home is not a game for everyone.  There’s no combat, no action, no cutscenes, no stats, no leveling up, and no heroics.  It’s a short experience, and those who are looking at a strict dollars to hours ratio will find Gone Home one of the worst monetary investments available on the market (especially at its original retail price).  That said, Gone Home is intimately unique and compelling game for those who are drawn to a story mechanic which is tragically underrepresented in video games -- the human experience.\n\nIn Gone Home, you play a young 20-something woman who has come back from travelling Europe on a late flight home in the 1990s. Gameplay starts just outside the home, where you find the house seemingly vacant with some hints that something may be wrong.  The rest is up to you to figure out by exploring the house and investigating what happened and where everybody is.  Primarily, you are following the story of your younger sister, but your parents and the old tenant of the home also form a bit of a side story -- should you choose to piece it together.\n\nOccasionally you will pick up an item which will trigger a small journal entry from your sister, but outside of that, the entire story is really yours to unfold via inference.  Gone Home draws no connections for you, but rather lets you connect the dots yourself as your travel from room to room and pick up items or just observe the detailed environment around you.  You could choose not to do this and beeline to the end of the game, but fleshing out the world in which you and your family live is the primary satisfaction of Gone Home.\n\nIt certainly helps that the setting is expertly realized.  Gone Home takes place in the 1990’s, ostensibly to help explain the plethora of hand-written notes strewn about the house which help with unravelling the mystery of the house. But the entire home is crafted with obvious obsession to detail -- you’ll find lots of references to 1990s pop culture and fashion, and those living in the Pacific NW will find a lot of familiar names and places which are central to its Oregon setting.  Occasionally it does feel like Gone Home is almost pandering its setting a little too much to those who will appreciate the references, but for the most part I found it well done.\n\nThe second brilliant part of Gone Home is hard to talk about without ruining the narrative a little (so if you are serious about playing this game and have not done so, maybe skip this paragraph).  Gone Home takes place at night, during a thunderstorm, in an old house with a mysterious (perhaps supernatural) history.  It’s not an inherently scary game, but it’s undeniably spooky at times.  The catch is that Gone Home makes its presentation at face value -- it lets the player craft the story into something more than it really is based on the expectations of it being a video game.  Gone Home plays on these expectations in some genius ways, and at the end of the game leaves the player with a refreshing narrative not about saving the world or killing the bad guy, but about an experience that each and every player can relate to in some way that is meaningful and personal.\n\nIf you’re the type of player looking for bang-for-buck, or something more action-oriented, Gone Home was never going to be your game and that’s fine. But everyone else should consider this a must-play, if nothing else because it is a wonderful and refreshing diversion from the norm.","January 6, 2015","true","1.9"," 300 of 574 people (52%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","52","300","574","13","0"

It's an activity, much akin to coloring or picking at an old scab.\nAnd for that matter, you don't really "play" it either. You sort of just wander around fiddling with the objects, trying to find the thing that makes the story progress. It's more of an experience. You just kind of… just… do it. You finish it. That’s it.\n\nSo, after finishing this activity…\nI rolled my eyes harder than The Exorcist.\nI rolled my eyes so hard that I went blind. I’m blind now. I don’t even know how I’m writing this right now. Gone Home made me go blind.\n\nI had a lot of people tell me not to play this ga---\nI mean “finish” this “activity.”\nHowever, before I judge anything, I always like to give it the chance . So I did it anyway. When I got around to experiencing it, the bar was set pretty low to begin with because of all the negative things I heard. Meaning that really anything could surpass it and impress me, right?\n\nIf you think that, you’d be wrong.\n\nWell, it was sort of interesting in the beginning, just getting used to how everything worked. Being alone in the house with a bunch of creepy noises was unnerving. Sort of reminded me of when I was a kid growing up in a big old house. But once I got settled in, I realized how… bored I actually was. I was able to figure out the “twist” about halfway through, but saw it through to completion anyway. I tricked a friend into buying it for me for $4.99 during the Steam summer games sale, and I still somehow feel ripped off.  I can’t imagine how the people who paid $19.99 for it feel.\n\nMany would argue that it’s supposed to be all about the story, and not the “gameplay” (and those quotation marks could NOT be more sarcastic).  But, again, the story is absolute tripe. Again, I was able to figure out the ending halfway through,  and it wasn’t nearly as deep and moving as people like Adam Sessler would lead people to believe. He even gave it his “Game of the Year” for 2013.  Wow, a game that’s not even a game winning “Game of the Year.” And I LOVE Adam Sessler. But sorry kiddo, you’re wrong on this one.\n\nThis is not a game. It's a story-telling activity disguised in a video game-like format. And the story's not even all that good. I mean, maybe if the story were a bit more interesting...\n\nWell, I suppose the story might be moving for people who have gone through/are going through the same struggles as the characters. However, I personally DO know exactly what the little sister is going though, having gone through some of the same struggles myself (that’s about as much as I can say without spoiling it.) But even I did not find it as satisfying as “game journalist” (more sarcastic quotes) made it out to be. And again, my bar was set pretty damn low. And it couldn’t even surpass my low expectations. And this is the kind of game that should appeal to exactly someone like me. It's nice to see a game go this route as far as character traits go. But...\n\nNope. Just nope.\n\nI don’t really know what I was expecting, but it definitely wasn’t this.\n\nTo wrap this up, I can never recommend this. However, I don’t blame you if you want to experience it yourself. Like most people. I don’t want someone making my mind up for me, I want to do it for myself.

The atmosphere is spot on, the story is believable, the mystery is alive, and the whole thing feels very real. However, what nobody told me is that the game is boring. I quit playing three times and had to force myself to sit down to finish the story in the end.\nAt first it was fun finding little things spread throughout the house and making the story better known and finding little secrets is always satisfying, but after looking through five rooms I lost the investment for the rest of the game. There are a couple of little things thrown in that get some sort of amused reaction from me, but the game wasn't worth the price. Save your time and money and just have someone else tell you what happens.

You then hear a story about the Player characters' sister and her struggles in understanding her feelings about one of her closest friends. The main problem I see, is the game is a walking simulator with the audio diary of a teenage girl attached to it, and really there isn't enough in that to keep me enthralled.\n\n(Don't get me wrong, It isn't that I dislike walking simulators, because I think that "The Stanley Parable" is potentially one of my favorite games of all time) But...\n\nPersonally I didn't really enjoy it. I felt more emotion in playing a comicbook zombie game (The Walking Dead) than I did while playing this. Even though there are many things that I can relate to in the games subject matter including some things about the main story plot, but I rarely felt a shred of emotion whilst playing it.\n\nSome might just write this off and say I'm dead inside or whatever. But I know that isn't entirely true because there were times that  I wanted the story to be more about her problems with her adjusting to a new environment and school (meaning a bunch of problems with making friends and bullying) and that TO ME would have made for a much better story and probably would have invoked more of an emotional response from me than the actual game ever did.\n\nI would recommend buying it just on the off chance that you would like it much more than I did.

It looked like some sort of creepy exploration game, that slowly builds the tension as you discover more and more. However my interest disappeared more or less when I learned it was hardly a two hour experience for the price of 20 dollars. I watched a video of the first few minutes of the game, it seemed to have that atmosphere I liked yet I still just lost complete interest. No way I was gonna buy that for 20 dollars for such a short amount of time. Of course, I, like everyone else saw the sharp difference between critics and players. Which more often than not, I agree with the players. I know how current video game critics are, and I have disagreed with most of them and their rave reviews of the latest innovative indie game or the latest flashy AAA game. Regardless, I went in with an open mind, I could easily enjoy the game. I didn't expect much, I suppose that gives the game a better chance to impress me.\n\nThe story was lacking, it didn't surpass my already nonexistant expectations of the game. The story just happens as you collect the various items, you slowly find out about how your sister was shunned by everyone at school and eventually found love with another girl. That's really it. Sure, you get some more detail about how her family denies her love for another woman, and some nice tidbits about the activities they do together and the ideas of their future, yet it all fell flat. It happened, and I felt no substance. Nothing truly interesting, nothing that made me enjoy each journal entry. It felt bare, maybe even forced; each journal entry is quick and useless. I'm not one for love stories, yet I have enjoyed love stories in various non-romance genres; this is just a story of your young sister falling in love with another girl and then running off with her. I saw the twist coming, which shouldn't impact the quality of the story but yet the story had nothing going for it anyway. The characters aren't bad, the setting isn't bad, their struggles aren't bad, it just wasn't interesting; it had not a single thing going for it. It just happened, and then it was over. Story is certainly the primary focus of the game, the experience finishes before it even starts; Full Bright's narrative will leave a lackluster taste in your mouth, it's clear that the story wants to be meaningful yet never works for it.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is one of the few things I think game does fairly well with. It's a nice flashback to the mid-90s. From Street Fighter to Pulp fiction, every little reference fits perfectly. It was nice seeing the details over the CD/LP player. Even the cover art of the textbooks scream 90s. They nailed making the house feel like it belongs in the 90s. The house itself feels creepy, not a soul in the home that seems both alive with knit-knacks everywhere while dead with some barren rooms filled only with boxes. The few places that feel they have life to them are both refreshing and creepy. The darkness certainly adds another edge to the creepiness yet all this creepiness and potiental terror soon washes away when you realize the game only cares about the light exploration; adding no depth to the atmosphere. While the game has an eye for detail of the era, it lacks detail in everything else. The house is lifeless in the wrong way possible, there were no extra details provided to the experience. Add some occasional random ambient noise, some creepy squeeking of the boards, a more complex engine that gives some realism to the world instead of everything you grab feeling like the lifeless assets that they are, etc. Hell, in the game you find your sister's book that goes on about her hunting ghosts, that could of been a really nice trigger to have some more creepy things happen in the house. Perhaps some creepy noises as said before, or an object making a strange shadow in a room. Yet all that potiental isn't used at all. The game's details begins and ends at the recontruction of a 90s home. The house provides no other purpose other than a lifeless realm to find some details about the family, with the sound of the thunder storm outside looping again and again. For such a short game that the developers pride in an immerisve experience, I expected the home to be leagues more complex.\n\nGraphics weren't anything impressive. In fact, the most impressive thing visually is the background of the main menu; I would of vastly prefered the game used that style instead of this vaguely realisitic style. The characters in the photos look strange and unintentionally hilarious with the aesthetic. These photos even clash with the celebrity photos that were obviously ripped from real pictures instead of applying the style used with the family photos. The textures letters, books, and anything else with text are impressive; it's nice that you can read the words even without selecting the pictures when most games would have them be a pixel mess until you select them.\n\nSound design is minimal and lacking. I didn't expect some amazing audio but I expected something leagues more immersive. Again, the atmosphere could of been built up much better with the right use of sound design. Even some footsteps would have been nice.\n\nVoice acting is nice. I wouldn't say it was anything amazing, it was simple and nice. I got no feeling that the actresses were trying too hard, they fit their roles nicely.\n\nLevel design isn't terrible nor is it good, it's always interesting to discover little short cuts or areas you didn't notice before. Gone's Home length ultimately hurts the level design for its only meant to be gone through once. The game is straightforward, if you go from room to room properly, there is no need to visit a room twice. You can just finish the game within 30 seconds if you remember a specific hidden room. The level design offers a possible "oh wow" moment that only works once. There is no lasting appeal for the level design because of the limited style of its content.  The house is small for length and content standards, ruining all lasting appeal.\n\nThe gameplay has you explore the house and read messages and sometimes listening to them. That's it. Point and click games have mastered with variety in the gameplay way before Gone Home was in development yet Gone Home didn't even try this. Exploration is limited and utlimately wasted in such level design.\n\nUltimately Gone Home feels like a prototype of a game, meant to wow potiental investors with a basic guideline of the game compressed into a lengthy demo. While in reality, Gone Home is a complete game sold for 20 dollars filled with potiental yet is outdone by any other point and click game that has come decade before it. Full bright prides Gone Home as a immersive, engaging tale told by the exploration in a seemingly dead home while in reality it is a game with a empty storyline that wants to engage you but never does, a house designed to immerse you yet gives up five minutes in, and gameplay that doesn't attempt anything new after the first room.\n\nThis game feels like critic bait, critics went crazy over it apparantly because it offers a meaningful story. It instead feels like they are going crazy over it because it's a minimal game in a industry filled with complex games, a minimal game that concerns a plot about two girls falling in love. The story has no substance but the fact it concerns a story about characters that are not in the forefront in games, it gets rave reviews. Or even more simply, reviewers being paid off or pushing an agenda, as video game journalism has frequently been subject to. Love stories have been done better in games that don't concern love stories, hell I find KotOR II did a better lovestory with Handmaiden and that's completely optional.\n\nDon't believe people that say Gone Home isn't a game, it certainly is a game, it's a bad game.","September 20, 2014","false","2.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

Ask yourself: “Is it enjoyable?” If it is, then whether or not it’s technically a game is irrelevant.\n\nI enjoyed Gone Home despite it lacking typical aspects of a “game.” The main character is a girl who’s just returned from traveling abroad but there’s no one home. By scavenging the house for clues, information is revealed at a steady pace until the main plot is resolved. During this process, details about her family are uncovered, forming several subplots that I assumed would tie together. While only the big question was directly answered at the end, speculations can be made about the others.\n\nSet in the 90s, the game is packed with nostalgia; from SNES cartridges to magic eye posters (that actually work). It’s a great touch and it got a few laughs out of me, but the real value is in the mystery of the story. Curiosity kept me going, and the game kept giving me just enough motivation to keep pushing through it. At two hours it’s a little short, and I would have liked to have seen more about the parents and uncle. For $20 I can’t recommend it but if you catch it on sale, definitely pick it up.\n\nIf I had to rate my level of enjoyment on a scale of 1 to 10, it would be a 6. The brevity really killed it for me, but it’s a solid story and probably deserves a higher rating. Either way, Gone Home is a great debut by the Fullbright Company, and I’m looking forward to whatever they’re next project may be.\n\nDigital Logik PC Gaming[dlgaming.net]","December 27, 2013","true","2.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Unfortunately, the narrative gets a free pass to be abysmally shallow for this.

The juvinile ending that would feel right at home in a cheap young adult romance fanfiction truly lacks substance - yet the game treats it as though it's something incredible and beautiful.

I'm not going to argue if this is a game or not. If it is to you, that's all that matters. Those who consider this feminist propaganda are just being ridiculous, as are those who hate it because of the subject matter it covers, one tragically overlooked in video games by and large.\n\nI did not care for Gone Home because it's a thoroughly unengaging experience that tells a poignant but utterly generic story with some of the most tired methods possible. There are no mechanics in Gone Home, you simply traverse an environment, picking up and looking at objects, some of which have no importance to the story, some of which do. At certain points, you will trigger disjointed (albeit well acted) audio logs which is how the core of the story is conveyed to you. You have the freedom to wander around most of the environment but as with traditional games, you are gated off from certain areas until required objectives are fulfilled. You do not directly interact with any other characters and your character is a silent protagonist.\n\nThe problem is that the storytelling in Gone Home relies on tired, unoriginal methods like gated progress and audio logs, two things people frequently railed against as being lazy, dated design but which are somehow revolutionary here. The story itself is also bland, uninteresting and cliché and personally, I've seen almost this exact kind of story told in other venues many times. The subject matter could have been explored in so many interesting ways and instead, we got an interactive after-school special that may as well not have been interactive. There's no subtlety or organic discovery as the designers claimed, the core elements of the story are delivered to you when they want them to. There is no ambiguity or room for interpretation in what's being said and just in case you still don't get it, many of the audio logs involving the core subject will have objects nearby that clearly beat you over the head with what's trying to be said. In Gone Home, you will interpret the story the way the designers want you to.\n\nThere are so many other examples of games that try to tell deep and meaningful stories and are able to do so with actual mechanics and game play. Papers Please and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons are two examples released in the same year that did so brilliantly. If you have a PS3 or PS4, the Left Behind DLC for The Last of Us actually tackles the same core subject matter of Gone Home but does so wrapped around game play and I found it to be a much more impacting and meaningful experience. I can't remember more than a few core elements of Gone Home's story but I remember everything from Left Behind.\n\nWhat I believe was the intent behind Gone Home was a noble one but it was badly executed. If you want emotional storytelling in games, there are better places to get it and better examples of the subject matter as well. It's also 2 hours long at best which is not a great value to many either. In my opinion, this is one of the most overrated games of the last several years and so many better and similar games deserved the success this got. Maybe get it on a deep sale if you're curious but it's not worth nearly it's normal asking price.","June 15, 2014","false","1.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

There is nothing to recommend or not recommend.\n\n*EDIT*\nDoes a single person have even 5 hours in this "game".  Think about that before you buy.\n\nI might have even a drop of respect for someone who puts their time where their mouth is and plays this game for a good 20 hours. Games that are good get played. People who spend more time telling people how good something is instead of enjoying it themselves are viewed as dishonest and probably have either a political or religious agenda (id est, people who say how great the bible is haveing spent only 3 hours reading it in their entire life).\n\nGone home fails not only as a game but as a story. The only part that might have made this Twilight-esque millennial trash have some redeeming value was at the end when going up to the attic, I genuinely felt concern that I might find the remains of the sister after she had committed suicide in short-sighted childish despair.\n\nThat was foolish of me thinking there would be real drama or consequences in millennial trash. After all that might upset or “trigger” or challenge some poor millennial special bubble child and we can't have that. So instead we have an ending where the sister engages in pure unfettered egotistical desire without thought for family or consequence. Since it is millennial trash after all, the story must end there without exploring the consequences of such childish actions. No opportunity for growth or learning or introspection. No character development. Just millennial trash pretending to be art.\n\nAlthough perhaps I'm being too harsh. Maybe the value is in pure intellectual masturbation. I'm not a Christian conservative puritan (id est not a feminist) so I have no moral objections to good old fashion purposeless masturbation. Even this however, Gone Home fails at. You see masturbation is an enjoyable experience that people who partake in often repeat. How many supporters of Gone Home have even 20 hours in the game? Even 5?\n\nGone Home fails as a game, it fails as a story, it fails as art, and even fails as masturbation.","November 14, 2014","false","4.2"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

In general it was pretty creepy and you expect something to eventually happen, but (sorry if this spoils it) nothing ever does. The game is probably better if you start off with an expectation like that because you'll either A) decide then to never play Gone Home, or B) play it while keeping your hopes low. The story is okay, you find clues and then the game usually confirms your suspicions with sporadic pieces of monologue. Sound and music-- there isn't much. There is mostly silence and the occassional thunder and I liked that. When the game's music does come up it's because you triggered it and it has these warm tones that make you feel kinda good. Then there's the punk cassettes. The songs fit the game, although I found them to be annoying, barely tolerable at best. There isn't much to the gameplay. Not a whole lot of purpose to your inventory. You can interact with almost any object but there usually isn't any significance to it. Overall my expectations were too high going into this game. I kept thinking something scary was going to happen or something hugely serious, like finding your sister hanging from a noose in the next room, walking in on your parent's beating one another, your Uncle's ghost chasing you, or stumbling upon your old neighbor who came back for his Street Fighter game and is now going insane chopping up your whole family while you were away relaxing across the world for a whole f*cking year. Seriously, how well off are you that you can go on vacation for an entire year? Anyway, at one point the game basically tells you straightforward that you're going to walk in on your sister banging. And you're like wow! This game is nuts! This could be hilarious and interesting! Then the story turns and it doesn't happen. Like I said, nothing ever happens. Gone Home is really just a waste of a few hours. It's like reading a fairly dull short book that you can move around in.\n\nI originally bought this game because a friend and I thought it looked hilarious, yet people were saying that it was good. Ya know how sometimes you just want to watch a movie or play a game that seems like it might be so corny that it becomes entertaining? At worst, I figured even if it's not funny apparently it should still be a good game based on people's reviews. I got it on sale. Thought we'd have a few light beers and a lighthearted time, but the game's funny-but-not-supposed-to-be parts are too few and far between and the serious parts are too frequent that you can't even enjoy the game in that cheap way either.\n\nSo if you can't enjoy Gone Home in a serious way, and you can't enjoy it in a ridiculous way, then I have no idea why you'd still want to try to play this game.","November 10, 2015","false","5.6"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","18","32","0","0"

I mention Dear Ester because it's the only other one of these kinds of environmental walk-through non-games I've played. And while the storyline is more coherent in Gone Home than it was in Dear Esther, I don't really know if the ending or the payoff was as fulfilling or uplifting. Definitely the graphics don't even come close to the environment in Dear Esther.\n\nAlso in contrast to Dear Esther, there's no headscratching at the end to make me think about later, or any reason to revisit it at all once it's over. Gone Home didn't make me feel smart for figuring out these clues on my own; the story is basically spoon-fed to you. I saw the ending a mile away.\n\nAnd though they paint it to be a happy ending, I don't think it really is if you consider the character you've been listening to, Sam, and her final decision at the end of the game. HOW WAS THAT A GOOD IDEA? Congratulations, your girlfriend is now a military deserter, which I'm pretty sure the Army doesn't take lightly. I hope you enjoy living in Canada.\n\nYou've also just alienated your entire family. You're not the first person to come out to their parents whose initial reaction was negative but eventually turned around. How is running away from home going to endear them any more to you? You also just left your big sister to explain the whole situation to them once they get back from their second honeymoon to rekindle a relationship that was already on the rocks. And you also left her the task of CLEANING UP YOUR STUPID ♥♥♥♥ you left all over the house, because I'm pretty sure they wouldn't appreciate finding the witchcraft stuff. OUR DAUGHTER IS A LESBIAN DEVIL-WORSHIPER. Yeah. That'll go over well.\n\nSorry. I just had to get that out. It's been bugging me.\n\nAlso, for a family with so many secrets, they sure don't have a problem leaving their dirty laundry everywhere so it's easy to find.  Welcome home, Daughter, to the most passive-agressive family in Portland. If I was her, I'd hop on the next plane back to Paris.\n\nDo I recommned it? I don't know. I guess if you have 3 hours to kill and nothing else to do, and like experiencing stories that make you angry for the purpose of deconstructing them, like I do. It's short and not a huge investment.

It tells it's story through incredibly minimalist interaction with the enviroment and through the discovery of hints of the past, while listening to the "journal of sam". The story is entirely around this person, and not about the player character at all. And while the story is genuinely touching and heartfelt, It's not enough to make a game upon.\n\nThis is a game made by people who do not truly understand the medium of video games. This story could have been told better through more interactive means, have more to do, and simply put. make it more of a game than a walking around touching and looking at things simulator. You are a passive observer, looking at things, opening a door and the most imput you ever do is putting a key combination into something. It's entirely linear, it's stupidly easy and it tops out at maybe 2 hours total.  That's less than the length of a feature length movie on average.\n\nOverall, Gone Home's story is a touching hearfelt nostalgia heavy tale that is well worth experiencing, but it is completely wrong for the medium and is ridiculously overpraised. the 20 Dollar price tag is stupdendously overpriced for such a shallow experience. Video games are not cinema, and this is an example of why it does not work. For a game with such a touching story, to be so shallow, so short and so ...boring, it's almost criminal.","December 8, 2014","false","1.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

The characters are awfully copy-paste (maybe with a few gender swaps here and there), the story - one-dimensional and in result you exactly know where it's going long before the end.

(Free enough to gain the popular tag "Walking simulator" on Steam.) It isn't as much a game as a story, and after a playthrough I feel more like having been the main character of a movie or a book than having played a game. In Gone Home, you return to your parents' home after trip abroad just to find the house empty. Why you don't know, and you walk through the house trying to figure out what has happened.\n\nSo, how is the story? Good, yet predictable, and I like the concept of exploring in my own pace by turning household things around in my hands and reading through letters and newspapers. The game is, unexpectedly, not scary at all. Instead it is relaxing and piques my interest. The sound is atmospheric and contributes to a nice overall feeling. The experience is probably best a rainy autumn evening accompanied with a cup of tea.\n\nOther than that I don't have much to say. You walk around in a house, open doors, read notes, look at objects, and build your idea of what has happened.\n\nEven though the Gone Home is fun, its biggest problem is that it's far too expensive. I finished the game after 80 minutes, after taking my time and not rushing anything. The price on Steam is 20 EUR, so in the end the hourly rate is much higher than a visit to the cinema. If you like a good story and want an hour and a half of entertainment I recommend buying this game on a sale.\n\n3/10 note books","November 30, 2014","false","1.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It is pure edutainment. With saying that it's not a bad experience by any measure, the atmosphere is well done and manages to build tension in a game that ultimately has no pitfalls for the player. That might have more to do with me having played survival horror games prior to experiencing this one however. It also manages to produce some 90's nostalgia, woo.\n\nThe story, if it can be called such, is so transparently designed to evoke sympathy for the player character's sister's sexuality, and heavily layered on with schmaltz and cliches about dysfunctional Christian families, that the software has the effect of 'preaching' at the player, and the only ability you have is to either turn the game off or continue on for more 'preaching'. None of that by itself would be all that problematic if we were talking about a free web browser game, or a few-pence phone app game, but this is 15 quid outside of a sale! It is so not worth it in the slightest, I bought it during a sale for a few quid, and I'm pretty sure I got taken for a ride.\n\nIn short, unless you're keen on cultural marxist indoctrination, your money is best of spent elsewhere.","December 2, 2014","false","1.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It tries to send a message that, let's face it, has already been shown to us hundreds, if not, thousands of times over and over and over, and this walking simulator, the best word for it, aside from expletives, is just the same message. No one cares if the whole premise of this game is about a homosexual daughter leaving her home, rather than wasting resources and time on making a game, you go and demonstrate your opinions and ideas on the homosexual equality protests, in real life, at real parliaments. Rather than wasting money, and tricking users in to buying a game that can easily be structured down into one sentence. "Equality for homosexuals".\n\nIt's a waste of money, time, resources and effort, and let's fact it, it's just another way for YouTubers to make even MORE money.

My first one for The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim wasn't all that hot, so It's time to start acting my age and be more specific.  I'll still sound pretty rusty, but hopefully as time goes by I'll be more thorough with my reviews and be more specific about my experiences and and opinions.  Sorry, but bear with me on this one.\n\nOver all, even with a decent premise and a unique take in story telling, I wasn't too impressed.\n\nAudio/Visuals - Takes place in a first person view through an enire house that tells a story about a family.  Given the fact that the team was not the bloated size of most AAA game publishers, the atmosphere on here is actually pretty good.  Shadows casted when you turn on lights, examining objects when you pick them up (and seeing the 5.99 sticker on the holiday duck?  Priceless folks!), the thunderstorm echoing through the halls and room as you unravel the mystery of what has been going on with your family since your year round trip across Europe adds up to a great atmosphere of wonder and curiosity.  The minimal system requirements means that you can experience this short adventure without the fear of having to call the fire department.  Just make sure to get a good pair of headphones and turn the lights off.\n\nGameplay - The meat and bones of any game.  If your looking to grab a full infantry kit, tack on an ACOG on that spify SCAR-H and go blow up some 'dem brown folks because F.R.E.E.D.O.M.........\n\n......no, not here.  The game has an interesting take on exploration, going from room to room, interacting with drawers, turning on light switches, reading documents and journals, picking up seemingly mundane objects and discovering clues, and piecing together the whereabouts of your family (and specifically, the whereabouts of your sister).  Think along the lines of Dear Esther.\n\nStory - You'll see a lot of opinions claiming that the game only got it's positive exposure due to it's take on a current civil rights movement right now.  Sadly, Im beginning to agree with them.  It's difficult for me to share it without spoiling the entire story, and I'd think it's better for you to go along with the narrative then read about it here.  But all I can say is that it overall plays out in the end like a run of the mill MTV movie special.  It's the same old story that has been better told through better channels.\n\nOverall, I was just dissapointed with this game.  I knew better then to go in expecting the likes of Fallout or Morrowind.  And I was taken in by the amount of exploration and mystery that surrounded the happenings of the family.  But while the game is proof that videogames can definitely be a great meduim for art (hell, in this day of age wackjobs consider aborted fetuses a form of art), unfortinately it loses it's luster as it goes on, turing into a tale that just jumps on the bandwagon of pop culture.\n\n\n","August 5, 2014","false","1.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It drops you in an empty house with a storm outside, building a nice spooky atmosphere. A lot of little details and good voice acting really help build the feeling of the environment. However, that's the only thing that I can praise. I was expecting a scary game from the art style and ambience, but all I got was a dumb story about the main character's little sister. A cheesy teen romance is not praise-worthy and it's not material to be the focal point of a game.\nI love "interactive stories" more than most people and finding all the little pieces grabbed me at first, but the plot was predictable, uninteresting, and very run-of-the-mill. Hints of the mother cheating and the father's struggles with writing are only briefly mentioned before the focus returns to the stupid romance. The weak plot is unacceptable in a game that focuses so heavily on story (walking and clicking are the only gameplay mechanics - you can't even jump).\n\nTL;DR: This game is well executed, but not good.

This is not worth the going price on steam. There is little actual gameplay, and one can finish the game in just over an hour.\n\nThe game is not necessarily bad, but.....\n\nI am not going to go so far as to say the story isn't good, but I feel as though I was misled in this purchase. It is tragically depressing.... SPOILER ALERTS!\n\nThere are no enemies in this game, and though marketed as a horror game, there really is nothing "scary" or paranormal.\n\nBasically you unravel some clues about how your mother is cheating on your father, and you also come to find that your little sister is a lesbian who has run off with her highschool lover. The story wasn't bad, but this game almost felt like a guilt trip for anyone who didn't actively support gay rights or the lgbt community. If you are gay, you may find this hits close to home and will enjoy it more than I.\n\nOverall, felt like a game deserving of $4.99 price tag.

Its overall gameplay was very dull and boring. The gameplay consists of inspecting objects, opening/closing boxes or cupboards, and looking for keys in a small mansion. Thrilling, isn't it?\n\nThe story also suffers heavily. What could be summed up in about three paragraphs of a biography is instead presented in a dully voiced audio log. The audio logs range from not important at all to critical to understanding the main plotline. Speaking of the main plotline, the game also suffers from multiple plot holes, especially at the end. Without spoiling anything, we know the parents of the household are missing. Yet it is never explained where they went or what happened to them. The whole story is very boring and uninteresting. It feels very pretentious and full of itself.\n\nIf I had to give this piece a score, I would consider 5/10.\nLifeless and average feeling characters and a sad excuse for gameplay makes this game feel more like a Walking Simulartor more than an Exploration game.

This is not the typical first person shooter nor you will be solving puzzles while going through it; instead you arrived into a house which begs to be explored, while doing some exploring in the house you will be told the story of what happened to the family living in it. There is a bunch of notes and stuff to read in the different rooms which will help you understand a little bit more the story and will help you finding the clues to progress further to all of the sections of the house.\n\nEven though there is a lot of stuff to do, read and see in the house the game is a little bit short, and as me you can probably finish the game in less than two hours. Music is alright; controls are simple easy to learn.\n\nIf you are looking for a different experience, well you can find it in this game; but I'll really recommend you getting this game when is on sale as doesn't worth the full price.","May 1, 2015","false","1.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

This means you walk around looking for worthless detritus amidst a genuinely eery atmosphere.  It took me probably an hour to realize there was no actual threat in the game.  It was about that time that I also realized there were no puzzles, just places you haven't looked yet.  Felt like there was a great deal of lost potential.  It's fairly clear the author had more interest in crafting a narrative than anything resembling game mechanics.  In that respect, perhaps a different medium would have been more effective.  But all this besides, it's not even really a game.\n\nI'd just like to mention the snippet from the New York Times.  “Gone Home is the greatest video game love story ever told.”  I suppose I need video game commentary from the New York Times like I need a bullet in the head.  It's not even a game, and without the principal characers present, it's not really a love story--merely the echoes of a love story between special snowflake teenagers more noteworthy than it deserves thanks to the sexual preferences of those teenagers.\n\nJust thinking about this game leaves me with a lingering foul taste, something altogether and grossly sacharrine.

The ending was very disappointing and abrupt, like an unfinished game, even.  All of the atmosphere that seemed to be building in this game came to a crashing halt at the end once you --\n\n\n******* SPOILER ALERT *******\n\n\n--realize the entire game has completely faked you out.  It's not a horror.. or even a mystery.. it's a gay teenage melodrama about nothing but two lesbian lovers who run off with each other.  This is something you could've caught on any of your local cable stations for free instead of paying money for.  I had thought there would be much more to this game as a deeper story seemed to be developing.. one of a creepy nature that was horror-related.  Very disappointing.\n\nTo their credit, there's a lot of detail on items that you pick up.. even down to detailed wrappings for toilet paper and citizenship papers.  But that's one of the problems with this game.  After investing so much time reading through hundreds of notes and documents.. even crouching to reach under chairs and sofas finding hidden notes.. and getting to know the characters, you eventually find out it was a waste of time.  None of it ever led to any sort of substance that will stick with you.  The end result has been done 1000x time over on cable tv.\n\nThe bottom line is that the story is very shallow.

There's nothing really difficult in getting from beginning to end and only took me about an hour.  The story is engrossing and is set in the 1990's something like a more modern Stand By Me but a nostalgic and idealized look at the whole riot grrl mentality.  Gone Home though is a love story - a nice, safe, pretty love story, which seems at odds with riot grrl.\nI applaud the developers for what they're trying to do and the barriers they're trying to break, I just wish there was so much more substance to this, especially for what the pricing is.  As many of the negative reviews here state, there is not enough playability, let alone replayability, to justify spending $20 on this title.  And also annoyingly while Bratmobile and Heavens to Betsy supply some awesome songs to the game, neither of them appear on the soundtrack - again a lacking of substance.\n\n","October 6, 2014","false","1.6"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

It's hard to argue that the way it tells its story is captivating, and it's very rewarding to piece together the lives of all the characters invovled. If nothing else, it's a promising testimony to the potential of exploration-driven narrative.\n\nSo what's the problem?\n\nThe story SUCKS. (Spoilers ahead.)\n\nTowards the end of the game, I began to realise that the big 'reveal' was something I had predicted from about half an hour into the game - the black sheep of the family is a lesbian, and has run off to be with her new girlfriend. I can only assume that the developers expected this to elicit some kind of controversial or surprised reaction from the game's audience, but in honesty, I just found it extremely patronising that this kind of thing can still be considered a 'plot twist'. Is the daughter coming out as gay really significant enough to be the crux of an entire plot-driven game? Perhaps a decade or two ago.\n\nSure, it was a nice story of a troubled young teenage girl discovering her own identity, and in a way, it was very sweet. However, the story is initially presented as something far more shocking - answerphone messages at the beginning of the game had me prepared for an out and out revenge-slasher plotline, or at least something with a little more drama. The real kicker is that the very real sense of mystery and looming dread that pervades the game all feels pointless in the end.\n\nThe house as a storytelling device was a stroke of genius, and really, it's very well executed. It's just a shame they didn't fill it with a story worth a damn.","October 26, 2014","false","2.3"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","0"

Don't pay $20 or anything close to it, but at least play it so you can form your own opinion. Kinda like how not everyone enjoys certain novels or films, but it's beneficial to experience it and form your own opinion. Gone Home tries to pull at your emotions and therefore will not resonate with everyone (didn't really give me the feels, had some friends feel differently though), and there is no way to know if you're one of those folks until you play it.\n\nThat said, here is my "review" -\n\nGone Home is better described as a "story" or an "experience", rather than a game. You step into the shoes of Katie, a young girl returning home after studying abroad. She is surprised to find the house empty - where are Mom, Dad, and her younger sister Sam?\n\nLooking through her family's belongings - a bottle of hair dye, a letter from her mom's college roommate, a note jotted on the back of a mixtape - Katie unravels what she missed. People and relationships are constantly changing and evolving, families being no exception to this, and Gone Home is relatable and touching in that sense.\n\nWould I recommend Gone Home at the $20 price tag? No. I paid $3 and think that is more of a fair price for what it offers, especially considering exploring everything only takes a little over an hour.","July 4, 2014","true","1.6"," 155 of 302 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","155","302","2","1"

Note that I used the word story instead of "game". If you're expecting a traditional adventure or horror game, you'll not find it here. Instead the game manages to capture the essence of the nineties while keeping you in a constant state of psychological tension as you explore a mysteriously abandoned home (with more than a few uncomfortable secrets to discover). As someone who grew up in the 90s, listened to riot grrrl, played bass in a riot grrrl band and experienced a very similar coming of age as the invisible protagonist, Sam... I can perhaps relate to the themes conveyed more than the average gamer demographic. Perhaps because of that, I consider this to be one of my favourite games of the year. It's an experience which rewards slow-paced exploration and the ability to soak in the atmosphere of the era. It's also very short, I finished it in about four hours despite taking my time in piecing together the subtle threads of the story and exploring the manor obsessively. I don't consider this to be a bad thing, as it suits the game's purpose of telling the story of a slightly dysfunctional family and their history. There is no need to pad it out with unnecessary content. By the end, I was deeply moved and pleasantly surprised... in my opinion, there need to be more games like this in the world.

And I mean LINEAR - the house is unlocked in sections, usually more or less hallway-shaped, and if there's 3 places to search, you only find what you need to progress by searching all 3. The motive for the player is to find out more about your runaway sister who left a note on the front door. Halfway in, you know why she ran away and there's no reason to continue playing because there's no new developments. Furthermore we're never given any reason to care about anyone involved, since we're just wandering around the house of a family we never really know anything about, other than a few trivialities like how their careers are going. Not that having any reason to care would make any difference, since nothing changes or is resolved anyway. The entire game is a situation on pause and the game ends when it feels like it's told you enough.\n\nThis game is devoid of gameplay and drama.

I didn't like it but I don't think it's a bad game.  I didn't like the main story line but I don't think it's a bad story - it is very personal, and the subject (for a video game) very surprising.  There are two distinct stories and I found the major story to be far less interesting than the parents - perhaps my comparable age contributes to that.  The biggest flaw of the game to me is the illusion of there being something more such that the story as it unfolds is quite a disappointment.  The delivery method was novel but I don't think it is something that breaks ground since the obvious linearity would be monotonous to do more than once.  To me Dear Esther was a far more impactful though at times infuriatingly unclear story.","January 31, 2014","false","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Simply put, the movement controls (w,a,s,d) were awkward.\n\nGraphics: Fine for this particular game.\n\n\nSound: Great for me.\n\nOverall message of the game (spoilers): Your sister is a sad teenager who's 'parents just don't get her' who got in to some weird crap with trying to connect with ghosts and started drawing pentagrams in the house and also becomes a lesbian when she meets an ROTC chick named Lonnie. Your mom has a great job working as a park ranger type person while your father writes books. These two people have one child living at home who leaves a TON of her stuff all over the house. Literally the whole house is like Sam's room.\n\n\nThis review is a lot like the game. There's a bunch of sections of useless information that culminates to basically nothing. The point of the game is to learn your sister is a lesbian and has runaway and will probably, based on what you learn about your sister, not survive for long on her own or with her lover. For Sam, it will probably be like the movie taken except her father's not an ex CIA agent but rather a man who writes books nobody reads. Also your sister's love throws away years of dedication in ROTC and a promising future in the US Army to "Pack everything in a car and leave," further driving the point that teenagers make poor decisions.\n\n\n\n\nThe truly hilarious thing about this game is that it is basically a game where you play 1% of a ful game that has an actual story.  Normally this is fine with some indie games because they are so cheap and made by a small crew. This is a problem because the game is 20 bucks. Dumb. You are essentially focusing on tiny details for the duration of the game to tell a small portion of a boring story. Does that make sense? Exactly.\n\nWhat was I thinking: When I first started the game I was thinking "Ok, cool so this is going to be really ground-breaking. Everyone, especially those that made it, have communicated that this game is truly something DIFFERENT." So I am playing the game and I start thinking, "Alright, this is pretty cut and dry. This story is predictable so far. OK I am pretty sure I know how this is going to end. Has it been 20 minutes yet?" 40 minutes into the game I start to realize, "OK I surely know how this is going to end. I guess I'll just finish it." I then finished it for the same reason I would eat the last piece of my toast that I don't actually want or need.\n\nThe only real review for this game should be in dogge form:\n\nSO BRAVE.\n\nYOU GO GIRL.","March 4, 2014","false","3.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The sound track was awful - everytime I found a cassette tape to play, I'd have to pull it out for the sake of my ear drums. The storyline was very obvious to the point that you know whats going on after 10 minutes of play and the rest of the game you can say "Called it!" after every clue. I payed 7.99$ for this title during a steam sale, it was not worth it. It was atleast better than Trama. Trama and Dear Esther are similar to this game interms of playstyle, but Dear Esther's storyline and environments were much better.

I got the DRM free version off of the Gone Home Website. I bought this game because I really like the art work and story telling done by Emily Carroll. Her wife, Kate Craig, has also done some pretty amazing stuff. I head she was one of the main graphics artists for the game. I had to give her my support by checking out this game.\n\nFirst the positives. Kate, the artistry in this game was AMAZING. I loved the graphics. I also felt the game engine was exceptional for what you were trying to accomplish.\n\nBut I can't recommend this game, definitely not for the full $20. Maybe I didn't do my research, but when I bought this game, I thought it was going to have a completely different direction with the story. Emily Carroll's work (and the little I've seen of her wife's) was suspense and horror, but the kind that makes you think. The kind that keeps you thinking up late at night. For the longest time, it seemed like this game was headed in that direction. "Oh my gosh! What happened to the family?! What horrors will I find in the attic?!!" The atmosphere, with the thunder, downed cable, darkened rooms, secret passages... I expected something different. I wanted to have the same kind of experience I have when reading one of Emily or Kate's stories. That was a let down.\n\nAnd while the story was very descriptive and well written, and I realize the struggle the LGBT has gone through, seeking to be understood and accepted, it just wasn't... done right. I'm going to add some spoilers to explain myseld, so if you don't want the suprise ruined, I'd skip the rest. But the story is this:\n\nYou've come back from a study abroad to find your home completely deserted. You have no idea where your parents and sister have gone. And so you scour the house looking for clues. As you piece things together and find "journal fragments" you discover your sister's story: Your parents moved into a house. This house is known by the students as the psycho house, as it was formally owned by your deceased, derranged uncle. At her new school, your sister, Sam, feels judged by her classmates, as they come to call her "That Psycho House Girl". She is befriended by this other girl named Lonnie, and they go through a teenage, rebellious phase, and fall in love. Events of their love story are recounted. At the same time, your Christian parent's marriage is falling apart, and your mother is toying with a relationship with a guy from work. They don't understand Sam's homosexual relationship, and tell her those stereotypical things that drive the LGBT community nuts. "It's a phase, you'll grow out of it", etc, etc. Sam and Lonnie in the end run away, madly in love, and your parents go to a couple's counselling retreat in order to try and fix their marriage.\n\nThe plot outline, though pretty well written, was pretty awful. It reminded me of a teenage, drama novel. It was about a teenage girl who, like every other teenager, feels like their parents are "the worst" controlling freaks out to ruin their life, who goes on a rebellious streak and makes some pretty rash decisions. It's about how those rebellious, dangerous decisions lead to something "wonderful" (depending on perspective). It was about how lesbians can have a strong, passionate, romantic loving relationship, while the hypocritical, heterosexual Christian prudes can fail in their holy marriages.\n\nIt honestly made me feel the same way as when black people get upset at me over racism and the white man oppression. I'm a mid-twenties young man, straight, single, and also a firm Christian to my very core. It upsets me that other Christians would rather place judgement our homosexual brothers and sisters, rather than seeking for understanding. It's a tough road they're on, and I know God has a plan. But the propoganda I found in this game was more frustrating than helpful to their cause. It came across just as whiney and judgemental as I'm sure the LGBT community feels about those who are against them. There are better ways to say what you want to say.","February 25, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Now I was recently able to purchase it at only around $7, so I wasn't as affected by this price tag as much as some. Recently in the gaming industry, the quality of a game's story hasn't necessarily been higher on average, but has actually just been more apparent and a more important factor in purchasing a game. Some games are given a "free pass" in its story if it has exceptional gameplay, and Gone Home is near the exact polar opposite of this. The question that you should ask yourself when considering purchasing this game is that, "For $20, am I willing to 'play' a game that has little to no gameplay and lasts for around two hours, since the game has excellent storytelling?".\n\nWhen I initially bought Gone Home, I already knew some of what I was getting myself into. Despite that, I thought I could forgive the lack of gameplay, since the quality of the story is more important to me in most circumstances. I found that I was wrong. One game I want to bring up in "comparison" is Bioshock Infinite. This is a game that has an excellent narrative, storytelling, and gameplay. When I was playing Bioshock Infinite I found myself thinking of the combat scenes more or less just as transitions from one part of the plot to the next. When I finished Gone Home, I asked myself if I would have minded if Bioshock Infinite had removed all gameplay. If it was just a story being told as you followed along in the midst of it all. And I would've minded, because all those "transitions" actually added to the quality of the overall quality of the storytelling. It makes you feel invested in the story, and that you actually have a role and purpose. In Gone Home, it seems more like a reading a book (which I love to do, although my books don't have quick-time events and save points, because books and games are two different mediums).\n\nWhile Gone Home is still a game, it lacks the biggest factor that set video games apart from other methods of storytelling. And that is interactivity. In conclusion, Gone Home taught me that while the narrative is still very important to me, a game still needs interactivity. This was my experience and may not reflect yours or anyone else for that matter. I merely hope this review helps make your decision easier and more satisfying in the end.\n\n\nThanks for listening to my thoughts, and there are more below if you are at all interested.\n\n\nBy the way, I do not disagree with any reviews of this game saying how great the storytelling is. I am merely saying that this game lacks what it needs the most, and that is interactivity. I am also not saying that I think the story is all that great. I just feel that the developer did an excellent job of telling the story they wanted to.\n\nPerhaps a better game to compare Gone Home to is The Stanley Parable. Both place a very large role on the narrative of the story and both do an incredible job of telling their story. Though there is a VERY large difference between the two. That difference is the interactivity in The Stanley Parable. While The Stanley Parable is extremely similar to Gone Home in terms of length, The Stanley Parable is a better game (in my opinion) because it allows the player to choose how the plot continues. From playing Gone Home and The Stanley Parable I have realized that gameplay and interactivity are not the same thing. In both games you walk around a building, go through doors, and listen to dialogue. Though The Stanley Parable gives you multiple doors and reacts to which door you choose, which makes you feel like you have a role in the game and that feeling encourages you to continue playing and experience the developer's story.","June 13, 2014","false","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Putting aside (for a little bit) it was made to obviously pander to a "progressive" crowd who doesn't even care if a game is fun or has a good story or even makes sense, Gone Home is a massive bait and switch.  It sets up a creepy atmosphere that eventually gets lost as you search every nook and cranny for stuff hidden in bizarre places, all while being told a story.\n\nThat story takes away from the immersion of the game play.  Instead of being led to believe something has happened through clues, which what I believed the game would be like after listening to the answering machine, you are force fed story and driven to look for things because a disembodied voice is basically telling you "you are going the right way."  It eventually becomes bizarre, as you realize that the person you are playing as didn't have a disembodied voice telling her to look for clues, yet you are playing as someone who is obsessively searching every nook and cranny of the house for no discernable reason other than a letter on the front door and an answering machine message from someone you don't even know.\n\nAnd in the end, the story is one that was something seen for years in cheesy movies, except this time there are lesbians.  We are supposed to forgive their mistake in the end because it's true lesbian love, not acknowledge that two stupid kids ran off together after stealing a car and going AWOL.  All Gone Home does is trivialize the problems faced by members of the LGBT by barely even showing them to us, then wrapping it up in a bow for a happy ending where true love always finds a way.  And the fact this has won awards for "game of the year" and has received so much praise from people who don't even acknowledge the shallowness of the gameplay and the immersion flaws and only acknowledge a story that has been done countless times shows there is a bias to give anything that is seen as pushing boundaries the utmost praise, even when it doesn't deserve it.\n\nIf you want a similar type of game, once based on story, play The Stanley Parable instead.  It is a wonder how both games came out for the same award year yet the one that is more flawed has gotten more attention.","May 10, 2014","false","2.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And you usually rate a game about how much fun you had in those hours. You're stuck in a house in this game and mindlessly looking for papers that have "clues", and the clues lead up to nothing, expect combinations and rooms, the ending explains EVERYTHING, not the "clues" you find.\n\nThe story is also a horrible aspect, there is a girl that's missing (I guess she's your sister or something, I wasn't really paying attention) and apparently after two boring hours, you find out that's she's gone with this girl called Lonnie or something and that's it. The ending has absolutely nothing interesting to it, and is dull as hell, I don't even want to put a spoiler tag on it so you can know what happened without wasting your time on actually finishing the game, I'm lucky I bought this from humblebundle.com for five dollars and didn't waste a WHOPPING 20 DOLLARS FOR WALKING AROUND IN ROOMS.\n\nThe game-play aspect also has nothing interesting and dull, like I said the point of the game is walking in a box, literally. The rooms aren't well made and are literally boxes, and the game-play is walking in those boxes, that's it. You occasionally find clues, but they're usually where stuff is located, more rooms, and combination, the clues don't actually tell you anything about the story.\n\nIn the end, the game has a good concept (going to your house after a trip). and finding nothing, but the game-play, story and game itself is horribly executed. $20 is a bad price for a crappy two hour "exploration" game. If you want a fun, and enjoyable exploration game, play The Stanley Parable.\n\nAlso, the critics/journalists are brainwashed, I guess they're forced to write overly positive reviews for crappy overpriced indie games without explaining the aspects about the game.","September 13, 2014","false","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's not likely that you've ever played another game like this, and while you might have your own assumptions of what to expect, Gone Home will likely fool you with it’s misdirection.\n\nWhat the Fullbright Company has managed to do with the Unity engine is quite impressive, creating a mansion where virtually everything can be picked up, inspected, read, or examined, even if it's completely irrelevant to the story. The deluge of seemingly insignificant items may fluster you into thinking you've missed something useful, but trust me, you haven't.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is mostly horror based, although I'm tempted to reuse the word: misdirection. The downpour of rain, accompanied by thunder and flickering lights creates a very tense, suspenseful abience. Played at night, with a headset, and you’ll find yourself jumping at shadows and fearing the dark.\n\nWhen it comes to the story itself, Gone Home is very short, allowing for just over an hour of gameplay, possibly two if you take your time. For this reason, I highly recommend you buy the game on sale, just to avoid being burned.\n\nFor what the game offers, and the experience as a whole, I enjoyed it. I just don't agree with the twenty dollar price tag.","February 23","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In this game, even walking from a room to another is a pain, the character walks unnaturally slow, I don't know why they chose to do so, maybe to add suspense, but it didn't work, at least not for me. You may think that this is something like a point and click game, but there's not one single decent puzzle in the entire game, making it really simple to complete. Sometimes you will have to find a combination for a certain lock, a code that you will easilly find written somewere, nothing that will need you to use the brain to be discovered, and those will be the hardest challenges in the game. Simply put, PLAYING this game is boring, and that will ruin the experience, no matter how great is the story. Probably it could be more entertaining watching someone else's playthroug on youtube, leaving him the boring part and enjoying the story better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nowherenowhere/recommended/232430/","nowherenowhere","Haunted","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nowherenowhere/","282 products in account","My first review of Gone Home was entirely positive. I supposed I focused mostly on the parents and the challenges they faced. It was a pleasant break from stealth-based horror titles and combat-centric games--a mundane mystery: where is everyone and why is the house empty?  Everything changed on my second playthrough scouring the house for every possible bit of information and with commentary enabled.  I started to see the cracks and little things that previously amused now annoy and/or disappoint.\n\nI'd like to be clear on a few points before we begin again:  I've no problems with games that have zero combat, minimal gameplay, simple stories, independent-tier graphics,\n\nSpoilers Ahead.  I mean it, the first point gives away the ending...\n\n\nLet's jump into this headfirst:\nGone Home's central plot involves Kaitlin Greenbriar (the player) arriving at the family's new home (inheritted by her father, Terrance, from his Uncle Oscar) only to find that everyone's missing.  Samantha Greenbriar (the sister) provides occasional voice-overs as the player explores the house and discovers (through her sister's diary) that Samantha left with her lover, Lonnie, after their (Sam & Kate's) parents previously left on an anniversary vacation.\n\nThe complications that created this situation:\n\n1 - Samantha becomes friends with Lonnie during their high school years and soon falls for her.  With biases towards sexual preferences being what they were in the 1990s, the pair face difficulty at school and further problems arise.  Samantha and Lonnie's relationship is conducted secretly until a forced exposure (truancy, low grades) to her parents.  They give Samantha the "just a phase" speech before placing her on restriction.\n\n2 - Lonnie Desoto comes from a military family, so naturally she prepares for a career in military service.  This places a wedge between her and Samantha as any thoughts to the future are accompanied with healthy amounts of doubt.\n\n3 - Terrence Greenbriar (the father) found success as a writer, but was dropped by his publisher after the second novel bombed.  After finding some unusual letters, I took a closer look at Oscar Masan (Terrence's uncle) and the suspicions began to pile up.  Oscar sexually abused Terrence.  This has been confirmed--long before I stumbled onto it--on the developer's Twitter profile.  Terrence's novels are attempts to find closure, but are also forcing him to relive the abuse (likely much worse in memory) and sleeping in the house where the assaults took place certainly isn't helping.\n\n4 - Meanwhile, Janice Greenbriar (the mother) has been growing more and more distant from Terrence and closer to her coworker, Richard Something.\n\nEverything comes to a head when the parents leave on their vacation; whether Terrence has told Janice about his past abuse or if Richard's sudden engagement and marriage invitation forced her to remember her husband remains to be seen.  In their absence, Samantha has an opportunity to spend one more night with Lonnie before she ships out.  The night passes and Samantha wakes up alone.  Later she realizes Lonnie left her several messages indicating that she's changed her plans to enlist (...in spite of having a ship date?  That's desertion, madam.) and wants to spend her life with Samantha.\n\nSo that's the story, why has my recommendation changed?\n\nI was unaware of Terrence's abuse during my first playthrough.  I was convinced that Janice had given up her affair with Richard in order to rekindle her marriage.  Now it seems that the only options for them are Janice helping Terrence find closure or Janice adjusting to rejection and mending any bridges burned with her spouse.  The story's become darker with every subsequent look.  Oh, well sideplots shouldn't affect the overall impression, right?  Sure, keep telling yourself that.\n\nPresent for some of the commentary was Corin Tucker...yeah, don't worry I didn't know who she was either.  Apparently, getting involved with feminism sells albums when the musician lacks the ability necessary.  Don't get me wrong:  the score was fine, but the insert tracks were devoid of melody or meaning.  Corin Tucker's contribution to the commentary is largely self-promotion and the fiction that feminism is about equality for everyone.\n\nNot once during the commentary did anyone mention the parents.  Their story was what drew me in the most, but it seems those two characters are simply window dressing.  The backstory of Terrence and Oscar should have been at least mentioned  in the commentary.  Either the developers sold out during the game's promotion or they were dishonest from the start.\n\nI haven't enjoyed writing this re-review.  It's been phenomenally disappointing to realize this game is not a positive message to everyone seeking love.  Would reactions to this game be the same if it were teenage boys instead of the two girls?  I doubt it.  Honest representations of alternative relationships are hard enough to find in games without added political propaganda.  I'll end this here while I still remember the good things Gone Home had to offer.\n\nThe Good:\n- an honest portrayal of an alternative relationship without unnecessary melodrama\n- mystery elements without stealth sequences\n- solid minimal score\n- excellent atmosphere\n\nThe Bad:\n- annoying choices for insert music, but at least they're optional\n- overpriced for the length of the game\n- limited graphics options and some performance issues\n\nThe Ugly:\n- deliberate propaganda at times\n- restricts user access (One journal entry written by Samantha describes some very tame intimate contact between her and Lonnie and Kaitlin forces the player to drop the letter and refuses to pick it up again.  The developer points this out as if it were something to be proud of and not heavy-handed at all.  It implies female-female sexuality is in some way sacred compared to other relationships.)\n- crashes on ending credits if the player attempts to skip","June 12, 2014","false","6.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I did however think that it was the type of first person where you do a lot of finding/searching and solving puzzles, and i thought it might have a little action thrown in there for fun. NOPE. This is not even what i would consider.. a game. Without posting too many spoilers, you basically walk around and read things. And yeah, I get it.. I get that it is extremely compelling in its story telling abilities, you DO get drawn in this story that youre discovering, and you begin to feel for this character that youre learning about that youve literally never even seen (which if you think about that, its very powerful) However, I need to classify something as not only story-driven and thought provoking, but entertaining and interactive (at the very least) to be considered a GAME. It does what it does very well.. tells a story, but it stops there. This was not really fun to play, not exciting, just so flat. It was also extremely short, which in my opinion, if I was forced to play this extremely boring "game", and it happened to be a bit longer, with a different ending, it COULD be good.

I honestly have no idea how this didn't get panned globally. It's like the developers couldn't decide what they wanted to make. You will hear footsteps on the floors above you, loud thunder strikes, ghostly whispers, and there's a scripted instance where you pick up a crucifix and the light above you goes out. There are no actual scares or anything. It's almost as if they wanted to make this a horror game and gave up half-way through because that would've actually taken some effort. There is no gameplay in this "game". You cannot fail. You just walk around the house throwing ♥♥♥♥ about and reading notes (most are in handwriting, so good luck trying to figure that out) with the occasional voice-over. The story (which is what everyone praises) isn't good either. It's just some stupid cliche story of a young person finding out they're gay and not telling anyone else, then running away with their partner. It only took me around 30 minutes (I don't know why steam says I played an hour of this, I only played for 35 minutes) to find everything there is in this game with me never having played this before.\n\nDo not buy this, despite what all the shills on the forums tell you. It is not a good game (it isn't really a game, either) and certainly not worth all the praise it receives. I do enjoy story-driven games like this if they can do it right and engage me (like Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead), but Gone Home is just awful.

I bought it in a Humble Bundle for like $10 along with a bunch of other games inc. Papers Please so it's not a problem for me. However, this game only uses WASD (and crouching) mechanics. That's it. You can pick up objects and rotate them, which is soooo exciting because who wouldn't wanna wonder around their... own... house... and empty the entire fridge of all its contents (see screenshot). You are a girl with an angsty teenagelesbiansister who has decided torun away from home with her angsty teenage girlfriend. It took me a couple of hours to finish the game because I was just looking at everything in the entire house, got pretty boring very quickly in all honesty. The game on its own is a decent idea and its pleasant, much like Dear Esther but definitely not as good in anyway. One of the biggest issues for Gone Home is the current price tag which sits at $20. It's not worth it. Buy it if its like a couple of dollars, or if its in some good bundle - but honestly you're not losing out if you haven't played it.","September 20, 2014","false","2.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I am a lover of spooky horror games and I feel like this had potential but managed to miss the mark for me a bit. While I thought the journal entries with the LGBT theme were a very sweet and endearing part of the story, I felt like it detracted from the spookiness a lot. It ended up sounding less like a scary story and more like an oppressed teen running away with her girlfriend. Made me wonder what the point of the whole thing was.\n\nThe atmosphere was decent as far as 'horror' games go. In the end, I had a hard time figuring out what the big mystery was. Exploration was fun at first but then quickly became sort of tedious as I meticulously gone through every room and encountered a locked door that I couldn't open. After searching the entire house without finding a way to progress, I decided I didn't want to spend any more time on this title.\n\nI really don't like when games are arbitrarily long with no substantial filling. You can't just hide a key in a giant house where nothing is happening except the sound of thunder. Even all the lights work properly, so you don't have to be scared in the dark. There are seemingly useful bits of information everywhere but half of them are useless filler.  They didn't explain anything or help me figure out how to progress in the story. Most of it was random drivel.\n\nSo if this game is supposed to be scary, FAIL! If the game is supposed to be a new exploration/mystery type genre, not so fail, but deff not for me.","June 30, 2014","false","1.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It has no action or puzzles and in a sense is basically a walking simulator. For those of you who do not like interactive story games, DO NOT buy this game! For those of you who do, continue reading below. I will also warn whomever is reading this that this review will be quite lengthy, but will hopefully help you decide whether or not this game is for you.\n\nI do not play many indie games, so when I saw this game for sale on Steam I thought I would give it a try. You play as a girl named Katie who comes home from a year long trip in Europe to find her house empty. The basis of the game is to "explore" the house and to find out what happened to your family. I say explore rather sarcastically, because even though you have to hunt for clues around the house, the game is very linear and you are forced to follow a set path. The game itself is also VERY short. I took my time to explore the house and I still clocked in at only about 2 hours at the end of the game. You can look it up online but you can literally beat this game in less than one minute if you know what to look for. So for a $20 price tag, this game is akin to highway robbery and even at a discounted price it is tough to justify.\n\nNow the story itself I mildly enjoyed. First off, the "main" story revolves around your sister Sam, who turns out to be a lesbian very early on in the story. I personally don't mind the LGBT themes in movies and games, as long as they are not shoehorned in (which usually indicates some sort of agenda versus good storytelling). This game kinda toed the line in that regard, as I actually started to laugh as they made the not so subtle reveal. There are also other storylines that are put in the game for some reason but are not fully fleshed out, leaving the player to wonder why they were ever in the game in the first place. The most prominent example are the whole "exercism" and "psycho house" themes. Now while I realize the developers have said that there is no violence or horror in this game and it is just about exploration, it seems counter-intuitive to create a dark and forboding environment if they were not going to fully utilize it. I really did like how a lot of the story was told by the clues left around the house like letters and notes, and piecing the story together for yourself. I'll also mention that while some of the nostalgia themes from the 1990's were appreciated (I personally enjoyed the numerous X-Files references), the fact that this game is set in that time period really has no effect on the story whatsoever.\n\nTo sum it all up, I liked this game. However, the underdeveloped story and characters and the extremely short playtime are too big of faults to overlook. Add in the fact that there is no replayablility to this game and the $20 price tag and you have a recipe for disaster. I am glad I did not pay full price for this game and I can guarantee you this review would be drastically different if I had. If you see this game on sale for a dollar or two, I'd say give it a try, but at the end of the day you really aren't missing anything by passing it up.","September 4, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Maybe this isn't the game for me. I can appreciate the attention to detail and the atmospheric conditions, and what the game is trying to represent and convey, but the experience was disappointing to me - I felt no real connection with the story, it came across a little 'rich kids problems' given the setting of the house, this seems trivial but when you are being immersed into an environment, you can't help but notice the pure scale of the house and how it relates to how the main character of the journal lives and feels.\n\nI was disappointed there was no real character development of Katie at all really - a few scraps here and there, but never beyond surface level, and even for Sam I just couldn't make that progression in creating an emotional bond with this character (and trust me, it is by no means that I am ignorant to the situation she is in, as I have parallels in my own life I can draw from). Why was there such a build up to an occult/horror undertone and then to drop it completely? The initial feeling of tenseness soon dropped to 'is it over yet?'It didn't help that the game feels poorly optimised, and it was rare that the game played entirely smoothly.\n\nThere are many interactive story titles breaking the mould in terms of storytelling and immersion - I just felt this didn't quite hit the mark. I would have been shocked to buy this for €20 though - there are books with far more depth in storytelling for half that price, and that's the only thing I can compare this to - an interactive book that has good intentions, and flickers of somthing great, but fails to really capture my heart and mind.","September 9, 2014","false","1.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It has no action or puzzles and in a sense is basically a walking simulator. For those of you who do not like interactive story games, DO NOT buy this game! For those of you who do, continue reading below. I will also warn whomever is reading this that this review will be quite lengthy, but will hopefully help you decide whether or not this game is for you.\n\nI do not play many indie games, so when I saw this game for sale on Steam I thought I would give it a try. You play as a girl named Katie who comes home from a year long trip in Europe to find her house empty. The basis of the game is to "explore" the house and to find out what happened to your family. I say explore rather sarcastically, because even though you have to hunt for clues around the house, the game is very linear and you are forced to follow a set path. The game itself is also VERY short. I took my time to explore the house and I still clocked in at only about 2 hours at the end of the game. You can look it up online but you can literally beat this game in less than one minute if you know what to look for. So for a $20 price tag, this game is akin to highway robbery and even at a discounted price it is tough to justify.\n\nNow the story itself I mildly enjoyed. First off, the "main" story revolves around your sister Sam, who turns out to be a lesbian very early on in the story. I personally don't mind the LGBT themes in movies and games, as long as they are not shoehorned in (which usually indicates some sort of agenda versus good storytelling). This game kinda toed the line in that regard, as I actually started to laugh as they made the not so subtle reveal. There are also other storylines that are put in the game for some reason but are not fully fleshed out, leaving the player to wonder why they were ever in the game in the first place. The most prominent example are the whole "exercism" and "psycho house" themes. Now while I realize the developers have said that there is no violence or horror in this game and it is just about exploration, it seems counter-intuitive to create a dark and forboding environment if they were not going to fully utilize it. I really did like how a lot of the story was told by the clues left around the house like letters and notes, and piecing the story together for yourself. I'll also mention that while some of the nostalgia themes from the 1990's were appreciated (I personally enjoyed the numerous X-Files references), the fact that this game is set in that time period really has no effect on the story whatsoever.\n\nTo sum it all up, I liked this game. However, the underdeveloped story and characters and the extremely short playtime are too big of faults to overlook. Add in the fact that there is no replayablility to this game and the $20 price tag and you have a recipe for disaster. I am glad I did not pay full price for this game and I can guarantee you this review would be drastically different if I had. If you see this game on sale for a dollar or two, I'd say give it a try, but at the end of the day you really aren't missing anything by passing it up.","September 4, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Maybe this isn't the game for me. I can appreciate the attention to detail and the atmospheric conditions, and what the game is trying to represent and convey, but the experience was disappointing to me - I felt no real connection with the story, it came across a little 'rich kids problems' given the setting of the house, this seems trivial but when you are being immersed into an environment, you can't help but notice the pure scale of the house and how it relates to how the main character of the journal lives and feels.\n\nI was disappointed there was no real character development of Katie at all really - a few scraps here and there, but never beyond surface level, and even for Sam I just couldn't make that progression in creating an emotional bond with this character (and trust me, it is by no means that I am ignorant to the situation she is in, as I have parallels in my own life I can draw from). Why was there such a build up to an occult/horror undertone and then to drop it completely? The initial feeling of tenseness soon dropped to 'is it over yet?'It didn't help that the game feels poorly optimised, and it was rare that the game played entirely smoothly.\n\nThere are many interactive story titles breaking the mould in terms of storytelling and immersion - I just felt this didn't quite hit the mark. I would have been shocked to buy this for €20 though - there are books with far more depth in storytelling for half that price, and that's the only thing I can compare this to - an interactive book that has good intentions, and flickers of somthing great, but fails to really capture my heart and mind.","September 9, 2014","false","1.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Why did it win that award? I have no idea, maybe it just tackled a certain subject in the game and thus critics praised it for how cutting edge and forward the game is.\nIf you feel mixed about my review, then by all means buy it and see for yourself.

In my play of it, I searched every room, picked up every object, and read every readable piece of paper; all of this, I did in 2 hours.  2 hours is not worth $20.  Only the most popular of movies can get people to fork over $10 to see them on the big screen, and this novel is no blockbuster. This novel, while WELL paced, is for girls with an interest in gay/bisexual relationships--take note this is not a bad thing: Although consumers interested in the game should be aware of this fact in case this kind of topic may turn them off from playing such a novel.\n\nLinearly designed, using door keys to block ways, the novel leads you down a straight path.  Yes, there are many rooms and hallways to inspect, but inevitably you will go down specific ones required for you to beat the game.  The only choice the user has is how much time the user wishes to spend looking at things other than the story-required ones.  After examining and using story-required objects the novel opens the next branch of the map.  While this disallows replayability, it is atmospheric and immerses the user into the story well.  It does become repetitive, however.\n\nIt is a walking simulator (not an inherently bad thing), which means the majority of interaction is walking and looking at things.  You will pick up things and toss them down, and that is how complex it gets, which for a lot of people is quite refreshing.  This simplicity allows the novel to remain casual and not a brain teaser.  The story is not complicated either.  It tells an easy to understand story about girls becoming curious about their sexual orientation, discovering it, and then the user learns about the struggles that come with such a life.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, It is a fantastic visual novel for those who dig the story.  Sadly, it is not long, nor replayable.  It feels more like chapter 1 of a longer novel.  For someone interested in female gay/bisexual relationships, wait until a Steam sale to buy this for about $5.  For those who are not interested in an LGBT story, this novel is not for you.  It is no GOTY because it short, expensive, and has a small demographic intended to play it.  For these reasons I cannot recommend this novel.\n\nFor other interactive visual novels, I suggest looking at Dear Esther and Stanley's Parable.  Both of those are admittedly short as well, but they tell interesting stories as well.  I cannot recommend them, either, at their normal prices, but during a sale they are certainly bargains.  So if you like interactive novels you may like them too.","September 30, 2014","false","2.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

It's a commentary on social issues that happens to be in a spooky house.\n\nI really liked this game in the beginning. The house, the environment feels rich and authentic. It, simply put, was spooky in a way I hadn't experienced since playing the 7th Guest. Which is awesome. The detail of the items, the feel of the home as a 'freshly moved in' place is extraordinarily well done. Everything is believable and thought out. Little details everywhere reinforce the multiple characters and stories in Gone Home. For the small team that put this together, they should be proud of their work; it is an excellent environment for exploration.\n\nAs for the story and the game itself.. well... as the game progressed, and the "plot" played out, the whole experience.. thinned out. Suddenly I wasn't alone in a spooky house, I was alone being fed snippets of a story that did not relate directly to me, as a player.\n\nTowards the end, it slowly dawned on me that this was not a survival/horror (which, to be fair, I supposed it is not marketed as?) It felt like I started off in a genuinely spooky movie, but ended up in a Lifetime Original. It just felt like I had come in expecting one thing, and about three quarters the way through I realized that the spookiness and eerieness of the game were just incidental. Which totally sapped the suspense out of the rest of the game.\n\nThat said, I have nothing against the main story (or message, if you will) of this game. I think it addresses important issues, and is genuine and feels real. But in the context of this game, it just feels out of place. Maybe I've played too many games and feel entitled to a certian consistency in gameplay? It is, after all, the developer's right to take a game in any direction they like.\n\nI feel like the dev team started with a great idea, wasn't sure how to wrap it all together, and chose to make a social statement rather than continue to work in the direction they started in. But, that's MY feelings, and MY opinion.\n\nI would recommend this game if it was marketed differently, but as it is, gives off the vibe of a survival/horror, but turns out to be something else entirely.\n\n--bp","January 6, 2014","false","4.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

If you really want something different and quick (1.5 hrs) then this is for you, but if you want something thats more of a traditional game then this ain't gonna cut it.\n\nThey advertise the game as being a story exploration video game and thats exactly what it is.  You come home from a long trip and you walk around the house finding clues to your family's whereabouts.  You move room to room finding notes and getting a feel for what this family is like until you reach the end of the story. There are no puzzles to solve so the story kind of just tells itself as you enter each area of the house and the story is as simple as the gameplay.\n\nThe game of the year awards aren't too surprising because the game should be recognized but don't expect anythng stellar.  Although I haven't played The Stanley Parable, based on the demo, I'd recommend that over Gone Home if you want a more entertaining story exploration experience.","December 30, 2013","false","1.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

However, in the end I use the word "play" more in the sense of "I played a DVD" rather than "I played a game".\n\nI did enjoy the journey that this game offers, but the whole experience left me wanting. The story wasn't enough to make up for the lack of meaningful interaction, and the "gameplay" was non-existent. As far as I can tell, nobody has spent more than 3 hours in this game, and there is no replay value at all.\n\nSome would argue that approaching this as a game is a mistake, but no matter how I view it I just feel ripped-off. As a story, I deduced the plot from the trailer; as a game...well...there isn't one.\n\nMy disappointment can be summarized by one moment (hopefully spoiler free):\nIn your sisters room is a locker with a 4-digit code. So I searched her room for clues to what it might be: Kurt Cobain's birthday and death day, the serial number from a motorbike, and similar 4 digit combinations. I later found that the code was written on a bit of paper split in two and left in random locations. It was at this point I realized no brain-work was required for this game. It's just follow the crumbs until the end.\n\nOn a technical level, the physics is totally bonkers, which really detracts from the immersion. Pillows act like they are made from dense rubber. And there is a massive problem with the junk-to-clue ratio...by the end of the game I was actively trying to break plates in the kitchen, just to give the interaction some kind of purpose, but they just give a dull bounce as if made from the same dense rubber as everything else.\n\nEssentially this game is an interesting exploration of the medium, and some people love it, but for me it simply isn't worth the money. Exploration isn't enjoyable, and the plot is too short and predictable. It is worth playing, but not worth buying.","January 12, 2014","false","0.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It's very immersive in that you really feel like a person coming home from a long absence to find an empty home. Having said that, you don't really have to "unravel a mystery". You wander around a house touching things until another audio clip starts playing and tells you another chunk of the story.\n\nThe gameplay is weak and the story, while somewhat moving, is about as engaging as a human interest story on the news, or an anecdote in reader's digest. Sid Meier said a game is "a series of interesting decisions". By that definition, this is not a game. Your only choice here is to touch, or not to touch. Look, or don't look and don't progress. The biggest lasting impact you can have on this game world is leaving a door open, or some household item out of place.\n\nI'd paid $7 for this during a sale. Because it's an interesting experiment in interactive storytelling and I did enjoy it for the 4 hours I spent finishing it, I'd recommend it at a price point closer to $3.","January 21, 2014","false","4.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

In my play of it, I searched every room, picked up every object, and read every readable piece of paper; all of this, I did in 2 hours.  2 hours is not worth $20.  Only the most popular of movies can get people to fork over $10 to see them on the big screen, and this novel is no blockbuster. This novel, while WELL paced, is for girls with an interest in gay/bisexual relationships--take note this is not a bad thing: Although consumers interested in the game should be aware of this fact in case this kind of topic may turn them off from playing such a novel.\n\nLinearly designed, using door keys to block ways, the novel leads you down a straight path.  Yes, there are many rooms and hallways to inspect, but inevitably you will go down specific ones required for you to beat the game.  The only choice the user has is how much time the user wishes to spend looking at things other than the story-required ones.  After examining and using story-required objects the novel opens the next branch of the map.  While this disallows replayability, it is atmospheric and immerses the user into the story well.  It does become repetitive, however.\n\nIt is a walking simulator (not an inherently bad thing), which means the majority of interaction is walking and looking at things.  You will pick up things and toss them down, and that is how complex it gets, which for a lot of people is quite refreshing.  This simplicity allows the novel to remain casual and not a brain teaser.  The story is not complicated either.  It tells an easy to understand story about girls becoming curious about their sexual orientation, discovering it, and then the user learns about the struggles that come with such a life.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, It is a fantastic visual novel for those who dig the story.  Sadly, it is not long, nor replayable.  It feels more like chapter 1 of a longer novel.  For someone interested in female gay/bisexual relationships, wait until a Steam sale to buy this for about $5.  For those who are not interested in an LGBT story, this novel is not for you.  It is no GOTY because it short, expensive, and has a small demographic intended to play it.  For these reasons I cannot recommend this novel.\n\nFor other interactive visual novels, I suggest looking at Dear Esther and Stanley's Parable.  Both of those are admittedly short as well, but they tell interesting stories as well.  I cannot recommend them, either, at their normal prices, but during a sale they are certainly bargains.  So if you like interactive novels you may like them too.","September 30, 2014","false","2.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Name dropping things like "The don't ask don't tell policy" will, for people who get enraged by a person just stating something that is bad, elicit an emotional response, which is what you want to do to your audience if a game is designed to make them think. But most normal, thinking people in the world aren't like this, most people aren't going to burst into tears and cry "depth!" "Story!" for a person simply saying the word holocaust for example, none of these things to the average person will elicit any emotional response whatsoever, they have no substanse at all if you don't expand on them or weave them into your story.

Your impact on these people is zero, because during the game, they're not home. Also, their stories are hidden: you need to find it in odds and ends strewn around the house, and even if you find them all, there'll be a lot left to the imagination (provided you have any).\n\nIf you're a narcisstic person with no emotional intelligence, this game will leave you cold because it won't be about you, but about other poeple's feelings.

Disregard this. If you want this sort of game, go buy Dear Esther immediately and get a much spookier, better written, more beautiful and engaging game.

You spend a little under two hours going through a deserted house reading scrawled notes and throwing every item out of drawers, making a mess of the place.

Well maybe it’s not a game but more of an experience. There are no puzzles, no challenge and nothing to put your game skills to test here. This “game” is all about exploring a house, looking at items and basically learning more about the people who live in the house and their background.  Without spoiling the story because this is the “ meat” of the game I will have to say that it tries to create an emotional connection with the user but the problem here is that THIS connection is hard to be established on all people who play the game and it depends on their own norms/values. That is also the reason that some people like the game and others don't. Furthermore this game is full of Easter eggs. If you were born in the 80’s just like me you will find a lot of references here. Some items will bring back memories from your childhood. The “game” is all about creating nostalgia but nonetheless it covers a very sensitive topic.\n\nPersonally the story for ME was not very touching and to tell the truth I enjoyed exploring the house in order to find those 80’s and early 90’s easter eggs. The main story was average and predictable to say the least.\n\nPros: beautiful environment that looks and feels like a real house, lots of Easter eggs, 80’s nostalgia is everywhere,  good voice work, the soundtrack is excellent and the music fits with the tone of the game\n\nCons: main story it’s predictable and boring, there is no real gameplay here, no replayability, the game is only 2 hours long and it’s also very expensive for its duration.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 6.5/10\n\nI give thumps down just because there is no middle ground in the rating system and because I recommend this game only during sales just for the nostalgia.","November 30, 2013","false","3.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

This means I played the game in completely the wrong mood, seeing as the shallow story that is actually underlying it really has nothing to do with horror. The story is nicely voice-overed, but seems at many times designed just to cause feelings from, again, reviewers, who have been pushing this social justice thing a lot lately. While I am all for diversity in gaming, it does not excuse lazy design and shallow storytelling. Was the game to be about a boy and a girl, which would honestly work just well, I doubt it would receive the amount of praise it did.\n\nI highly applaud the game for its experimenting in storytelling, but I cannot say that I believe it pulled it off well at all.

Pretty much the same setting as the game so I had extremely high hopes for this game.\n\nBefore I was about to beat it I convinced myself I wasn't about to beat it because I mean... a $20 game (bought at $5) couldn't possibly end after ONE HOUR after going through everything. Well it did, and the ending is the biggest cop out of all time. The narrative is what is praised, but its an extremely brief narrative with very shallow and thin character development. I realize this game came out two years ago, but the praise it gets boils my blood.\n\ntl;dr - game is boring, very little character development, EXTREMELY short game. Maybe buy at $0.99-1.99 to see what the hype was about, but just be warned... it's boring and just not really a good story.","December 30, 2015","false","1.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed by it. It’s a shame because I did actually quite enjoy the game – up until it ended (much too soon), and I was left feeling dissatisfied.\n\nIt’s unfortunate because the rooms in the house were beautifully made, and it really did make you feel like you were exploring a real family’s house, with lots of backstory and substance. There were some cool mechanics (like ‘put back’), and the sound and interaction did really immerse you. But the actual story felt severely lacking and, frankly, quite mediocre. All of the atmosphere that had been built up lead nowhere, and I was left with many unanswered questions and devoid of any accomplishment by the end.\n\nIt took me a mere 70 minutes to complete, and I didn’t feel that I was rushing through it. Fortunately, I had purchased the game for just $4.99 on Humble Bundle, but if I had paid the full price of £14.99, I would feel really ripped off.\n\nI went into this game with absolutely no prior knowledge, and I guess I didn’t really know what to expect from it, but I was expecting something more, and it never delivered.","December 21, 2013","false","1.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I thought "Wow this is going to be great!" and boy was I wrong. The gamplay itself is just wander the house and click on this to hear a snippet of a story. This would be okay if the story itself was excellent but it is not. It is a love story but with a politically correct twist to it and if it missing that then it would be a typical teenage love story. I kept hoping that the end would bring some sort of originality or depth to make you think, but no that was lackluster as well. It seems that the largest reason this game received so many high scores is due to its stance on a political issue but is that enough to merit high praise?\n\n*Edit: I forgot to mention the narration from the sister which is well done. It would have been a possible buy if there was more narration and less wandering the mansion.

I think there is too much of a disconnect between the "gameplay" and the story. The interactive portion is akin to a horror adventure game (Amnesia comes to mind). You are coming home after being out of the country for some time. Upon arrival, you find that nobody is home and the house has a slight eeriness to it. Lights flicker, there's rain and thunder, you are all alone... It's a perfect setup for a creepy adventure. But this is highly contrasted by the story. The story is provided as pieces of a journal that you discover as you walk around and explore the empty house. Without giving too many spoilers, the story is about a teenage romance. Right from this moment, you can probably see my confusion with the non-game: Horror-like environment and gameplay, romance story. It just doesn't fit together. In fact, I would go as far to say that Gone Home doesn't quite know what it wants to be. With that being said, I wouldn't exactly shun Gone Home completely. I think it might be worth picking up if you happen to stumble upon it during a sale, but I don't think it's worth the $20 it's asking for. There are much better non-game interactive stories to experience: The Stanley Parable and Dear Esther are just a couple that come to mind.","January 3, 2014","false","1.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

This is exactly what it feels like to roam around a strange house.

There is NO replayability in the slightest. Not to mention that the game is roughly an hour and a half long. This should have either been a free game, or (like previously mentioned) a short story.\n\nAnother thing, the game seemed to be playing off of the Survival Horror demographic. Yes, I know it's not Survival Horror, but it's in an empty house with flickering/moody lights. It plays to the demographic, without giving anything close to a game that demographic would enjoy.\n\nI can summarize the plot of this game in one sentence:\n\n"Your sister is a lesbian, and she left home with her girlfriend."\n\nThat's it, the whole entire plot. Now, there's no problem with this story, there is a problem in putting it in a game where you can't do anything but walk.

The stories focus on the protagonist's sister (Sam), her sweetheart, and their upcoming separation as one prepares for college and the other for Basic Combat Training in the US Army.  Their story is told through notes and letters, through narration from the sister, and through the occasional concert stub or band poster.  The protagonist's parents each have a less-developed narrative arc which is told entirely through the things they own and the correspondance they receive.\n\nIn a way, I would love to sit down the devs of many modern games, point to Gone Home, and say, "That is how you tell narrative with setting!  That is how you write a story of attraction and romance!"  These two aspects are well done, and the level of attention and fidelity to minor details show just how much you can show about your characters just by things like the state of their rooms, the books on their desks, and the clothes they own.  You can learn more about Sam in five minutes glancing about her room than in ten hours of awkward dialog.\n\nDespite this one striking feature, ultimately the love story is not enough to support this game.  It's a well-told story, but one you will not want to hear a second or maybe third time.  Nor will you want to explore the house again; having seen the contents once, you will have seen them all.  Suddenly, the one-time trip to explore the house becomes the tedium of doing something rote.  The game advertises there's no puzzles and no combat, and while that makes for an interesting experience one time, once you've picked up a few dozen ticket stubs, high school notes, and books, there really is no reason to engage in that experience again, is there?\n\nHowever, the game is smart enough to realize the player can put together a story on their own.  Sam's story is inescapable, but the stories for your parents are "hidden."  Their tales come out only for a player who pays attention to the clues in the environment.  It's not a great mystery requiring Poirot-like leaps of logic to solve, but it does showcase a beautiful example of how background details can be left in the background and the player can be trusted to find them.  Nowadays, when most games feel a need to focus the player like a laser on ever aspect, it's a nice touch.  It's also a beautiful example storytelling without dialog and without words.  No one is ever seen in the house, but you can tell the awkward dynamics of your family from just a few glances through their things.  Speaking of those awkward family dynamics, great job putting in realistic family tensions.  Most narratives portray families with such operatic, almost comic bonds, while here, the dynamic is much like a real group of flesh and blood human beings.  There's no supreme dysfynction with patricide and matricide, or screaming, juvenile daddy issues, or any of that nonsense.  And it works.  Listen, writers: having an occasional normal family works.\n\nSimply put, a game needs teeth.  This does not necessarily mean every game needs to be an FPS, but with no challenge and no element of change, a game has nothing to draw the player back.  Nothing you as the player do in Gone Home matters - you stumble blindly forward, tripping over the solutions to the game until you've collected the right plot coupons and it ends.  Sam's story will be told and all you have to do with it is just keep clicking on things until the game ends.\n\nThis isn't The Stanley Parable, with its metanarrative about both gaming and working.  This isn't a throwback to the old-school adventure games.  Gone Home is exactly what it says on the tin - a one hour long experience of bumbling through other people's underwear drawers.  While its cute little story is well-told, there's no commentary or larger discussion to be had.  There's nothing here which has a right to ask for twenty dollars.  There's nothing here which should ask for five dollars.  Such a short, simple, unrepeatable experience would fit in a twenty minute student film without wasting my time  opening every sock drawer in the house in case I missed a plot coupon.  Gone Home wants to charge for admission to the show, then gets up there for one good song and calls it a night.","March 9, 2014","false","1.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

I loved this game. I can see why other people didn't, though, but I'd like to try to defend it.\n\nGone Home is narrative intensive, and it explores new ways to tell a story that are only possible through videogames. There are no guns or enemies, but there are plenty of puzzles. Here's the thing, though, while you do have to collect hints and piece them together, the game won't make a satisfying "ding" when you've found one, or give you points when you've reached a conclusion. It won't even ever tell you if the conclusion you've reached is the correct one. For most of the storylines, it won't even tell you what the puzzle was to begin with. It's up to the player to search thoroughly, find out that there is a mystery to be solved, then figure it out on their own, in their own head.\nA lot of people call this pretentious BS, but this is weird and I'm guessing it's exclusive to gamers, because other narrative mediums have been doing this kind of thing for quite some time. I don't believe anybody would call out a book for not telling you what to do with it, or not giving you an achievement for understanding it correctly.\n\nIf you can't take a game with no game overs and no hand holding whatsoever, then you will hate this. If you're excited about games that experiment with new narrative techniques, then give this a go.\n\nAnd yes, you can finish it in under 2 minutes, but consider that your "bad ending", if you must.","July 23, 2014","true","5.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

This is actually art that poorly desguises itself as a game.\n\nImagine, if you will, that you return home from a several month long trip touring the globe only to find your mansion sized house totally empty. What do you do? You follow bread crumbs through this monolithic house with solid wood doors thicker than a baseball in every room, breadcrumbs left by your sister. However, teh placement of these bread crumbs is random, some pinned to lockers, some in drawers, and some in secret passages in the walls. Somehow, through an act of God almighty himself, you find these breadcrumbs in exactally the right order to get the full story of how your sister discovered she was a lesbian and ran away with her lover, who goes MIA the first day of army bootcamp to be with her.\n\nIs this not enough for you? Is this twenty minute game, which claims to be worth a dollar a minute, not satisfying enough? Well then, your in luck, because for thirty seconds there's a somewhat intruiging ghost story sub-plot that contains a single jumpscare, and then is manages to make you stop caring entirely by never mentioning it again. Still not enough? well then, prepare to wonder where your parents are at 12:00 at night during a thunderstorm only a few days after their youngest daughter dissappears. be astounded as this mystery is never answered and the game ends with a not-so-dramatic narration.\n\nI'm being totally honest here, it's an alright game/ art/ cultural criticism thingy, but not nearly worth 20$ i've finished this game four times and I still only have 1.3 hours logged. I feel the pnly reason this game got such great reviews is because it has a lesbian love story as its primary motivation to finish the game, and no one wants to look like an intolerant ♥♥♥ when it comes to sexuality.

This should have just been a short story instead.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay (or lack there of), it's just walking and reading. Walking Simulator 2014 basically. This isn't fun in the least. There is NO replayability in the slightest. Not to mention that the game is roughly an hour and a half long. This should have either been a free game, or (like previously mentioned) a short story.\n\nAnother thing, the game seemed to be playing off of the Survival Horror demographic. Yes, I know it's not Survival Horror, but it's in an empty house with flickering/moody lights. It plays to the demographic, without giving anything close to a game that demographic would enjoy.\n\nI can summarize the plot of this game in one sentence:\n\n"Your sister is a lesbian, and she left home with her girlfriend."\n\nThat's it, the whole entire plot. Now, there's no problem with this story, there is a problem in putting it in a game where you can't do anything but walk. Even the Telltale Games (which are only narrative, little gameplay) give you the ability of choices to choose the outcome of the story. Those choices make you feel like you've actually acomplished something, that's a feeling that you can't get from Gone Home.\n\nGone Home isn't a game.

The moment the player walks into the empty house he or she is drawn in by the stillness of the vacant home. So begins a search to figure out where everyone has gone. The search never leaves the house, but the house is incredibly large and tightly-packed with subtle clues and objects to flesh out the plot. Gone Home doesn't require the player to do any more than explore, so if you're looking for anything more than a story-driven exploration game I'm afraid you may be disappointed. However, Gone Home commits to what it does, and it's that commitment that makes it a wonderful game.\n\nOn paper the story would seem lackluster, but it's the feeling and voice-acting of the narration of notes littered around the house that help give the game life. You begin to see that all the characters involved are deep and relatable even though you will never lay eyes on them. As you sift through all the belongings of your family you'll become closer with these people that have a lot more going on than you realize. It makes you wonder how much someone could get to know you just by going through your own home. As creepy as it sounds, Gone Home is a game that makes the player think about how these relationships are affecting each other, and ultimately affecting the end portion of the story.\n\nHonestly, it's the sound design of Gone Home that heightened the experience for me. The sounds of an empty home during a thunderstorm were oddly chilling even though I knew I had nothing to fear. The crisp dialogue is perfectly cast, and the actors did an amazing job. This is one of those cases where great writing and acting come together to create something truly great. The soundtrack, however, really hit home for me. It's beautifully done comes in at just the perfect time for emphasis to what's happening in the story. I have the soundtrack on my phone as we speak, which is only something I do with the my favorites.\n\nI love simple walking simulators that allow you to relax and enjoy a great story. Gone Home is well made, and there's a lot of love in it. If you enjoy a good story with relatable characters and a little exploration, you should pick this one up. However, be warned that Gone Home only lasts a couple hours unless you REALLY dig deep into the environment. As much as I love it, I would suggest getting it at a discount.","January 5","true","2.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Which was (incase you failed to notice) to create a short piece of environmental storytelling about a stressed out family against a 90's backdrop. Because of the setting, the game can be treated like a time capsule of sorts.\n\nYou explore an empty house, read a lot, listen to diary entries from a young woman coming to terms with her sexuality, look at zines, listen to Corin Tucker sing empowering feminist punk, etc.\nYou are likely to either adore this game and hold it dear to you, or discuss with your friends how much you hate it, and how much of a joke it is.\n\nDue to the nature of exploring a family home devoid of people, the game leaves a lot to your imagination. If you are anyone like me, when you enter a character's bedroom you are likely going to sit around wondering what times the owner and her girlfriend shared there. You will sit around in the basement wondering what the punk show you are reading about was like for everybody involved.\nThat's why I personally like this game, how it flawlessly puts you in a state of melancholy, reading about these fantastic experiences as you, the player, roam around this big empty house alone with a bittersweet ambient soundtrack twanging away in the background.\nThese people were your family. Your sister has grown up into her own woman, your parents are in the process of rekindling their marriage after heavy difficulties, and your father's career is looking up after all.\n\nMaybe im biased because im a girl who loves the culture spawned by the Riot Grrrl movement.

People tend to criticize this as a "non-game," and they're not completely incorrect.

She struggles of being gay in a conservative American household that gets narrated from notes and letters from her, which are scattered around the house.\n\nBelievable written by Steve Gaynor (that's really his name) a self proclaimed emo wuss who worked with Karla Zimonja and Johnnemann Nordhagen on this award-winning experience. They really made an effort to create a detailed (i believe) typical household for this novella. And this is where it started to get uneasy for me.....\n\nSnooping around the house made me really feel uncomfortable. I didn't feel like being Katie investigating for what happen with her family, I felt more like being a burglar or a nosy neighbor kid and this till the end of the game.\n\nYou wander around in a smaller version of a typical Resident Evil mansion. Due the ambiance and lightning it's also no less creepy since you usual go into dark rooms or corridors to find the light/light switch. It always make you wonder beforehand if something horrible is about to be revealed, especially since sometimes light is already on or turns itself off/on again for no reason. Maybe it's just the symbolism of the dark times of Sam you shed light on...or some other hipster ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t which I don't know (and obviously don't care). In reality they probably just thought it would bore people out halfway through if it was in a more friendly daylight setting.\n\nEven with all love for the details and writing, I did very little to me personally, even the Nostalgia wouldn't hit as hard I had thought since I was in a similar age as Sam in the 90's. Don't get me wrong, I feel sympathy for Sams struggle, but so does everyone else with empathy who is hearing someone elses growing pains stories.\n\nIn conclusion:\nThis game would be awesome as an completely optional side mission in an open world rpg.\n\nJust as a comparison, would you buy a polished standalone version of Vault 11 (or any other Vault) from Fallout: New Vegas for 20 €uro? If the answer is yes, then go for it. If your answer is “I played F:NV, but what was so special about Vault 11?”, then no.\n\nTL;DR version:\n\nThe good:\nBelievable writing.\nLove for details in the art direction/setting.\n\nThe bad:\nA story I didn't really care nor relate too much.\nWay too pricey for its content (Would have more fitting to be small part of open world RPG game.)\n\nThe ugly:\nCreepy setting for no reason or reasons which would be painfully unimaginative.\nThe praising critics for this game.\n\n5/10: It's a wankfest for hipsters. So it's doesn't come much of a surprise why gaming journalism loved it.","December 8, 2013","false","2.6"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","25","48","0","3"

Oh turns out im a lesbian and im totally going to run away with this chick I have known for like 3 months and ♥♥♥♥ my parents they dont get me!\n\nThe graphics are alright but nothing to WRITE HOME about... Ha. You would think that only having to design 1 house would mean that the devs would put more details in the game and re use less things. It would seem this family loved their dressers and bookshelves so much that they bought them same exact ones and scattered them through the house!\n\nThey also have the same 'random clutter of letters and papers' that they use over and over. The clothes in the draws are downright laughable. Seriosuly. Google them. They have a few tapes and such you can put in and listen to but seeing as my taste in music isn't ♥♥♥♥, I pulled them out and burned them with fire. (In my mind)\n\nThere are a large number of letters/notes that are written in what I like to call 'doctor's writing'. Which means that you cant bloody read them. A very important feature is missing from this game that hurts the expirence a great deal. That would be the ability to transfer messages on letters and such to a simple typed format overlayed over the note for people that dont want to take 3 years the break the code of what these people are writting.\n\nIt also suffers from to many narritives. You have about 5 stories going on at once that you are piecing together and it gets a tad confusing trying to keep names together as the diary entries only track Sam's letters and no one elses. In fact it seems you learn more about everyone else. Almost nothing is learned about the playable character other than we went on a trip to Europe and places and we are 3 years older than our sister.\n\nThere are very little physics to speak of. You can pick up and throw a few items in the game but the physics are some of the worst I have seen in a while.\n\nTo top of the insult we have the game bearly clocking in at an hour for someone that hasn't played it before and read most of the notes that werent complete chicken scratch. There isn't any replayability for this either. That means you are paying a Hamilton for an hour. I would say you are better off just buying a Taylor Swift album which will last longer, gets the same message accross, and at least is a nice voice to listen to. (I know that was the second time I mentioned her but this story just made me think of Taylor Swift so damn much.)\n\nFor what its worth the voice actor for Samantha does a pretty good job and does bring a little emotion to an otherwise cringeworthy story. Thats about the only good I can say though.\n\nAlso who just walks into their parents house and goes through all their ♥♥♥♥? Wouldn't a normal person just go to bed or wait for someone to come home?...Or Go home rather...

Although a bit short for the price(I recommend waiting for a sale to pick it up like I did).   But that's not why you're reading this.\n\nThe storyline is incredible.   You're Katie.  You come home from Europe to find an empty house and a letter pinned to the door from your sister saying "Don't come find me".    This starts an immersive investigative journey through the house.   It takes place in the 90s,  so the VHS tapes and cassettes are there!.   A lot of throwbacks to those days as well,  so I would recommend being old enough to "get" that time.   The main story focuses on your sister Sam and her whereabouts.   Although side-stories and plotlines involving your mother and father run concurrent to the main story as well.   There are no objectives or waypoints.   Progression in the game relies on human curiousity.   I personally just went exploring in the house and the game subtlely guides you to the next location,  you never quite feel guided but you are.   Being thorough and anal in searching each rooms turns up interesting tid-bits on the occupants of the house,  both past and present so search everything.\n\nAtmospherically the game does well,  it's taking place in the middle of a massive thunderstorm,  so rain, thunder and lightning blanket the house,   there are creaks and eerie sounds throughout,  and some interesting moments with lights.   Playing this at night,  the atmosphere of uncertainty and the fear of basements comes into play(lights!).\n\nAll in all it was an exciting journey.  I enjoyed it.   It's not for people with low attention spans,  and if you aren't enthralled by gameplay lacking action and gunplay,  this isn't for you.   But the story,  and the very subtle ways you develop bonds with the characters you are trying to find makes for an emotional trip in trying to find them.   You should all play this game at least once.","December 16, 2013","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only meaningful choice is whether you continue to explore, or stop. There are no opponents, and the only obstacles are a handful of locked doors, the keys to which appear as you progress. Rather this is a work of digital fiction, a set of character studies told through the letters and keepsakes that they have acquired, through the exploration of a virtual world and through connections in the mind of the observer.\n\nWithout actually including any of them, the story presents us with several multifaceted cast members and the problems they face in life, work, love and family with a respect that feels at odds with an inherently voyeuristic aspect of the situation. The way it manages to touch on sensitive and dark issues tactfully, and with compassion even for those in the wrong, reflects a meaning of ‘mature’ that more mainstream games often overlook.\n\nThere are some flaws: a bit of railroading and one illogically locked door; an overuse of some props and inconsistent decisions about what is or isn’t interactive; and an occasional disconnect between those props, and sections of the story. None of which should impede anyone who didn’t lose interest in the first paragraph.","November 28, 2013","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I believe I finished the story and found all the collectibles (there really aren't any) in the time period.  The replay value and price are a little disappointing, but the story and emotion make up for it.  Beautiful piece, but don't go in expecting traditional gameplay or length.  Worth the buy, but maybe when it's on sale.\n\nAddition:\nIt's been two years since I wrote this review, I think, and it still holds true.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_mechi/recommended/232430/","_mechi","mechi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_mechi/","274 products in account","This game received a lot of love from critics when it came out, initially resulting in an over 90% metascore. Most critics praised it for being unconventional, experimental, emotional and unique. While some gamers agreed, a large part of the user community didn’t seem quite as excited about Gone Home, calling it “boring”, “not even a game”, “too short and still a waste of time” or simply “too expensive for the content you get”. Gone Home apparently is one of those love-it-or-hate-it games.\n\nI’m also having a hard time calling narrative-driven games actual “games”, since there is hardly any gameplay or challenge to be found. All you can do is walk around, click on objects and crouch while you figure out the story. That’s why I also understand people who call it boring, because there is just not much happening on the screen. And yes, it is short; very short. Even searching the whole house and reading every letter and scrap hardly got me two hours of gameplay with a replay value close to zero. So yes, its standard price is way too expensive for the content you get, so I waited until it was on sale. And I didn’t regret the purchase.\n\nAt first I just really enjoyed that good old 90s nostalgia which made me immediately miss my own good old times. The overall atmosphere is pretty decent, although it might come along as to horror-y for a game that has absolutely no horror in it. Sometimes it gave me the impression to get jumpscared any minute, which just felt a little out of place for a love story. Since I want my review to be free of spoilers, I won’t give you too many details about the story itself. Let’s just say I found the story wasn’t as original or daring (when it comes to the topic of homosexuality) as some people said it would be. It’s just another love story in my opinion and love stories are not my cup of tea by any means. However, I still found it very touching at some moments. The monologues are very well written and the voice actress reading them with a beautiful voice and the fitting amount of emotion does a fantastic job in helping you imagine how things developed for the characters. Creating such an immersion without much actually happening on screen is something not many games can pull off.\n\nI enjoyed this game a lot and I’ll probably think about it for quite some time, but I still have to say that 20 € is just too much for two hours of gameplay. Gone Home might probably have prevented a lot of the hate it got if the price wasn’t so high in the first place.\nSo wait until it’s on sale and have a good time if:\n\n-	You enjoy exploring an environment and unwrapping a story\n-	You enjoy (love story related) emotions in a story\n-	You enjoy reading and listening to monologues in a game\n-	You don’t mind the lack of actual gameplay or challenges\n-	You don’t mind a game being short","December 26, 2013","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The developers have created a believable, realistic setting and storyline that completely captures the atmosphere of the game.  It's a really beautfiul game, though the price is a bit lofty.  Having played the game, I find that it is a truly great game, but $20 is a little bit pricy for 4, maybe 5, hours of gameplay, and I completed the entirety of the game in that time.  I believe I finished the story and found all the collectibles (there really aren't any) in the time period.  The replay value and price are a little disappointing, but the story and emotion make up for it.  Beautiful piece, but don't go in expecting traditional gameplay or length.  Worth the buy, but maybe when it's on sale.\n\nAddition:\nIt's been two years since I wrote this review, I think, and it still holds true.  This game is one of the few that I can say affected me on an emotional level.  It isn't for everyone, though, that's for sure, and looking at it now, the storyline is a bit cliche, but to me, this game is beautiful.

Also the story is mainly told besides all the notes, etc that you can read through the voice of your sister Sam's journals.  It's a wonderful emotional tale that pulls you in, although i might be biased as i myself was a teenager in the mid 90's.

You can interact with hundreds of items in this fairly large house which has numerous hidden things to uncover.  All the set pieces are great and the game taking place in the mid 90s plays homage to many things from that time.  Also the story is mainly told besides all the notes, etc that you can read through the voice of your sister Sam's journals.  It's a wonderful emotional tale that pulls you in, although i might be biased as i myself was a teenager in the mid 90's.  It's hard to call it an adventure game as there aren't really puzzles per se that don't rely exploration, still it is an adventure and a game I can whole heartedly recommend.","December 24, 2013","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although it sounds cool, but the story isn't cool at all. Maybe because I'm not American. I do not feel intimate about the narrative. From the beginning it was quite obvious that the protagonist and her sister are in a sort of binary opposition. While the player is more of a socially-acceptable person, her sister has a lot of traits of marginal people in school, family and society. This is why I don't like this game. It is to tag lesbian, unsporty, hard-rock hipsters with "marginal people." Although it is quite true, the story is like a soap drama on how marginal people cares about something that socially-normal people wouldn't understand. It is like the oldest topic in YA movie. I don't understand what the fuss is about on the story.\nOther than that, the devs put lots of effor on illustrating the family members' struggle. You can get the information by interacting with the stuffs in the house, which is quite a good new way of storytelling. Overall it gives you a vague sadness. You know that the family is not happy, but they are struggling to be. It reminds me a lot about the movie American Beauty. It is a story of American urban depression.","January 7, 2014","false","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It could be that I was a victim of overhype, which has happened before. It was also incredibly short, I managed to finish it in almost two hours and that is an accomplishment for someone like me who explores every nook and cranny in every game I play. That is why my biggest issue with this game is the gametime compared to the pricetag, the two do not seem to balance each other out.

Voice acting and music are top-notch. You are experiencing a primary story with multiple supporting narratives throughout. One thing I really loved is that (virtually) everything in the game is still accessable at later points, so you can backtrack and "replay" or re-experience parts of the narrative. This is like flipping back to a favourite or poignant part of a novel. This is much more a literary experience than a "game" in that sense... though I'm sure all the reviews say that.\n\nTime to completion is 2 hours. There's probably some replayability - I think I missed a few things in Oscar's thread, for example - but I'm overall satisfied with the experience and probably won't play again for a long time.

However, the asking price of 20 dollars seems steep for a game that is only about an 1 hour long, and even shorter if you ignore the entries and such (I got it on sale at 10, but I still feel the same).  While I thought the story was okay, it does not make the gap from gameplay to price.  While the narrative has a somewhat interesting approach, I feel like you could do most of this on gmod with slightly less quality.  I think the worst part is that there is clearly some well thought intentions in the game, but it doesn't work since the game is so short.  Gameplay wise, there is nothing other than exploration with some easy puzzles.  Also, I have had games with fast paced action with less strain on my system, which is strange, because there is very little going on in this game.\n\nidk, was ok 10/10","April 26, 2014","false","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Voice acting and music are top-notch. You are experiencing a primary story with multiple supporting narratives throughout. One thing I really loved is that (virtually) everything in the game is still accessable at later points, so you can backtrack and "replay" or re-experience parts of the narrative. This is like flipping back to a favourite or poignant part of a novel. This is much more a literary experience than a "game" in that sense... though I'm sure all the reviews say that.\n\nTime to completion is 2 hours. There's probably some replayability - I think I missed a few things in Oscar's thread, for example - but I'm overall satisfied with the experience and probably won't play again for a long time. That said, the sale price is definitely worth it, and had I known how solid and enjoyable experience it was I would gladly have paid full price (equivalent to a movie admission, or cost of a good novel, which is what this experience most closely resembles).","June 26, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
