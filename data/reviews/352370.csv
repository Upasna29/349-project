Honestly, it's simple, fun, yet complex when you actually get into it.\n\nSo, let's get to the meat of the game, shall we?\nThe game focuses on you building ships to complete various missions, however, you may be tempted to make the best ship, and that's where Defect is unique: you fight your own ships.\n\nYou see, you're a terrible captain, and the crew (also terrible) throws you out of your ship and claims it as their own in the end of each mission.\n\nThe missions at this current state are pretty fun, and seem to be tweaked constantly. The game is really dynamic because of how you build the ship, is how you will play. It's also really satisfying, when you finish that mission that took you so long, or that ship you built that was a great challenge to face.\n\nThe weapon diversity is there, you have turrets, beams, beam turrets, just pew pew laser weapons, torpedoes, missiles... A NUKE! (not yet avaliable to build though), shields to protect you from pew pew lasers and specialized shields that block missiles and torpedoes.\n\nThe game offers great variety in terms of building, because each component has an unique feel about it and can be rotated to look absolutely different.\n\n\nSo far so good, I'll continue playing this game and update this review as I go.\n\n9.5/10","December 22, 2015","true","44.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Something really interesting (and I found this out after I had recorded my sneak peek), when you are placing components to the ship, you are actually creating the completely custom music track that will play while you are flying it. I thought that was completely cool. Each ship has its own "mood" or "atmosphere".\n\nDefinitely a title to grab. They've done a great job with the game and it should only get better from here!","December 3, 2015","true","0.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/352370/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFULL DISCLOSURE: I received a press copy of the game from the developers.\n\nIf you’d prefer a video review, have a look here: https://youtu.be/Xb8qGxJMjRY\n\nThere are a lot of modern video game consumers out there who love designing things. And not just designing things, but designing things that work. Games like Minecraft, Cities: Skylines, and Prison Architect, all very succesful, put a focus on creating something productive, or at the very least functional. So what if there was a game that rewarded you for designing something great, but even more so, rewarded you for creating fatal flaws? Defects, if you will. What if in Cities: Skylines, one day a rift opens up in your city, and if you can’t destroy or stop the rift from spreading within a few months the entire planet gets sucked in and the game ends. Say, you knew it was going to happen at some point in your playthrough. What would you do about it? Put a nuclear device underneath your wonderful city, and the only way to set it off is if you press the button only you have access to? Would you build a dome that could completely cover your city and prevent the rift from spreading elsewhere? What if a huge focus of the game, is sneaking the cleverest Death Star like weakness into your design that you possibly can?\n\nThen you get defect, a sci-fi game where you can build your own ships. The gimmick is that after every successful mission, your crew turns on you and steals your ship. That stolen ship becomes the boss for the next mission you take on. At the very beginning of the game you can get away with creating better and better ships to take on the previous models. But eventually there might be a mission where you have to create the tankiest ship you can. Much tankier than any ship you’ll be making any time soon. That’s when you need to begin putting failsafes into your designs.\n\nBefore I get into the meat of the review, I want to mention that this game is in early access on stream, which means it’s unfinished at the time of this review. If you’re watching this at or after the official release, then you’re watching an out of date video. I plan to make another review of the full game which is scheduled for around May 2016, so have a look around my channel for that. The game on release may be unrecognisable from the game I’m reviewing now so bear that in mind, but I doubt that’s going to be a problem for a game that’s as close to being finished as this one is. I’ve put about 6 hours into the game, and there’s easily, just looking at the number of missions, 20-30 hours of content here and probably much more. I think most of the reason for the early access on this game is for getting feedback on the balance, because in Defect much of the game relies on the player not being able to exploit the stats of their ships.\n\nPresentation I’m a fan of the way the game’s presented. The missions are all played on a 2D plane that has the illusion of being 3D. The art direction certainly fits with the sci-fi theme, though the character designs are a little strange, I like them. I really liked the dynamic music in the game; as you’re playing a mission, the music will be relatively soft in the beginning, but as you fight more and more enemies it gets more intense. It even changes based on the way you build your ship. There was one time where I think the music messed up, if that wasn’t a bug, then that was some horrible sounding music.\n\n\n\nMechanics The gameplay is kind of interesting. By default, you’re using the left and right keys to turn your ship and the forward key to go forward, when you get near an enemy your guns fire automatically, and your job is simply lining up the shot. But as the captain of your ship, you can take direct control of a single part of the ship at any time. You can take control of the engines to speed up the ship, the hull to increase defenses, the guns to increase accuracy and fire rate, the wings to increase maneuverability. Basically you are choosing where to delegate your resources as you fight other ships. And it all depends how you’ve built your ship; maybe you built a super light fast ship that needs extra protection, so you take direct control of the hull most of the time. And the game does a really good job of forcing you to build different kinds of ships. Maybe there’s a mission with a super fast ship you have to chase down, or you need a certain type of weapon on your ship. It’s all done very cleverly, and all the while whenever you build your ship you need to consider the fact that eventually you’re going to have to take it down.\n\nStory The story is as good as it needs to be. Some of the writing is kind of entertaining, but for all intents and purposes there isn’t really a story. Think X-Com, the story is there but that’s not why anyone is playing this game.\n\nVerdict The game is $15 on Steam. I mentioned earlier that someone could easily get 20-30 hours out of this game. It’s fun, it’s an original idea, and it’s challenging. The thing that might put you off are that it’s pretty difficult, but for most people that’s not going to be too much of an issue. It’s also in early access and that’s a dealbreaker for most people, and I don’t blame them for that. For what it’s worth, the game played absolutely fine with me, and there is so much content here that you wouldn’t know it’s an unfinished game. That said, if you’re going to wait for release, try not to forget about it. This is a special game, and one that you should look out for. Defect gets a glowing recommendation from me.\n","December 1, 2015","true","5.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","0"

It is well made and one of those early access games that feel more complete than others ever will.\nBut.\nIt is really really really frustrating sometimes. I don't know if I'm just too dumb to get what I'm supposed to do but I simply cannot win some missions. I spend hours building and min-maxing ships specifically designed for that exact mission. But I die. Every time.\nI really am no rage quitter normally but Defect got me to lose my ♥♥♥♥, which then again might be a hint to the devs to balance to game out in the future or maybe just offer a teeny weeny bit of help for people like me who just dont get it.\nBut still, I am loving (hating) this game, 666/10, would rage again.","January 30","true","5.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

The editor is easy to use, seamless, and you can build some really gorgeous ships. They give you a large collection of parts to play with as soon as you wrap up the tutorial, and you consistently unlock new ones.\n\nBattling is fun, but more akin to jousting then a traditional bullet hell style. To be honest, this is probably an excellent choice for this game.\n\nThe game is actually funny. Not just a pile of bad Nathan Drake esque jokes, but actually pretty funny. The game is not shy in making fun of itself a bit, and the dialog and story while simple are absolutely sufficient to allow gameplay.\n\nGreat idea, excellent execution, and without doubt worth the price.\n\nI'd love to see in the future a creative mode, and some kind of multiplayer. Especially if those two are combined - it could be very fun.\n\nDon't hesitate, get this game now!","December 2, 2015","true","2.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The missions are short, boring, and frankly, annoying.  The core mechanic is that you build a ship, do one mission, and then it gets taken away, and you have to build a new ship to do exactly one mission and then fight your old ship.  Rinse, repeat...l  I played long enough to know it wasn't worth $15 to me.\n\nThis game could be great, if the linear mission system was stripped out and replaced with a sandbox world where you slowly acquire scrap and unlock upgrades to keep improving your ship.

Easy to pick up and start playing, tutorials feel like normal missions and are quick enough to keep you from getting bored. Graphics are good and the game runs smooth, I haven’t encountered any slowing or stuttering yet.\n\nCombat is fun, your guns will fire automatically or you can control them yourself. Everything you put on your ship can be damaged or destroyed during missions, engines damaged? Your a sitting duck, decided to attack head on, lose your weapons in the process. However, you can repair your parts during the mission as long as you've collected scrap off destroyed ships.\n\nOne thing I was worried about was having to re-design your ship over and over and thought it would be very tedious. To my surprise ship building is quick and very easy, you can save your setup or start from scratch but takes very little time at all. With that being said the amount of time you spend in a certain class of ship is very appropriate, you'll unlock new parts every mission but you don't advance to larger ships without adequate time to use most of what you've unlocked so advancement feels good.\n\nThen there’s the mutiny, after every mission you'll lose your ship and you'll have to face it as the last enemy in the next level. Several missions in I thought to myself "this is the best ship I could have built right now it's great" and what a double edged sword that was. During the next mission within seconds I found myself without weapons or wings within seconds of fighting the best ship I could have designed!  Take caution when designing overpowered ship.\n\nThere's not a whole lot I dislike about this game, some things are the parts are displayed on the left hand side, but when you get so many you'll have to scroll down to repair some of your parts, an option to resize them or start a second row so they're always on the screen would be nice. Currently when there is a mutiny at the end of the level the crew always says the same thing. Not game breaking by any means just small annoyances.\n\nWell worth the $15, this game is fun and fighting your old ship keeps things interested.\n","December 5, 2015","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This creates an interesting dilemma when you design your ship.\n\nThe only annoyance so far to me are the cut-scenes that momentarily remove your controls and/or pan the camera around to show you where ships are warping in or anything important that's going on. While this is perfectly okay and even necessary the first time you play a mission, it quickly becomes an unskippable nuisance when you have to attempt a mission again and again and again.
