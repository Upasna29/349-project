Neither does this update solve the central issues with the flow of the game, but at least it is half-a-step in the right direction. Oh wait - the UI and dialogue, even in the tutorial days, has obvious spelling mistakes and dialogue screw-ups. These have been reported since before release, and you still haven't bothered to fix them? (This is not as large of an overhaul as it claims to be, on top of that.)\n\n~~~\n\nIt's one thing to have a great idea, concept, and writer,\n\nIt's another thing to cut your development roadmap short with what you once called "placeholders" now becoming the "final product".\n\nMy review for this game was once positive, however with their extremely underwhelming March update (which was extremely late to the party) it is clear that the developers are pretty much done with the game. And what they left everyone with was not a fully fleshed-out concept that everybody thought was amazing. Sure, they might do another patch or two, but they likely won't meet up with the picture they painted for the game a long time ago.\n\nWhy I regret my investment into it's early access:\n\nI thought it was a mistake when I looked at the store page and saw that it was out of early access, but apparently, it wasn't.\n\nYou see, the game was nowhere near a final release when they started saying it was going to leave 'early access', and neither the appropriate polish nor needed changes/fixes had happened at that point.\n\nI let it slide because a "big update" was planned, except said update was really just some "UI" features and bug fixes. Pathfinding, which has been rough and improperly done since long before the "official release" is still completely mucked up even after the "huge" march update.\n\nThe game still looks unpolished. It still plays and feels like an unfinished game. The animations lack content. Enemies with over-used models. The vast majority of NPCs you interact with don't even have names, and are stuck with "Looter" and "Survivor" as if the devs planned on going in there later and changing them.\n\nThey removed the 'cure' ending entirely on the grounds of "It would have been too much work to get it going" despite having the characters involved extremely hype this idea to you as an achievable goal already in the game. They also took 'balance' as a reason to write it off, which doesn't make sense since it was originally an ending. Also, you and I both know that an ending was your original intention. That objective was widely regarded as an ending well before it was scrapped. So using "it was never intended to be an ending" as an excuse was extremely sleazy.\n\nAnd what did the game do to off it? Replaced some text. Threw in an apology from one of the NPCs for getting hopes up. I have several science buffs (including the immunologist) and medical professionals who showed interest in the subject of a cure, and you're telling me that a paragraph of text somehow makes up for one of the most anti-climatic story checkpoints in gaming history, all because the developers didn't want to do the work to get it working properly (or add in a scene where the cure fails and all hope is lost) for that matter.\n\nLet me put it this way, you said you were selling an exotic sports car, so I bought into it.\n\nHowever when you ripped off the cover and revealed the 90's Mazda Miata beneath it, you covered my mouth before I could yell. You told me "this is just what it is now, we will replace it with a new Ferrari Hypercar down the line".\n\nHowever when you said "It's ready" down the line, I was worried because I had seen them rolling that same car into the shop every day for the past six months. But I trusted you, I genuinely thought the full release was as big as you made it.\n\nAnd then the cover got lifted again, and under that cover was a 90's Mazda Miata with a spoiler, pair of stripes down the middle, some performance parts and rims. No hypercar, just an upgraded 90's Miata.\n\n...\n\nAnd because it's been made clear that the cure is never going to come back, and no major game-changing developments will be happening anytime soon, it shows how little the developers actually care since they slapped a "good to go" sticker on it and sent it out of their door.\n\nWhen you see early screens of the game, you see people sitting in stools in the lab, tinkering with machines, while a character flings her arms up in the air while raging about somebody being a problem. You see characters moving their arms as they talk, showing emotion. You see life. You see a game where you can show what's happening to a friend and they will understand what is going on in the scene without you explaining it.\n\nThat's not the game now at all. Everything is lifeless. Sloppy idle animations never made it past it's adjective I just applied. Everything relating to emotion and conditions was reduced to text and labels. Even in the very minor "live-action" parts of the turn based game, it still feels like it's turn-based because everything is still attatched to their depth-lacking animations and use of the tile system.\n\nThe actual game\n\nI'm going to summarize this to boot.\n\nObvious pros and cons:\n+Good writing.\n+Good story.\n+Awesome, in-depth characters.\n-turn-based gameplay is clunky\n-Lack of polish\n-Broken story events that don't recognize a previous descision when it should\n-Lack of attention to various characters (Jodie Hopkins as an example)\n-Extremely empty list of events in the bit of time before the endgame\n\nBorderline points:\n=Long storyline (but didn't have the intensity to match the hours it takes)\n=Mediocre amount of weapons and content to use outside of characters\n=questlines can have a lot of detail and options, but on the flipside, some don't\n\nWhat I factor in when I write my reviews is the question of if I genuinely recommend this to somebody, would they enjoy it?\n\nTo answer that question, the said person would have to enjoy turn-based games, and they would also have to appreciate good characters and writing.\n\nHowever they would also have to deal with the fact that some mid-game characters don't get in-depth development, the game lacks a lot of polish despite a long time in early access, the pricetag that is debatably not worth it, some obvious bugs and story holes and some glitchy questlines.\n\nA lot of other turn-based titles have more polished and simplified gameplay. Even though Dead State had a champion writer, it still can be said that the flaws override the good.\n\nAnd that is why I don't think I would recommend it.\n\nWriting and concept was great, hower it was the clunky execution, lack of proper dev attention to well-noted problems, unbalanced features and lack of streamline-polish that ruined it for me.\n\nThis game is the poster child for products that spread themselves too thin. I understand that exit-stage early access titles are almost never as good as they made them hyped at the start of development, but this is well beyond "just scrapped ideas". While I found the characters and choices entertaining, literally everything else felt extremely under-developed and nowhere near completion.\n\n\nThat's my blunt review for now.","March 16, 2015","false","111.8"," 292 of 332 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","292","332","7","28"

The delicate mix and interplay of facilities, resource management, and character skills including your own definitely play a big impact on your crew's morale and survival prospects.  Those who get bit (infected) during the game as a result of combat with zombies have to be managed with daily antibiotics.  Each infected cause a potent little morale hit on a daily basis (fear those infected will turn keeps your survivors up at night).\n\nWounded characters heal in user built infirmaries.  Recovery in HP can be slow, fatigue is implemented if you have your characters scavange the wasteland of Texas for too long without granting them rest, and the additional game modes with the most recent "Reanimated" update even make it possible for your own character to get infected.\n\n+The Reanimated patch adds a few of the more interesting game settings to the original base game that ramp up the zombie threat to 11 without making it impossible and human enemies are much more aggressive and damaging if you elect to ramp up to Hardcore game mode.  The Ironman mode I wouldn't recommend given the occasional save game related bugs in the game but if you save often there's no problem with anything else.\n\n+The large map and variety of buildings is almost varied enough in their experiences to wipe away some of the larger pacing problems.\n\n+Some characters that can join your fledgeling community of survivors are extremely interesting characters in their own right so there's enough variety in the mix of personalities on display in this game to intrigue the imagination.  Its a pity that the NPC banter and dialogue for each of these characters (~30 altogether) couldn't be fleshed out a bit more than it is but its good enough assuming you are patient enough for their scripted events to come to you.\n\n+The Crises events in the game add a lot of tension to the game and the amount of democratic support you have leading up to these events as well as the consequences of your decisions to resolve the crises are well thought out.  Its a pity there weren't more Criseses to help with the pacing problems that occur in the mid-game.\n\n+Pick your favorite picture of any flesh-toned animated flavor and your enjoyment and immersion into the atmosphere of the game will automatically increase by leaps and bounds.  The portraits that come with the game I found - disturbingly - androgenuous especially for the men.  The game lets you import custom portraits...use that.  The rest of the NPC characters portraits are perfectly fine though so don't let that deter you.  Its only the PC that looks...questionable, shall we say?\n\n+The game allows you a broad choice of presets background and skillsets and lets you choose your own by assigning points how you will.\n\n+The other factions in the game will definitely reach out and make their presence felt. Some will be hostile, some neutral, and some will be friendly.  A few will change their status depending on your words and actions.\n\nCons\n\n-Graphics and animations are good enough for an indie game of this type but there's nothing you would call clean or flashy.  I don't mind this one very much just thought I would toss it in to cover my bases.\n\n-Ambient Music track is super repetitive and the one combat song gets real irritating real fast. Play some of your own music in the background and crank the music volume in the game down very low unless you really love the unimaginative midi drum-beat ambient deathrattle.  My zombie kill-count went up immesurably and I had a lot more fun when I turned to my own combat mix.  Yours will too, trust me.\n\n-No voice acting\n\n-A pity the infected mechanic doesn't have a stronger thematic element than merely a morale and daily biotic hit beyond the fixed three day incubation period of Zombie turning.\n\n-The dialogue after the introduction that you initiate in your community shelter is weak and repetitive outside of scripted events.  This is one area that may be the most disappointing from a narrative standpoint.  Each character gives you something to worry about and do and they will get into conflicts with each other in somewhat realistic fashion.  They will even group themselves into factions under sub-leaders you come across which is also nice but the lack of depth in the dialogue still makes me find this game to be a flawed gem cut too early in the development cycle to reach its prime potential.  The indie budget shows most severly in this area but the early game has the most content and in all honesty I found the early part of the game in the first month to be the best most fleshed out part of the game by far...\n\n-The factions also suffer from a lack of fleshed out developement. They are interesting and do interact some but there is a gap between what is realized and the potential that might have been realized with more time and money. More diplomacy and more varied interactions and scripted events would definitely have helped the pacing problems in the mid-game.\n\n-Pacing problems. The greatest content is at the start when you are busy trying to set everything up and get recruits and resources to deal with opening crises and character conflicts but this dries up in the mid-game pretty fast leaving you scavaging and fighting the remaining areas on the map until the scripted end-game sequence leading to the finale and one of the game's true endings.  That's all there is to say, I'm afraid.\n\nSummary\nIf my hour count is any indication (I bought this game when it first came to steam early access), then I have certainly gotten my money's worth a few times over from this game.  It took a very long time for my interest in the game to wane and it certainly improved technically and qualitatively from a gameplay standpoint from its most recent reanimated patch.  Nearly all of the game related bugs are long gone by now and the game itself is a lot more tense and exciting with the hardcore and PC infected options enabled from said patch.\n\nMy only real disappointments with the game largely result from the fact that they simply did not have more than a matchbox budget to start with from their modest kickstarter and that has certainly plagued this game's development for a very long time.  That said, I remain quite fond of this indie game company and its devs for the hours of tense enjoyment they have given me since this game's release to Steam for early access and what they accomplished with such a small low-budget.  The indie team are, IMHO, very passionate about their work and considerately attentive in regards to their community.\n\nFor all its flaws and rough edges, this game is amazing in its concept, focus, and scope.  Nearly every other game on zombies boils down to a button mashing action kill fest but this game takes a more cerebral approach to its gameplay mechanics where the focus is on survival not just of your one avatar or a few NPCs but an entire community of folks whose problems go far beyond the basic humdrum of scavanging and NPC questing.  The game doesn't deprive you of either or from simply going toe to toe again the zombie hordes and the diverse medley of surviving human factions.\n\nBottom Line: This is an amazing little game for such a small indie team.  Excellent Concept, decent implementation, a good mix of features that are especially rare for a genre plagued by first person shooter fare.  You'll also find far more meaningful choices than can be found in any Telltale Game.\n\nIts rare for a game of this type to hold my interest for as many hours as I've logged into it over the years; so yes, I would definitely recommend this game in its most recent incarnation without reservation to any fan looking for a more cerebral Zombie Survival RPG game that casts you as the Headman of a small community of quarralsome survivors struggling to survive the Horrors of the Apocalypse together.","October 28, 2015","true","347.0"," 173 of 189 people (92%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","92","173","189","14","0"

I'm writing this review in hopes that people won't overlook this great game because the some negative reviews have scared them off.  If you love the idea of the zombie apocalypse, resource managment & turn based tactical games (like JA 2, X-Com, Xenonauts, etc) you will love this game if you can get by the bugs (which are the source of most of the negative reviews).\n\nWhat I like about the game:\n\nAfter the zombie apocalypse surviving would be a day to day grind.  Dead State perfectly replicates this.  You struggle to keep up food supplies, fuel for the generator, and morale for a group of people with realistic differences who have been thrown together in this shelter to survive.  The members of the shelter all have their own goals and agendas, they fight amongst themselves, and some challenge your leadership at every turn.  To keep them happy you can bribe, threaten, negotiate with them.  When crisises occur you have to walk a fine line to keep most of the people happy, never being able to make everyone happy.  Outside of the shelter you have to deal with zombies, looters, psychos, outlaw bikers, racist militias and everyone else who would go insane if law & order was gone.  Combat is not only a struggle to win, but to do so using the minimum force needed to win.  Ammo is always short for the good guns, and gunfire attracts hordes of zombies.  Hordes of zombies are bad, M'kay.\n\nWhat's wrong with the game:\n\nThe game has bugs.  I'm not talking about crashes, but about storyline/dialog bugs.  These are a little annoying, but certainly didn't ruin the game for me.  There are a few technical glitch type bugs, but with some help from the forums on the company's webpage, I was able to work past all of them.  The developers are actively working them out.  Honestly, I think the full release should have been delayed another month or so.  If they had, the reviews would have been far more positive.  But, the X-mas season drives release dates.  The developers are running a business, so I can't blame them for it.\n\nAll things considered I LOVE this game!  I haven't been this addicted to a game in years.  If you can look past the bugs, you will love this game.","January 21, 2015","true","733.5"," 317 of 390 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","317","390","9","3"

This is due almost entirely to the punishing morale system of your shelter. Even allys with "good" or "okay" moods give you a negative moral penalty. You have to constantly scour the country side in search of "special" morale linked items for individuals in your shelter. And even when you're constantly showering your allies with said items, a "good" negative moral penalty is the best you're gonna get. God help you if the generator runs out of gas, an ally dies(for any reason), or you mishandle a crisis event. Any of the following will lead to a morale death spiral. Inevitibly, the more allys you gain, the more daily negative moral penaltys you recieve and it ends with Davis gunning you down and a game over screen(worst case scenario). I enjoyed the gameplay despite the last-gen graphics, but the morale system killed the game for me. 5.5/10.","December 19, 2014","false","48.7"," 591 of 787 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","591","787","7","18"

I love the concept, I really do--but it's taking a long time to get into the meat of it, and the interface, while not bad, is sorely missing that last coat of wax.  Having to rotate the camera to reach containers, not being able to see into buildings that I haven't entered even when I should have LOS, fumbling around to click the right tiles...and NPCs that seem to promise tremendous interactivity at the beginning, but don't follow it up outside of cutscenes.\n\nI'll come back to it later, I'm sure, but I don't feel terribly excited.  More than anything else, Dead State feels *dated* even though it's brand new.  It nailed Fallout 1 a little more than it should have...I'm okay with the mechanics, but that's not the interface that modern games should emulate.  Long, slow-paced games NEED some amazing polish on their interface so that they're a joy to play even when nothing is going on, and Dead State just doesn't have that polish.  I'm sure there's a great game lurking further underneath, but it seems like a pain to get there.\n\nShame.

But everything else falls flat.\n\nGraphics: I'm not a graphic snob, but even 14 years ago these graphics would be dated. I can get over that, however it plays into combat. It's hard to see where you can move to during combat due to the dead bodies on the floor. You can't tell the difference between a looter or a zombie, you have to scroll over them...I mean if they are holding a shotgun, prolly going to be a looter.\n\n\nCombat: The tactics are okay, in the new patch the characters seem to connect a lot more. However it's hard to set up a battle and get your characters to where you want them to be. This should be the highlight of the game but the ratio of how much damage you put out and get is way off.\n\nIt's challanging in a good way, but when you have to save before a fight it's a little too much.  Plus there is no real upside from fighting, unlike most tatical games you gain levels or xp, in this game concept you gain xp for upgrading your shelter.\n\nI feel like your always grossly out numbered, looters aren't push overs and even zombies can take several hits to kill.","December 23, 2014","false","10.8"," 602 of 829 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","602","829","6","0"

I'm all for gritty and realistic, but when it seems more than half the looters you encounter on your first day have guns, and you don't, it negatively impacts initial enjoyment as you watch your characters getting blown away in 2 shots, before you even land a single melee blow on the looter...\n\nAdditionally to this, the tutorial is virtually pointless and the manual does not give much more insight... Dead State lacks 'hover over' tool tips for character conditions, once again making early play arduous whilst you're trying to figure out what exactly is going on...\n\nDead State shows considerable potential, but IMO it feels as though it still requires alot of work before reaching it and I would not recommend buying Dead State as is...\n\nIf you don't mind your survivors getting blown away at the drop of a hat on your first day, while you're still trying to figure out the basics, then Dead State is almost certainly for you however...\n\n**** ADDED AFTER 31 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY ****\n\nKept plugging away since I had paid for it and, once you actually manage to get a little armour and some better gear, Dead State actually starts to become quite enjoyable..\n\nThat is until you start getting better and better gear, at which time it becomes almost too easy... Zombies can barely inflict any damage and even gunfire is of little concern, only reiterating my previous assessment that rebalancing is required, not just in the early game, but even in the later stages.\n\nThe longer you play, the more bugs you will also encounter such as 'misplaced' enemies (sprite in a different location to where they are physically recognised by the game), to-do tasks that are never completed, unusual inventory management and item stacking anomalies and game events that do not seem to trigger correctly.\n\nBIGGEST ISSUE NOW : after nearing the 30 hour play time mark, I am now encountering regular random CRASHES TO DESKTOP. There is absolutely no reason for this, as everything has been running fine until close to 25+ hours when I first started encountering CTD issues.\n\nIt's my suspicion that the more your explore, recover and improve your compound, the more unstable the game engine becomes, which would fit in line with what other people (and some professional reviews) have also mentioned.\n\nOnce again, even having invested 30 hours into Dead State, I would NOT recommend it in it's present release state and it requires considerable further work before it can be considered to be truely 'finished'...\n\nIt is my opinion that THIS IS NOT A FULL RELEASE GAME IN IT'S PRESENT STATE - IT IS LITTLE MORE THAN A LATE-STAGE PUBLIC BETA, THAT PRETENDS TO BE A FINAL RELEASE.","December 23, 2014","false","118.7"," 458 of 630 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","458","630","3","0"

However i started playing the final release and i am disgusted at what is being passed off as a complete game.\n\nThere are numerous crashes that should have been fixed ages ago. This game promised to delve so deep into a zombie apocalypse that it would include much more than just bashing zombies.. it also promised tactical combat and in depth group management.. all we get is a game with limited at best combat and group management. I waited untill the full release to see if these things would be fixed, and they havent. The game is basic, and playing it you will see that nearly all that was promised is missing. Average graphics, limited dialogue, Biggest let down of the year.\n\nTo try and make the communication challenging all they have done is program npcs to be fairly moronic. Nothing feels natural and you will not be drawn into the politics of your group.\n\nComparing this game to fallout which has real tactical combat is an insult to people that actually took time to make their game legendary. Everything in dead state feels awkward and clumsy right down to firing weapons. There are no tactics in combat except for taking in turns. If i could get my money back i honestly would.

In theory, this should be my kind of game. I like fighting zombies, and I like turn based combat. Sadly, I don't like Dead State. Its not a terrible, broken game, I'm just feeling kind of ... bored.\n\nThe biggest problem is that I've discovered that zombies and turn based combat don't mix together.\n\nI like turn based combat systems because of the tactical depth that they allow. I enjoy analysing what weapons and abilities my squad has, what type of enemies I'm up against, their abilities, the map layout and figuring out my plan of action. But zombies don't have abilities. No healers, no area of effect attacks, no teleports, no debuffs, no summons. They just walk up to the nearest person and bite them. Dead State has no special infected. Sure, there are some Human enemies. But they either melee the nearest person, or shoot the nearest person. There is no tactical depth. You can't even put your guys on overwatch. Nor can you control your companions' stats, because they auto-level up. Want to improve someone's ranged weapons skill? Well that guy is taking melee because screw you.\n\nI just realised that all the other zombie games I enjoy - Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil, Dying Light, Dead Rising, Killing Floor, State of Decay - the action is real time, fast paced, and you're fighting through large hordes. Plus they all have special infected which keeps the combat interesting.\n\nThe other thing about Dead State that stands out to me is the poor sound design. Weapon sounds feel flat, the "arghs" a character/zombie makes when they get hit are dull, there's no voice acting for cutscenes and the music is too slow and quiet. I don't often comment on sound, I guess its one of those things that I don't notice when its done properly, but as soon as it goes wrong, its really obvious. I'm convinced the lack of exciting sound is contributing to my feeling of boredom.\n\nI can't even motivate myself to keep playing Dead State, so I'm certainly not going to recommend anyone else to pick it up. Very disappointing.","July 3, 2015","false","10.5"," 177 of 233 people (76%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","76","177","233","11","0"

You have to build your little shelter, gater other survivors and keep them alive as well as happy. At the same time there is a rough "bigger" story, which you can follow to different endings.\n\nGood points:\n\n.,Exploration of the state, with random encounters and mostly different maps.\n\n.,Fallout like character creation of your own survivor, including different skills/attributes and the improvements of these (including perks).\n\n.,Many different weapons/armors and other equipments.\n\n.,A great variety of survivor characters, which create a good part of the atmosphere, together with the radio DJ and the messages you can find throughout the game. But beware, some may work against you, they have their own personalities ;)\n\n.,You can - up to a point - play an really evil style as well as a normal or even good and helpful guy.\n\n.,Long playtime\n\n.,Base building, weapon modding etc.\n\n.,great humor\n\n\n\nIndifferent points:\n\n.,Combat - It mostly works fine as it is, but naturally could use some more options\n\n.,The late middle game can drag a bit.\n\n,. There could be more dialogues/interaction with the survivors, since it is one of the strongest parts of the game, i can´t get enough of it.\n\n\n\nNot so good points:\n\n., Not an optimal balancing.. zombies become kinda less dangerous, when you have better armor, same is with weapons - you won´t use most of the melee weapons. At least i don´t.\n\n,. Still much room for improvement regarding the handling of your fellow survivors/items etc.\n\n,. Many (mostly smaller) glitches still in the game (sometimes characters "float" or zombies stand on the same tile etc.).\nNothing gamebreaking though for me.\n\n\n\nSo, in the end, i have my fun with it, even if it´s still a bit rough on the edges. A very overlooked zombie rpg/strategy gem, which really didn´t deserve some of the negative review trolling it got.\nHope to see much more of this game!","January 8, 2015","true","53.7"," 124 of 158 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","124","158","3","17"

( saw a bad review saying it took him 30 mins to find his bed....)\n6. in the base, if you go to the stash you can in the upper left corner select other people besides your main guy, making inventory and equiping items way more easier.\n\nok with that being said dont be scared of this game because of bad ui, its not bad if you know a little of what you are doing!!!!\n\nok i do like this game i give it a 7/10 total. would be higher if it had more replay value. but i do have a bunch of time into the game so was worth getting it, still playing it too.\nsome people said they had lag or crashed with them game, but mine runs great i have had it crash a couple of times but its rare for me and it auto saves a lot so didnt lose much time.\n\npros:\nthe base is well done, and you dont see a lot of games with one.\n\nstory and dialog is good and you have to make choices that effect the game.\n\nlike the noise idea, zombies will come if you make noise with guns or breaking done doors. depending on the noise and the location of the zombies, also you can use this to your advantage. fighting ai humans, zombies can distract and soak up a lot of their bullets!! but remember if they die from a zombie now they become a zombie!! also their are items you can use to make a lot fo noise like firecrackers.\n\ncharacter making is cool and has good perks and you can differently make tons of different main characters. do you want to be a zombie killing machine? melee and strength! want to be a gun pro? go rrange and preception. want your base thrive? their is survial, mechanics, science, leadership etc.saw a bad review saying he couldnt hit zombes in the begining, yeah if you dont have enough strength to pick up a sledge hammer and no melee skills you cant use melee weapons.... and also you dont know how much life an enemy has, true but its around 60-80 for zombies and depending on the type of human you are fighting, like a soldier is harder to kill than a looter.\n\nwill say guns arent that realistic in terms of range but its balanced nicely. so is melee.\n\ncons:\nreplay might not be a lot of that, every location is static and the enemies you find there are too and most events i think are static. items you find in those area can differ a little but not that much like you might find different special items like this had coffee and now its batteries. or the food types might be different(which doesnt matter at all).\n\nminor con: is the ui but once you figure it out its pretty good.\n\nleveling up in the game is dorky. basically you have goals you need to pass, like find x amount of fuel or food or this resource and if you pass it you get a skill point. there are goals you can complete as many times as you want and then there are one time shelter goals like build 10 upgrades to shelter, but some dont give you points... and not sure but as far as i can tell you just get one point, and every 20 skill points you get a stat point. also all other character you cant lvl yourself, they put there point into what ever they want based on the type of character they are i think. like my doctor she put her points into medicine( make sense) and for the most part its not bad just that you have to add skill point into stuff you dont want because i have poeple who have mechanic skill but no science skill and people with science skill and no mechanic skill and there are upgrades, jobs, crafting etc. that require both. also so far to me putting points into medical is a waste, i have 2 medical people in my base and so far that plenty.\n\nwish there were more upgrades to shelter or that resources are done differnently. all resources are finite to a degree, but you can make food pretty easily and parts once you get a recyler. fuel on the other had and ammo are hard to deal with. you can make ammo if you upgrade your shelter but it costs fuel to make and you use fuel everyday for the generetor, wish there was solar panels or some way to make electricity besides the generator. this reason too is why i dont use a car in the game just horses. also the base seems lacking somehow, maybe if there was options to move to different locations gave different bonuses but then not sure how upgraded would work excatly if you did move. also you find tons of cars in the game, but you never can use them...\n\ni dont mine the combat, but some people might fine it boring or tire some after a while. also comabt is very skill point based, if you dont have high range/perception you cant use a gun very well or melee/strength you cant use hand held weapons very well.\n\nclosing: good game i got for 10-11 dollars very happy i got it, get it if you like zombies but dont be scared by the bad ui reviews.","December 21, 2015","true","320.1"," 103 of 127 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","103","127","10","0"

XCom both old and new then YES!!\n\nI know I don't like buggy games and normally would avoid them. So why on earth would I recommend the game?\n\n1. None of the bugs are game breakers "anymore" that has all been patched.\n2. Loads and loads of content here. Way, way, way more than I ever expected from a 29 dollar game.\n3. It is very fun.\n\nWhen I say it has a lot of content, here is what I mean.\n\n1. Battle maps, you know how when you play some games you feel like you have been on the same battle map 28 times That never happens here, every map is new, and hand crafted. The only repeats are in random encounters and those are avoidable.\n\n2. Loads of NPC that can join you, more then 30, each with their own portraits, stats, skills. perks, story, likes, interactions and requests.\n\n3. Improvements, yes you can add many features to your base.\n\n4. Multiple mode of transport. Foot, horse, or car\n\n5. Politics, there are faction in your own groups that effect your decisions.\n\n6. Equipment, there are hundreds of items in this game. You pick up a new shiny piece of armor and put it on, guess what your character changes to look like he is using it. Same with weapon and helms. Too many games just skip that these days. I like to see what my character looks like.\n\n7. Build your own character the way you like. You pick there stats and skills. You decide how to deal with others.\n\n8. Fighting styles, you don’t just have to run up and take a swing, you have different options with different weapons. Maybe you want to try to knock them down, push them back, spray mace in their face. It’s up to you.\n\n\n9. The radio, everyday there is a new message no repeats. It’s a “live” show, so if you don’t listen to the radio that day you miss the message.\n\n10. A mini hacker game, over 100 data bit can be found and hacked to find out what in them\n\nIf you like this kind of game, it’s bound to be a classic and it’s underpriced, there’s a lot more here than a 29 dollar game.\n\nEnjoy!!","December 28, 2014","true","206.6"," 188 of 261 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","188","261","5","0"

It's HUGE, there are so many places that you can visit that it's almost overwhelming at times. There are different types of locations from an abandoned gas station to a two story hospital and a nine-story hotel.\n\n-Leveling\nIt's not your usual type of leveling, you don't level up by killing but by the goals you finish to better the shelter. For example, bring home 100 food and/or 50 luxury items. These can be mixed and done at random. One of my favorite is 'decrypting' data-discs by basically solving an anagram.\n\n-The shelter/basebuilding\nIt's nothing fancy but it gets the job done. You have certain things you can build to improve the shelter, such as a sturdier fence or a car to be able to travel faster on the map. It's nothing extraordinary but it's effective and does what it's supposed to.\n\n-Combat\nVery simple and disappointing. However, since there are more than one faction (besides the zombies) you can now and then run into different groups fighting each-other and decide to either jump in and start killing or wait out to see who's the victor and then attack them.\n\nNow for the bad parts.\n\n-Bugs, bugs and more bugs\nSome bugs can be annoying, such as not being able to loot certain stuff while others might be somewhat game-breaking (as event not triggering or not being able to fix broken things in the shelter). This is something that can and should put most people off from playing the game as of now since if you spent 40+ hours just to have everything break down and then make you wait til there's a patch that fixes it.\n\nBecause of the bugs I can't recommend this since I can't even finish the game due to CTD's at the end fight.\n\nI would give this game 7 carrots out of 4 bears holding 20 poker-cards.","December 24, 2014","false","96.5"," 312 of 450 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","312","450","4","8"

Old-school, but fun and 360-degree camera panning\n- Addictive\n\nCONS\n- Too easy - I'm on day 30 and have a ton of food, high morale, and more supplies than I can shake a stick at\n- Needs more/various upgrades to the shelter. As with "too easy," I'm almost done upgrading the entire shelter and soon will have nothing for my survivors to do except eat food\n- Limited scavenging team ability. Your character must lead every team. I have a great fisherman in my compound, but he can't lead a team to the local lake and go fishing unless I'm there with him all day. A waste of time since he could be fishing while I'm killing zeds and bringing back ammo, fuel, or other depletable items.\n- Poor zombie AI. Pull one zed, park your team 6 squares away. The zombie will walk right up next to you. Bash it on your turn. Lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nAll that said, I  continue to play the game as this genre appeals to me, especially without the 1st person blood-and-gore fest that most zombie/survival games have become. I love the strategy level game, the building of a compound, the interaction of characters... just wish it was a little tougher.\n\nStill, a great game, though perhaps not at $30 yet. Try the demo first; you can play for 7 days - plenty of time to see the coolness factors. But keep in mind that by day 30+ there's not a lot left to do and gameplay becomes repetitive.

I mean it's truly terrible; this thing is somehow less fun, functional, and challenging than Fallout 2, which is 20 years old. This is further compounded by pisspoor A.I.\n\n2) Where was the UX designer? The amount of glaring flaws in this game, flaws you'll notice within the first 5 minutes of gameplay, are astounding. Examples: Why are there no weight limit indicators visible WHILE LOOTING CORPSES, vision cones/agro ranges on enemies, range overlays for your guns, etc. Stuff that an intern UX still in college would be able to decipher.\n\n3) Torque 3d. Because of how awful this engine is, you can expect crashes. Lots of them. The refusal to use other Engines baffles me, especially considering the Unreal Engine is free.\n\nI had followed this game for 2 years waiting for it to evolve, and at it's finest moments.... it's playing like a vastly inferior version of Wasteland 2. It's saturated with all the concepts you know and love from games of the past, with none of the perks or joys from new age titles.\n\nBase building: It's like a D+ version of X-Com's\nSurvivor management: It's a slightly better version of State of Decay's (since characters have personalities) with far less customization options\nTurn-based combat: F; it's inexcusably boring, uninteresting, and slow-paced. Even for a turn-based tactical game, it's pitifully slow. I would go as far as to say it's the worst, most unintuitive combat system I have personally ever experienced (and I played Shadow Vault)\nNPC interaction: It's very lacking. My choices, while phrased differently, seem wholly irrelevant and meaningless. Dialogue feels like a farce.\n\nA few other things worth noting:\n- I have no way to know what enemies are hard, and what enemies are not. They all look the same, but some hit WAY HARDER and have WAY MORE HP than others.\n- It's ridiculously hard to see the "Loot is here" indicator; why a dull orange color was used, as opposed to like a dark green or red, I will never understand.\n- Replay value seems non-existent. Want to win the game? Make a melee character, gradually ramp up to ranged, and walk through the game on cruise control.\n- It's incredibly frustrating when you're fighting and 23 zombies have to move before you can. It's exacerbated by the fact that I can't turn up combat move speed to expedite the process.\n\nI want to recommend it because I support indie studios... but I just can't. There are just entirely too many visible flaws in this game that suggest the lead designer either doesn't know what features are missing... or even worse, is not listening to feedback from his team about these absent features and mechanics.","June 14, 2015","false","57.2"," 184 of 266 people (69%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","69","184","266","9","14"

Enough time for a fair first impressions review. So here is the short version, playing this game is like eating a fine icecream after you dropped it on the beach. It is tasty, and cool, and sweet, but every lick has annoying grit in it, and it has a salty aftertaste you don't care for.\n\nThis game is so full of bugs, it needs fumigation.\n\nDon't buy it. Come back in six months and see if anyone has bothered to fix this, because as it is, it's an annoying mess.\n\nOk, details, for those without ADHD.\n\nThis has a great game in it. But like watching a scratched to hell DVD of your favourite film, it jutters along tripping over the various bugs, made all the more infuriating because you were enjoying the bits inbetween.\n\nSo what is wrong?\n\nBluntly, the game is not finnished. It's a late alpha of a great game or an early early beta of a good one.\n\nHere are a list of the actual bugs I have run into:\n\n* Graphics options don't save, so I have to reset them each time I start the game.\n* KO'd characters who are saved with a medical satchel are still considered dead once you return to the shelter. They can no longer be spoken to and are missing from the job board. The end of day lists them as lost - even though they are still stood in place in the school (2 instances).\n* No splitting of stacks. I picked up 12 gallons of fuel in lots of 1 or 2. I needed to split it between my characters to grab the last bit of loot - no deal. Or, ammo. Can't divide my ammo between the two characters using 9mm weapons. (persistant).\n* Zombie model not in the correct place on the combat grid. Or is confused. Main character was being hit by said zombie, but any character that attacked that zombie moved six tiles down an aisle in a store to attack the zombie on a tile which does not appear to be occupied. Think displacer beast. (1 instance).\n* Highly unstable client. The quicksave option should be for a cautious player moving into a challenging area of play, not as a safety measure against the game crashing.

Rightly or wrongly I thought I may be able to recruit her to my group because she had a name, and was the first living hostile I had encountered.

Nothing inovative, but satisfying. The demo is short and has VERY little replay value. On a whole the game is very linear. I think most people were expecting something more freeform or open like the other zombie games. However, it's just an RPG set in a zombie apocolypse. Nothing more, nothing less. The final game will be worth $25-maybe the $30 they are going to ask. However, I don't think the demo is worth $25 unless you have been dying to get your hands on this one.\n\nI can however say that there are few bugs to be found.","February 13, 2014","true","10.6"," 361 of 556 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","361","556","0","10"

It seemed to promise to have the social interaction of The Zafehouse Diaries with tactical turn based combat and a healthy amount of base builing mechanics ... I have played through the first day a couple of times trying out different things (and am looking forward to diving into Day 2 and beyond)\n\nA couple of things ... There has been some confusion over simple mechanics such as how to exit the school for the first time and enter onto the world map ... having a tooltip or even a simple hovering pointer would stop this being a point of difficulty for first time players ... also if you are unable to sleep in your bed because you cannot select continue ... simply increase your games resolution and the continue icon will be clickable!\n\nThose two bugs aside ... the game plays exactly like I hoped it would ... the combat is brutal and unforgiving (I lost a character to a stupid decision in less than 2 seconds ... dead ... gone ... forever!)  ... I have high hopes for the base building and the social interaction mechanics but as of right now ... this is a solid early access demo and as long as you go into it acknowledging that it IS an early demo/beta then you will not be dissapointed!\n\nLooking forward to the whole game!!\n\nSloshworks\n\nPS - Please make the zombie walking animation in combat just a tiny bit faster ;-)","February 14, 2014","true","13.7"," 350 of 539 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","350","539","0","5"

I suggest you look at a more recent review. This one was made shortly after the game's release.\n\nNot worth it right now at that price (28€) unless you are extremely tolerant of zombie games. Not a good SRPG or Survival game\n-Shelter feels lifeless since every survivor just stands still\n-Engine can't handle maps with lots of enemies\n-No basic SRPG features like interrupts/overwatch\n-Pathfinding outside of combat is very wonky\n-Human AI is very basic just rushes to you in a straight line whether or not they're using guns\n-Zombies do not roam and bandits don't patrol either\n-Zombie maps are so easy they're a whack-a-mole minigame\n-Bandits and zombies teleport to the edge of your field of view when they are on the move and out of sight in realtime\n-You can shoot through some obstacles\n-Can't rebind keys, AZERTY keyboards can't even type the damn M key in the datacenter (and yes switching to an US keyboard doesn't work)\n-When lured on a position bandits all converge on it and stay there until the end of times\n-UI is serviceable but is missing some key features like showing looted containers\n-Zombies who are crippled can't attack\n-OST is forgettable at best...\nIt goes on and on.\nFilled to the brim with bugs and lacks features/polish, deserved more time in developement.\n\nIf you're looking for a SRPG with good mechanics and a zombie apocalypse background I'd say the asking price is kinda high right now (unless money really isn't a problem for you). If you're looking for a zombie game that happens to be a SRPG I'd say go for it because let's be honest, the market might be saturated with zombie games right now but it's saturated with bad zombie games. Dead State happens to fall in the kinda alright category and as far as zombie games go it's already an accomplishement. Most of the minor issues with the game can probably be resolved with a patch too (and maybe will be by the time you read this) even if the main problem I have with it will still persist : a SRPG with little tactical depth and a lack of polish.

I asked myself this after encountering another glitchy door before going into combat with a pack of armed looters.  Character walks through a closed door right into their arms- Why.\n\nDead State is, for the most part, "finished."  The places are all there, most of them work, and there are a few things that make the game neat to play.  But that's about it.  For a text-based game, I'm entertained for a while.  But, something doesn't feel right...  The glitches, the static characters standing around doing nothing in any room at the base, the mundane grinding process, the fact that once I can't even assign a job to everyone I've brought together...  Well, there's the problem.  The game doesn't feel "finished."\n\nOnce your character is good at leading, negotiating, and fighting, all that's left is finding the people you would actually want to have around- that is if you make it that far.  The game's combat system is cruel, unforgiving, repetitive, and I hope you don't mind bodies stacking on top of one another so you can't loot one of them. It's super disappointing to see this game "released" in the state that it is now, having watched development from the very start.\n\nThis end product is rather boring.  Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy it, but more needs to be done to iron out the problems, more animations need to be added, and for God's sake, there needs to be a variation of death poses.  Everything I kill ends up laying there like it's planking- in some cases, forbidding me to loot the corpse, and we CAN NOT have that in a completed game.\n\nDead State may mostly be finished, but it isn't, and if they don't bring the updates to fix these problems and to "modernize" what feels like a game from 2005, I'm unable to recommend it to anybody at the price they're charging.\n\nIf you want this game badly enough, wait for a sale.  I wouldn't pay more than $14 for this in the state that it's in.  It just isn't up to par with more modern titles.  It's pretending to be a classic in 2015.\n\n\nLATEST EDIT.\n\nI'm sorry to those of you who support the game, and it's development team, but it appears that Dead State has been abandoned.  There are still numerous bugs, and there has not been a release of any editor tools to improve gameplay via Mods.  This is both disappointing and shameful; the least that this team could have done was offer to stick around for a while, but it's pretty clear they only sought to fulfill their Kickstarter obligations and jump ship.  They were never in it for the community.\n\nDead State still feels like an incomplete game.  It still has its vintage C-Grade game graphics, and still fails to fulfill the full level of immersion one would expect from a game posing to be one purified Turn-Based RPG in style.  When comparing this to other games in my library, such as Wasteland 2, Arms Dealer, Kenshi, Project Zomboid, Space Engineers, and others, Dead State left Early Access before it was finished, and the Development team rushed a Reanimated edition, That means they decided to upgrade the game after it was released, showing you how much they care about the very principles of "Early Access," wherein you actually get things done before putting out a game.\n\nThe very fact that these developers left their community and game to rot is simply disgraceful; it's as if they're relying on pure name-recollection to keep a fanbase (Example: "Oh, it's the company behind Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines! The game was okay, maybe this'll be better."), which means they either don't care about their games or they don't care about you.  Seeing a game left in the dark like this is dishonorable.  You don't leave a half-♥♥♥♥♥ production sitting around, you fix it so it works for your customers or you lose your customers.  Bottom line.  I can tell you that I will not be giving Double Bear my business again.","February 23, 2015","false","29.8"," 72 of 98 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","72","98","3","0"

And while killing zombies plays its part... its not the focus of the game. The real focus is on managing the lives of the living, whether its the people you take in and live with (their wants and desires and how they interact with you and everyone else in the shelter), or the rest of the people out in the zombie infested wilds of Texas (Rival shelters, lone survivors, looters or gangs small and large).\n\nGameplay wise, it plays as a mix of the old classic fallouts and X-com. I love the noise mechanic for the zombies. Which makes the decision of when to switch from using the quiet melee weapons to the loud guns far more strategic than in most games.  I love that i can through a firecracker or bang on a door to lure the zombies toward a group of violent gang members and escape with the loot while they fight it out. I like the interactions with the NPC's in the game as well. Each person and group you let into the shelter alters how the shelter operates. Will this NPC be a disrupting influence or a helpful one? Will they contribute more than they take?\n\nIts a great game all around.

They are very active with the community and even actively try to implement the things that the community asks for.\n\nThis game has superb writing.

I am a Kickstarter backer and thought the concept looked great and was excited to see what they did with this game. Sadly, I have just been disapointed with the game so far.\n\nAs gameplay goes, it is buggy (but as a unreleased game this is expected). It is a turn-based system. The basis for who goes where is a blackbox and unclear if/how you approach will let you have the first turn or last turn in a mob. This can create an extremely annoying start to a fight. It ruins the strategic element from time to time and has made me walk away from the game on more than one occasion. There are two types of enemies in the game 'looters' and 'zombies', however, the only real difference is that 'looters' have items. Other than that they follow the same mindlesss horde approach to a fight. This makes, what should be the palette cleanser of combat just more of the same. The game feels to "be on rails" and there is, as of now, zero replay value to be had. While there is an expected main story it doesn't feel like there is going to be much in the way of meaningful choice in the end. Then there is the fact that the game is not intutive and has 'hidden' controls like the quick save and quick load which can ruin your game if you accidently hit it outta the blue. Of course these are all explained in a guide book, but that guide is not actually a part of the game it is hidden on the Steam fourms. Which leads to my main issue.\n\nI just don't trust these devs to bring out a quality game anymore. There are so many little things that they have whiffed on so far that makes me think the game is going to be released halfcocked and a dud. The game is only out in demo form, but the demo is not functional to prepare you for the game and feels far more like a "hey, see it totally IS a game like we said!". The game is far behind schedule, not totally uncommon, but the updates are few, far between, and completly underwhelming. Very little progress is seeming to be made and it is concerning. Right now the price is high and there is nothing to show for it, the game is not in early access and is simply a demo verison.\n\nThe long and short save your cash, Check back in a year to see if the game has actually released and see how the game does. Right now there are plenty of other strategy sqaud based games that are worth your time and money. Check out those.\n\nUpdate for release:\n\nSadly this game released as I expected. I stayed away waiting for the release to see what the devs could do, and while I was exicted about the progress they stated the game is just plain unplayable with bugs. That is the biggest thing is that unless you are constantly saving your game you will never move forward. To be so far behind schedule and then to release a game that crashes all the time is just embarrasing. Overall my suggestion stays the same, save your cash for another game.","June 25, 2014","false","32.2"," 69 of 105 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","69","105","0","3"

I do not regret purchasing this game and feel that it is worth its current price for the amount of time you will spend on it.\n\nWHAT I ENJOYED ABOUT DEAD STATE:\n\nEvery location on the map is unique, the amount of detail and lootable containers is very well done, each location tells its own seperate little story. Some locations are tiny enough you only need to visit them once, others are so large you need two or three trips to loot it all out.\n\nGood old fashioned text! Even though the game is fully text based, it does not take away from the game as I found the story, personal stories and crisis events to be very well written and believable. The game has an interesting and large cast of characters and each of them has their own quirks, and personal issues good and bad, not everyone gets along with everyone, there is internal conflict based on the decions you make.\n\nMicro managing your group of survivors from the job board. Brilliant! You can assign jobs to your survivors based on their skill set. As you find survivors out in the world map you can recruit them, each having their own set of skills. Some are more suited for tasks than others and parts of the crafting system can open up once certain requirements are met. The high school setting really is an all too ideal setting, it basically has everything you would need to survive in a zombie apocalypse.\n\n\nCOMBAT!:\n\nThis was hit and miss for me, but overall it wasnt that much of a negative experience as I've played worse in turn based-RPGs *cough* Blackguards *cough*. Dont expect X-Com type combat, there is no cover or crouching, no overwatch or support fire, no destructable environments or elevated terrain.\n\nMy biggest issue with the combat is that the A.I. can be a little annoying (extremely slow) if there is a large queue in the turn order.\n\nHowever I feel the combat system really suits the game setting. One of the cool things I liked about the combat is the decible meter and how certain weapons generate a lot more noise than others.

In combat, you basically just move around your character to a better position such as the back of the zombie to take a strike, or use your tank to defend a bottleneck while your other teammates shoot the zeds from the back. In a gun fight, there is not much variety, just shooting and being shot at. There is no cover system. So basically it's the group with better armor and guns wins. But I am still surprised that after playing for 40-50 hours this is still very satisfying to me watching the zeds and the bad guys fell one by one and fill my backpacks with loots.\n\nThere are some crisis events occationally. The player has to make a decision that can please certain people and ♥♥♥♥ off others. One decision may have immediate effect while others have delayed effect. It's a cool element but my complaint is the crisis event is not big enough to change my loot-fight-loot-fight loopcircle. It would be nice if the crisis can force me to go / avoid going to certain places or do certain things.\n\nThe game needs some serious de-bugging and balancing. Some events do not fire off correctly or repeating forever. The loot is also too much and it makes me don't feel that I am struggling in an apocalypse world. The map does not have indication how much loot is left. I also can't loot both bodies that fell on the same tile. So I suggest if you can wait, buy this after a couple of mouths.","December 29, 2014","true","108.7"," 45 of 64 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","45","64","0","0"

This is a game that I had high hopes for. This is a game that had a lot of potential (and still does). This is a game that has let me down.\n\nI was finally able to play this game when it was released on Steam's Early Access and I was absolutely excited for it. "Finally!" I thought as I started the game and met the first characters of Dead State. In about two hours time I completed everything that Dead State: The First Seven Days had to offer. It wasn't much but I was happy with what there was and I understood that it was a game in it's alpha stage. Updates to the game were few and far between and there was little in the way of announcements on the community hub (though apparently there are more frequent updates on DoubleBear's forums).\n\nFast forward to September, I notice the game was moved forward into it's beta stage, "Finally!" I once again thought as I booted up the game. There was certainly more to do this time, a lot more, but soon things went downhill for me. Many of the locations were simply not finished which surprised me considering how long this game has been in development and there are at least two areas that I could not leave once I entered such as the hospital that was not textured and had a grid that  had "512x512" on it. Some locations you can enter despite it's unfinished state but you'll see that there is nothing to loot and no one to kill. I'm not sure how many game days have passsed but I know I built many of the available upgrades to the shelter. However, my save is no longer playable as I cannot load the game without crashing. In previous saves I can't re-enter the shelter without crashing. I have no idea what is causing this problem, it definitely has something to do with the shelter, whether it's an upgrade or an ally.\n\nI am very much aware that Dead State is still in beta and that it's in early access. Once again, I am very much aware that Dead State is still in beta and that it's in early access but this feels more like an alpha. For a game that has been in development for so long there is not much to it and I'm pretty disappointed about that. I'm disappointed that after release date delay after relase date delay this is all we got. This is just my opinion however and everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I know there will be some who agree with me and many who will disagree and that's okay.\n\nSeptember 21st: Started playing again to check out the new update. Gameplay stopped after 7 days that said "Thanks for playing!" as dialog with survivors went on over the screen. After the dialog I pressed "Continue" and was taken to the main menu. I'm not sure why that happened other then something happened where the game thinks it's the first seven days demo.\n\nNovember 3rd: I wanted to try the new update and see how things came along since I last played. I saved the game during the intro sequence right after I created my character. I loaded the game (or tried to) but was met with an error "CGC::GetPC - could not find playable character." I have no idea why this is occuring.","September 4, 2014","false","58.6"," 91 of 144 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","91","144","0","4"

I guess the devs thought it would make the game harder and more realistic, but all it does is make it more "automatic-move-and-attack-nearest-guy", and less of a "thinking man's game".\n\nFinal verdict: As a turn based game, the combat system is its heart and soul. Sadly combat is also the least polished, least complex and least enjoyable part of the game.\n\nAs a result the whole game falls flat on its face because of the shortcomings of the combat system.","April 13","false","7.0"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","32","42","0","0"

Firstly, I want to be presented with a set of options that potentially change the entire way the game is played. Secondly, I want to be able to control multiple characters, while still retaining a main character role, and lastly I want said characters to be in a survival-esque situation or dilemma. For me, this game ticks all the boxes.\n\nIn a nutshell, Dead State feels like a more strategic form of The Walking Dead by Telltale Games, and also the TV series episodes, in that its your job to keep safe a bunch of survivors stuck in a zombie apocalypse. Unlike The Walking Dead, however, wherein you are almost certain that someone is going to die and you're going to be left with one, maybe two survivors, that same theory is never in concrete in Dead State. Someone could die at any minute, and it could be any of your survivors, including you. If you're sensible and strict, you can manage to avoid deaths entirely, but the potential is there, and that's what makes it all the more fun.\n\nDead State also has a great variety of salvageable items, dropped from both zombies or other hostile survivors, or found from things that you yourself can imagine searching for if there was a real zombie apocalypse. Suggestions that your fellow survivors make are also logical ones too. For instance, in games such as Left 4 Dead and Contagion, the idea of going to places like a hospital or train station or coastline is all too familiar and accepted - Dead State eschews that principle. Being stuck in central Texas instantly eliminates the idea of sensibly heading to the coast to get away from big cities, like many other games would (I refer to both Left 4 Dead and its sequel as an example), but the survivors directly tell you why going to places like hospitals, clinics, supermarkets and the like is quite simply a waste of time.\n\nEach and every survivor to you is as dynamic and unique as they are important. What I mean by this is that the plethora of people you will come across truly are different in every way. From flight attendants to former cops, from veterinary students, the mentally and physically handicapped, and every other minority in between. As diverse as they all are, they all have a certain role to play at your shelter (which is a now heavily barricaded school by the time you've arrived). From nursing the sick to fixing the fridges, you get to choose who does what for how long and when. As of the time of writing, Dead State keeps things standard by allowing a venturing party of yourself and three other members of your shelter to head out into the great outdoors in search of supplies, but all the other survivors will be busy doing things that you've allocated them to do. To me, this feels like a real sense of teamwork and feels quite rewarding when something gets done right and progress is made.\n\nTeam fights are a very basic turn-based system using action points that vary from character to character depending on their stats and other attributes (think Divinity: Original Sin as a prime example). Though at this stage in development, hacking down a zombie with a sledgehammer isn't too hard to do, the real threat thus far is other humans. Some have responded to this in the community hub with great negativity, but I find it makes only too much sense. After all, if there really were a zombie apocalypse, I'd fear humans more than the zombies. We know from games like The Walking Dead and Dead Island that the more dangerous threat is other humans. Let's face it: they panic, they have no idea who to trust and why, they move faster, and they still have the capacity to use a gun. Dead State makes all of these clear to you, for truly when you see another hostile survivor on the map and turn-based combat starts, you do need to think very carefully about what to do because even one angry gunman can turn your entire survival situation upside down.\n\nI won't say the game is without its faults, it certainly isn't. The game is still in beta though, so you certainly have to give leeway for that. The game is peppered with lots of tiny errors (which I'm sure can be rectified quite simply) and a great deal of content has yet to be added, but the development team are quick to respond to issues and are very good with their communication to their community, which is always an added bonus. In-game content doesn't avoid controversy either, they don't shy away from real-world issues that would occur during a cataclysm like the plot, such as racism, murder, betrayal, religion, same-sex relations, disability and others, which, while risky is also quite a breath of fresh air.\n\nUltimately, if you're looking for a game that gives you the flexibility to be in charge, while retaining a challenging experience to keep not just yourself, but others with you alive, with great versatility and variation, Dead State should definitely be added to your library. Dead State is a unique game among its genre, but one that works in a really good way. If you have reservations about Dead State and questions regarding its current gameplay that you don't feel have been adequately answered by anything you've seen or read, I'd be happy to answer them for a game I feel so positive about.\n\nFor those that teal deered: 9/10.\n\n- - - - - UPDATE: v. 1.0.0 (4th Dec 2014) - - - - -\n\nThis will be a lot more brief than the content above mentioned at the end of October, but as Dead State is now fully released and out of beta, it seems only fair that you know what's changed in the last month and a bit. Truly? Quite a bit. I'll list the greatest first.\n\nFor starters, all of the unfinished crap that you could find when travelling around on the map (i.e., accidentally finding a completely empty location with just the shell of a building) are completely finished. This might sound like a quite obvious one, but there were a lot of these locations, so it's pleasantly surprising to see that they are all complete and weren't just scrapped and removed. Often, you could be travelling in a party of four and all of a sudden, three more of your survivors who you left at base would pop up out of nowhere and also be there. Though it wasn't necessarily a bad thing to have 7 of your people running around with you (especially in combat, it was quite nice to exploit), it wasn't how the game was meant to be played, and honestly, having more survivors with you will only cause problems.\n\nOne of the three main commodities in Dead State, fuel (the other two being parts and food), can be very hard to come by. That being said, there was no way for you to turn off your shelter's generator if you didn't particularly need it burning your fuel. In the Dead State community, this caused a bit of an uproar as it simply drained people's fuel that they wanted to use for other projects. That being said, Double Bear clearly noticed that this was an issue, listened to its players, and now the ability to turn it off is functional.\n\nThe artwork of all characters have been updated too, and their portraits are now much larger. Not a huge issue, but it does make it look much better, and aesthetics do count to a lot of gamers. That being said, it ties in with the fact that a lot of characters received updates to their personal perks (a lot like talents in World of Warcraft or Divinity: Original Sin, for ease of explanation).\n\nBack in October I mentioned that there was nothing stopping you from equipping yourself with the best shotgun and the strongest hammer in the game and just smashing your way through - so they've added skill requirements to all weapons to prevent this! Though it may not seem like a lot, it does prevent you from giving your wispy little doctor a giant railroad hammer.\n\nUnfortunately, I ran out of space but thank you for reading!","October 12, 2014","true","88.7"," 253 of 427 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","253","427","0","18"

Instead, it just folds up like a house of cards.\nAll of this looks like a result of a terrible lack of oversight, and in too many areas.\nWell, since I'm no professional gaming journalist, let's just make an obtuse little list.\nSo here we go, in no particurlar order:\n\nBalancing issues - there are precisely three tiers of armor in the whole game. One is, to put it mildly, ♥♥♥♥ and has all the usefulness of a wet tissue paper. The other excludes zombies from the list of viable threats completely. Finally, the third one is a ballistic vest and and any other armor with a better defence rating. You put those kevlar sunday suits on, you never have to worry about anything ever again, nothing can seriously harm you anymore, which instantly turns the game into a glorified mall looting simulator. Everything else can be worked with, but if you're making a combat-heavy game and then take any thrill out of it, you aren't exactly gunning for a favorable impression. And you can get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ vests fairly early in-game, too. I've got my first three around day 18 or so, and that's not that far into the game at all, and I didn't stumble upon them either - an NPC directed me there.\n\nSpeaking of the loot, Dead State is a damn good looting simulator. There are all sorts of neat little locations you can shamelessly rob, tons of people you can liberate from their stuff, and in general it is very satisfying to haul bags of freshly stolen military rations back to your hideout. Or at least it would be, if you didn't have to wrestle with the inventory every time you have to do that. If you are trying to haul a serious load, you will have to click a gajillion times though at least three menus. And you will end up having to do just that, because, as you progress through the game, your character roster will expand and expand and expand, even if you suffer losses, there will be ample replacements, and all those buggers will want to eat, if nothing else.\n\nHovever, the interface problems don't really end there. For example, you can't really view character stats and inventory on the same screen, so often you have to backtrack between two different tabs to see what exacly you should be arming mr. New Guy with so he wouldn't blow his ♥♥♥ up or. All of this would be acceptable if you were dealing with a game lke  W2, where new party members are few and far between, but nope, no dice, there is a huge roster of potentially available characters and you will have to rotate them from time to time.\n\nThere are also a lot of smaller questionable design decisions, and them being lacking is often apparent in the late game - for example, the way zombies cannot pose any threat to you no matter the numbers. You are never risking getting bum-rushed, mobbed, dragged to ground and eaten, when facing a big group - not any more than during a one-one fight, which kinda goes against the conventions of zombie genre, because them shamblers are supposed to have strength in numbers. But no, as far as the game is concerned, there is very little practical difference between a fighting a mob of zeds and fighting them mano a mano.\n\nSpeaking of which, balance issue notwithstanding, the combat system leaves a lot to be desired. It would be acceptable in a 20-hours game, but, once again, the deeper you get, the more obvious its lack of depth is and it's not going to get any better, because the few options it can offer are laid out in front of you from the beginning.\n\nFinally, the plot. Without getting too much into details, I was pretty disappointed to learn about the ending. While execution was par the course, there  was much more promise to it. See, there were all sorts of little breacrumbs with omnious hints here and there, but it turned out they've had zero relation to the plot itself. In addition, it appears that some content was straight out cut, and the threads were just left there hanging.\n\nThere's also an issue with the bugs ranging from mildly annoying to game-breaking, but discussing those is pointless. Indie studios like Double Bear can hardly afford quality QA, and whatever the reason for game being the way it is right now, the bugs can at least be fixed. Bad design is forever.\n\nIn general, Dead state is a game you can nitpick for a long time, but - credit where it's due - only because Dead State is a big game with a lot of effort put into it. There is a lot enviromental storytelling going on, the sound meter makes you think and use the situation to your advantage, since both living and the dead can react to you making a ruckus, there is a lot of characters with unique interactions, quest lines and personality qurks, the management aspect is interesting and adds another, much needed layer of complexity.\n\nProblem is, though, for each and every one of these points there is counterpoint. The areas get duller and duller the further you venture from your starting point, the noise gimmick becomes meaningless because there is little combat difficulty to speak of, so you can just shrug and go in guns blazing, the character interaction is shallow and only manages to grab your interest by juggling characters around and never focusing on any of them - and that's actually a good thing, as this is a cardboad cutout fest worthy of the worst Bioware games, management aspect looks interesting but never delivers, because you won't ever find yourself starved for resources or even operating at a loss, and so on and so forth.\n\nI guess it is worth its money, since I've got my 60 hours of entertainment out of it, but it's not worth the disappointment you will inevitably experience.\nAnd that does the game in.","December 24, 2014","false","67.3"," 131 of 215 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","131","215","0","1"

I am nearly 2 hours into the game and I am only on day 1 out of 7 days. So far the game lived up to what I expected. The tactical combat is nothing new, but is as good as in similar games such as JA2 or XCom. So far the story is okay, but might get better later on (only day 1). I havent gotten to the point of fortifying the base yet or any other shelter management. I will update the review as I go further into the demo. So far I would certainly recommend the game as it seems to be nice once it is finished.\n\nEdit: After 5 hours and on day 3. The fights seem a bit too easy, but then again, it's just the beginning of the game and a few times I was close to losing someone, so I guess it's alright. The Map works similar to Jagged Alliance 2, although enemies and loot don't seem to respawn where you have already went, but I might be wrong on that. The Demo doesn't seem to go very far into the Story, so I cannot really say if the Story will be any good. Nearly all base building and jobs to give to your mates are not available in the demo, so I can't really judge that. Bugwise, I haven't encountered a single bug yet or I did but the bugs were that small, that I didn't even notice them. The graphic looks a bit outdated but I personally don't care about graphics in this type of game.\n\nI would recommend it to anyone who is into that kind of games (tactical round-based, zombies) and wants to play the demo and get a small discount before the game is finished, hopefully this summer from what I've read.","February 13, 2014","true","46.8"," 202 of 341 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","202","341","0","0"

It's not flawless; the turnbased combat system is sometimes annoying, there are a few bugs and the replay value is low due to event progression, and it is expensive. But it's also fun.\n\nOverall, I really like this game and hope for some sort of expansion/sequel. More choises on where to build your shelter and more interactions with and between the other survivors would be great.\n\nEdit: Oops, seem to have missed a part of the manual.

Seriously, it has all the elements you could hope for in a zombie survival type game. base building, loot, skill trees, crafting, quests, and much more. I love every minute I play this game, well almost. The thing that prevents me from recommending this game in its present form is that it is rife with bugs. Not just little niggles, but game crashes, pathing problems, teleporting group members, logistic errors when throwing something like a molotov cocktail,  quests that wont complete, the list goes on.\n\nThis game came out of Early Access way too soon. It's like the devs never beta tested it or, if they did, they need to sack their testers and get new ones because they failed in a big way. The cynic in me thinks that the game was released with full knowledge that it wasnt finished, in an effort to make money. It should have stayed in beta/early access for another month or so at least. Until the current bugs are fixed, I recommend that you keep an eye on the game and buy it when the bugs have been ironed out. If you cant wait, buy it but save often, although from what I hear there have been a few problems with game saves, although I have not experienced this particular problem myself.\n\nShould you bite the bullet and buy it now, be prepared for frustration, but at the same time, be ready for a deep and thrilling ride through the zombie apocalypse. This review should be longer, and I fully intend on adding to it in the future, but time contsraints mean I have to keep this short  I came here to write this review after another game crash that closed the game, but, like any addict, I am going to go right back in and carry on for a little longer before I go back to work :)","December 11, 2014","false","125.3"," 62 of 97 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","62","97","0","0"

None gamebreaking so far, but it will disrupt storylines and characters. Example: You discover a possible X, you investigate the areas, collect the items, yet nothing happens. You check the forums, only to discover this X quest is not implemented. This happens several times over the game.\n2) Horrific UI, item management, and character management. IE: If another corpse dies on top of another corpse, you can't loot them. Another example: You can't loot all items in a map quickly, you need to click on dozens(sometimes hundreds) of items manually per map to loot them.","December 28, 2014","true","131.9"," 40 of 59 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","40","59","0","0"

The writing and dialogue is where this stands out. All of the characters are individuals and prompt a range of emotions. Some are hilarious and some down right infuriating.\n\nThe turn based combat is simple but varied enough to work out elaborate attacks especially when you start to obtain decent weapons and armor.\n\nThe managment and building side to the game are great and really add to the involvement.\n\nI've read a lot about its bugs but all I encountered were some side missions not ticked off the board.\n\nAll in all its simply a great adventure which, for me, smacked of the right kind of nostalgia. It reminds me of what made GTA Vice City so great. No single aspect stood out, except the writing in the this case, but everything came together to make a thoroghly enjoyable and remorable experience. 10/10 for me.\n\nOh, and the endings.

See the bottom of it for my update.\n\nGoing to start by saying that I love this game.\nI followed this game for a while, and saw so many complaints about bugs and the like in the other reviews for it.  At 40 hours in, I've only had 2 crashes, and one bug where I got stuck on an object which necessitated reloading my last save.  Not bad, I say.\nThe price was a little high for this old school, low graphic kind of game, but I don't regret buying it at all.  I figure 2 hours of my pay went to this, and I've got 20 times that in entertainment so far, so it's a damned good deal.\nWhile not overwhelmingly dark, this game has ts moments.  The story, and the horrors you see in your explorations, are what you would expect.  The humans are the real enemy, not the zombies.  Killers, looters, ♥♥♥♥ gangs, etc. are a constant reminder that humanity truly has fallen.\nI highly recommend Dead State.  Don't let the previous reviews with all of the negativity about bug issues put you off.  You'll kick yourself for waiting.\n\n\n**  Alright, so yeah, I've discovered some more bugs that, while annoying, haven't ruined the game.  First, there are some goals on the To-Do List that I've accomplished, but aren't being checked off.  I've been asked to go to specific locations, have done everything there is to do there, but they've not been checked off.  Second, one of the Steam Achievements seems to be fouled up.  Give 25 luxury items to survivors.  I've given out about double that, if not more, and it stopped counting long ago.  Third, on one of the maps, I can only take a party of 3, rather than 4, if I want to pass a certain part.  It's a shopping mall, with offices above, and in one of the staircases, only 3 people can fit.  That's a bit of a pain, as there are some tough mofos up there.\nA pain in the ♥♥♥, surely, but I still recommend the game.

Sometimes a character will ask you for some item or suggest visiting a specific location, but for most of the time you are left with nothing to do. After 40 in-game days when you have storage full of food, parts, fuel, antibiotics, when you have all shelter upgrades constructed and when all your characters are equipped with the best available items the game gets really boring and repetitive.\n\nMoving in combat mode is completely broken, costs shown are often incorrect, characters chose longer paths, are unable to avoid obstacles etc.\nGame freezes and crashes.\nInventory management is a real nightmare. Multiple bugs, no way to easily move chosen items, items often do not stack, tabs in the storage are useless - you will have hundreds of (non-stacked) items in first two and about 20 items in the other 4. There is no way to easily find weapon/armor or sort them by type/damage. When equipping characters you cannot see their stats, when looting there is no maximum carrying weight shown, you have to constantly keep changing between inventory and character information.\nWhen upgrading shelter or crafting items the remaining time shown and estimated finish time are often incorrect. Sometimes having fewer people to work on an upgrade allows to finish it faster.\nSometimes your turn is ended after first attack even though you still have action points. If the same character acts twice in a row, their action points are not refilled.\nRunning around the shelter and trying to find constantly moving characters is a real pain in the ♥♥♥. Same when giving them items to improve their mood - constant running between storage and survivor. No way to handle this from some overview panel.\nMicromanagement gets quite annoying with 30+ characters. In the morning 5 characters come to you asking for a day off and if agreed they are automatically moved from their current job to "sick". You have to remember where they were assigned to or check all possible jobs.\nYou often give survivors promises but there is no track of it. You cannot see any conversation history or any hints.\nVery poor choice of items, workshop/laboratory are completely useless as there is nothing really worth crafting there.\nThere is far, far more to this, but there is a limit of the review size so I couldn't list them all even if I wanted.\nA very few nice things:\nexperience is not equal to the number of kills - main character gains skillpoints for fulfilling goals which are mostly how many items of particular type were scavenged, while other survivors gain 1 skill point per day\nthe game loads/saves very quickly\nyou can load a game during enemy's turn\nthe loading time of maps is very short, usually a few seconds only\nyou can swap positions with friendly character for 2 action points","September 13, 2015","false","62.3"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","34","49","4","1"

Certain aspects like NPC actions and morale has not been ironed out and there are still small bugs. That being said I still enjoy it and patches has been good and often coming.\nMy experiences on the stream forum for this game with DoubleBear has been nice. My queries has been answered quickly and with decorum.\nThat DoubleBear decided to push the next patch a couple of weeks because of the holidays is understandable (by me at least) and I look forward to the next patch.\n\nThe obligatory pros and cons list.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Basebuilding in an RPG, The basebuilding could be more elaborate but just the fact that its present is a major boon.\n2. Good story.\n3. Turnbased combat. (I consider this to be a great asset)\n4. Hard game. This will have you start over or reload a lot.\n\nCons:\n\n1. No interaction with NPCs. The NPCs comunicate via writings on the screen and a menu. there are no way to comunicate with them or interact other than fight or leave. (NPCs are the living that does not come to stay at the base. Often hasn't got a name)\n2. Linear story. Your actions and choices in dalogue does count. Still some things are set to happen at certain days and they will do that.\n3. Annoying inventory. The fact that you at base has to go to the store to see allies inventory is bulky in itself. This has been adressed in previous patches and has improved but is still not good.\n4. This is just a minor annoyance for me but the fact that containers with visible loot aren't lootable. An example is in the base there is a gymnasium with containers with balls in them. Balls are a luxuary item but you cant get the ones in these because you cant interact. It goes the other way too so if you empty a shelf there is still item on it when you empty it. This is an immersion glitch for me and a minor annoyance.\n\nAll in all as it is it is a 70/100 I will try to update as more patches emmerge.","January 9, 2015","true","75.1"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","31","44","0","0"

You can save everyone you come across, but that just creates additional mouths to feed, meaning scavenging becomes even more important.\n\nLoved the characters, each one felt like a real person, even the cliched archetypal characters (nerd, goth, redneck).

This turn based RPG is a bit rough around the edges and is entertaining at the same time.  In my short playtime so far it has crashed several times.  The UI/Controls are a bit wonky with the iso view being just slightly not flexible enough to get a good view.  The upgradeable base and morale and stocking the supply larder with basics + luxury items is brilliance.  Lots of fun there and the raids into town/pharmacy are fun and tense.  Despite some roughness this is a worthwhile purchase I think.  time will tell if it has the staying power but it does appear to have enough in it to keep a zombie fan busy for awhile.\n\nThe weapon variety seems good (melee, guns and even a tazer)  Ammo is reasonably sparse making you treasure every shot and the action point based movements are a tried and true method to force good use of tactics.  Skills for the individuals matter and make a difference on how you will approach any specific situation and the sound mechanic is pretty cool.

No sense at all. If you wear the heaviest armour, you are literally invulnerable to all damage. You can wade into crowds of zombies, or even humans armed with assault rifles, with 0% possibility of death. Goodbye suspense. Also, boy o boy is the combat pretty boring if you're waiting for a dozen zombies to drag themselves over to you, and god forbid you start off with the wrong team-member in a crowded area- get ready to skip turns until it's the turn of the guy in front.\n\nBugs: I let a few patches go in and decided to give the game another chance. I spent about an hour clearing out a block of houses and looting. The last zombie on the map got stuck in a closed doorway to the room I was in, leaving my team stuck in a bedroom for eternity. This kind of thing is not uncommon. Also, if you aren't able to design a multi-floored building without having players stuck in combat with enemies on different floors that they can't see, stick to bungalows.

The game has everything I would expect in a post-apoctolyptic world: starvation, a battle with morale, interactions with survivors, and of course fighting and killing zombies and looters.\nI believe the best aspect of this game is interacting and rescuing survivors. Each survivor has such an in-depth storyline which creates an emotional attachment with the gameplayer. You're forced to make such difficult, yet rewarding, decisions which impact the entire game's plotline.\nOne controversial aspect of this game is the turn-based fighting. Now I may be in the minority with this opinion, but I think the turn-based fighting adds originality to the game. It makes the game memorable and stand out from all the other zombies game.\nAnother part of the game which is a challenge is the balance of morale. Your survivors are scared, depressed, and alone in this zombified world, and they look to you, their leader, to keep their moods up. If you fail at keeping your survivors happy, they will leave your shelter, steal food and weapons, or even mutiny against you.\nThis game is brilliant, and the latest patch made it even stronger.

The store is loaded with supplies that you so very much need. You round a corner and get pounced on by a zombie luckily your other compadrae was right behind you and sledge hammers the zombie in the back of the head before you became a torn open meat bag. Now you carry on with looting the building and come to an office door you open the door, axe in hand ready to fight a possible zombie only to find a looter aiming a gun right at you.\nHe fires shooting right past your head. you duck back away from the room where the crazed gun man resides. Seconds later you hear pounding on an emergency exit where your pooch had lost the horde on the back alley of the building. They heard the gun shot. You and your partner high tale it out of there as the door busts in from the weight of the horde. The looter is now trapped in the room struggling to stay alive. You are half way out of the building as you hear moans and gunfire in your wake. You meet up with your loyal pup and flee the store now once again claimed by the dead.\n\n-That is the sort of game play I love about Dead State I give it  5 out of 5\n\n","May 19, 2015","true","46.9"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

It can be a trudge to get through the game and I found myself playing through long periods of boring and/or frustrating gameplay to get to short spurts of good writing. You see my playtime count? That is one playthrough, that is me being careful like you're supposed to and stretching out viable resources - what you're supposed to do. There are just far, far too many problems with the gameplay to list them. There's even major, recurring issues outside of combat and they too are too numerous to list. While the shelter functions almost perfectly you'll encounter glitches and bugs that make the game tiresome and even disrupt combat frequently. Aside from that bugginess there are a plethora of questionable gameplay decisions outside of it. Zombies are terrible enemies for an isometric RPG and don't work well as antagonists for numerous reasons. Tie in that the game is so glitchy with the turn order I can't tell if they're supposed to be fast zombies or slow zombies and the main antagonists of the first half of the game are just really frustrating to deal with. The game isn't well balanced for the second half of the game, which is further hurt by extreme bugginess. The writing is quite good but you only usually get exposed to it at the beginning of each day. While there is environmental storytelling in most areas, with even some events in progress, its not enough to fill the gaps.\n\nThe gameplay is just too much of a chore for me to recommend the game for its writing, which while good isn't so good its worth trudging through the rest of the game for. The game would've been recommended if it had the gameplay of a title like State of Decay but since 90% of the game is average to downright tedious and boring I cannot recommend it, not even for a Steam sale. I got it on such a sale for $9 and while I don't regret my purchase I don't believe I could recommend it to others.","February 15","false","187.9"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

I love it because it is turn-based, concerns surviving the Zombie Apocolypse, and has RPG elements.  I hate it because it is just too <expletive deleted> addicting, which sometimes ensures my Monday mornings at work are impacted by my lack of an adequate amount of REM sleep.\n\nIs it perfect?  No, but what game is?  And remember, this is just a game, a means of entertaining yourself.  Apparently, I have not spent enough time in-game to encounter all these bugs that are generating so much drama in the forums.  Regardless, if I find any bugs, I plan to communicate with the devs in hopes of fixing them, not go whining to the forum flamewars (grow up peeps).\n\nI strongly recommend Dead State to those of you who like turn-based RPGs in a Zombie Apocolypse setting that incorporates group behavior and relationship management in addition to combat and exploration.  It is a challenging game and I look forward to many more (>100) hours of play.

There are a few good aspects, though the negative aspects overrule a lot of the enjoyment which could be had.\n\nGood Aspects:\n- The micromanagement of each person in your shelter and prioritising finite resources is satisfying\n- Unique survivor perks and characteristics which adds a bit extra decision making when deciding on a team\n- The leveling up system is odd, but appears to function fairly well, allowing you to scale well relative to the dangers of the outside\n\nBad Aspects:\n- Combat - At the start combat seems ok, but the further in the slower, more tedious, and painfully boring it gets. During each turn of combat, the queue of characters will cycle through the entire list of characters on the map until it gets to a relevant character/zombie/etc participating in that combat. With the larger, more zombie-populated maps, I was sitting up to roughly 15-25 seconds per round simply waiting for the queue to cycle to the relevant zombie. Plus, when a zombie is in the combat area, but unable to reach a player, it will stand there for 5 seconds or so, letting out a bored groan, mimicking my own, made worse again when 4-5 zombie were bottlenecked.\n\nIt may not seem like a lot, but if combat has as little as 4 or so rounds, I am essentially waiting triple or quadruple the length of time than is actually necessary to finish combat. And, the more you play and the harder areas you get to, the worse the issue.\n\n- Descriptions - You will need to use Google. A lot. Descriptions of the various skills, leveling system, and user interface are very poor, meaning you will either need to have a second monitor with a wiki page helping you understand the basics for the first several hours, or you will be re-loading previous saves after realising you screwed your character up.\n- Bugginess - While not the worst game bug-wise, there were many instances of characters occupying the same cell and making it difficult to issue certain commands, a few times I was attacked by 'invisible' zombies, which only appeared during the second round of combat, and there were a few crash to desktop moments, though I can forgive this.\n\nIn short - big problems, which could be quite simply fixed, potentially raising the score from 4/10 to 7.5/10.","February 5","false","81.8"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","19","26","3","0"

The concept is great - managing a shelter of survivors of a zombie apocalypse - and there's a stack of looting, crafting and even diplomacy to do.\n\nUnfortunately it's all held back by the combat system. It's slow, it doesn't feel like there are many options (no overwatch/defensive stance), the bottlenecks caused by the narrow grid system are more irritating than strategic and the AI is really frustrating - just had a prime example where a human enemy had two zombies gnawing away at him, but kept shooting at my unconscious character until she died.\n\nIt also has some dubious design decisions, such as requiring that your character be on every scavenging mission. Even if you have 20+ people at the shelter, and your character is best suited to leading behind the scenes, you must go out.\n\nNot only does this discourage focusing on the leadership/negotiation skills, it means you're at a constant disadvantage as you have to either sacrifice a day of scavenging to rest or constantly have a character with half their HP.\n\nSpeaking of negotiation, it offers a lot of promise but is too reliant on hidden triggers. One example was when I had a heart-to-heart with a survivor and finished by asking him to ask how I was the next time we saw each other. I ran up to him with anticipation the next day...and only had the option of repeating that very same conversation. It made the whole thing feel empty and pointless.\n\nThe AI in general is a bit wonky. One location has a group of survivors lure you into an ambush. However, if you don't walk to the specific spot which triggers that, you can just stroll around them and loot all their stuff while they stand there blankly.\n\nFor all that negativity, I still recommend buying it if you can get it cheap. It is still more enjoyable than many games, and it's worth a shot to experience the positives; it's just depressing to imagine what it might have been.\n","May 22","true","26.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

In terms of setting, the game nails it.  Since society has broken down you’ll have to turn your group into a bunch of scavengers in order to survive. This is a dangerous endeavor in Texas where firearms are plentiful, and some homeowners aren’t going to let you raid their pantries or medicine cabinets without a fight.\n\nAs leader of a rag tag group of survivors you are going to be in charge of determining who to take in, how rations are divvied up, what improvements to build at base with your meager resources, and how you will relate to outside groups like motorcycle gangs, militias, and remnants of the US Army. Sub leaders will emerge within your group whose council you will need to take into account. They may try to pull off a coup against you. Maybe you can accommodate them or maybe you can put a bullet in their head during a mission and blame bandits.\n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed the setting, character interaction, and government game aspects of Dead State there were a few issues that might be major turn offs for some players. First off, it pretty much plays exactly like the old turn based CRPGs of the late 1990s. Think Fallout 2 with zombies. It also looks a little like Fallout 2 (as viewed through nostalgia goggles – obviously it is more attractive than Fallout 2 if you’ve played Fallout 2 recently).  I personally don’t like the art style because a friend pointed out that all the NPC’s have facial features characteristic of Down’s Syndrome (and now I can’t unsee that… thanks, bro). The lack of voice acting made Dead State’s NPCs feel a little flat. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines’ NPCs were really interesting because of excellent voice acting coupled with great dialogue by Dead State lead Brian Mitsoda.  Also, be prepared for an assortment of bugs and crashes. I don’t know if there is anything game breaking you need to worry about but that could be a possibility.\n\nI was able to get 175 hours of enjoyment out of it and I am actually contemplating starting a new campaign to try more stuff out. So consider this highly recommended, if you can put up with the flaws I mentioned.","September 20, 2015","true","175.5"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","26","39","4","1"

For a huge zombie fan like myself, this game is something i've always hoped for. If an editor ever gets released, this game will be a without question must have for anyone who enjoys the zombie genre. A lot of freedom to explore and even the freedom to run your survival shelter like a total prick. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at a couple of your lazy sub-ordinates? Take em out in the field and perhaps they will have an...unfortunate run in with the undead out there. Nice little storyline that doesn't really get in the way of exploring the overall game itself.\n\nThe bad:  Unforgiving. Your first run in with hostile survivors will make it very evident that you just might be outmatched and outgunned. Missing a shotgun blast at point blank range...with your last 2 shells...yeah that just happened. Can become a bit repititious as well, as some locales appear to be just more of the same stuff you've already seen. Prepare to save and reload often.\n\nKeep in mind you can bring up console commands to give yourself a bit of an edge. This game will not hold your hand.\n\nAgain I am a huge zombie fan and gamer from way back....and this game took me away from a very modded State of Decay for a nice bit of time...which says a lot.

As it stands, there are only a half-dozen areas to visit, and not much to do in them aside from some very enjoyable grid-and-turn-based tactical combat ... and the stealth elements that allow you to avoid such combats in many cases.  Being sneaky is no false promise; by selecting the quietest possible weapon and walking around alone, there were only a small number of cases where I could not quietly take out an enemy while keeping its buddies unaware (that goes for zombies and humans alike, though you can debate the realism of a human not bothering to call for backup in such a situation).\n\nThe base-building is bare-bones at the moment, but it looks like it is going to be a lot of fun once fully implemented--which is something I would say about the game as a whole--allowing for an intriguing cross between Fallout and XCom overall.\n\nCertainly, you can question the decision to only give players a demo if they pay for a pre-order in the form of "early access."  But the game is solid fun now, even if fairly small in scope.\n\n(Also I alt-tabbed out of the game and accidentally left it running for a weekend; no, I did not find some way to get 48 hours of play out of a short demo)","February 18, 2014","true","67.9"," 47 of 79 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","47","79","0","1"

It delivers on the promise of managing a shelter, fighting for survival, tactical combat with very different approaches to the dead and the living. Given that it was made by a tiny, indie team on a small budget, this ambitious game delivers.\n\nI did wait for the Reanimated update to start playing, and I think a number of earlier complaints have been fixed.\n\nWhat I like:\nI like the dual game of managing the shelter and then going out and exploring the world and engaging in tactical combat, almost like a role playing Total War game.\nSet in the modern world!! A nice break from high fantasy for the genre.\nGood opportunities to role play, with fairly interesting characters.\nCombat is fun and tactical. Approach to fighting zombies and humans is very different. And the noise meter is a good system that adds a nice cost and trade-off decision to firing each round of a gun.\nMaps are quite well designed. They capture the feeling on Walking Dead and other zombie shows - the world is your oyster, go around, scavenge, pilfer, but be ware. Around every turn a zombie or 10 could be hanging out, or you bust into a supermarket only to find half a dozen aggressive looters already there and they don't want to share.\nThe feeling of resource scarcity is real - you are generally always low on something, whether it is fuel, antibiotics, bullets, etc. They did a pretty good job of making enough systems where you feel a constant urge to go out and risk life and limb to find more of something.\nGood writing and humor - item descriptions are fun, and some maps visually tell a story without any dialogue. There is a faux-twinkie factory, and an ominous church filled with dead inside. I am sure there are more like it!\n\nCons:\nThough much more stable than previous versions I guess, I still get a few crashes and bugs\nCharacters feel a bit shallow. There are a good amount of them and probably more I haven't found, but I do wish they had more depth and other branches of dialogue, and more interaction across them.\nInterface is very clunky - especially the inventory. Splitting items is a pain. Trading items between team members requires a special move, instead of being just built into the inventory. Reloading and unloading guns is done oddly and you can only do it in certain screens or menus.","May 28, 2015","true","51.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

When it works, it's a delightful experience reminiscent of the original Fallout and other such games with an interesting world and endearing characters.  Collecting loot from locations, rescuing survivors and interacting with them, upgrading your shelter, and equipping your characters all prove to be engaging stuff.  The first 30 days are great fun as you struggle to explore a strange and hostile landscape.\n\nThat said, the game ends up with several critical flaws. It's unfortunately buggy and will crash on you quite frequently, the UI is occasionally frustrating to sort through for important information, and the combat is underwhelming due to mechanics that become imbalanced in the mid to late-game. The game just steadily begins to run out of steam after the first month as it gradually runs out of ways to challenge the player.  You'll mostly be sitting around as you wait for the game's endings, which themselves don't do much to really resolve the player's emotional connection to the characters and story.\n\nDead State is a game I cautious recommend.  It tries to be the Zombie RPG we all wanted 10 years ago and succeeds fpr the most part, but in doing so it feels exactly like an unfinished Iso-RPG from 10 years ago.  Dead State isn't perfect, but I guess it manages to be "good enough".","April 17, 2015","true","148.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

It would work if battles were more group focused. Example if zombies fought in groups together so that on a map you would have maybe 3 or 4 major fights which you can fully enjoy the tactical control of the combat system. Currently, you will quickly grow bored killing sometimes one zombie at a time.. some maps have probably 50+ zombies; very mind numbing.\n\nStory:\nWhoever wrote this games story needs to get some real life experience. Don't get me wrong, the direction of the story is awesome but as soon as one part starts to get interesting the epic idiocy comes out in full.\nExamples without give out too much details:\n\nThe group members do not respond as if the world just ended by a horde of zombies. They will try to take 'time off' for insane things like headaches, diarrhea, etc. You wouldn't tell your captain you had a stomach bug in the middle of a battle nor would you 'take the day off' if zombies could at any moment run the shelter over.

I'm at about day 15 and am happy to report that the writing gets better and all of the features I was looking forward to start to open up quite a bit (shelter upgrades, new survivors, interesting but tough choices, and personality management).\n\nI am a point and click guy, but will admit, there are times the combat can get pretty tedious. There are some layers of strategy that can be satisfying (ie; using the noise meter and zombie hordes to your advantage to take out looters) BUT you really need to take time in between battles to manage your inventory before heading out on another run. They do, however, alleviate some of the micromanagement by automatically stocking shelter items each time you return.\n\nYour survivors will randomly need to take some time off due to sickness or other reasons, so you will have shuffle your scavenger party every once and a while (this is a good thing). Your survivors also level up, but at a slower pace than your main character.  And while you can't allocate the points manually, you can occassionally suggest areas you would like your other survivors to improve when they do decide to level up (which is fine, I guess. It goes along with the concept that you can't control everybody at your shelter. You have to mange personalities through dialogue choices and finding items in missions).\n\nFor me, the UI wasn't as intuitive as I was expecting when it comes to information and inventory management...but that's a tiny gripe.\n\nAside from those gripes and small pathing issues, if you give it a little time, the game does get interesting. It's certainly worth 20 bucks and has more depth than I thought it would. The demo will give you a good idea of gameplay mechanics, but as I mentioned, it really picks up from about day 8-12.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI've been following this prject before kickstarter many years ago and am an early backer. While the development has been slower than I had initially hoped (due to some global issues affecting some of their remote team members), there is enough here to get the gist of the type of game they are trying to make. And it definitely has some really great potential (exactly what you want to see in an Alpha).\n\nWhile the updates have been slow moving, when they do implement an update, you see a pretty significant impact. It's somewhat playable as is, but still needs a lot of work. You are paying to help test and give feedback. They have only released the first seven days and there is much to do. And while we all want more, they are still implementing story, maps, features, etc. . If they released anything beyond seven days, it would spoil the story and other surprises they have in store for us when the full game is released.\n\nBack this now while it's on the cheap. This game has too much potential for gamers to let it slip into obscurity.","June 17, 2014","true","64.3"," 45 of 77 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","45","77","0","0"

On the surface this has a lot to recommend it; recource gathering, base building, missions and more besides, and no doubt that make might for a fun game. But the combat system is so irredeemably awful it makes getting into the game a tricky notion.\n\nThe typical action point system only comes into play once you're in combat so you're free to run around until then, but once you enter combat, good Lord does the game go south. For a start, you can't attack on a diagonal, which makes precisely no sense. Square on fighting is the order of the day. Secondly, there's no way to bring up a list of key commands so if you need to change view for instance, there are no on-screen icons to do it (a staple of these kind of games surely), you're kind of stuck. The whole game lacks that kind of simple clarity. Thirdly, it's too easy to batter someone on your team (why does the game allow this without at least a simple 'are you sure?' check?).\n\nAs a result, once you enter combat it turns into a farce of repeated misses with whatever weapon you have equipped (early in the game you equip a weapon which doesn't show on your character who then gets advised to equip a weapon by everyone he meets before going outside - top work!), shuffling your characters around to try and get to the right square to attack and then using all your action points hitting your own team.

I played Suikoden back in the day until they stopped making it for the European market, and the replay value of Dead State is kind of like that of Suikoden: You play through, then you play through again to get things perfect. Then you set it asside and pick it up one day when you remember what a fun game it was.\n\nI love collecting the characters, interacting with them, and scavenging. Killing the zombies is fairly easy, but battling the gun-wielding humans can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ (but that's part of the fun). I like improving my headquarters and the crafting. I like how my decision making and interactions have consequences, and I like following along with people's stories. I also have to give the developers special props for not deciding for me that the main character is hetero.

This is not a timed demo. The game does not expire after 7 days. The initial build is called The First Seven days because it only features content from the first seven in game days.\n\n2. This is not a paid demo. This build is an evolution of the 3 day demo that was shown at PAX. It is a way for Kickstarter backers to get a progress report to see how far the game has come along\n\nIf this was released in the condition it was in, it would be commercial suicide. It's buggy, it's crash prone, and it lacks many features. Unlike actual demos that exist for finished games, this is not a demonstration of the final product.\n\nYou can either save a measly $5 to pre-order a game that isn't done and get access to content that is not even in beta form yet, or you can wait 3-5 months for the game to be actually finished and try out the public demo that will be available to everyone for free while reading reviews and make the decision for yourself.\n\nIf the word "demo" was absent and it was simply called The First Seven days, then I guarantee you there would be no public backlash as the content featured here is the same as the initial Early Access builds of Wasteland 2, Blackguards, etc.\n\nAs for the actual game itself, it's a very promising and ambitious computer RPG that feels and plays like one from the late 90s.\n\nFor an indepth look at the game, check out my video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-c5cplcqZs","February 23, 2014","true","11.7"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","29","48","0","0"

This is not one of those games. Zombies make constant, obnoxious noises every single turn, and they are so irritating that I've felt the need to turn off my sound on more than one occasion. The firearms in this game are far too underpowered to be of any use against anybody, living or dead. One of the worst parts of this game is the hit chance for a gun. I got a 0% hit chance with a lever action rifle from three spaces away, which is stupid. I'd also like to note that the hit chance system is complete bull, since even when you get a "90% hit chance" it's insanely likely that you will miss. The places you can go in this game normally have looters, which can range from one person with a knife, to twenty men with full armor and guns, yet there's no way to know how many looters are in a certain place without engaging them in combat, which, on many occasions, has killed me and my team in the first few turns. All these issues combined makes the game nearly unplayable.\n\nBy the time you realize how bad the game is, it's already too late to get a refund, so be warned, if you buy this game, prepare for severe disapointment and regret in not buying a better game.","August 21, 2015","false","10.7"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","22","35","2","0"

Could understand this happens once but not every dam map and starter map as well.\n\nAnother example, first map quest go get drugs.  I sneak around map killed a few zombies, near use all my med kit up but made no sound.  Went into the chemist and 2 looters there, one has a gun and fires, this makes a noise and 3 zombies join in plus the two looters I finaly killed turned into zombies.  In the end they killed another char with 2 hits then eating then my turn to get hit with fits for 90hp dam then bleed to death.\n\nworks out I am only doing 10% dam to zombies armed with knives, gun and such yet they kill with 3 hits, does not make any sense at all and makes it impossible to even start playing when you cannot even finish the first quest.  I have tried it with dif weapons. skills and make no difference at all.\n\nSeems like a great idea and has good maps, anims, items but lacking in any fairness of play as you start off with nothing and after a few maps end up with nothing but lost hp due to never fully healing.

Unfortunately this causes the difficulty to be... excessive. I think so far I've reloaded Brady (near the beginning) around 10 times, from looking online, I'm not alone in that.\nThe focus on melee, means that the game devolves into surrounding an enemy and hitting them. Unfortunately the human enemies seem almost super-powered compared to your guys, surviving multiple axe, bats and shotgun blasts to the face.\n\nI'll be following the game in case things like cover mechanics, crouching, overwatch get added in, but for the time being, the combat is overly simplistic, lacks difficulty options and has a number of crashes that really should have been resolved by now.\n\nA pity, it had a lot of potential.","December 7, 2014","false","8.0"," 59 of 105 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","59","105","0","0"

Yes, killing a single zombie is a cakewalk. Yes, the shelter occupants you start with are a pretty good bunch. Yes, it seems like once you get a chain link fence up all your troubles are over.\n\nThey are NOT.\n\nThe game will actually let you fall pretty far behind the curve - and then murder you. It will certainly monkey wrench your plans and will make running your shelter difficult. If you are not careful people, including you, will die in one, two rounds of combat. Don't let the simplicity of the graphics or the basics of combat fool you.\n\nPlay at your own risk. :)\n\nI knew I was going to spend some time with ths game when I found myself zooming in on the map so I could see the details, read the spraypainted graffiti on the wall, and try to figure out just what story was being told with the scenery in a house that was no more important to the storyline than holding three zombies to fight and a little bit of random loot.\n\nI like strategic games, I like building games, I like RPG's, and I really liked the Fallout series of games. Any game that is going to give me a dog companion (a perk available in the game) to face the post-apocalyptic future, zombie-filled or otherwise, is going to get my attention. A shelter filled with unique occupants with interesting backstories, single player combat that I have to worry about more than my current health to survive, and wanting to see what new thing happens tomorrow is going to keep my attention for a while.\n\nIF you prefer FPS/realtime over turn based games, cannot stand bugs in games, or want the latest and greatest in game graphics think twice before buying this game.\n\nIF you like games where you go back to earlier saves to try something different, unexpected "monkey wrench" challenges to your plans, and games that tell a story I think you'll like this one.\n\nIt is a travel around an area map in search of locations for encounters kind of game that has base management, personalitiy conflicts you must settle, and a humor to it.\n\nCombat, which is turn based, isn't deep but its' different. Worrying about allies panicing, how much noise is being made, and if a combatant you thought dispatched and done with will get up again to attack you as a zombie are things I haven't had to deal with in combat before. It IS a zombie game full of zombies. Slow, simple, easy to kill one. Trying to balance noise that attracts more of them against the noise made killing them isn't as easy. Neither are the human enemies you come up against, some of which can be quite challenging the first time you meet them - especially if you are underarmed or underarmored. The variety of weapons is pretty extensive. I have three hundred hours in it and I have not tried them all with their different kinds of attacks.\n\nThis is a game I have enjoyed coming back to and seeing what was improved on in every patch and update. I am willing to put up with bugs to play a good Alpha or Beta game. Why anyone would want to go back to waiting months for a patch that tries to fix everything instead of an incremental improvement/feedback loop I will probably never understand. As often as this game has been updated to fix the remaining bugs and incoroprate player suggestions I'm sure I will be playing it off and on for some time to come.\n\nThink you'll enjoy it. I did.\n\n(edited for grammar/punctuation/clarity - which yes, probably all still suck and need another patch of their own.)","December 24, 2014","true","432.0"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","35","60","0","0"

The menus are far away from\nintuitive. it takes hours to manage your inventory ♥♥♥♥. Sometimes I feel like doing my taxes instead of playing a game.\nThe game is also sometimes annoyingly complicated. After the first mission I searched for a place to sleep for 10 minutes. I clicked right and left on every bed until I finally found THE ONE I could sleep in. What is the point ???\nEven if the game is so "realistic" that you don't want to sleep into someone else's bed - it could give you a hint like "I want to sleep in my bed" I seriously thought this is a bug.\n\nIn the fights your are always surprised. I mean the game shows you a perfect straight street on a sunny day and you're strolling around with your party and suddenly 5 zombies appear in front of you ! Have they been invisible ? Can everyone in your party only look into 5 meters distance ? Same counts for weapon range. I can throw my keyboard farther than these guns can shoot.\n\nBest joke is to heal somebody. I was wounded and found a complete, full medkit. Nevertheless I could not heal myself because you need to put the contents of the medkit into your medic satchel to heal someone.\nImagine this: " doc ! doc ! help me!"

It's a very fun game and i'm really enjoying.  It's nice to play a single player version of a survival game.  I played h1z1 and dayz and while those games are fun its really hard to enjoy the game when you get killed on sight and lose all your stuff.\n\nI'm not in to writing a big a review of the game.  Most people have already gave a good review of it.  I'll just tell you a little story.  I was on a run and on the way back, i found a camp.  So we go check it out and start taking stuff.  Well there was people there telling me not to take there stuff.  Well i ignored them and they starting attack us.  So i killed them all and took there stuff.  Well first i beat them down and knocked them out and than did a final blow to them.  I go back to the shelter and one of the guys at the shelter told me that i shouldn't do that.  Just kill random people and take there stuff.  I told him i won't do that again but i still do it.  Another time, i got a random encounter on the road where there was a car crash.  There was a guy standing next to a dead body next to his wrecked car.  He wasn't saying anything so i wasn't sure what to do, so i just killed him.  No consequences on that though.  I think it was suppose to let me recruit him but i think it was a bug because he wasn't saying anything.\n\nThe bugs in the game aren't that bad.  Every now and than, the game will crash but it takes a long time for that to happen.  The game autosaves a lot so its not really a big deal if the game crashes.  A little annoying but whatever.  It's still worth playing and i hope there will be dlcs for the game.  If you are wondering if $29  is worth it, i would say yes.  You could wait for a sale but i didn't and i'm enjoying the game a lot.  As i get further in the game.  I'll add to my review.

BUT, most are small annoyences that can easily be fixed OR avoided.\n\n1 corpses tend have there body model one place, but acctually be somewhere else. so if you try to attack a zombie and are confused as to why your charecter is wandering off a different direction, you know why. this bug is a little common, but it useually doesint cause a major problemb or major frustration.\n\n2 be CAUTIOUS around 2 or more floored buildings!! these tend to have lag and are very glitchy/ wonkey!! ESSPECIALLY ON THE STAIR CASES!!! SO try to avoid saveing in these areas and go slow. you can eaither take your chances or avoid them. second storys are useually rare or far away from your base. so you wont reach them till your far in game.\n\n3 charecter AI i dont find that bad. they tend to do stupid things, but i feel as long as your not running far ahead and stay close to your team they tend to navigate fine. running ahead too far makes the navigation a little confused. this does not mean you have to stick close to them like babys.\n\nyou have to assume they will go straight for you or take the shortest route to you. if you run around the zombie hoard while your far ahead and your teams just now catching up, guess whats going to happen. so always keep that in mind and that your team can lag behind a little.\n\n4 random crashes. i have only had 2 (knock on wood) so far. but the game auto saves everytime you enter a area. there is also the quick save button F5 and a quick load button F9. so when the crashes do happen, they happen very quick and you can just quickly reload the game.\n\n5 so far no major lag. lag tends to only happen when a lot of zombies are suddenly aware of you or appere suddenly all together. and agian as mentioned above, in 2 or more floored buildings. it rarely happens.\n\n6 mutiple bodys on a single tile in the same position. mainly zombie bodys. useually you have to glide the mouse slowly over the stack to select the different bodys becuase they merge/ cover each other. happens as often as you let it. zombies useually tend to stay seperate unless you funnel them down a hall or something.\n\n7 dead state is not very happy with windows 8. you CAN play it on win 8, i am proof of that. but in order to play it on win 8 you have to go to the games main file and set it on "windows 7 compatability".\n\nthese are just some of the most main and common bugs that ive seen mutiple times.\n\n#2\n\nnow that the bugs are out of the way, time to start talking about the main parts.\n\n1 i love the charecters. everyones different, acts different, love/ hates different things. and some will ask you for help or advice and you may have to solve fights between two charecters who dont like each other.\nsome charecters you mite even personally hate becuase of their attitude or opinions.\n\nand beware, not all charecters have good intentions when entering your group!! so choose wisely!!! or face some charecters dieing from your mistakes.\n\n2 i love the loot and moral system. there is a major morale system that you must make sure stays good or there WILL be consequences!! so you must be sure to bring back not only food but luxerys as well. toilet paper, tooth paste, books, shampoo etc.\n\n3 recruiting. unlike other games where you have all the time in the world to gather others. this one has lives on the clock. take too long to find someone and itll be too late for them. (useually the clock starts running out around day 30-40)\n\n4 leveling. when you first start you have a certain amount of skill levels to spend. chooseing between melee, ranged, leadership, negotiation, medical, science, survival, and mechanical. each time you reach a certain point in a skill, you'll get a perk. chooseing between two.\n\nthere are also stats that can help things such as your health, carry weight. chooseing between strength, agility, vigor and perception.\n\n5 events. each new moring some charecters want to speak with you. asking for more supplys, to take the day off, or advice. asking if they can come with you on the next run. to tell you of a near by location. or just to whine and compain about something.\n\nsome can be very major and lead to disaster, so be careful on some choices and watch how charecters act. the most major ones will require you to have a meeting and decide between a few choices. not all of your group will agree on the choices made at the meetings.\n\nwhile traveling you will also come accross random events. some can give you new survivors, others can lead you into a gun fight with zombies and looters. reading the event description useually gives you a hint of what will happen.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSO there you have it. the most common bugs ive seen and what i like about the game.\n\nis the game worth $30?\nHELL NO!! i suggest buying it when its on sale. i bought it on sale for only $20. i suggest getting it lower then $20 if you can.\n\nif your still on the fence about the game. try the demo. its basically the same, bugs and all.","March 24, 2015","true","11.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Of course, this means going around to all the various places in Central Texas, dodging every zombie and murdering every looter to fill up your backpacks with as many ramen noodles and luxury items as you can carry. TIMES INFINITY. I wouldn't mind if there was more to interact with in the world (and there really needs to be more stuff to do to break up the monotony of scavenging all the time), because having to loot gets so damn boring after a while. I ended up skipping entire days towards the end of my playthrough because I was really sick and tired of having to go out and ♥♥♥♥ing pick up the groceries. And I hated not being able to delegate this task to the two or three people sitting around in the shelter once all the improvements were built. This mechanic, while it fits in really well with the world falling apart and even adds an 'Earth Abides'-style flavor to the proceedings, drove me up the ♥♥♥♥ing wall and onto the ceiling, down the wall on the other side of the room, and back. Like a really angry hamster determined to get out of his cage.\n\nSo why didn't I just quit the game and play something else?\n\nHere's why - this game has some very, very interesting storytelling. When people talk about this game being a spiritual successor to games like Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines and Arcanum, they're talking about the solid storytelling. Brian Mitsoda (he worked on Bloodlines and Arcanum) and two other people made this game, and Brian did such a damn good job with the writing that I kept going despite hating what was going on with the game. And that storytelling is what held my interest throughout the entire game - I nearly could forgive all the monotonous scavenging if it meant more lovingly written, well-researched bits about how the world fell to the zombies, about astronauts losing their ♥♥♥♥ on the ISS, interactions between survivors, between militia groups, between the outside world and the little emotional ecosystem going on in the shelter. Those moments were beautiful and fun to experience.\n\nI really had to fight to finish the game, both inside the game and outside. The scavenging took such a mental toll on me, but the storytelling kept me coming back for more. I don't doubt that this is going to be a cult classic among RPG enthusiasts, easily joining the ranks of the great RPG games that don't work all that great but have such wonders to show anyway.\n\nYou know what? To hell with it. I recommend this game, but  only if you bring several audiobooks or your backlog of podcasts to go along with it. If you don't, the monotony will drive you crazy (unless you're one of those mutants who runs around in a field to beat up slimes so you can grind your way to one-shotting Sephiroth at the end, in which case there is no hope for you). It starts out strong and ends strong, but everything in-between moves so damn slowly I nearly quit several times. You've been warned.","March 9, 2015","true","65.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

I have been watching the game for a long time but decided to wait until it went on sale to pick it up.  It seems like Doublebear has been doing steady patching, while maybe not to the level some people want, updating none the less, so when it went on sale I went ahead and decided to pick it up.   I love turn-based games and RPGs and Zombie stuff so it I figured I would roll the dice and drop $20 on it and see what I got.\n\nSo far with a couple hours under my belt I am really enjoying it and I haven't ran into any bugs.  The UI is a bit frustrating at times and a couple of times I wasn't sure what I needed to do for stuff like swapping inventory.  A quick glance at the manual resolved those issues.  The game can be counter-intutive at times but counter-intutive isn't the same thing as game breaking bugs.  During my play (I admit I haven't spent a lot of time yet) I have enjoyed the game play.   It does feel like XCOM with Zombies instead of Aliens.   Yes the misses will frustrate you sometimes, but that is the genre.  The game isn't "easy" but it isn't "unfair" either.\n\nPeople can fuss over if Doublebear released the game too soon as a greedy move or not.  I don't know what the game state was back in December when it launched, but currently the game is very fun.  Games can always spend some more time in the oven to enchance them, but then again at some point the game has to leave Early Access (though I have a few that I seriously doubt ever will).  But at the end of the day, is the game fun?  Yes it is.  Is it a AAA title, no.  Is the price fair?  Once again that is subjective.  From my couple hours of game time, I can tell you that I wish I had picked the game up eariler, regardless of the sale.  The normal asking price of $30 is a bit high for a indie title, but I believe it is mostly worth the price from what I have seen so far.  I have gotten less enjoyment for double the money.\n\nGame prices are all over the place these days for Indie titles so I honestly don't know what a good price point is for games anymore.  That said I based on what I have seen so far and what I have read the game should last at least 30-40 hours, so I think it is a fair value.\n\nSo in closing is the game great?  Time will tell.  Has it been fun so far?  Yes it has.  Have I seen any bugs yet?  None that I can tell, un-intitive user interface design, yes, but bugs not really.   Of course I have just begun the game so that can drastically change along the way.  If it does I will be sure to update my review.  But at this time I can say that I would pay the full asking price for the game, much less on sale.   I think the game is good.  It isn't super, but it is fun and fair.\n\nWith 2.5 hours under my belt so far I would give the game a solid 80/100.","March 22, 2015","true","4.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","2"

I find every aspect of the game to be amazing, from the base building, to the combat and discovery and group management.\n\nDoes that mean that the game is without flaws? Definately not. There are things about the game that I would like to see changed in ways, but the devs did say that we can expect more patches with changes and additions. I just feel that some guy got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, and he got all his friends on board to do bad reviews on the game, atleast thats what it looks like. Show me another game where they have all of my favourite aspects in one game, eg base management, character progression, exploration, looting, the list goes on.\n\nSome people might argue that the game was taken out of Early Access too quickly. I could understand why people would be upset about that....if all the patching and content also stopped, but thats not the case. DB devs posted that continued patches and content are planned, and by the amount of patches in the last few weeks, I can see they keep their word.\n\nI've played many otehr games, games that cost more, and I've felt truly robbed by some of those whishing i could get the time and money spent back.

What State of Decay should've been: A zombie survival game that places emphasis on "Survival". An XCOM-State of Decay hybrid, I'd recommend this game to anyone whose a fan of strategy and/or survival games. This game oozes originality and fun gameplay, you'll be immersed very quickly into a tense atmosphere where one wrong step can land you knee deep into a horde of Zombies. The only downside is it lacks a character creation, an element that would help bolster the RPG aspect of the game. Other then that, a solid game. Can't wait for it's release.\n\n***EDIT***\n\nSince the game has come into beta, I've pumped a bunch more hours into the game and have only scratched the surface of the game's depth and content. However, one issue that I was unaware of was the travelling system; whilst the game is better then a lot of triple A games nowadays, if you go beyond 12PM whilst travelling back to camp, you die. Now, that seems quite harsh, especially with the games lack of an autosave feature, relying on you to spam that F5 every few minutes. The character creation has been implemented, but it's relatively bare right now, a lot of the features being locked and still being worked on. I imagine we'll be seeing more updates to it within the next few updates.\n\nThat being said, the game oozes style and creativity, and whilst state of decay was a poor comparison with this game, it's a breed on it's own; a XCOM and Walking Dead lovechild. If you love strategy, and you love RPG's that you can make your own story to, then this is the game for you.\nCan't wait for more updates and more content.","February 13, 2014","true","53.1"," 77 of 140 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","77","140","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/danielo83/recommended/239840/","danielo83","Starwars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/danielo83/","209 products in account","I've just finished my first playthrough of Dead State and I definitely plan on replaying it at some point in the future. In short, I'd say that it's definitely in my top games for 2014.\n\nThe game is a bit of a curious mix of survival games (think resource gathering in something like This War of Mine) set within a framework of a RPG playing quite like Fallout 1 and 2. After a brief intro sequence you are soon aware that the zombie apocalypse is happening and you are soon put in charge of a shelter in a Texas town called Splendid. It's your job to make sure any survivors (you will find many who you can invite into the Shelter) living there can, well, continue to survive. You talk to people, solve conflicts, assign jobs. And then you wander out into the world seeking resources.\n\nThe game is viewed from a top-down perspective with a camera you can spin around.\n\nGameplay:\nThere are a few different gameplay actions you do during the game. As described above, the Shelter is your base which you need to improve. This is done via a Job Board where you can assign tasks to your fellow survivors such as building things, be a doctor, or come with you out into the field to get supplies.\nThis is all dependant on the game's RPG system where you can invest points into various skills such as Ranged Combat, Leadership, Medical skill etc. All survivors you meet have their own set of skills (which you don't have any control over, but will continue to grow over the course of the game) which make them suitable for different tasks.\n\nThere is a base management aspect of the Shelter. You need to keep it stocked with food, gas for the generator, luxury items and medical items. There is a morale stat for the Shelter depending on how well you do.\n\nThe survivors also hang around the Shelter where you can talk to them and get (fairly brief) bits of their stories. You can also ask them if there's anything special they'd want from the scavenging hunts. Someone may favour whiskey, someone else a cigar. This will raise their mood. If a survivor's mood goes down, they may end up leaving you.\n\nAlso, each morning there are little interactions, situations that arise in the Shelter. People may be arguing, someone may need to talk to you about something etc. Sometimes there are Crisis Events which is regarding bigger decisions in the Shelter. The characters involved will agree or disagree depending on your choices.\nThe writing for the characters is very good most of the time. It's down to earth and believable most of the time. There are a few exceptions but mostly the writing gives the game a real human feel which is exactly what a game like this needs. You can also find "data items" which can be found in the world and decrypted so you can read them. These items vary from the Dead State equivalent of Twitter messages, medical reports, personal letters, message board discussions etc, mostly about the outbreak of the zombie virus. These are *fantastic* and present a real nice backdrop to everything that's happening.\n\nI also have to give the developers kudos for including characters with a form of mental illness. Too often in games do they treat mental illness as just being CRAZY! But Dead State does it seriously even while it may not dive too deeply into the subject either.\n\nDuring the day, you're most likely out scavenging with your party (total of 4 members including yourself). This is done via a worldmap travel system (again fairly similar to the older Fallouts). There are many locations to find in the game, all with varying resources, allies to recruit and enemies.\nThe combat system is very much like Fallout. It's turnbased and may feel rather slow and clunky to some players. The combat system feels at its best when fighting against humans, it can get pretty exciting. Most of the time, the zombies are a non-threat. Individual zombies are weak and easily taken care of. Any danger that they pose comes from the being in groups.\n\nThere is a noise-level system in the game, and the zombies are attracted to noise which creates a very interesting dynamic. If you get into a firefight with some humans, you can soon count on the fact that zombies will start to move towards the location of the gunshots. This creates a great an additional layer to think about during combat.\nYou can also use this to your advantage, luring groups of zombies into a bunch of human enemies by throwing firecrackers for example.\n\nVisuals\n\nDead State is not a AAA game by any means, and it may look really crude at first. The character models in particular look fairly boring. However, when actually playing, one notices that locations in particular are quite well done. It's not high end graphics by any means but all locations manage to convey a sense of place really well. Whether it's a shopping mall, a neighbourhood of houses, a resort. They work really well actually. Animations are also pretty well done though it feels like it could've needed a few more.\n\nAudio\n\nNothing special here. The music works well and does its job. It sounds relaxing at the Shelter (except when conflicts arise) and creepy when exploring. Given how much combat there is in the game, the combat music quicky wears out its welcome unfortunately and starts to grate after a while. Sound effects feel pretty "stock", nothing particularly exciting.\n\nOther stuff\n\nMuch drama has been made about the buginess of Dead State and, indeed, I did run into a fair amount of bugs and polish issues. Mostly it seems to be certain story events and such happening out of sequence at times. There are many small annoyances also such as difficulty traversing stairs at times. It feels a bit janky at times, moreso the longer into the game you get. At least that was my personal experience.\nI had about 5 crashes throughout my nearly 50 hours with the game, I'd say that's pretty good actually.\n\nIt also has some pacing problems. The game is pretty slow to get going, mostly due to there being few followers at the start and not much to "do with them" so to speak. It feels a bit empty. The game shines during the middle when the Shelter starts filling up, people start talking to each other and things start happening. And then the energy goes away again toward the end of the game where you've collected all the stuff you need basically. It feels more like a waiting game then for the end-game to set in. I think the game would've done well to be "condensed" a bit, especially at the end it can actually get a bit boring unfortunately.\n\nSummary\n\nAll in all, I *highly* recommend Dead State if you know you like the types of gameplay it offers, It is extremely addictive, I found it very easy to play through just "one more in-game day". The writing is mostly great and give it all a nice sense of purpose. Like I said above, this is one of my top games for 2014, no question.\n\nHowever, the bugs may annoy you depending on how sensitive you are to games feeling a bit broken and janky. The devs are gonna be actively patching the game so you may want to wait a bit before taking the plunge yourself.\n\nAll in all, highly recommended!","January 5, 2015","true","54.3"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","2"

No matter who you select for your first party, its like watching the three stooges try to fight the undead. Miss, miss, miss, get eaten.\n\nZombies can also sense you if you are directly behind them. No sneaking allowed.\n\nAlso, they have 9 action points, which is as much or more than your starting party members. Which means they can shuffle much further than you can move, while apparently getting free or almost free attacks, which is infinitely better than the 3-8 AP required to attack them.\n\nAll of this topped off with the fact that your weapons hit them for 7-25 damage, up to about 50 with the sledgehammer.

I've read many reviews that claim this game is awful, unplayable, so full of bugs that it's not enjoyable and after playing 75 hours of it, I will have to disagree. I'm not saying it's a perfect game or doesn't need more work and polishing but it is still a pretty damn fine game on it's own.\n\nNow as far as bugs go, I've encontered a few but not nearly as much as other people claim there are. There was one instance of a zombie disapearing and being unattackable while still existing on the map and attacking you on it's turn and every once in a while the game crashed. But other than that I've been pretty much bug free.\n\nWhat I enjoy about this game? An intresting story/setup where being the leader of your group of survivor of a zombie apocalypse isn't just about mowing through wave after wave of zombies and calling it a day. Taking care of your shelter and your people can be just as fascinating. The combat while not super deep has some interesting layers with positioning, noise making and panic mixed in the simple but effective turn based combat. There are some nice RPG elements added that give some replay value and I absolutely love how you can influence certain events/characters simply by the way you treat them. I also enjoy looking at the shelter evolve with time both from upgrading it but also from smaller things (food in the pantry for example) and wish there was even more of that in the game.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the game as it stands is how unbalanced it is. Maybe I've just played that type of game too often or maybe I'm too "efficient" for what the devs intended but after only 30 days in game all shelter upgrades were built. At day 45 I've discovered what looked like most of the locations. And because of the perks I took I had enough fuel and food to not have to care about it for another 3 months, I had enough antibiotics to be able to shower my people with them, my fence was nearly indestructible and I had enough weapons and armor to have everyone equipped, even characters I knew full well I would never take in the field and even then I was throwing weapons and armor in the recycler despite not really needing any more parts. My overall morale was so high that I think people were happier than before the zombie apocalypse. And now I had to just pass each day until sopmething else happened. And it became a bit boring at that. So I decided to make another game where I would put myself restrictions on how much and how fast I would do things. Every day I would only go on one outing for one location only. Doesn't matter that my inventory is not even half full, doesn't matter that I'm still at full health. It sure made the game go at a slower pace and makes it longer before I'm done with everything but I find it disapointing that I have to put myself these restrictions instead of the game making me take hard decisions on what I need now and what will have to wait later. (think X-Com for instance)\n\nI also have other small issues with some desing decisions (like the inability to advance to clock until after everybody is done working) but again overall it is an enjoyable game with a good concept that I hope the devs will keep polishing and making better with time.\n\nOh and for replay value I hope one day they come up with different maps so that people who played the game don't already know where everybody is or where important things are.","March 17, 2015","true","112.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

First would say while the game is out of Early Access, there are still quite a bit of bugs and glitches but I have not come across any game-breaking ones and the game does have an ending. But the game is still being cared for by the developers and still getting big patches and fixes every other month or so.\n\nNow that's out of the way let's start on the game. Dead State is a survival focus RPG where you play as a created character who survives a plane crash and later wakes up in a school with other survivors. The school is your main base and so the main focus is to help build it up while also going out to find supplies and other survivors to join you. It is cool that your base does change when you build upgrades and the March patch now let's survivors roam around, giving it more life-like. The only thing I do wish is more stuff you can do in the base or also the look changes based on the survivors you recruit (mainly them bringing in personal items to decorate).\n\nThe gameplay outside the base is similar to games like Xcom or any squad based RPG. You go out with a max of four people and when you arrive at locations, you mostly just look for supplies while fighting off the undead and hostile living. A nice thing is you will have to use different tactics when fighting zombies then living, since the undead aren't as smart and can be dispatch faster. However the good thing is they keep it bit realistic in the sense that taking on one undead or two is easy, but taking on a big group can be deadly. The equipment in the game while plenty, sadly they are not random in stats like Diablo. Also many survivors you recruit will have different skills that can be useful both on and off the field.\n\nSpeaking of survivors, Dead State is one of very few zombie games that actually get this right. By right meaning every survivors you recruit is a "person", a unique personality that can change on how you treat them. You will also get events involving them that also give them more of a background. Course another nice thing is nobody is safe, since the game does have permadeath on party members (though if your main character dies it's game over) that does affect morale. However if you have somebody that does get on your nerves, you can easily take them out on scavenging, kill them, and come back claiming they got eaten by undead. Also by them not being safe, they can also get infected if you're not careful. Luckily getting infected doesn't automaticly mean death in this game, as long as you have antibotics you can fight off the infection. So in a sense unlike other zombie games where other survivors are either as lifeless as the undead or there fates are already sealed, this game does them justice by actually making them people trying to survive with you.\n\nGood:\n-Plenty of survivors that join you, each with thier own look and personality\n-Lots of areas to explore\n-Realistic equipment\n-Good amount of content and length\n\nBad:\n-Still good amount of bugs\n-Combat can drag on little too long\n-Interface and menus could use some work on","March 22, 2015","true","62.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It's also one of the best indie games I've played this year. A post-apocalyptic zombie game where fighting zombies is the least of your troubles, your task is to keep a shelter of ragtag survivors afloat. This means keeping it secure by building/maintaining your wall and posting guards. Keeping your food and water supply going by looting abandoned buildings (or unabandoned ones), building a well and gardens, and raising chickens. Trying to keep your food refrigerated (and stop your survivors from rioting) by keeping a steady supply of fuel for the generator. Dealing with the other surviving factions, either through "diplomacy" or force. And so on...\n\nThere is a fair bit of combat, but for most battles, it's a matter of chugging through and killing everything so you can loot the map. In most cases, either your party is properly-equipped for a combat scenario (in which case you will eventually win) or it's not (in which case you will lose, probably quickly). This is a big reason the game feels slow nearing the end: you know you can kill everything, so now you need to chug through and do it. This is especially true for the zombie maps, since a "hard" zombie map is just one with a lot of zombies on it. Human enemies will wipe the floor with you in the early days, but by the end game, there are only a few encounters in the game that will give you any real difficulty. Even some of the scariest-looking ones are actually quite easy with decent equipment. So it's the shelter management aspect where the game shines.\n\nIn Dead State, you have a great deal of control over all aspects of the shelter's management. You're not only responsible for meeting those basic needs (food/safety/electricity/morale) and assigning work duties, but also internal and external diplomacy. You choose which survivors to recruit, how to deal with other groups of survivors, how to deal with the various cliques in your shelter, and what to do about criminals and other crises. There are a lot of different ethical choices to make that don't boil down simply to "plus karma" or "minus karma" like many other games. Is it more wrong to turn away a survivor that you know is useless, knowing they will die, or to let them in and risk starving everyone in the end due to lack of food? What about attacking other camps for fuel to keep your shelter from falling apart? Does it matter if they are "bad guys"? What counts as a "bad guy" and are you sure you aren't one? :)\n\nAnyway, despite the bugs I thought it was worth every penny. There is a free demo available, which is the full version of the game with a limited number of days, and if you like the demo, you can carry your save over, so if you're curious there's no reason not to try it out.","April 11, 2015","true","159.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teros001/recommended/239840/","teros001","teros001","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teros001/","110 products in account","I recommend this game with a few reservations.\n\nFirst, it's not for everyone.  The game can be very repetitive.  Managing a group of survivors and locating resources to build and feed everyone sounds fun, but what it amounts to is little more than going from one area to another, clubbing everything to death, and putting all their food/fuel/ammo in your inventory.  Then doing it over and over again.\n\nSecond, the combat is not very good.  I found it poorly paced.  There is a very basic early game, middle game, and late game, but the jumps between them seem don't transition well.  It's all based on armor, really.  Having better armor suddenly makes you immune to so much damage.  Combat pretty much boils down to doing the same thing over and over again, with very few interesting mechanics.\n\nThird, the game is not paced well.  This goes hand-in-hand with repetitive.  There are very interesting storylines and elements, but there are large bouts of nothing followed by sudden bursts of activities, particularly close to the end where there bouts of nothing become longer and longer.  The game could use a BIT more activity/story.\n\nWith all that said, this game is interesting, fun, and contributes to the genre in a much needed way.  The devs are actually patching/making improvements, so I consider that a strong plus as well.  Some bugs remain, but they're definitely working on it, and I didn't run into any major issues (although a few annoying bugs were present).  I enjoyed leading my group through some tough situations and exploring post-apocalyptic Texas, meeting new people, and exploring a variety of environments.  There is some difficulty in building morale/food stores in the beginning, but this is actually fun and contributes to the difficulty of the game (something that is lacking at a certain point).\n\nOne final word.  The game has some political (ridiculous conservative/Texan stereotypes) elements to it.  If you're sensitive, you probably won't enjoy this game.  It was  bit heavy handed at times, to be honest.  Still, I enjoyed this game overall and would recommend IF you have a high tolerance for reading text, doing repetitive tasks, and some amount of "roleplaying".  You should also, of course, really enjoy the genre as well!","March 26, 2015","true","59.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Wanted to get it based on the demo and that it is squad based.  However, given the comments didnt want to pay too much.  Even in the Demo saw how annoying bugs could be.\n\nOverall, I have to say a resounding thumbs up for the game though.  It is exactly what I wanted and hence however many hours in I am through the game I felt it fair to let others know who like me have been on the fence.  I like squad based tactics and so I am really most interested in the scenarios for getting supplies.  I like the combat and even enjoy just turning up while I fight is already going on and watching two looter groups fighting it out with each other, attracting a load of dead guys and then being overrun by them.  I then clean up and take all the loot!  Excellent fun!  I also enjoy the tricky encounters, usually where better armed looters/militia control an area and arent interested in parlaying.  Surprisingly I have also enjoyed running the shelter and developing my character in order to do that.  Admittedly the shelter begins to run itself after a time and you get so much food and luxuries that you could hold out until armageddon but it is a nice touch.  Havent got the lab yet but everything else is done.\n\nSo why wait until on sale?  It is still bugged.  It is a little annoying to see your guys walk through a locked door!  Or right through a car.  Also frustrating to not be able to get to loot which has been placed in a position that is inaccessible (rare though).  Early on (possibly demo) it was real annoying to have killed a guy taken some excellent loot only to get back to the shelter and it had gone missing and no I didnt forget to pick it up.  I think the worst faults, so far at least have been in the hotel  in Austin.  Great idea, real enjoyable combat, difficult and demanding.  But moving between floors is a real pain.  Could it not have been made a bit easier?  You will find it almost impossible to move up or down unless your players are in the right position but you cant move your players to get into that position.  Having one person in the right place should be enough then an automatic move.\n\nIf you enjoy squad based tactics (old school xcom not the new) and you woul like to try something different then this game is worth getting, you just need to work out what price you are willing to pay for it.  I got it at £14.99 and that was fine for me, under a £10 get it no questions asked.","April 2, 2015","true","189.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Been waiting for improvements for over a year.  Seems like the developers have abandoned it.  Game could have had a lot of potential, but there are too many problems with it.  Combat is extremely slow and difficult.  Use of guns is pointless due to the noise drawing more enemies to battle when they're less effective than melee weapons.  No real variance to the plot: loot, build, sleep, repeat.  Could have been so much more.

There is no tutorial to explain how to go about doing certain things that aren't so intutive.  Dialogue choices appear to not really matter or effect relationships in your group.  Battle mechanics are sub-par and don't feel like a traditional RPG (IE: wasteland 2, XCom, Banner Saga.. etc)\n\nIn the end my hour spent in my first go through of the game was filled with frustration and ended with a slap in my face "Thank you for finishing the game" message when I had clearly lost.

It's so hard to write this review. I've been on a rollercoaster with this game. At first you can be discouraged to play it because of high entry level - your team seems so weak when tackling zombies at first...After some days and character progression you find out that..man! it's too easy...Having some of the best NPC'd and firearms it's just not challenging anymore...\n\nThis game needs some serious balancing. I haven't finished it yet (currently at day 55) but I'm struggling to keep going. When you aquire decent armor and good companions you find out that the biggest obstacle is to find enough motivation to find out what waits at the end. Maybe introducing some advance zombies (bossess) would do the trick, I don't know but at later stages you just don't get enough challenge. Missions are repetitive and enemies are not hard to beat at all. On the other hand it's still pretty rewarding to crack some undead skulls and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of those looters :)\n\nI guess everyone just need to find out on their own what's your perception of this game.

The storyline is fantastic, the visuals for such a development is phenomenal. I will still be granting the highest review however this game comes off to me as an "alpha" stage game. The fine line between alpha and beta versions seem to be thinning with early release games and for the most part this game is incomplete and missing fundamental necessities to make it an enjoyable playthrough on beta. I understand glitches and bugs should be present, but content should not be slowly incorporated into a beta test but given and tweaked per recommendations by the audience. Needless to say this game is AMAZING and I've dumped numerous hours into it.

What really should be an indie darling hasn't quite managed to come into it's own.  Let me clarify, the game is interesting, challenging and, depending on your definition, fun.  What I would consider it's core issue is that it was built with the same engine powering Age of Decadence.  Why is this important?  Well, Age of Decadence is quite a unique style of RPG and it's engine was tailored to it.  Since Dead State is a more traditional RPG, I just don't think this engine choice has done it any favors.\n\nBefore I get into why, I must give my recommendation: If you are looking for a more classical take on zombie survival that takes its cues from a pen and paper role-playing experience, there's a good chance this one is going to be memorable to you.  And for that alone I give it a recommendation, it isn't a bad game.\n\nSo why the longer review?  Largely just because at it's core it's a budget product and that shows through in every single place you look.  Combat, for example, is fine if you imagine it like a board game (it plays like one) and use your imagination, but everything feels so static many things would be more compelling in a book: "The zombie lunges for your throat!  Luckily you push it aside!"  It is a very spartan affair with a simple animation and a barebones sound effects.  While you undoubtedly get into situations that feel genuinely tense, it's because the premise is done very well, not because it has compelling on-screen action.\n\nThat may not bother you at all, but larger issues arise in continuity and premise.  So many things are just presented matter-of-fact and completely accepted without any involvement from the player in spite of objections.  The best example is the premise itself.  You run the shelter, you very well may be a competent leader.  However, you are just some person they rescue from a plane crash.  The shelter is already established, everyone already knows each other, and you are a total stranger.  Yet they immediately hand you the keys and let you manage it.  You literally wake up with a head wound and the first thing you can ask people, "What can I get you to make life easier around here?"  Just one minute ago you were coming to terms with being in a plane crash, and strangers explaining to you how everyone has become flesh hungry monsters who are going to kill you if you don't reinforce the fence outside.  You cannot object, you cannot decline.  This is somewhat moot once the game opens up A LOT in the following days, but since this is your introduction to the world, I just can't ignore how anti-compelling that is.\n\nUgh.  I could really dive into these criticisms but it all comes down to engine and budget.  The game was built on a shoestring, so probably all of this is to be expected, and if you know the history of the engine, it just does not seem like the best fit for what Double Bear wanted to do here.  So while it is a refreshing entry in both the RPG and zombie genres, being framed from the perspective of people surviving, its presentation makes it feel fifteen years too late to the party.","May 31, 2015","true","2.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

You have to recruit as many people as you can while you feed them and equip them for the hard times ahead. You also build up your base AKA the school and there are tons of upgrades for your school from a chicken coop, garage, farm and so much more. The part that most people complain about is they cant keep people happy or other stupid morale problems they may have(they lack people skillz). Just like in real life not every one you have in your town will see eye to eye about certain topics because the game is gonna throw a lot of random events at you that you need to deal with to make some people happy or even angry with you. There is perma-death if you are sloppy and get one of your guys surrounded and 3 or 4 zombies drop down on him for a quick snack you can beat he is getting back up but not as a human. Other complains I have read is that people think this is an alpha but your wrong the developers love this game and you can tell because they are always updating and fixing bugs for you. Come on they just released a nice update not to long ago and some companies would have made it a DLC but not these guys. There is also crafting, anything from armor, weapons, and even upgrades for your car once you get there. On top of that your played character is fully customizable from the way he looks to what kind of skills he/she has. You want to be a medic sure, you want to be a bad a$$ with a sledge hammer max melee skill, computers, gun skill, and a ton more.

It is quite the opposite.\n\nThe game isn't very forgiving of mistakes and the right answer isn't simply handed to you.

There is no “hone my skills to perfection by grinding first” easy button.  This game is meant to intrigue your mind and push your planning abilities.

I started playing at the initial release, but I did not get into the game because, quite frankly, I was overwhelmed by its complexity. I tried again a couple months later, but still did not get into it. I saw that the Reanimated edition was released and finally dug into the game, giving it the time it deserved. I can now say that I love this game and am 100% addicted to it!\n\nThis game is complex, difficult, and so SO rewarding. It's been said before, but this game is basically Fallout 1&2 plus X-Com plus Walking Dead. And this combo works so amazing! Sure it is not perfect, and could use a little more polish, but the game is so much more than the sum of all parts and is one of the best gaming experiences I had in years.\n\nThe negative reviews on Steam seem to all complain about the morale system and/or the bugs. I can't really speak to how the game was before the Reanimated edition, but I will say there was only 1 bug that I ran into. It was a dialogue bug that happened during a random encounter, where the guy I knocked out was talking the same text as he said when the fight started. I hit him one more time with my bat to kill him and that solved that problem... I didn't see any other bugs, which is impressive considering the scope of this game.\n\nAs far as morale... this is the end of the world! It is supposed to be difficult to keep a group together. I struggled through at first and had to make some rough choices about whether to kick people out of my group or not (which I did). But as you progress, it is possible for you to make things work. Overcoming these obstacles is so much more rewarding.  The people that complain about morale are essentially saying the game is too hard, the end of the world isn't meant to be easy and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nIn closing, don't let the negative reviews keep you from trying this game. At the least, download the demo and dedicate enough time to it so that you understand what this game is all about. Once you do, you will find a gem of a game that you'll love and find nearly impossible to put down.","May 24, 2015","true","57.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

I imagine that a lot of the negative or neutral reviews came in while this game was still in developement- the occaisional crashes, corrupt savegames, noise radius, and other issues have largely been hammered out (my last playthrough of over 120 hours contained none of these issues to memory).\n\nThis is a great game. Comparatively on the level of the first 2 fallout games - there's a deep crafting tree, a large amount of replayability from the skill tree/dialogues/npc interactions. You play as the lone survivor of an ill fated plane in Texas in the opening weeks of a zombie apocalypse engulfing the world. Boarded up in a school with a handful of other survivors from various walks of life it quickly engulfs the player in the tasks of figuring out basic needs in the new world (security, food, fuel, medicine) while also providing the unique challenge of managing your survivors' happiness and other needs.\n\nThere will be conflicts that arise both internal and external amongst your group and every NPC that you come across will stretch your party's abilities as well as its needs. As a result, especially on the harder modes- which is the best experience, in my opinion, you will be forced to make decisions regarding what new members bring to the group versus the resources they consume and potential conflicts they bring. The dialogue, of which there is a good amount of, is well written and each of the many NPCs have well written backstories, motivations, and unique needs.\n\nTied in with the NPC interactions are a series of events that occur- some random, others timed, that move the story forward as well as challenge your settlement. Ultimately, this is a game that moves past the traditional RPG/survival genres to ask the player how they would treat others in such a scenario. This topic is also examined in various lights by your NPCs with their backstories and actions.\n\nAside from being a well made, polished, and excellently written game there's one thing that I've cited as a reason to purchase this game- choice and causation. Rarely in games are there cascading events where one choice by the player leads to both scripted and unscripted outcomes that were unforseen. To be more clear, each playthrough of mine has brought about events and outcomes where "savescum" tactics would not work because your choices and outcomes were determined hours or days ago. This game provides a multitude of such occurances. It's hard to explain how glorious this is without having played the game suffice it to say that those that appreciate the "what ifs" will play through the game at least a second time.\n\nTL;DR: Played through game 3 times since early developement. Worth the price at $60. Buy it if you have any appreciation for survival/rpg/writing. Watch for this studio's future releases- this is an excellent and so far, it seems, underappreciated game.","June 18, 2015","true","165.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

There is still room for improvement and the Devs see it and will update the game as time goes on. The combat in the game is turn based, if you are careful you can avoid combat completely. The NPC interaction is what I really like, I hope they add more personal quests and crisis moments.\n\nI'd also like to see more base upgrades and research, and interaction/events once you get the upgrades. With so many people at the base late game there should more options to allocate the survivors and missions/crisis tied to those.In the future this game could be a 10/10, right now it is a 7.5/10 for me.\n\n\n***SOME POSSIBLE SPOILERS** The best moment for me so far was when I was on a scavenger mission with fresh survivors, I walked into a downtown area, it looked looted so I decided to proceed with caution. While my team was looting I decided to send one of the survivors to scout the area... and then I saw it... the park...  shards of metal everywhere and what looked like an elderly woman and a man impaled to the benches, I quickly gathered my team, but it was too late a heavily armed raider group got the drop on us. They knocked down the scout nearly killing her, I rushed the rest of my crew over to save her life. Fire, metal and blood, flew through the evening sky, my combat medic rushed over and secured the downed survivor.\n\nThings looked like they were changing... then the boss came out. Our pistols and bats did little to slow him down, and we were surrounded.\n\nI suddenly remembered my melee specialist was holding on to an assault rifle and my ranger happened to have the ammo, we were able to take out the raiders one by one, my melee specialist picked up a shield off a dead raider and rushed over to deflect incoming fire while the scout and medic found cover, my ranger managed to pick off the last raider, and we managed to walk away with no casualties, hardened by the experience and the new equipment.","December 7, 2014","true","108.7"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

I then promptly forgot about it.  So I only started playing around the time Patch 4 came out.  So I started from then.\n\nWarning - This is a game that will be somewhat ruined by reading Wiki's first.  Allies have stories, and sometimes they can be unpleasant.  If you cheat and read about it in advance, you will lose a lot of the enjoyment in the game.\n\nGameplay - Interaction.  There is a lot of interaction between you and the "Allies" it adds a lot of flavour, and lets you like and dislike the allies.  The Events are pretty regular, and generally pretty interesting. It can be a little repetitive, and hard to know when something new is available to talk about.\nNon-Allies.  I don't know if I am doing something wrong, but every survivor group I meet seems to attack me.  Sometimes I miss the warning messages in the bottom left of the screen, which means I keep goign when someone has warned me off.\nIt would be nice if there were more groups willing to trade with your group, but not join.\n\nGameplay - Combat.   Combat is quite a simple turn based affair.  There is some complexity with it, in that you do have a reasonable selections of weapons, there are several tactics that can be used in different circumstances etc.   Important to not however the Zombies are not the true danger in this game.  It is the living survivors who will try and kill you.  Zombies quickly become easy kills once you work out how to avoid notice and whittle them down.  They can still be dangerous in numbers of course, and if your allies get bitten they can be infected, but overall they are not a great concern.  Some of the complexity comes into drawing enemies into each othrer. Throwing a fire cracker to attract any Z nearby right into the middle of a group of violent looters. Fun.\nAnd the gun toting loonies aren't easy either.  Well at least not the first time you meet them.  Once you have some better gear it becomes less of a challenge.\n\nBugs. - I haven't come across any game breakers.\nI did get the pleasnt oaks hostile email howerver.\n\nOverall I am loving this game.

It blends a few concepts well, and while I found the game overall very fun, I do have a few issues that I think keep it from being great.  I may not play it again, but I would definitely be interested in a sequel or the same concepts taken in another direction.  If you combined most of the concepts of Dead State and State of Decay into a 4x, I think it would be a very interesting game.\n\n7/10\n\n++Map design, can't say enough about this, it truely feels like you're living in a zombie apocalypse.  From the wrecked cars, ransacked stores and homes, trails of blood, graffiti on the walls warning of zombie inhabitants, to the somber reality that many will simply take their own lives in their houses with their loved ones.  Double bear did a great job setting the environment\n++Moral choices, did a great job here.  You have several dialog choices, when I made my decision it seemed to be something I would say in that situation.  NPC's that join your shelter will remember dialog choices you've made with them and bring them up in future conversations\n+Crisis and random keep it interesting, hostile human NPC's can be turned against zombies\n\n\n--Game is to easy, once you get past the first few days, other humans are the only real competition.  They are easily avoided, or distracted, and you can come back later and whipe them out with better equipment\n--Item durability, nothing breaks, leaving you with stacks of items and weapons.  You can recycle them in later stages for parts, but I prefer a more realistic game and would like things to break and have value\n--Useless items, there's a large variety of weapons and items, but I spent 80% of the game using aluminum bats.  Zombie s would die in two hits and most humans were no problem, even if they had guns.\n-Micromanagement is pretty bad starting off, but gets a little better.  It gets annoying having to run to the storeroom to swap items, the job board to assign tasks, and the exit zone of the shelter to reach the map\n-Map is stagnant, no roaming hordes of humans or zombies, once you clear an area you have no reason to return\n-\n","January 4, 2015","true","34.4"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

The amount of bugs are ridiculous. First off, this company should never have taken it out of "Early Access." Even at this point, major bugs still exist, some even game-breaking.\n\nThe combat is relatively fun; although, extremely simple. You might get bored at the lack of options or variability in combat. It gets old quick once you hit the 100th zombie with a sledgehammer. Late in game, the armor you acquire pretty much puts the game in "God Mode." You can take 10 bullet wounds from a sniper rifle and only get a modest amount of endurance/health points removed.\n\n"The Shelter" was a well thought out concept, but executed poorly. You get very little, if at all, dialogue changes from allies. Allies in "The Shelter" are pretty much just nice looking statues. The situations that arise in "The Shelter" are so few and far between. At some point in the game, it becomes a literal waiting game whereby you just pass up days because every location has been scavenged, all the upgrades built, and no new shelter crises arise.\n\nThis game honestly feels half-finished, so much so that there is a major quest line that an ally gives you that is impossible to complete.","January 13, 2015","false","283.5"," 40 of 73 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","40","73","6","0"

It uses an isometric view, turn based combat and base building/management NPC interaction system.\n\nThe plot has so far been excellent, with well written background stories for NPCs. The dialogue, and the interaction really makes you feel like you're dealing with the daily problems of life in the apocalypse. You must scavenge for supplies, repair your base, and upgrade it, But you have to deal with the people you care for as well. Keeping up moral, finding personal items they need, while assigning them tasks and job schedules around the base.\n\nThe interface at first seems abit clunky, but took me very little time to get used to it. The sound & graphics, while not cutting-edge, are done very nicely. One thing I'd really like to point out, is the areas you visit while looking for supplies or running errands. Every map area, tells a story if you look. Very impressively done, for example I was looting a local neighborhood and every house every block, you could see the damage or the carnage and piece together what happened there. A car slammed into a power-pole, the trail of blood as the driver tried to escape to a house... The door smashed, his body half devoured in the doorway ! Just little stuff like that seriously adds to the ambience, and feel of the game's setting.\n\nI also would like to point out the leveling and skill system, is well done. You really do get the feeling that each level is really going to help you survive. You don't have to reach level X before you can survive on your own ; each of level you gain does give you the sense of accomplishment. And so far most skills, that I've gained/used have a purpose, have a use that just might keep you out of the hands of the Dead for just another day...\n\nThe bad... The game does have some bugs. I haven't really experienced anything to severe, or to frequent to prevent me from playing on. So far I crashed once, loading a save-game. Just once, and reloading the game and reloading the save went fine on the next attempt. I know there are some odd dialogue mix ups that others have had an issue with ; But so far I have not.\n\n\nOver all, a well done game that is enjoyable.","January 8, 2015","true","55.8"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Now for a quick review.\n\nLikes:\n* Good concept (although I'm yet to see a zombie themed turn based strat game at equal of the mentioned titles above)\n* Gameplay - it's just okay not the best or even great lets just put it - very simple.\n* Content - the dialogues/script could've been improved.

I actually turn my sounds off and in windowed mode since the graphics is not the best.\n* Bugs - it does load, save and having logged in 14 hrs its not actually that long that players will ... well look for another.\n\nOut of 5 stars this would have been a 2.5 or even a 2, I would wait out till they fix the bugs or release a patch.","December 26, 2014","false","22.5"," 47 of 87 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","47","87","0","0"

It is a long game and at times it can get repetative and monotonous, however the story is fun and the characters are very intersting. This game isn't just about killing zombies, its about survival and coexistance. Its almost a social experiement. The social aspect of the game is very important.

The game is not easy, but its worth playing once.","June 12, 2015","true","87.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I've seen fans who jump onboard and immediately shout down anybody who has negative criticism of the game.  I pay for (and expect) quality, and really struggle with the new era of gaming which puts the public in the chair of tester.\n\nHaving said that, I really enjoy Dead State.  A *lot*.\n\nIt was formally released early December (about a week ago), and there are still a pretty wide range of improvements that could be made to the game.  The thing is, even without them, the game is fun.  It's quite immersive .. insofar as it pulls you into the story and the concerns of your survivors.\n\nA lot of games try to achieve immersion these days - but they have some kind of false idea of what immersion means .. making a game grindy and laborious may be exactly how it feels to chop down a tree in real life - but you soon get bored and realise it's just a game.\n\nWhat Dead State throws at you is relationships and a foundation of morale and needs that drives them, and then lets you try and survive in an open sandbox in Texas.\n\nScavenge, deal with zombies, deal with friendly and hostile survivors, try to satisfy the needs of your community - those are the basic imperatives of the game.\n\nPeople interact with you, there are branching conversations - a very significant amount of dialogue.\n\nOn the downside is that some elements feel a little unpolished.\n\nI find the combat to be fun and tense, and the environments you nervously scavenge through to be beautifully drawn .. but the combat mechanics themselves feel a tad simple and unpolished.  People have complained about lack of stealth, cover .. and yeah, I agree - there are some of the tactical systems in the game that could use a second look.\n\nWhat would that achieve ?\n\nIt would take a GREAT game and make it a WONDERFUL game.\n\nGame is still very good in it's present state, I recommend it.","December 10, 2014","true","336.0"," 64 of 120 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","64","120","0","8"

You survive a plane crash and are taken to a shelter which you must lead. The goal of this game is simple: survive. Every day will be a struggle - there are many threats in this apocalyptic world of Splendid, Texas. Not so splendid anymore.\n\nThe game is both a Fallout-like RPG as well as a turn based management game. You are in charge of managing a shelter which means gathering food, building upgrades such as fences to keep zombies out, finding survivors who may be able to help you get to safety, and dealing with crisis events such as a gang threatening to destroy your shelter. Each survivor has different areas in which they contribute to shelter management and it's up to you to manage the resources. In addition, there are conflicts and events that happen every day and it's up to you to deal with them.\n\nIf you know Fallout's combat system, then you will know Dead State's combat. All in all the combat is relatively easy - but there are a few encounters where you will literally be in war against a small army of guys equipped with military gear and assault weapons so don't take everything for granted.\n\nThe looting can get repetitive - it's pretty much kill everything, search containers, grab as much as you can and clear area. Combat is *usually* very easy, but there are modes this game has that will make it oh so much harder. And also, be very careful of what you say to fellow survivors. It takes just one bad statement to make them absolutely hate you. But this is a stressful time, after all. There's an achievement for rescuing all the survivors - some found randomly.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game, and I recommend it. 7.5/10.","June 24, 2015","true","163.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Playing in iron mode is cool in concept, but this game is far too long for me to risk losing all of my progress based on a few bad rolls. If consequences were less immediately dire or potentially game ending, I'd hop on it in a second. I was fine with losing some people through story events or even in combat late in the game once it was clear that I'd be able to finish it.

Let us say, a strangely designed game. When you start to play it, for the first few hours, it is very interesting and engaging, if you, like me, can disregard very outdated graphics, somewhat clumsy interface and occasional bugs.\n\nAt first, survival feels really hard. Every day, yout scavenging party goes out to find food and fuel, and usually can just about bring enough of both back to prevent Shelter from dying outright, but not enough to feel safe. It's a real struggle and it feels interesting. Even more interesting are dialogues with your fellow survivours.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that time or other constraints prevented DoubleBear team from really completing this product. When you finally find horses that allow for faster travel (and, therefore, for two expeditions per day!), you beging to gather more food than strictly necessary for survival. At this point, the second part of the game should begin, but it doesn't. Most of the important events are tied only to day number, not your actions. And since survival is no longer a day-to-day concern, you start to feel bored from clearing same-looking supermarkets, houses and camps.\n\nThe problem is compounded by many bugs in many scripts. People do not notice completed quests (thankfully, this mostly goes only for minor tasks). People disregard events that already happened. People give you information about locations you have already visited. The worst moment, however, came when one game faction reportedly wiped another, but when I came to their old site, they were there, along with a duplicate of character that came to Shelter with the news of disaster!\n\nThe ending, when it comes, seems rarther aburpt. There are a number of endings, some of them more anti-climactic than others, but I must say I'm not very satisfied with them.\n\nA few words about combat. It's not particulary good, but it's not particulary bad, either. The dead stop being a serious threat quite soon, but armed people remain a problem nearly to the very end, especially in large numbers. AI is bad, but it doesn't matter too much. (And at least it's better than in JA: Flashback). I'd say the combat is on the par with Wasteland 2, which is not saying much, but it's not awful.\n\nDespite everything, I had fun with this game. I liked exploration and texts, even when they were bugged.  I wouldn not recommend it for everybody, though. You have to be tolerant of crashes (fortunately, quicksave is VERY quick!) and bad graphics. Still, I feel like a lot of love was put into it, and it shows, even if the end product is somewhat mishappen.\n\nI'd say you should wait for patches, but so far there was only one, and with the number of crashes, I'd expect the developers would try to hurry with fixing at least a few of them, so I do not have high hopes. Still, even with all the bugs, I managed to finish the game, so at least it's better in that respect than pre-patch Arcanum was :)","January 17, 2015","true","49.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

With Brian Mitsoda of Vampire The Masquerade, this story driven game will let you decide if you are either a LaMOE or a Crusoe in this zombie shelter game.\n\nThe story takes place shortly after you wake up in the middle of a world that has gone to hell in Texas. After the cops found you and stitched you up along with two other survivors. You are tasked with at first making sure the shelter doesn't fall apart and take responsibility for the people that you choose to bring into the Shelter and make sure they have enough fuel, food and parts to get through each day in one piece.\n\nAs a zombie shelter game, there is notably less "railroad" situations where you will ineveitably lose allies. Theoretically you can end the game with every survivor alive and well when you finish the game unlike in State of Decay which ineveitably have you lose people to the zombies wherever you like it or not. That said, it's freeform so you can choose to be the few beacons of hope in a bleak genre or choose to bring out the worst in humanity as you kill those that are useless. Leave survivors to die or do internal purges after a mutiny by sending any member who was loyal to the mutineer to a suicidal march.\n\nCombat wise the game plays like Fallout and Wasteland, an AP system that allows you to move and engage your enemy with a diverse perk system that gives you your own perks as well as other members of the shelter who have their own contributing abilities to the shelter.\n\nThe cast of survivor is a colorful mix from old war veterans, to an geek who uses the Fremen Battlecry or the avatar of Brian Mitsoda himself. Picking which survivor to come with you is important as some are illsuited for battle while others have limits to how far their moral compass will bend. A hint to know if your survivor has no qualms beign raiders is their attitude in combats. The more rough ones swear like a Borderlands player character and makes a nice addition to your motley crew of survivors.\n\nReplayability sadly is lacking, while i had reservations about playing it again the lack of fulfillment in some endings have made me think otherwise for a great zombie shelter game.\n\nOverrall I recommend this game for those who want their zombie survival fix.","November 17, 2015","true","112.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It is hard as balls (unless you want to save scum) it's not terribly intuitive to start,  and the graphics evoke a very specific "little bit dated" style.\n\nNow with all that said, if you are the sort of person that has fond memories of about fallout 1 and 2. The Baldur's gate series and a host of others in that game you are going to like it. You've been weened on hardship and know how to savor when things finally come together after the sting of perhaps some very bitter defeats.\n\nThe Good: The game is a faithful re-imagining of old school iso RPG's. Yes it trades on a lot of nostalgia but there is also a lot of solid game play and interaction here. There is a wealth of stuff to explore  and characters to balance out and it feels like you have quite a bit of freedom to grow. You can pour hours into this game and have extremely knife edge victories against serious odds. The crisis events and other things pressed on you are interesting and add a definite personality management aspect.\n\nThe bad: The games interface is clunky, inventory management is a PITA (pro-tip you can manage ally inventory fromt he main shelter inventory, not just your own). Likewise it really really needed a means to check an ally's overall stats from the main shelter screen. I suspect this was an intentional design decision but it hurts the game more then it helps my immersion. Poor combat scaling: Don't get me wrong I like that if you bring a knife to a gun fight you'll get your butt kicked but on the other hand melee feels really under whelming even when you've crossed the distance through the hail of gun fire. Conversely guns start out awesome and just stay that way sans noise and ammo concerns. Lastly the game really really needs (and at least thus far I havn't found) some sort of trading mechanic to get goods you need for stuff you have a surplus of. I've got arrows, bolts, and certain types of ammo coming out of my ears but so far have found a grand total of one stick of deoderant and one box of sleeping pills.\n\nThe final verdict: If you have the patience for a bit harder experience then seems to get mass produced in some of the hand holding games today you will get a fantastic return on investment from this game, well worth the 30 bucks or less if it's on sale. If you don't then you will probably end up not liking it.\n\n","January 21, 2015","true","64.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

It doesn't have Fallout's dark humour or intricate combat system but what it does have is a fairly complex shelter management simulator. Basically the game is about managing your squad, your resources, your shelter upgrades, and all the survivors who are working in the shelter when you go on scavenging runs (including the shelters overall morale and each survivor's individual mood).\n\nA fairer comparisson would be State of Decay or Jagged Alliance 2 (the original). The game isn't about your character surviving in a post apocolyptic world but about a group trying to scrape by in one. The turn based tactical battles are not an end in themselves, they're mearly a way to get more food, fuel, parts and medicine so your shelter can survive longer. Your character levels up but you have no personal goals: it's all about keeping the others happy, alive and away from each other's throats.\n\nIf you liked State of Decay (but thought it'd be better as a turn based strategy) or loved Jagged Alliance 2 (but wished it had zombies) then this could very well be the game for you.","February 24, 2014","true","188.3"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

(Think Fallout Tactics but open-ended with a strategic/resource management layer). As the elected leader of a small group of survivors, you must go on runs for supplies, locate and rescue other survivors, allocate resources and gradually build up your shelter from a bare-bones school into a fortified complex. You must constantly deal with not only the hordes of walking dead, but perhaps more importantly, the living, who in many cases are even more dangerous.\n\nEveryone you find has their own story, their own motivations, priorities, and attitude towards life and what is happening out in the world. As your shelter and group grows in size and reputation, people will eventually begin coming to you, leaving you with a choice as to how to deal with them. Letting in everyone may seem like a good idea, but eventually you will have to deal with the personality conflicts that arise between certain members of your group. Threats to your survival will arise both from the outside and from inside the shelter itself, forcing you to make tough, black-or-white decisions about how to deal with them. Food shortages, supply shortages, morale problems, and epidemics of disease are daily specters. Do a bad job in dealing with these issues, and other strong-willed members of the group may decide to challenge your leadership, putting you at risk of being thrown out of your own shelter.\n\nCombat is squad-based, turn-based, and tactical. Traveling to any of the game's many scattered locations to scavenge for supplies invariably results in hostile encounters with the both walking dead and rival groups of hostile scavengers or survivors. Each member of your group has a specific set of skills that may make them suitable as a melee fighter, ranged combatant, or combat medic, and it is up to you to equip and assemble your squad with those things in mind, using whatever weapons, armor, equipment and medical supplies you have managed to scrounge or manufacture. The pros and cons of various weapons and armor, the layout of external obstacles and the internals of buildings, and proper noise management all play into getting your scavenging team in and out of dangerous situations alive and, hopefully, with backpacks full of badly-needed loot.\n\nThe game does have some interface and gameplay issues, and there have been alot of reports from users about crashes as well as glitches and bugs ranging from annoying to game-breaking throughout the game's release history. Personally, at 60 hours/50 game days in, I have not encountered anything more than a few minor glitches that, while annoying, have not seriously impacted my gameplay, in addition to a few isolated crashes. Luckily, the devs wisely included an automated bug-reporting tool with the full game that will allow you to notify them whenever there is a crash. I would advise anyone who buys the game to backup your save files just in case something catastrophic happens. I will admit that the game could use a few more updates, in my opinion, but more in terms of things to be added or modified rather than fixed outright. Overall I feel that the basic mechanics of the game are solid, providing a compelling and realistic simulation of trying to lead a group of survivors through the zombie apocalypse. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys open-ended RPGs or turn-based strategy games.","February 15, 2015","true","68.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Also reminded me of State of Decay, but with turn based combat instead of 3rd person realtime, in that it focuses heavily on upgrading a shelter, scavenging and dealing with NPC allies along with external threats. Dead State is centered around the "Shelter", a school that the player's allies have fortified, The problems the player has to solve are both internal and external, NPCs have problems with each other, shelter upgrades break down or NPCs want to know what happened to their loved ones or people they knew. Then there's external threats in the form of hostile factions that the player can negotiate with, antagonize or even wipe out.  So far I've encountered 35 recruitable NPCs who have their own story to tell if I ask them, or sometimes don't ask them. Every morning in the game there's invariably one or two people at my room's door wanting me to either deal with a problem or to provide me with a new location on the world map to explore.\n\nOne of the central game mechancis though is Crisis Events, which deal with large problems that the entire shelter's population wants solved in one way or the other. Diplomacy by the player can help persuade NPCs that the player's decision is the correct one. Or the player can choose an option that pleases the most people to increase the mood (personal) and morale(entire population) of the Shelter.\n\nI also like how easy it is to mod the dialogs in this game. So I can fix problems or change things that I don't like which is always a plus.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone who's a fan of old school RPGs.","October 9, 2014","true","575.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a turn-based zombie survival game where you manage a shelter and have to deal with many harsh situations that may happen based on the survivors you have as not every survivor is as steady minded as you could imagine. Some look for love in the wrong place, others are mentally disturbed (due to what has happened and the situation you are in now) and you can even recruit animals to the shelter which give their own moral bonus, but also eat into your food supplies too.\n\nAll the characters in the shelter have their own personalities. Some can even point out new locations where there would be a large storage of weapons or food based on their life before the disaster struck. Some can be very likable like the Loving and helpful Renee or others will be blunt and emotionless like the officer, Vic. There are multiple endings and hours of replayability with the many different dialog trees. I have not yet completed the game, but I have gotten far into it and built everything in the shelter, of course trying to gain enough food and fuel on each excersion to keep moral up becomes difficult with more people.\n\nNow I'm not going to say the game is perfect. There are still bugs in the game and issues where bodies will share the same square, however the dev team are still working on this game and want to make it the best experience for all of those like me who are craving for a zombie survival game where you are responsible for the survivors and all the survivors have varied and interesting personalities.\n\nIf you are still uncertain, I'd suggest playing the demo to get a good feel for it. It has that wonderfully nostalgic feel of Fallout 1 + 2 as well as Wasteland.","March 18, 2015","true","154.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Combat is already getting REALLY repetitive whether it be bandits or zombies.  Equipment and inventory is a hassle and I can't believe it's as interface unfriendly as it is.  The shelter just has people standing around even if you assign them jobs and nothing really feels alive.  All of these complaints may seem mundane but when they add up it feels like a game that slowly lulls me to sleep or frustrates me.  If it was $10 i'd say sure but for $30... I feel let down, especially with all the die hard reviews saying this was good but it feels too much like an old game with half the personality.\n\nI remember playing Baldurs Gate 1 and 2 and even Fallout 2 and was blown away at the time by the story telling.  Not only does Baldurs Gate 2 look better than this and that's a title that's MUCH older, but it's less buggy and the world felt more developed.  I put in many hours just to get my moneys worth but I believe DoubleBear rushed this and dupped people into buying an incomplete game which was vastly overpriced.  Sorry DoubleBear, I know some Devs on your team put their hearts out into this, but when it all adds up it just wasn't worth it.","February 25, 2015","false","74.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Combine this with the sparse mechanics, like the noise level, which is poorly explained/clumsily executed (compare with Invisible Inc's alarm meter, or Thief's noise gem, both of which clearly and intuitively provide information while being stylistically coherent inside the game world) and you get a scenario where you can neither effectively sneak around and loot nor effectively tactically engage foes.\n\nBase building and management suffer from an abundance of materials as opposed to a scarcity (not necessarily a problem, in and of itself), but it gives more of an impression of inventory management and 'finding x item to keep y character happy' as opposed to a struggle to survive, quickly lapsing into tedium,\n\nSadly, like so many other turn-based games of the same ilk, Jagged Alliance 2 came along over a decade ago and set the high watermark that so very, very many of these games have broken themselves against over the years. Kudos for the effort, but zombie games aren't exactly a scarce genre, and many of the others, from low-fi indie gems like Rogue Survivor or Neo Survivor, through mid-rangers like 7 Days to Die, all the way to high-gloss AAAs like Dying Light, pick aspects and do them better.\n\nI don't think this is a 'bad' game, and I applaud the devs for the effort, but I'm really not motivated to play something this tedious when there's already a definite feeling that rewards for the invested time will be minimal.","February 24","false","6.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Sheperd-Christ","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001476196/","224 products in account","UPDATED (and rating changed)\n\nNot recommend at full price, if it's on sale, get it if you are open to the overall ides.\n\nAlso please read the comments for updates!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThis is not a terrible game, actually it is a fun game to play and I like it.\nIt just does a terrible job at selling it's strengths!\n\nThe overall idea is nice, of course nothing new, but still I like it. "Tactical" Combat, Ressource Managment, Exploring, Survival, role-playing and npc-interactions in Zombie-infested apocalypse, if that is something which intrigues you, you may have a nice time with it.\n\nBut alot of the stuff put into it feels unfinished and/or falls flat when it comes to utilizing it's potential, especially the combat, which is sad, but it shines in other (very well hidden) aspects.\n\n\nCombat in general:\n\nThe combat, one of the main parts of the game, since it happens so often, is lacklusting. One of the most often used tactics is being seen as early as possible, since enemies almost always got the first attack, so you want them to see you early so they first have to get close to you, spending their action points for moving, instead of attacking. Of course this tactic fails when it comes to human enemies with guns.\n\nThe lack of a stealth system is imo a terrible design choice. You can't sneak up on anybody/anything, at least not without initiating combat a few tiles away, so that you may have at least one (normal) attack on a chosen enemy, which wouldn't be that bad, if wasn't for the high amount of APs you need for your actions. At this point I can only utilize this "tactic" with my main char, since all other survivors are almost literally useless (too few APs, low skill values).\n\nAlso the special attacks are just not optimized. For example, there is an attack called flurry which executes as 3 attacks with 30% reduced accuracy, but on my Main char it costs 6 APs, while the normal attack costs 2 (reduced costs for high dex), so instead of using my APs for 3 attacks with normal accuray, I can could spend them on this "special" attack with reduced AP. Just wow, I am amazed.\n\nAs wrote above, generally enemies move/attack first (if you don't want to waste APs to "counteract" this). That also happens when someone reanimates as a Zombie (which is a cool mechanic in general btw). Ko'ed NPCs can and will be attacked by nearby Zombies, thus getting infected. They die and come back as Zombies. But why do they have to have the initiative then? They come back and can immediatly move and attack someone. Again imo another bad design choice.\n\n\nThe Gunfighting:\n\nMostly you wouldn't want to use guns, since they make too much noise, thus attracting nearby enemies (which is btw one of the good things about this game), but nevertheless there are moments you don't care much about noise, but how it was executed is just not good. Reloading takes an insane amount of APs, it's 7 (out of 8) for one of my fellow survivors, who was a Sheriff before the apocalypse hit. Okay, I get it, reloading just takes more time than shooting at something, but how translates this former Sheriff almost not being able to hit a human-sized (zombie) target less than 5m away to realism?! Not everyone has to be a good shot, but seriously?! Imo it would have been better if gunfighting was given some more love. The only advantage of using guns, instead of melee, is that you don't have to close the full distance to your target, that way saving some APs, but that's it. Attracting nearby enemies and the scarcity of ammunition are good mechanics/design choices, everything else...not so.\n\nInventory Managment and Looting:\n\nIt's tedious. Beginning with not being able to check the skills of your people while browsing your storage, but sadly not ending there. It would have been nice if you could change chars on looting screen, when not engaged in combat.\n\nAnother irritating thing is that sometimes the standard action on ko'ed looters(NPC enemies) is "attack", instead of "loot/search". Via right-click you change the desired action, but why it is sometimes loot and some other times attack, I still haven't figured out (see comments for update)\n\nUI:\n\nIt lacks "Tool Tips", those informations you get about items, skills and so on in other games, also a nice addition would have been a clock display, speaking of, maybe it isn't necessary, have to figure out first, if time passes when exploring an area. In all else regards, it's nothing special, just essentials.\n\nThe used font also is a problem. On higher resolutions it's too small and the color makes it hard to\nread.\n\n\nNPC interactions:\n\nFleshed out well enough, even if it may not appear so at first glance (even some ingame days into it), but after some more time you'll find many possibilities to interact with NPCs in various, entertaining ways.\n\n\nStability:\n\nOn my system (which is quite stable I may add) the game isn't stable at all. 7.7 hours into the game and it crashed 3 times already, which is something I could excuse if it was a brand new title, because you can't rule out something like this on a diverse platform like the PC, but that shouldn't happen anymore after being for sale for month. (see comments)\n\n\nLast words: It really isn't all bad, despite what you might think after reading this, at least I enjoy playing it, though I believe it to be shy of it's potential and and the price tag is just a tad too high imo. If you are into this kind of games get it for a reduced price when it is on sale (20€ would be okay I guess), though in my opinion you won't be butthurt if you bought it at full price, just don't expect a new standards setting gamechanger.","June 21, 2015","true","73.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

This game is challenging. Not just challenging but almost unplayable at points due to the general difficulty right from the start. Now i played this on its base difficulty with no \"iron man\" or \"survivor\" options enabled and this game is still ridiculously hard.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong. I love a good challenging game, it makes me feel alive and puts me to the test. But this game takes it way too far as after a good 9 hours gameplay i still feel so weak against everything. I had 3 fully equiped survivors out on a mission but we got stuck in a room and only one could fight at a time meaning that the endless horde of zombies waiting very politely outside the door ended up getting the better of me ONE BY ONE.\n\nNot only is it hard when it is supposed to be but the features it lacks makes it even more fustrating. Want your guys to take cover behind an obstacle to avoid missle fire? Nope. Want to climb on top of a nearby building to escape a zombie horde? Nope. Want to simply trade an item within your shelter to a friendly survivor? Nope.\n\nThese are just many of the infuriating events that can occur to you and happened to me basically every event. However this game isn\'t all bad. If you feel inclined to challenge yourself to the point you regretably put a hole through your monitor than be my guest because this game has so much to it and can be so much more. I just think that for a \"survival strategy\" there has to be some element of strategy other than just luck and using the right weapon.\n\nUnfortunately the good outweighs the bad for this one so i simply can\'t recommend :(","June 1","false","26.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In some maps, after your guys take a turn, it can take almost a minute of just watching it cycle through zombies that aren't active and do nothing.\n- The turn order is useless for know when a specific enemy will move since their portrait is only loosely related to their in-world model\n- There's an option to show which containers on the map can be looted (most can't). This is off by default, and turns itself off each time you play\n- There are horrible glitches in how it renders area with multiple levels. When on a map like that you will often see people floating in air, or have the ground below you disappear\n- You can tilt the camera, but only very slightly which makes it hard to see certain areas that you want to move to\n- You can get "Status effects" like poisoned, bleeding, etc. These are shown by an icon, but there is no tooltip when you hover over them so you have to look them up in the manual.\n- The pathfinding is bad. It will show that you can't reach an area, but if you click a few squares at a time, you'll get there\n- If you want to move to a square that contains a corpse, you need to carefully target around the corpse.\n- Having the Science skill means your melee attacks inflict Poison. What?\n- When looting it shows you how much you are carrying, but not how much you can carry.\n- The game maintains a To Do list, but even when you complete them they will often not be crossed off\n- In combat, facing is important but you have no way to change your facing\n- Weapons have special attacks, but there's no way in-game to see what they are. You have to go read the manual.\n\nOverall, it's unpolished and unfinished. If you can get it on sale, it's still worth picking up and trying. I wouldn't pay full price or recommend spending the time to finish the game once it starts to drag.\n","November 10, 2015","true","74.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It took a little getting used to, but once you pick it up it is immense fun. I know previous releases have been buggy and there was some negative comment removal issues, but I was fortunate enough to pick up the Reanimated edition so I've only experienced one bug so far on 4 different playthroughs.\n\nThe gameplay is slow. It's not a zombie slasher/shooter although there certaintly is plenty of turn-based head crushing. This is a game for those who want to manage a group of survivors through the zombie apocolypse ala Rick Grimes style. The characters are well written, the conflicts are dramatic and well thought out. You get attached to some characters while others you may have to leave behind and others you'll wish you had.

The plot can be gripping if you allow it to be.  The characters have personality and they can get on your nerves, but if you want to keep them [you do want to, you need their skills and manpower] you'll have to placate them.  It's not impossible to make everyone happy, but it does require some effort.\n\nThe turn based combat is a lot of fun, even given how much of it there can be it never really came off as tedious to me.  There are even a few situations where you can manipulate the undead to help you in wearing down some enemies for you to swoop in for the kill.\n\nThe story and atmosphere are immersive and it's was easy enough for me to lose myself in the game, especially if you have a favorite character personaily or concept to role play with.\n\nI most certainly endorse and would recommend this game.","January 24","true","172.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There's a lot to sink your teeth into with this one. Basically you lead this bunch of survivors and every morning you get a quick briefing of things / place to explore before setting them to work and you and your scavenging party set out to find some resources to survive another day.\n\nThroughout your travels you'll come across other survivors, some good, some not so much. But its you against the zeds so every live body helps. There's lots to explore and different modes of travel, and the shelter will requires lots of upgrades to turn it into a haven amongst all the chaos around you. There are items you need to collect to improve survivor's morale throughout your travels, in turn they will give you advice and mark locations on your map for you to explore. The overland map presents lots of random encounters during your travels, some good, some bad.\n\nThe shelter is what it's all about. You are constantly struggling with the other survivors to turn this little elementary school into a bonafide ZA haven. And it has all the ability to do it, with 2 floors and multiple rooms you will have everything you and your survivors will need to survive the nights of Splendid if you plan accordingly.\n\nCombat starts off appearing simple but as you get more followers and more weapons you can then start to have very tactical battles, with different status effects and AOE biological weapons to help keep the battle in your favor, making impossible-looking battles into 3-round wipe ups if you're careful. Both ranged and melee are viable (I stick to melee, this is a ZA)\n\nThe maps run from classic overrun parks and hospitals, to dark scenes of lost hope, to some really...unique scenarios that I wouldnt have expected. Games like these are what makes all the risk of joining an EA worthwhile. Would highly recommend.","November 5, 2014","true","112.1"," 87 of 169 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","87","169","0","0"

So if you are big on visuals than look elsewhere.\n\nThe idea behind the game is very good. Set in a zombie end world scenario, you are a survivor trying to survive day to day by collecting resources and gathering npc party members in a stronghold. You character is fully customizable in terms of skills and stats. The NPCs are not, only a few choices in game on which way they will specialize, but those of use played Baulder's Gate and some RPGs this is a minor inconvinience.\n\nThe game play is not bad, u have to manage ur shelter/stronghold. Collecting, gathering, or fishing for supplies day after day to keep everyone fed and fuel for the generator so you have electricity. You need electricity for alot of functions in your shelter so it's best to keep the fuel stockpile full. Meds and other supplies also is needed for the shelter. The constant threat of hunger, low meds, and lack of fuel keeps you running out to grab more and explore more. This is very good part of the game and keeps the days rolling.\n\nThe Combat is very basic, i mean it in a bad way. no cover system or anything. extreme linear movement in a square grid system, firearms have very little range and there is preciously little ammo making using guns frustrating. Also gun fire or loud noise attracts random zombies, they spawn at edge of map and walk towards the sounds, it's a good idea but then it's really lame because only 1 zombie come, well per noise meter raised. Sometimes they dont come at all, i mean there should be some indication or more zombies. It's very frustrating you cant take cover behind a stone pillar or  a tree or the corner of the house and you see the enemy shoot right through obsticles. So combat in this game is pretty terrible. Im comparing to earlier games like wasteland 2 or xcom. This needs work.\n\nStory is very good and there are unexpected turns, you can't keep everyone happy is the underline theme.\n\nSo in this state I cannot recommend the game because I simply dread combat everytime i runinto it and it's every few minuts while scavenging. I get so bored.","June 29, 2015","false","111.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I was wrong. There is and isn't a story. The story is to survive, which is the most common theme, however, it does NOT focus on zombie killing. That's just a bonus. It's a story about how people need to survive off of each other when everyone's worlds  shatter collectively. Many needs can happen, people can experience bad memories, (especially when you have one of your teammates get eaten by a zombie then come back) and so much more. It's like Romero's movies. Sure there's zombies, but the worst enemy is the people who will do anything it takes to survive.\n\nPROs:\n*Customizable character creation\n*Skills with a different trait for a given amount of points put into one thing\n*Each weapon has its own stats (Some can break. Some weapons are improvised and shouldn't really be use)\n*Stats are simplistic and easy to understand.\n*The interactions of people and how they can survive in the world while trying to maintain their own sanity.\n*The lifeness of each character (Each character has their own personality.)\n*Animal companions. Have your animals help keep morale up or help defend your base!\n*Situations that upcome and can change how people can view you.\n\n\nCons:\n*Zombie AI. If there's a horde of them, they won't move one by one, they'll all move THEN get a turn to attack each of your characters. I understand these things operate on sound so using weapons isn't great. However, when a whole horde comes, it usually screws you over.\n*Some characters are kind of useless than others.\n*Story. LIke I said, it's more focused on survival and the desperation of people during the end of the world. However, if there is a main goal, I can't seem to figure it out.\n*Combat is a bit awkward.\n*If you're a graphic snob, aka, HAS to be 1080p and 60 fps, then this game isn't for you. The graphics are good, but not the best. Look for another game.\n*The motorcycle gang members have super powerful weapons, even at early game, and can bring you down to half or a quarter of your health in one hit and when you DO kill them, their weapons dont have ANY ammo or any on their bodies.\n\nOverall I would rate it 9/10. It could use a bit of work, but it is a great game. If you like the theme of the world turning upside down during the zombie apocolypse, and people doing everything they need to survive, then this game is for you. If not, try Left 4 Dead or some other game for your satisfying zombie head shots.","November 22, 2015","true","193.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Or put them near death" turns out I was wrong it does good damage but its useless to me because its so hard to hit a zombie, seriously? A slow moving dead corpse just survives a sledgehammer? It didnt destroy or decapitate a limb, it just made them loose a good chunk of health? Why! Oh why couldnt they have the sledgehammer make your enemies crippled? Pretty much same with any other big dangerous weapon, I bet a chainsaw it this game wouldnt do ♥♥♥♥ because they'd think that its a good idea to have the player have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hit rate even though a chainsaw would have shreaded the enemy to little tiny pieces by than.] One other problem I had was that when I try sneaking up to a zombie from behind to back stab them the zombie immediatly realizes that the game programmed the player to sneak up to them in combat mode, my response to this was in these words "Why cant I backstab the zombie? When the first zombie/enemy you incounter can be backstabbed and killed easily with a bat? And why isnt there a function to stab their head? The people in the game even said "Go for the head" when they are in combat they dont even shoot the head, they just shoot radomly like gangster at the enemy." The last thing that really got me is that there are autosaves, my thought is that I can go back to a certain point if I screw up, or I forgot something, once I forgot to save my game so I went out to an auto save that I thought would get me to the right to where I was, it brought me to yesterday on the game and it deleted the other auto saves with out me doing it my self, so I had to go do the same mission/ scavenge all over again, which ment I had to do more bland/boring combat, its boring because there is no way to head shot them, you can not aim in the game so you haved to hope your player will realize going for a head shot is a better choice.\n\n\n\nIn my opinion I thought the game got boring and repetative after awhile, it had a good story, and it was fun at first, but it soon got boring with the bland combat, I also thought that my character was blind because he literally cant even see 5 zombies down a straight road with out walking up to them and having a nice tea party.\n\nI dont recommend it, but if you like the bland combat I wont bother, its your decision on what game you like and what game you dont like.","April 3","false","13.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It has flaws typical of a low budget, indie production, despite that I couldnt stop playing. I don't like the game engine to be honest, the graphics/textures are not that good, but at the same time it has little nice details like seeing what you equip. The management part is very nice and so are most of the dialogues but it's the combat that'll take most of your time. It could be better with something like an overwatch system, a real initiative system, STEALTH... No it's mostly random misses and avoiding agro. With better combat this game had a formula to surpass XCom! But don't get me wrong, it's still awesome to go scavenge for goods and see looters run into zombies!\nThe tutorials are too short, and I was googling alot of details, had no problems but a more casual player can feel in the dark about some things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreyven/recommended/239840/","dreyven","ExVasterist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreyven/","42 products in account","So far, the game is LONG and HARD. Straight off the bat, you'll be hit with a minus ## in morale - don't worry, just keep going out and try your BEST not to get your guys KO'ed. If you see a red skull show up next to a character, HIGHLY SUGGEST that you reload (game autosaves everytime you enter and leave an area) - red skull means infected and will NEVER go away.\n\nLove the tactics that can be used in the game, tons of loot EVERYWHERE, there's quite a bit of realism, like the hacking mechanic in the game, and though annoying, panic and horror does make battles harder or easier (depends on which side gets hit by those "run for your life!!" character freak outs).\n\nPros:\n- Dead State uses a REAL map from Texas (the only area that seems made up is "Splendid") for the game map.\n- Lots of different types of enemies.\n- Sound alerting the undead/infected is a plus for realism.\n- Large number of built upgrades (as well as equipment modifications).\n- Unlike a lot of zombie games, there are TONS of recruit-able allies.\n- There's a vote system (once Vic gets back).\n- Can pick lock doors, disarm security alarms, or simply kick the door in.\n- And a powerful yet unstable psycho character can join you (sad when I lost him).\n\nCons: (a lot need correcting and fixing)\n- Typos and spelling errors EVERYWHERE!\n- Tutorial mentions that you can sneak up on enemies (FALSE).\n- Animals and Crawling infected are far more likely to KO player than those standing up! (WTF?)\n- Feeling of being forced to build places (allies want it, don't get it done by #day, they leave).\n- Boyfriend infuriated you didn't tell him about girlfriend (not spoiling) even though you are NEVER given the option TO TELL HIM (add the option, makes zero sense to not be able to tell him an him getting infuriated cause you didn't say anything!!).\n- Turn Order (top right of screen) - Understand when the enemies you're fighting are in the turn order display, but SERIOUSLY cycling through EVERY SINGLE ENEMY ON THE LEVEL? (Big Con!)\n- Characters in Panic/Horror can make losing pretty easy (both pro and con).\n- Areas do not respawn loot & enemies (realism is a pro) but expects player to remember if area is cleared completely or not (# of times visited and days since last visit is ok, but having to remember what is cleared an what isn't can get annoying and wasteful since Time isn't on our side).\n- Allies' Moods feel broke - It gets frustrating & annoying when despite your efforts, the "moods" don't ever seem to change (Morale is oddly separate from this).\n- Cannot pick skill & stat point use for Allies. Though it adds to challenge, it still blows that the skill & stat points for allies is out of the player's control, this just forces a player to not bother with the pathetic allies, keep the important ones at home, and pray the allies that go out with you don't focus on a skill you don't favor (more of a con than pro).\n- And Todd. He prays while we act. He thanks god instead of us. Seriously tempted to commit Wrath on him....\n\nDespite all the cons in the game, frankly Dead State is STILL a good game. There's a lot of stories in this game based on the characters you befriend, and those you just outright want to body slam through a wall. Feels like Final Fantasy Tactics meets The Walking Dead - both very good games, and Dead State feels like a mix of the two.\nYeah there's a lot of cons that I listed, and not many pros - but most of the cons are personally (my opinion) what needs to be fixed, changed, and corrected by the developer of Dead State. Once those are taken care of, the pros will undoubtedly outnumber the cons.\nThe game's graphics aren't spectacular, but the visuals matter little when the gameplay is experienced.\n\nTo the Game Developer of Dead State - Please take note of the listed Cons, most are errors, typos, bugs, and others are simply game mechanics that need adjustments.\nThis game could be awesome, COULD BE (has the potential), but right now its just a good game. I've barely explored the map, gotten many tough battles, and made quite a number of interesting allies.\n\nHonest Opinion of the game: 7.5/10.\nIf most of the listed cons are fixed, changed, or adjusted, it could easily become 9/10.","May 16, 2015","true","1.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

That main concern being the business decision to move a game from Early Access to full release during the Steam holiday season. The game on the release date had a long list of known bugs, several of them either game or story breaking. Yes there have been patches and some of the bugs have been fixed, but this does not cancel out they original concern. The choice that was made looks like Doublebear tried to trick gamers into buying a game thinking it was finished when in fact by DoubleBears own known issues list on the day of release it was not done. I and now I think others feel that a company should be held accountable for these type of actions.\nI have never asked for an extreme punishment, all I expected was for Doublebear to say what was going on to cause them to do this and to issue an apology to their loyal fans. Is open communication too much to ask for from the people who funded your game. Instead of dealing with my concerns directly Developers and mods have tried to silence myself and others.\nThis game would not be a reality without people like me with our little 30 dollars. The attitude that I have seen from DoubleBear has come off at entitled and ungrateful for the opportunity that has been given to them.\nNow onto less important stuff. My defense.\nFirst of I want to say I was deeply offended by Annie Mitsoda's personal attacks on me on tumblr. Being called a @ickbag & #ucker was far less offensive than the way she disregards my 30 dollars. Just so you know that 30 bucks is three hours of my work day. I might be nothing to you but I put my hard earned money towards your dream.\nhttp://imgur.com/p97JvCI\nhttp://murderblonde.tumblr.com/post/105832304380/exhaustion\nBrain and friends at DoubleBear continue to claim I engaged in "abusive comments towards both the devs and mods" and this is why threads were locked and deleted. This is not the case , I as well never harassed anyone. They can't provide screen shot of where I did any of the things they claim because they did not happen. What screen shots of locked and deleted threads they do show are just snippets without showing what anyone else is say. I was never off topic ,never spammed, never directly attacked anyone. The claim that I harassed DoubleBear requesting a public apology be given to the community is just absurd. I was the only one on any of these forums to get banned when there were people making direct personal attacks on me that were defending the developers that were not even given a warning by the DoubleBear mods.\n1)First thread was shut down for no good reason.\n2)Second one I thought maybe they shut it down because the attacks on me. I knew I did not break the rules so I made another post pasting most of the OP and then adding another paragraph to make it new. This was right away shut down.\n3)Third post was a little snarky post about how they shut down post that are on the top that are critical.\n4)Fourth post was actually made by another person. This is the one I got banned in and I did nothing except ask Brian to say sorry. Never broke a forum rule once. No warning just a ban. Yes you will notice #114 &115 are back to back but that is only because the I did not copy the second part over from my wordpad. You will notice that there are several posts in between #115 and my next post. Too bad the devs only provide what I say in a attempt to manipulate the way this looks.\nhttp://imgur.com/tjdBGs9\nhttp://imgur.com/Tj84fUi\n5)I by this point was not happy. I felt like an American being silenced and someone who my 30 bucks and support was being treated like trash. I contacted the mod(Caidoz) through a private ban email. Its funny how they just provide one snippet of the conversation and deleted the email from my account so I can't provide a picture. Yes I did say I can just create tons of alt account in this private chat. I wanted Caidoz to know his ability to silence had no power over me. I never once said I was going to abuse this and mass spam threads or upvote my own review. First of the time and money it would take to get 300 accounts is ridiculous.\nhttp://imgur.com/l0XxiVX\nI have had this alt account for 6+ years and I did not use it until now to defend myself after many attacks.\nSo with all the above being said I am a forgiving gamer. If DoubleBear publicly apologies for the early release and explains why they did it then I think everyone should forgive and get behind this company to help them finish what I think will be a great game when complete. On a personal note I think Brian and Annie Mitsoda's own me a private apology for the slander and attacks personally against me.\nFierhorn79\n**********************************Review**********************************\nWanted to start off by saying I was a huge supporter of this game pre Steam Early Access and during early access. I enjoyed beta testing the game for DoubleBear and helping them to use the EA process to better the game.\nI think the game is a blast even in its frustrating buggy state.\nNow onto the reason why I think people should not buy this game or support the company DoubleBear for any future games until the Give a public apology.\nI don't know about all of you but I found Kickstarter and Steam Early Access to be a wonderful breath of fresh air. I was sick of big AAA and medium sized AA Developers and Publishers pushing out 3/4 made buggy games that after I paid full price for had to wait months before it was patched up and enjoyable. This was the norm and I was sick of it.\nSo I started supporting only EA and Kickstarter games, more than I could afford at times. Dead State is one of those games and I was very happy to support Doublebear.\nSadly DoubleBear betrayed its fans and sought to deceive new buyers into believing that Dead State was a finished product in order to take full advantage of the Holiday shopping season. Brian and the Dead State team had pages of known bugs and some of them were game and story breaking.\nAsk yourself what reason would a Developer move a product that is known to be a buggy mess from Early Access to calling the game fully released. We the gamers are there Publisher and we were not on their backs pushing them to release the game in a unfinished state in order to reap the profit from the Holiday season.\nMy over all point is that when small gamer funded games pull the same fast one as big AAA developers something has to be done about it. This type of behavior and not be rewarded.\nThese type of actions corrupt the new system from within. If this is allowed to happen then we get get a bunch of small studios acting just like the AAA ones because they can.\nI and many others went onto Dead States forums to ask for an appology and get an answer why they felt the need to move a unfinished game from EA to fully released. We all found ourselves pounced on ,forum post locked and in several cases found ourselves banned. These type of actions are those of people wanting to hide what they did not ones wanting to correct the mistake that was made.\nI don't know DoubleBears reasons to fall to to such a low level. If they had funding problems there are so many other more honest options.

Still, the game refuses to play, and there are no functioning fixes on the internet yet(trust me, I tried). Instead the fact that the game crashes to desktop, made Steam **** a brick too. It claimed that I was in Dead State when I wasn't, and showed it as "In-Game: Dead State" several hours after I quit trying...\nI tried to exit steam but it demanded I 'shut down Dead State' first, which wasn't running, not even in my Task manager.

Well this game changed that for me. Specifically, it was reading reviews from people hailing how awesome the game was with over 500 hours logged into this game - an early access game with that many hours clocked in by one person really grabbed my attention.\n\nSo, going out on a limb i decided to get this game - figuring hey, I'll at least get access to the full version when it comes out, and probably cheaper than if i waited.\n\nA good choice, I think. Now I only just started playing the game, but holy crap is it addicting as all hell!\n\nSo, to start, the main gameplay of this game is a turn based RPG, much like Fallout 1 and 2 (hell even the UI is layed out the same for the most part), except you have a party of 4 that you take out on ventures with you. But the game is so much more than that.\nThe travelling around and fighting is actually a small part of this game. The core of the game is that you're basically the leader of a Zombie apocalypse team that found themselves barricaded in a School. The school is your base, and you can upgrade the base with tons of different things, like a better fence, a workshop, a garage for fixing and building cars, and so much more.\n\nSo how it works, is the game day starts at 8 am, and you got free roam of your school. You can go around talking to your team members, ask them about their attitude and certain things they'd like you to grab them from the field such as soap, or chocolate or what have you (getting these items for them will increase their morale, which plays a huge part in this game, but I'll get to that).\nYou have a white board in the cafeteria, where you can allocate your members to go do certain jobs during the day, each job takes varying hours (and will decrease if you get another member to help them with it), mechanical jobs will go much faster if you have someone with a high mechanical skill doing those jobs.\nEach member has their own set of skills (as well as the PC that he chooses at the beginning of the game, and can increase as you 'level up') and you decide what jobs they do depending on their skills.\n\nWhile the rest of your team is doing jobs (you can have the PC do some of these various jobs, but you cant do anything while that happens), you can pick a team of up to 4 members as your raiding party. With these guys you can leave your base and get to travel the map (which is literally a map of texas, with all the interstates and towns and cities and all that). Travelling the map takes time, and is slower or faster depending on your travel method. At the start, you can only travel by foot, but later on you can get horses and even cars to speed up the process.\nAs the time goes by during the day, your members back at base will be doing their tasks you assigned them, while you are finding random super markets, hospitals, neighbourhoods, and so on and looting any materials you can find, weapons, food, luxuries, parts and tools and so on.\nHowever, you MUST be back at your shelter by 3 am, otherwise you get a game over (im pretty sure, i never let myself be out that long yet), so obviously you cant travel too far from base without some sort of transportation.\n\nWhile going to various locations, you must avoid or kill zombies, who are not only hostile but if they get a bite on your allies while their health is low, they infect them. Your allies, if infected will go up to 3 days without treatment before they will kill themselves or turn into zombies and attack you. There are antibiotics you can find that as long as you have them in stock, your allies will take them staving off the infection (but not curing it), so you can keep infected allies indefinitely, you just need to have a supply of antibiotics.\nYou can also find other people, looters who are hostile and you must kill to survive, to even other survivors you can recruit to join your cause. However, watch out when firing guns off liberally in a battlefield, as it attracts zombies, and getting guys infected is the last thing you need.\n\nOn top of all this, the most important part of the game is your shelter Morale. You have a morale level that goes up and down depending on recent events and moods of allies. Every ally has their own morale level that can be increased by giving them special items, keeping a stock of luxury items on hand, and even having other allies do jobs such as cooking for the crew to bring morale up for everyone. Morale is affected by everything, ranging from having broken generators (or no gas to run them) to the amount of food on hand, to having a secure base or what have you.\nIf morale with people get too low, they may find that they are better off out in the wasteland and leave your crew, to even if morale is so bad for everyone you can have a mutiny and your crew will outcast you from your own base.\n\nThis game is so damn addicting, I wish i had more time to play it haha. I would recommend this game to any RPG fan out there, specifically if you like survival horror. A solid game, and worth the money for sure. I would even go as far to say that this one could be nominated as Game of the Year, especially if im only playing an unfinished product so far.","November 14, 2014","true","61.7"," 56 of 109 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","56","109","0","0"

I'll give 10/10 if you can f***k all the characters anytime you like, I mean come on in zombie apocalypse dire time we need this.\n- They did add and change the game feature based on the suggestion from the early access players.\n\nCons:\n- Until now the character face customization is still not available in full version. When asked they replied the developer will add in this feature when they got time.\n- Not worth current price, wait for less than 10 dollar or so. Better spend your money on Wasteland 2\n- Wait until they fix all the F**king bugs, it's still buggy and the developer started to slow down because the sales had slow down as well. *they claimed to fix when they are free (or when people are purchasing this game)\n- The developer company is greedy. The developer had raised 330K Dollar in kickstarter, which is more than enough to finish an indie game like this and startup a new company. Not to mentioned they got sales on Steam.\n\nIn conclusion:\nGame wise, really mixed up.\nRecommend this game but just buy Wasteland 2 1st and wait for 80% sales. Not worth the current price.\n\nThe later you buy this game the better","December 25, 2014","false","163.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Buy it!  The writing is terse but perfectly composed:  you get to know these characters and care when they die, or turn against you, or become disillusioned with your leadership (yes, all this can happen organically within the game system).  This game creates a tremendous sense of atmosphere and freedom:  every place, however insignificant, has a story if you look closely, and the game throws plot events at you at a slow but believable pace that lets you explore and deal with the crises that emerge naturally from the dynamics of the world and your own play style.  This is one of the very few times I have felt like I do when playing a tabletop RPG with a truly excellent GM.  This writer knows what he is doing.  Plus... this is a very satisfyingly long game, especially given the price:  look above to see how many hours I've given this game and I haven't finished it nor can I guess how it might end other than... well... badly.

Maybe have it focused around a country.\nThis is near the start so it makes sense for walking distance places to have supplies still.\nBut, it would make it more interesting if you traveled across a landscape to get supplies.\nSuch as multiple states.

I managed to spend 48 hours playing this game, and I enjoyed them. I found the combat enjoyable, scavenging was fun, and upgrading the shelter was satisfying. But this game is not everything that was promised to be. Interacting with survivors at the shelter was a lifeless experience. "Crisis" events were very rare and sometimes made little sense. Crises also had little lasting imapct; besides a one-time morale effect, they were never mentioned again. Certain story and character arcs were clearly cut short. You will almost never be able to find a creative solution to a problem- outside of multiple choice crisis and story events, your choices will have little consequence. In the late game, you will likely have a glut of resources and will be able to simply go on cruise control.\n\nThis game had a lot a promise and only partially lived up to it, but there is fun to be had here.

This is what Indie developers can do when they work hard on a project they believe in, and see it through to the end (....>..>  Looking at you Rust and others)\nAnyways if you like either Tactical games, or zombies, or sandbox games, or exploration games, or shooting dem bad guys, or just scavenging your enemies bodies for cool new stuff then you must buy this game.\n\nTo simplify, this game is an strategically more detailed XCOM but with Zombies instead of aliens. Thik of it as "XCOM Enemy Unnown - Zombies Ultimate Survival Edition" if you will.  I mean freaking zombies, who doesnt love zombies.  Global defense isnt your goal, but Survival of you and your fellow survivors that matters. So build your Base Defense the best you can, keep your people safe, especially while you are out looking for weapons, food, fuel, water, a can opener..... (lol) etc, you get the point. Oh and zombies, I Mean Freaking ZOMBIES!!! DUDE!!!!!\n\nCombat is tactical and turn based, youll want to weigh your options if you come across zombies or people. With zombies its a choice of "Do I wanna take em down quietly one at a time with my axes, knives and such in melee risking return/counter attacks or do I want to risk the noise and pull out my .12 Gauge Semi Auto Shotgun and get it done fast with no chance of them getting even near me.  Also using a party member as bait works well to, just dont use anyone you actually like because you can expect them to survive long enough that you learn their name but thats about it, hes gonna die in a mission/trip or two.\n\nNow with humans its a whole other ball game, are they friendly or hostile?  Are they pretending to be friendly to get easy access on you with a nasty suprise later. They got guns!   Oh Crap!  but we are sneaking through a town full of zombies and we are to smart to fire our weapons and call the Zeds down on us all, buuuuut are these other people just as smart or will they open fire as soon as they catch you in the corner of their eye?\n\nIn total, there is a lot of fun to be had with this game, a lot of choices both in story and out of it. Suport this dev team, they do great work, and all of te content updates have been free, no BS DLC to speak of, they make it and just drop it in there for us to enjoy.","June 20, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's got a base with lots of upgrades, tons of loot, decent selection of weapons, limited resources (ammo, grenades, fuel, etc), good character progression, zombie killing fun, base management, character interactions are fun, etc.  Basically it's got a LOT of stuff done RIGHT.\n\nCON's:   Not as many different weapons or upgrades as I'd like (thinking JA2 again); approx 3-6 per ammo type (7 ammo types; maybe 20-25 weapons total).  The side stories are limited in content and usually amount to: bring character A to place B from their past; get special dialog, end of quest.  Not bad, but could have been made into much more.  There are a few bugs; I had about 8 crashes total over my playthrough, but with ample auto-saves you never lose more than the last 10-20 minutes.  Last and biggest complaint is the simplistic AI.  Dont expect you're enemies to Mcguyver up an ultralight and surprise you with an L-shaped.  It's just not there, still: what do you expect from zombies?\n\nStill a postive experience; really recommend this one if you're a fan of the genre.","September 25, 2015","true","297.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I will find it more funny lf random zombies can come out of the map and roam around the map, but for now this can be not a problem, since a lot features are not been implemented yet soo we just need to wait to see the rest of the game for now.\n\n5) The crafting part of the game was interesting, but not too much for now. You have the same jobs of some games ( Farmer, Doctor, Nurse, Chemical, Mechanic and soo on ) but for now they can't craft for you a lot even because you can't build the areas you need to make them work. For what i have seen you can only craft some things like lethear armors, military armors and helmets, your own ammunitions for pistols / rifles ecc but there is not too much variety he seems like State of Decay where you can craft only little things like molotovs or fireworks to lure the zombies away.\n\n6) The place where your hide it's a school, a normal place we see in some zombie movies or in zombies games ( Like Zombie Fort lf somebody knows that title ) and it's very well maded, a lot of classrooms where can become new areas, basements, garden where you will build farms and other things, but for now everything it's looked. He seems a bit empty for now even because the npc's you have are just stuck in the same place with the same pose and withtout an animation, soo they are like statues and it's a bit sad.\n\n7) The animations for now are nothing cool, the zombie animations for when they try to bite you are ok, when they die they use the same pose ( Soo for example lf two zombies dies in the same space, you can loot only one ) and it's nothing different, the walk of the character is nothing special even for the looters and when the zombies uses normal attack they just slap your face sometimes.\n\nFor me the game is great, he has a lot of potential and can be fun! For now you can't do anything and there is no point to play it more then 1 max 2 times, i hope they will add a lot of random things, they will fix the enemies stuck in the same poses forever, they make the game a bit more "Live", random zombies / events and such. For now lf you want it look first on some gameplays on youtube because he can be for now a bit frustrating to buy, or you can simply wait the 3-5 months they said for the game to finish.\n\nThanks for reading and sorry for my bad english, but it's not my main language :3","February 13, 2014","false","147.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

I liked the gameplay a lot at first, until of course about 40-45 hours. Tryed my best to like it but I can't. I am a fan of turn-based strategy games.\n\nMy negative opinions\n\n1.) Waiting for the zeds to load\n2.) The graphics look cheep and agonizing and get annoying to look at\n3.) Lag spikes depending on how many zombies in a zone\n4.) The buttons, inventory, and other options are setup badly and should be easier to handle\n5.) Minor bugs.\n6.) Shelter design is poor and getting around the shelter is sloppy\n7.) Camera\n\nBrief Explanations ^\n--------------------\n(1) Annoying as ♥♥♥♥, waste of time, and the number one reason. Waiting for AI to wait a turn even if they don't need to move that round should really be fixed (2) They should have better avatars (3) Can get really laggy - on two story buildings and when dealling with large number of AI (4) Looks like something out of a free online game\n(5-7) minor issues\n\n\nOverall, this game gave me high hopes from the store page, but left me with a bad taste.

The game is driven by npc characters personal stories which are many of times linked to missions and side quests. The game's main focus is not on combating zombies but base upgrading and keepings your surviving npcs morale happy and keeping them safe in zombie apocalyptic world. Combating zombies is only an obstacle to these objectives and your base can come under attack by the living and the dead. Among your npcs are personalites that may clash with each other and even you the\nProtagonist in the story. Zombies can kill you if you dont plan an attack when you approach them in a turn base combat. Outside of combat is free roam. Think of this game like "This war of Mine" meets "wasteland 2". The developers seem to be continuing to fix bugs and add more contents to this final release game...","April 22, 2015","true","77.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Maximize vigor, strength, and put on a heavy armor.\n...But that still doesn't mean you should, since dead character will stay dead. Avoid any direct confrontation if possible, whether it's against looters or zombies.\n\n"-can't kite them"\nEvery type of enemy has a certain vision range. Just make your party hides in a certain spot and *very* carefully send one party member to kite one or two of the zombies.\n\n"-can't evade them"\nPut more points towards agility. But this is a survival strategy game in the first place, so what you really want to do is to kill off any threats as carefully and quietly as possible.\nAnd to add: positioning is *crucial* in any strategy game, so if you somehow messed up and got a party member surrounded by zombies, then you're the only one to blame for that.\n\n\n"-can't sneak past them"\nStealth is a totally viable option, and is the preferred way of doing things in this game. Zombies has a rather small(er) visibility cone, so you CAN evade them and quite easily too compared to sneaking past looters.\nThey do have better sense of hearing though, so if you're planning to do a sneak attack do it quickly. Initiate the attack a few squares away from behind the zombie.\n\n"-must rely on luck to beat them"\nEvery strategy game that has RNG relies on both skill and luck. I see no problem with this.\n\n"-if you don't outnumber them 2 or 3 to 1, it has a high probability of a loss."\nOutnumbering them does indeed kills them more effectively, but that doesn't mean you can't send a party member with high Vigor and Strength/Agility plus a high enough melee skill to face off against a zombie one-on-one.\n\n\nI'm not saying the game is perfect. It's buggy at times, writing is... okay, and the graphics and animations are not exactly what you'd call stellar...\nBut the game still offers exploration in a rather big world map, the strategy part is quite solid, you can recruit and manage survivors who also gives you choices and consequences that matters, and the best aspect i personally love the most: homebase management. I just wish they would offer more base other than the school though, and more interations between each survivors.\n\n\nOverall it's at least a 7/10 game, and is totally worth the price tag.","July 6, 2015","true","9.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I expected a completely open world which, frankly, has been a standard since Might and Magic and Baldur's Gate.  I restarted the game to carefully follow the tutorial.  Then I had to figure out myself how to find locations on the map when they're not already marked so I restarted again because I lost a day or two.  Later I learned that you will not find some locations until an ally tells you about them.\n\nDespite that, I found Dead State to be fun and engrossing.  The shelter, the upgrades, the morale system, and the crafting system are all excellent.  Combat is flexible and you can approach a fight in many different ways.  I spent about 30 hours on the first 16 days and enjoyed it a lot.\n\nAfter that, I started to find some of the religious, political, and personal issues of the allies to be a pain in the butt.   I just wanted to survive the zombie apocalypse not be a politician and social counselor.   If there are zombies around your fence, aren't people going to be a little more concerned about survival.  Some of these allies that  show up are just plain unrealistic.  It's like Dead State turned into some nightmare, reality show.\n\nFinding comfort items and medicine for allies was great.  Looking for family members - awesome.  Beyond that, if things are brought up I'd rather look at it through the lens of surviving the immdediate threat of zombies.  For most people, I think a safe place from zombies is more than enough to keep their morale up.  Just my opinion.\n\nSo I'm giving the game a qualified thumbs up.","July 7, 2015","true","46.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Or tried to help me, apart from Grant I suppose but im not sure if he counts.\n\nI would have liked it if the player character wasnt so invincible, maybe they should have had the ocasional sick day or depression, I mean in my game he had just lost his whole family, wife an dkids in the plane crash. And all he gets is "Oh sorry about that, listen would you mind being our leader and going out and finding materials to repair the fence and food and stuff thanks bye."\n\nAlso its strange that the Player has to lead every scavenger party, what if you were playing as a scientist or a mechanic? ANd your skills are needed back at the fort, building upgrades, repairing the wall, making bullets? No sorry you have to lead the scavenger team so you have to put points into Ranged, Melee and Survival. Anything else is just a waste. Why bother giving us the freedom to create our own character, then railroad us into having to make them a soldier/fighter?\n\nZombies got really repetitive to fight after a while, but the Human enemies were fantastic.\n\nOtherwise its a great game, I hope they make a sequel as it definately could use some improvements and be even better.","August 19, 2015","true","147.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Bad combat. the combat needs to be improved for example the cop in the game misses almost all the time with the pistol even though the target is right next to him.\n2. No checkpoints. If you die that is it and you have to start over from the beginning. maybe a hardcore mode/regular mode?\n3. The esc key. If you press the esc key in game it takes you to the main menu and loses your game progress so you have to start over.( this is what did it for me to make this review)\n4. main character is the only one able to go out in the world. granted you can bring people with you but you can't send people to different locations to collect supplies? little unrealistic.\n5. Being able to target your party in combat is very frustration. why is that even an option?!\n\nI understand this is still beta/early game release and there is more work to be done but until these issues are fixed Im not playing it again. this game has great potential. don't ruin it","February 15, 2014","false","2.0"," 32 of 63 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","32","63","0","1"

I reccomend placing your money elsewhere till this is worked out and we can get an actual answer on that.","February 13, 2014","false","5.9"," 38 of 75 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","38","75","0","0"

It seemed like the people making it were really into zombie culture and were promising a well made zombie simulation game.  Unfortunatly, I don't think they were too experienced when it came to designing actual gameplay.\n\nThe story is pretty generic zombie-survival fare.  You wake up after surviving a plane crash surrounded by a bunch of people who saved your life when they brought you to their safehouse and patched you up.  From there, you are basically given jobs to strengthen the safehouse and you try to survive your first week in zombie land.\n\nThe actual gameplay is little more than making sure all your people are in the right position when you start a fight with a zombie.  If you do it right, you'll kill the zombie almost every time without it even noticing you.  If you do happen to be noticed as you approach the zombie, it will get a free attack on you and possibly beat you down pretty badly just in a few hits.  If you have a group with you, sneaking up on a zombie is a crapshoot unless all your party members are stealthy.  Once combat begins, you basically hit the zombie with debuff attacks then hit it with power attacks until it's dead.  (Blunt weapon for zombies, edged weapons/guns for humans usually works well)  If you're fighting humans, then there is a bit more of a challenge as they often have at least one pistol guy in their group.  (And, unlike most games, getting shot really hurts.)  Also, their gunshots may bring more zombies, but I've never had them bring an amount that worried me, (2 or 3 tops) which was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nI think the feel of the game is the most disappointing thing.  The zombies in this game don't seem like a threat that should have brought down society.  Most areas in the demo only really have a few zombies to deal with and they just aren't that scary. There should be the danger of hordes, being overwhelmed, and getting tired from too much combat.  None of that really comes into play.\n\nThat said, this is just a demo so it's possible the final product will be much better.  However, this game is not worth the $20 price tag they are asking.  Wait for the final product or until they lower the price tag to something more reasonable.","February 19, 2014","false","18.2"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

I'd consider this the highest praise I can bestow a game.\n\nThe creative minds at Double Bear were involved in the creation of such cult games and have succeeded in achieving the sense of wonderment I found absent both in Pillars of Eternity and Wasteland 2, both of which attempted the same trick of capturing the essence of these earlier titles. Personally, I found both PoE and WL2 shallow interpretations, with story, immersiveness and game mechanics triaged for improved graphics. I suspect both titles will be forgotten while the legacy of their predecessors will continue.\n\nGiven the teams behinds those particular titles were also involved in the creation of what I consider the "golden-age" era of cRPGs, I'd just about given up hope of finding another immersive isometric RPG. Maybe the real minds behind the greatest RPGs had left the business, died, or transcended to a higher plane of existence. Maybe, like myself, they were tired of the excreta being squirted out and trotted about as the "greatest RPG of all time" every few months. Maybe it was time to find a different hobby.\n\nThankfully, at least one of the minds involved in the creation of cult classic RPGs is still among us.  The sense of an expansive and hostile world awaiting exploration, the advancement of both your character and relationships within the base alongside combat that retains old-school strategy but boosted with modern animations is unique among modern RPGs.\n\nThe personal interactions are significant, with extensive dialogue trees that vary depending on your own actions and the emotions and morale within the base. Plus, there are a huge number of friendly NPCs, with 90% being unique and memorable. As an example, you can negotiate with a Vietnam veteran to kill his infected wife and join your base. You can either encourage his martial mentality, or relegate him to the kitchen. He can end up drunk and you can either admonish, mock him or give him time to recuperate. You can improve his mood with cigars and bourbon. You can encourage him to recover his old combat skills or serve the base more domestically. He can confront and threaten you if your leadership suffers, and you can either regain his support through negotiation or shoot him in the back as he leaves your room and insult him as he bleeds to death. Such extensive interactions are present with the majority of the NPCs within your base. This isn't Dragon Age type fluff, you aren't bored with slowly voiced over descriptions of the sexual preferences of Quinari princesses in the lands of make-believe. The topics of discussion are life and death, the answers are realistic, sometimes grim, and darkly humorous or a distraction used prior to a sneak-attack.\n\nYes, the zombie premise has been overdone. Yes, there are bugs (Fallout 2 and Bloodlines were also released in such a state). Yes, it can be hard to maintain morale and food in your first game. Yes, you may found the graphics not the greatest. If the screenshots are repulsive to you, this won't be your preferred game type. This game has depth and complexity, not 4D-quantum-parralax-10.1 reflective sunbeams accentuating the convexed-v-synced-bump mapped textures of the player characters rear end, each bun modelled with a 6-point physics skeleton for life-like jiggle as you waddle around. This isn't style over substance.\n\nThe Easter Eggs, such as the Friggin Chikin scratch card and bill-board signs, plus Dougs nerdy advice about attacking those crazed meth addicts with critical hits to their eyes is appreciated fan-service to those of us who immersed ourselves in such iconic RPGs almost two decades old.

This game totally got me addicted! It is a successful rendering of Fallout 1 and Tactics. My wife was like, "what the hell are you doing? Why are you glued to the computer day and night." I haven't experienced that since the original days of Fallout.\n\nIndie games rarely draw me in. But I must applaud this game's success. Some reviews complain about picture quality and easy level of the game. It is exactly what I am looking for. This game is for those who miss the old days of Fallout 1 and Tactics. I am enjoying this game very much. It caters to a specific group looking for a specific kind of game. It is not for everyone.\n\nIf you dislike action, open world/crafting/multi-players, RTS and prefer old fashioned turn-by-turn, RPG games. Then this game will be for you.","September 2, 2015","true","44.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Hit ratio % after increase in stat points does not make near enough difference from stage 3 to 4 to 6 which cost a pretty penny in stat points, sometimes you do, sometimes you don't, no buff received as it should be when stats increased to higher levels. The undead stand still and spawn in same place every sequence, but no hold the presses, they all the sudden changed after playing the same map 25 times and are randomly running around certain maps and seem to have endless AP and wait for it....wait for it....in "Iron Man" mode you can't save, except maybe sometimes after launching the game you can, BUT HOLD ON AGAIN ....when the game actually launches and does not crash a dozen times in a row. Inventory vanishing all of the sudden when gaining morale items for comrades. Go figure you cannot keep morale up at a consistent level when your s**t keeps disappearing all the time, I mean afterall Vic needs his damn bourbon and cigarettes but the cigs always disappear leaving him unfilled with just his alcohol. Anyhow, you get the just of it, if ya got 20 hrs you don't care about and wanna play a game that will just ♥♥♥♥ you off and or if you wanna get back at a friend and ruin their day, gift them this catastrophic piece of S**T.\n\nOriginal Review below: Sorry for the false hope, I feel dirty, gonna lower head in shame........\n\nAlot to do here, an involved game that is a learning piece-as-you-go style. Not everything is explained generally that well with the guide pop-ups, however clicking and exploring your commands and the various character screens and tabs will solve some of the mystery relatively quickly. Some areas take a bit more exploration depth to recognize user intention. As the game progresses you realize more and more how to satiate the masses, but it is not handed to you outright. You need to make smart decisions and not rely on a hack 'n' slash style gameplay, as it just won't work out for ya'. Ensure you speak to your group often and fulfill their needs, not gonna give away to much, but it will help a bit in the beginning. Overall enjoyable, but don't expect the typical zombie infected shoot up the earth and hope for rebirth scenario as that is just not this game. Progression is a little slow, but that is the intention. Hope ya' dig it.","February 19","false","20.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So I bought it for $8 bucks on sale. That's what I feel this game is worth. The combat is rather simple once you figure it out. Z's will attack the closet person for the most part and if you have a fire ax/sledge it's game over for them. Guns are pointless because they alert everything in the area (which is realistic). You can "add" stuff to your shelter by saving up enough parts and working on it for a number of ingame days. This adds a slight bonus and takes away from the monotony slightly.\nSo basically every day you go out and do the same thing, search for food, fuel, and luxery items to make your people happy. With combat rather simple it's a rinse and repeat grind waitng for the next addition to fisnih so you can  start buidling the next "addition"  that will add another slight (and I mean Slight) bonus to your base. And then wait as your people make weapons/grenades for you.\n\nI wish steam had an meh okay button instead of recoomend or not. It's not a bad game but it's not an amazing game either. It kept me interested for 18+ hours but seeing as there is no real story line beyond just collecting loot I don't think I'll put much more into it.","February 5","false","18.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But its just another failure that could have been great had they decided to finish it. The base building is lackluster at best with the only noticable differences being the wall lightly changing as upgraded. Other than that every upgrade is invisible.

Hit ratio % after increase in stat points does not make near enough difference from stage 3 to 4 to 6 which cost a pretty penny in stat points, sometimes you do, sometimes you don't, no buff received as it should be when stats increased to higher levels. The undead stand still and spawn in same place every sequence, but no hold the presses, they all the sudden changed after playing the same map 25 times and are randomly running around certain maps and seem to have endless AP and wait for it....wait for it....in "Iron Man" mode you can't save, except maybe sometimes after launching the game you can, BUT HOLD ON AGAIN ....when the game actually launches and does not crash a dozen times in a row. Inventory vanishing all of the sudden when gaining morale items for comrades. Go figure you cannot keep morale up at a consistent level when your s**t keeps disappearing all the time, I mean afterall Vic needs his damn bourbon and cigarettes but the cigs always disappear leaving him unfilled with just his alcohol. Anyhow, you get the just of it, if ya got 20 hrs you don't care about and wanna play a game that will just ♥♥♥♥ you off and or if you wanna get back at a friend and ruin their day, gift them this catastrophic piece of S**T.\n\nOriginal Review below: Sorry for the false hope, I feel dirty, gonna lower head in shame........\n\nAlot to do here, an involved game that is a learning piece-as-you-go style. Not everything is explained generally that well with the guide pop-ups, however clicking and exploring your commands and the various character screens and tabs will solve some of the mystery relatively quickly. Some areas take a bit more exploration depth to recognize user intention. As the game progresses you realize more and more how to satiate the masses, but it is not handed to you outright. You need to make smart decisions and not rely on a hack 'n' slash style gameplay, as it just won't work out for ya'. Ensure you speak to your group often and fulfill their needs, not gonna give away to much, but it will help a bit in the beginning. Overall enjoyable, but don't expect the typical zombie infected shoot up the earth and hope for rebirth scenario as that is just not this game. Progression is a little slow, but that is the intention. Hope ya' dig it.","February 19","false","20.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't tend to be very good 1st-person, as I fail at the twitch factor miserably (lol). However, it would be nice if there was a clock on the top of the screen at all times and pack animals, so we don't have to run back and forth to get everything. Also, more chickens and how about the ability to grow more by utilizing the roof and two other patios (so called because they look like the one that currently has the garden. Lastly, what about wandering zombies? When my party is our scavenging, how come they don't run into zombies in-route? I think these are easy additions (BTW - I'm in software as an SDET).\n\nNow, if you really wanted to do something fun, you'd allow us to move to another location or add/remodel the shelter/school.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/olaf_merchant/recommended/239840/","olaf_merchant","Olaf the Merchant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/olaf_merchant/","210 products in account","Now that I've put in a few hours (12) in the game, I can make a pretty comprehensive review on this title.\n\nFirst off- Dead State has rough edges, surely, but overall, it's an enticing zombie survival game, with emphasis on squad and shelter management, improving your abode while trying to weather out the apocalypse. You'll set up your base in a school in a fictional Texas town, trying to make ends meet without succumbing to the horrors of the zombie apocalypse, which is not limited to the shambling dead. The game makes good use of the setting, providing a few differing factions and splinter groups set up in the ruins of the world, each striving to survive- sometimes at the expense of others. You won't be getting many warm welcomes, and most of these will turn out to be ambushes, so that the thugs in question can loot those canned pineapples from your carcass.\n\nThankfully, not all of Texas is going to meet you with guns blazing- sometimes, diplomacy is the way to go, and investing in the skill trees can net you surprising results, varying from avoiding armed confrontation with hostile groups, to negotiating new location information, talking depressed survivors into fighting for another day or even recruiting some of the tough-as-nails survivors to join your growing community. Naturally, characters of nominal importance are the only ones you can actually recruit- you can pretty safely discern hostile troops from their lack of name, and the ubiquitous looter gear they're armed with.\n\nAfter 12 hours, I can safely say that I am glad I backed Dead State- it's proving itself to be pretty much all it boasted, albeit with a few rough edges. I find myself playing 'just one more day', trying to meet up daily demands and the missions on the To-Do list. You're free to explore the end of the world, utilizing your own judgement and goals, although it does pay to placate and bribe your growing group of survivors every now and then, just to keep everybody happy, healthy and ready to eke out a meager existence in a world filled with ravenous undead, trigger-happy looters, gun-toting militias, renegade cops, mercenaries and just ordinary people trying to survive at all costs.\n\nPros:\n\n- Solid tactical gameplay. Aside a few odd glitches in the 1.0 (multiple enemies occupying single tile, some impr. weapons losing their ammo charges- pepper sprays, nail guns and the like), you can pretty much plan, and execute raids on the many locations in the game, sometimes taking an active part in offense, sometimes defense, and every once in a while, just playing both hostile survivors and the zombies against each other.\n- Stealth versus guns-blazing approaches- you're free to use your own judgement in how to deal with each location, but the game will most likely toss a zombie or two on maps where you announce your presence by three rounds rapid.\n- Varied locations that, although using same buildings from time to time, are still distinguishable from each other.\n- Emphasis on Survival, instead of shooting one thousand zombies. Stealth, planning and a bit of cloak and dagger can get you in and out of many situations where most games would provide you with one option- violence. In Dead State, violence is usually the last, least desireable option.\n- Different characters with various backgrounds, motivations, likes and dislikes, which are factored in the daily business of your Shelter. Some are nearly joke characters, while others have to cope with the tragedies arising from losing their loved ones to the zombie plague.\n- Good range of skills, weapons and choices for improvements on the home base\n- Great concept art, character portraits\n\nCONS:\n\n- Still a bit buggy. Expect they will sort 'em out in the future patches, but be ready for clipping foes, misplaced pepper spray and nail gun magazines, one or two zones where Turn-Based-Combat trigger is broken and the fight will continue, despite no active hostilities. One shut-in recruitable survivor dialogue which should end up in violence, does not.\n- The game really doesn't give you a heads up that initiating hostilities towards obviously hostile survivor groups first can lead to a MASSIVE negative morale in home base. You see a crazed shooter, you better have them initiate combat, or suffer the consequences.\n- Static game zones: Sadly, once you've cleared out a game zone, there's nothing left to do there. And you can't mark these looted areas off your map, but have to rely on your own memory.\n- No way to mark vital resources on the map, like discovering and making note of a sack of concrete mix you'll need later for HQ upgrades.\n- Some of the menus are still a bit difficult to navigate/ too small to read on higher resolutions.\n- Survivor inventory management in the HQ is a bit tricky to locate, but once you pick up on the drop-down menu on the upper left corner, you're set. Also, ammo dividing can be achieved with the CTRL-click on ammo stack, after which the portion allocated can be moved to the HQ stockpile, and distributed to your survivors.\n- No real soundtrack or voices, sound effects that stick to mind.","December 5, 2014","true","120.7"," 52 of 105 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","52","105","0","0"

The positive recommendation didn't change though.\n\nCharacters still feel bland. The dialog is, for the most part, very generic and there are many characters in my shelter that I barely know, and didn't even bother to get to know their names. Part of the problem here is that, what makes them special (eventually), comes by way of them taking the initiative to talk to the player about their problems or ideas. Those events trigger at different times, and not very often, which means that most will probably remain forgetable for a long time. This system is fine as it is, but I believe there's much room for improvement there.\n\nAs I found more people, and as I invited them to the shelter, the game became significantly more interesting and I became much more immersed in it. In the morning of each new day people will talk to the player making requests (like not working today), suggestions and other stuff. There are also crisis events that trigger rarely and result in a meeting between the main characters forming a makeshift, small council to discuss an issue. The role of the player is as the leader of this shelter, so he's expected to have the final word in these matters. There will be some moral dilemmas along the way which at times made me really feel responsible for these people well being.\n\nAs for the difficulty, I described it as escalating quickly in my first impressions, but after getting good equipment and weapons, along with leveling my character with a focus in combat, that difficulty curve quickly peaked and now is taking a big dive. Combat is way too easy now, especially against zombies. Apparently the main character can't get infected, which, along with the fact that they can no longer do any damage even if they hit me, makes them just an annoyance. Other humans still pose some challenge from time to time, but it's rare. I expect another spike in difficulty soon, otherwise I'd have to say this game has severe balancing issues. In terms of shelter management, even with a character build not meant to excel at that, it has become easier lately as well, though not as much. Raising morale, getting enough antibiotics to keep infected survivors alive, and getting fuel are the main causes of tension. It became incredibly easier after getting a horse, and I expect it to become even easier with a car, so again, I expect events to trigger that will put more strain on resources soon.\n\nAs for bugs, I found quite a few. I recon many are supposed to be fixed soon, but at the time of writing, there will be some glaring small issues that indicate lack of polish. The only really bad ones were crashes, which only started happening recently, but twice in two days, in which I lost some significant progress. It's my fault for not saving, but an auto-save feature would have been very welcome.\n\nOne thing I'd like to test is its replayability. I want to create a new character that is all about running a shelter, managing people, leading them in combat, but not being a good combatant himself. That should make the game harder, and I like the idea from a roleplaying perspective, although I don't know if a second playthrough can be different enough for that to be fun. On the other hand, I'd like to beat the game first, but I have no idea if I'm close or not.\n\nSo there, my opinion of the game improved dramatically because I got totally hooked as time went by. I recognize how hard it must be to balance the tension between the combat and shelter management parts of the game, and for the most part, it does a very good job at it. The text below was written much earlier into the game.\n\n---\n\nThis "review" was written at around 10 hours of gameplay (so pretty early in the context of this game). Up to this point, my experience with the game has been positive. Here's a quick rundown of my experience with it. I've seen many comparisons with other games, so I'm going to frame this in comparison with them.\n\n- Unlike TWOM and XCOM, this one plays from the point of view of a specific character that you create in the beginning.\n\n- The character creation is fairly simple, but allows for many different playstyles. From looking at the options available, I see that you could play the main character as ranged, melee, shelter manager/leader, or a mixture. I don't see options that would allow secialization on a stealthy gameplay though, which is disappointing. There's 4 general stats (analogue to Fallout's attributes) and around 10 skills with perk choices built into the skill progression system that allows for even more customization.\n\n- There's a shelter stage, and a combat stage that would be familiar to XCOM fans, although unlike XCOM, they play the same. In the shelter stage you walk around the shelter talking to people, assigning jobs / upgrading facilities / creating items by interacting with an object, getting or storing items by interacting with a container.\n\n- Just like State of Decay, you have to manage the resources of the shelter, in the forms of food, morale, antibiotics, fuel and the mood the specific characters.\n\n- When you leave the shelter, you'll see a map whose mechanics will be familiar to anyone that played the original Fallout games, with random encounters and all.\n\n- The gameplay in the remote locations you find is close to the original Fallout, with the difference that you control your party members as well during combat. There are many little new mechanics that I like, for instance, if an ally is blocking your way to an enemy, you can swap positions with him by spending two Action Points (also useful if you want a character to shield another). I found the combat part to be very unforgiving and difficulty ramps up quickly while you'll be scrounging for bullets and other stuff.\n\n- I found many issues with the text, sometimes being cut off or being hard to read due to lack of contrast with the background, but those instances aren't too bothersome and not game breaking in any way.\n\n- The narrative and cast of characters up to this point seems bland. Little of it made me care for them, which I think is a failure in this department, as I think this is important for this game to truly shine. This is one thing I don't want to judge so early into the game, but I would expect to be more immersed in the narrative by now.\n\nSummary\n\nI'm having a lot of fun with it. It's fairly nostalgic if you played Fallout, and the mechanics seem to be well designed. Graphically is not very polished, and doesn't seem very unique from an artistic perspective (like TWOM is) which makes it look very generic, but the mixtures of RPG, turn-based tactical combat and resource management mechanics of the game are its greatest assets. I'll update this later on, but this is my first impression of the game. I'd recomend it for anyone that played the original Fallouts and XCOMs, but I doubt this would grab the attention of less patient gamers.","December 7, 2014","true","90.7"," 33 of 67 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","33","67","0","0"

Along with the turn based combat and exploration, a well implemented base management adds an extra element of planning and strategy. Levelling is not based on kills, but rather on a goal system, meaning farming every kill on a level is not at all necessary, and avoiding combat is at times the best strategy. I have not played many hours but already I can see this will be one of my games of the year.\n\nThe game does seem to be a bit buggy at this stage (from my limited playtime), but the devs are definitely on top of things and are listening to their playerbase, so I do not see this as much of a problem at the moment.","December 7, 2014","true","10.5"," 30 of 61 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","30","61","0","0"

With all the baggage that entails.\n\nZombies are boring but the conflicts that all disasters create between people are interesting. Dead State understands this, and that's why it manages to remain captivating despite the overdone subject material.\n\nIt's a turn-based rpg and you travel the post-zombie-apocalypse wasteland in search of loot to bring back to your shelter. There's loads of combat, base building, and managing the personalities in your base. The combat isn't anything to write home about, but it's on par with Fallout 1 & 2.\n\nThe writing is really great, and one of the best parts of the game is reading through the dialogue you have with the people at your shelter. There's tons of opportunities to be a truly disgusting person without being stereotypically evil.\n\nLike all great old school rpgs, however, it's got its fair share of bugs. Don't get me wrong though, it's very playable - there's nothing game breaking - but slight annoyances can add up if you're sensitive to that sort of thing, you little babby. Save often and keep multiple saves to avoid headaches. Graphics are fairly dated, too - although the character portraits are quite pretty.\n\nI've played about 26 hours of it and it's definitely super impressive, coming from a small indie studio.\n\nMore like this please. Maybe with a robot apocalypse next time.","December 8, 2014","true","47.5"," 23 of 47 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","23","47","0","0"

I have not run into many game breaking ones, other than ones that cause crash to desktop. I find if I do not save at every opportunity it is garneted to crash at a bad time. When people come to the gate once in a while the camera gets stuck there.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fairly fun. I do enjoy the mesh of real time exploration with the turn based combat. however line of sight  seems a bit off at times, and seems obstacles do not effect how hard it is to be hit or hit others with guns, ie on the other side of a table or car hood.\n\nThe shelter is neat as it changes, though a few upgrades could be changed a bit, as there is plenty of ground outside they could have used for farming rather than the small things on the roof. one needs to get the 25 % food reduction perk rather soon as food consumption gets rather high while getting 10 additional moral per day is rather underpowered. this shows additional balancing should/needs to be done.\n\nThe moral system itself should be reworked a bit s it seems to easy to keep I up. maybe put a upper limit on it and have luxuries be consumed as needed rather all at once. not so sure how to improve that system but it can be worked on.\n\nTLDR Bugs lot of bugs, they need fixed. but otherwise an enjoyable game.","December 10, 2014","true","106.6"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","22","45","0","0"

All over the map in terms of balance and characterization, and the UI is shameful across the board. Over the long haul, however, Dead State's charms begin to manifest.\n\nIt will take awhile before the game starts to get going. A safe bet for the first-time player is that you'll be about 10-12 hours in before the first character conflicts kick in and you start exploring places more spectacular and atmospheric than deserted small-town main streets and suburbs. Story content is gated by in-game days and it takes about a week (each day an hour or more of gameplay, depending) before things start to really happen. If you can't devote that kind of time or don't have the patience (and not everyone does!) then it's a take-or-leave game. It squeezes surprisingly little from its premise otherwise (there is SO MUCH you could get from a hardcore RPG set in a zombie apocalypse), and clearly marks itself as an earnestly made first game from a new developer. I would say that if you're into 90's Interplay classics, have time on your hands and really, really love zombie fiction, it's worth the $30. Otherwise? Wait for a few patches or get it on sale. But it's worth the look if you're into turn-based RPGs.","December 12, 2014","true","63.7"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","0"

Note emphasis on "early," see below.\n\n+ Base management can be fun, especially once you get lots of survivors who then start interacting with each other which can lead to interesting crisis events. Probably the best part of the game.Seems to clearly draw from Suikoden, what with being able to recruit lots of characters to your home base who have vignettes and even being able to build a suggestion box to read often humorous suggestions from them.  Until you get a lot of survivors the base is pretty dead though.\n\n+ Can scratch that loot tick before you get tired of looting. Nothing like opening a single container and seeing a ton of nice loot.\n\n- The game still has a lot of bugs including ones patches claim to have fixed (see: certain stairs in the hotel only working after rejiggering your whole party position so you can use them, enemies especially zombies clipping into each other while moving and merging into one tile, etc) which can make playing a chore.\n\n- Combat breaks very quickly after the early game. You start finding armor that lets you ignore damage, quickly making zombies irrelevant and humans who don't have guns higher tier than the armor you're wearing irrelevant until eventually you have such good armor there are no longer enemies that can threaten you without critting. This cuts both ways and eventually the only significant way you can damage certain enemies is on crits, especially the really annoying ones with riot shields who you should basically not bother with if you aren't critting them with weapon types they're least resistant to. You can find and craft various gas grenades that trivialize combat against human enemies who aren't resistant to gas, which is like 90% of them including the top tier ones since you just blind or even knock them out and then pummel them while they're helpless. A zombie game where zombies quickly become irrelevant because your armor is so good they do nothing to you and humans become almost irrelevant soon after has serious issues.\n\n-The interface is one of the worst I've encountered in a long while. You spend a lot of time looking at inventory screens, and because of that what might be minor problems in another game or taken alone quickly add up to become frustrating. There is physically no way to drop an item you realize you don't even care enough about to recycle (see below), you have to dump it into a container somewhere on the map. If you want to move things from the car to your base's stash that don't auto stock, you have to first move it to your main character and then move it into your stash (hope you invested in strength!). You have to move things one by one from character inventories to the trunk in the field because you can't move things from multiple characters inventories like when you trade between characters (another interface issue because you have to actually select it as an action on the field by right click cycling through other options instead of just pressing "I" when you're not in base). I can go on. Again, these might be minor issues in other games or taken alone, but since by this games nature you spend so much time messing with inventories it adds up very quickly. The idea of getting loot in a game with a large emphasis on looting actually became a chore that I began dreading.\n\n- You can recycle things you don't want into "parts," one of the resources in base management once you build a building. This is just completely ridiculous. First of all, once you build a recycler, you no longer have to care about parts because you can recycle trash items into more parts than you will ever need. This is a game partially about resource management where you can build an easily accessible building that lets you ignore one of the resources. Let that sink in. The other issue is it encourages you to pick up every piece of garbage you encounter so you can turn them into parts encouraging the most base loot hording behavior. This is already annoying if you're a lootaholic in games like Elder Scrolls series, but compound it with unfun messing with inventories and you can see why I never wanted to see another inventory screen in this game again. They nerfed this building at some point in beta and its still ridiculous. Guys you don't need to try to make every bad idea you come up with work, just delete it and move on.\n\n- There isn't really any story until extremely late in the game. I'm talking like 80+ days in. That might appeal to some people, but by like day 30 I had my base pretty much set up and no longer had resource issues. That left 50+ days of basically going through the motions for the sake of it. Resources quickly become irrelevant when you get good transportation so you can bring home hundreds of pounds of materials home in a single day from no longer challenging maps. Lets not even talk about recycling.\n\n- I don't care about graphics in RPGs but if you do... play another game. Not much going on in the audio department either.\n\nI don't want to keep going because again, I really wanted to like this game. I think they have made an admirable effort considering their situation and resources. But that the people behind it made an admirable effort doesn't mean you should buy a game, and in its current state after beta and multiple patches I can can only recommend this game to extreme fans of the genre who are also extremely forgiving. I like to think I am in that category most of the time, but this game in particular soured me.","January 7, 2015","false","96.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

I finally picked up Dead State at a whim and I have to say that I should never have bothered with the other titles.  This game is surprisingly good and interesting to play and makes for an interesting mix of building up your base, finding supplies and trying not to get your teams killed.  No XP for killing stuff, encouraging players to be a little more clever about how they explore and hunt for supplies.  The devs are active and each patch brings about new and tangible enhancements.  This game is definately worth supporting.","October 13, 2014","true","90.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

There is a lot to explore and a good variety of items.  Interesting art style and great variety of NPC's.  The noise mechanic is also cool.  Enjoyed attracting zombies to a fight with scavengers to pit them against each other.\n\nThe game has a pretty steep learning curve if you don't read the manual.  A lot of things are not obvious nor intuitive.  The UI is a little clunky and there are still some glitches in the release version, though these are not really game-breaking nor take away from the overall experience.  Mostly some weird moving animations or inability to access containers the first time they are clicked on.\n\nOverall, a pretty solid game and fun to explore.

There are bugs, which are getting squashed. So far none of them have really bothered me or my game and im really diving it this game. One bad patch came out and was quickly rectified, which happens to the AAA devolepers too. I wouldnt really hold it against doublebear.\n\nThe game itself hits my sweet spot of gaming. Turn based, rpg, strategy gaming with base building. The closet analogy game released recently would be Wasteland 2. So its easiest to compare them and would be relevant to most gamers too:\n\nDead State (DS) has base building which i love. Wasteland 2 (WS) doesn't have this, and the way that game was made makes it seem like it SHOULD have been in there. The way the second half of WS was written it seems like it should have been included and it to me it felt like a great chance to extend that game was ignored.\n\nWS was too campy in my opinion. It made far too many referential jokes and nods and what not to the previous game and the genre in general. I felt that was a mistake. DS tries and succeeds in maintaining a better immersion in the zombie filled world and takes itself seriously. So over all DS beats WS in its game world.\n\nOn the negative side DS needs to be balanced still. Combat goes from wildly hard to wildly easy. Not long into the game only a few characters can mow down a battalion of zombies with little effort. That being said, the inclusion of so much fighting other humans can be tricky. You will find in the long run, its the living humans that are truely the real enemy in the game. But im sure as the patches come, feed back is gathered, and balance is achieved, this won't be a negative for long.\n\nGraphics are passable for the game, but they bog my machine down way more then should. If you have a low end machine you might run into problems with graphics on anything other then lowest settings. My machine is middle of the road and i have to run middle of the road graphics. While comparative games generally run much better. This is probably an optimazation issue, which of course, tends to get taken care of in patches. From the already released patches it seems like they are trying to get this ironed out.\n\nThere plenty of stuff to find and loot in the game. Much of it though is not anyting more then having the words FOOD and LUXURY ITEMS written on a holder card and given different names. While they may be 1000 items inthe game, 900 of them are functionally identical, but the fact i can horde up toilet paper and candy bars makes the game feel more immersive then it really is as far as loot is concerned. I almost wish the game made a distinction though between toilet paper and tooth paste and it didnt just all end up as one pool when you bring it back. But that would probably have made the game turn into a consumables stockpile sim, which i might like, but i bet most gamers wouldnt. So I accept the way it is, and be happy enough with it.\n\nI would have liked more base building features. Base defense battles (which may or may not be included but i have yet to see one). More weapon and armor types (though honestly there already a lot, but i just would like more).\n\nMy biggest gripe is the lack of documention of some things. I find data items before I am told how they could can used, so i spent a long time trying to figure out why i couldnt access them in the library. I also got confused when unlocking blueprints inthe workshop had the same icon as the actual item construction. So i did blueprints and couldnt tell know could build the item, i thought it just made more blueprints. But fortunately the devolpers watch the forums and answered in minutes (literally minutes) and i got it sorted out. But its a good sign the game is complex enough to not be instantly figured out, but i would have liked better tutorials/documentation.\n\nIf you read this whole review, you will know i am whole heartedly recommending this game. This game had me up til the sun rose the day of release playing it. Its probably been 2 or 3 years since a game did that to me. Thank you to the devolpers for making this game!","December 7, 2014","true","36.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

It appears that game makers do check these critics or we're just in sync with each other; thank you for the updates already made to game.\n\nCreators have added a way to attach own pics but I have to leave this critique for now because it's still relevant to a degree:\nCharacter creation looks promising, but currenty selections are girly men and rough women. Also you apparently have to have some peircing, tattoo, or hair style fetishes because thats what's offered. character progress either as a preprogrammed set of improvements, or the main character can select where the points go. However, there is no xp bar or knowledge of when or where those improvments are coming from. you just check character screen every so often and go - yay!\n\nInventory screen is severely lacking. When you return to base, only main chacter is accessible. Meaning he/she has to have all property on self in order to go through it. There is an auto remover for community items, but the items npcs are carrying are unaccessible at this point.\n\nGame was feeling linear in beginning; approaching a more sandbox like environment? I like that now your ( upto four man) team can now move somewhat independent by hitting j-key. It appears that game is leading us to the point where we can possibly recruit human survivors. Will all people be possible to talk to? or just a few scripted ones? Will a dialogue option be added to support this? My current experience is to visit local park, be attacked and win then be told back at base that I am a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for killing an innocent!?!  No control over that so I assume it's in fix mode.\n\nSome positive ideas, good luck with them - your the smart ones making it appear in game.\nI also would think more resources or replentishable resources might be needed; or even, (just ideas) a gas truck  location, truck is stuck can't move, but I can send team to collect gas once in a while. Or maybe more ammo stashes, or reloading options, or even black powder firearms options (imagine the chicken farm that gives food and potassium nitrate for powder).\n\nAny chance on creating forward bases or safe houses, meeting other commnities for trade and safe haven. Imagine the house where you post a small team and can  add upgrades to or re-enforce. This would allow team to cover much more area on foot without the getting stuck and dying part.\n\nAll these criticisms and bugs aside, the game seems to have so much potential I can't help but love it. Good luck team, I hope you  guys make a  great game.","September 30, 2014","true","114.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

These are my impresisons.\n\nIs the game perfect? No.\nIs the game very good? No.\nIs the game good? Maybe.\nIs the game fun? Maybe.\n\nLet's get the elephant out of the way early. Dead State has a host of issues. Combat is simplistic. The zombies aren't really a threat. There are numerous bugs and I have experienced numerous crashes. Certain game concepts are poorly explained. The UI can be rough in places, especially dealing with inventory. You can't eject people from the shelter. Areas don't get monster respawn. Enemies are always in the same place on every game, limiting replayability. The list goes on. So there are many legitimate reasons why some people may not like it.\n\nYet I enjoyed it for a while. The game feels old-school, almost in an original Fallout sense. It plays slowly and methodically and you have a chance to really get to know the world. Issues and situations are thrown at you, sometimes with no easy answer. It has that "one more day, one more turn" feel that most good games have. I always have something to do, explore, build and always a new situation to handle. The person who is bit - do I get them out of the shelter because they're using up all my antibiotics? Or do I do the merciful thing and keep them here? How do I handle an abortion issue?Does a woman's right to choose outweigh the necessity of repopulating the human race? Do I go fishing for food or do I try to scout that new camp to find supplies to reinforce our wall? Combat at times is difficult and after a fierce fire fight you can feel tired, not elated, but it's always nice to get the spoils of your victory.\n\nThis is one of the first Kickstarter games I backed and I don't regret it because I wanted to see a game like this made. I had some fun playing it and it piques my imagination. There are many areas where the game could be improved and maybe that will happen and maybe that won't. If it does, Dead State may become a very good game. If it doesn't, I still got some enjoyment for my time spent with it.\n\nSo why the negative review? The game is just simply too poorly balanced and too buggy to recommend. Combat is horribly unbalanced - you'll want one type of weapon and one type only because it's so vastly superior to everything else. Zombies are so easy to beat that they present no challenge whatsoever. A zombie game where you aren't afraid of the zombies is not a good thing. Bugs abound everywhere, including some show stoppers that won't let you finish the game. The NPCs that you meet aren't really interesting and their stories don't really go anywhere. The only threats are other humans and most of those interactions are exceptionally simplistic and almost all end in firefights. So between the balance, the bugs, the dull NPCs and the simplistic combat, after the first few hours you've seen everything the game has to offer.\n\nSimplistic combat + unscary zombies + few tactical options + bugs + simplistic NPC interactions  = unhappy Blackadar. It's too bad too because this game was close to being very good. It just needed another 6 months of real polish before release. It didn't get it.\n\nLong story short, you MIGHT have some fun with this if you're old school like me. But eventually you will probably tire of the bugs, balance an bad NPCs and you'll toss it away. I stuck with it to the bitter end, including an ending that required console commands to get past game stopping bugs, but that's because I'm a glutton for punishment. So I have to give it a thumbs' down. Go give your money to the Shadowrun games instead - better stories, better settings, better combat and better balance.","December 9, 2014","false","72.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

After completing a game of Wasteland 2, the turn based RPG bug bit me again.. totally reminding me of FO,FO2, and Jagged Alliance of days past. I searched steam for some more, and rememberd Dead State.\n\nIve put some decent hours into Beta Patch #2 so far and I really like where this is going. Its got all the elements of past turn based RPG's (ie. combat, micromanaging, strategy, building) and more. You wake up as part of a group in a school, which becomes your "base". You have to stock that base with food, weapons, etc.. from surrounding areas, all while looking out for zombies and bad guys. Along the way, more can join your group and you have access to all the group for job tasks or scavenging.\n\nYou dont level up by killing anything, you level up by completing "shelter goals". Some of the goals include gathering so much food, med supplies, luxuries, etc.. I thought this was a neat way to gain more skills for your characters, totally away from the norm of killing for skill. I like it.\n\nIm on day 25 or so on beta patch #2, and I'm coming to the point where I may have taken in too many people at once, so each day ends up being a search for food more than anything, luckily there are "fishing spots" to walk to and test your luck harvesting fish. In fact, I see the potential to have hundreds, if not thousands of locations on the map along with encounters because of the way the map scren and travel works.. this could be a pretty content loaded game moving forward.\n\nMy Jagged Alliance heart wants to see more specialized firearm variants, as right now, they seem to have one firearm per ammo type. This may be wishful thinking, but would be pretty cool moving forward. I know its the zombie apocalypse, but cant that dead soldier just be carrying a MK17 SD variant or something ;)\n\nI'm sure others will complain about the "graphics" in some cases, but for me, they dont matter as much.. these games are about the adventure, the open world, the choose your own tasks, the story.. you make it what you want to survive. The true turn based RPG thrives non-linearly, and this game certainly has that potential.\n\nAll in all, the game is well worth the purchase, even at this early access stage. I think we are in the middle of a turn based RPG game renaissance, and I couldnt be happier about it.  If you like this sort of game, micro managing little pixel squads of people, and, well, the zombie apocalypse.. get Dead State now, you wont regret it.","October 15, 2014","true","75.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Layered on top of tedious combat is Dead State's painfully plodding pace, slow performance and lackluster features.  This makes for a totally unrecommendable game.\n\nI liked the concept of the game and I do supprt the resurgance of crpg's.  That's why I contributed to this game and others like it on Kickstarter.

Still, I am very impressed and excited by the game.\n\nFirst of all it is a very traditional old school roleplaying game, the combat is great turn-based, very similar to Jagged Alliance 1 or 2, or Fallout 1 and 2, even to UFO series (the old ones especially). There is character sheets and stats to improve which have some effect in game. Obviously in the end game we might see better how these skills and attributes (and even perks that is not yet in the game but planned) will influence the game and give a boost to replay value.\n\nThe theme is from the Romero's zombie movies mostly. Zombies are slow, dead bodies, no mutations and freak abilities, differs mostly by the state of corpse. If you are fan of Romero's movies you would like this. If you are expecting a huge range of monsters then you will be disappointed. But if you can get along with it you might have a nice experience. The true enemy is the conditions, the lack of resources, other human beigns who compete for what left, ad your own group. There is a good amount of social dynamism even in such early state of the game and this will be just better. You influence your group morals by what kind of job you assign to them, who are you taking out to the dangerous scavenging missions, how much you listen to their advices and who do you listen to, and so on. There is a hint that there will be some power struggle among the group in later in game.\n\nThe tactical combat is good enough, if you learn the tricks it is not very hard, but honestly sometimes it can be difficult if you are not careful and the game can punish you very much if you are not careful or do a mistake. That is good in fact and makes the game just more interesting. If you are fan of turn based tactical combat, this game is for you. Weapons do have some special attributes, like cutting weapons can cause bleeding to living beigns, crushing weapons can cause disorientation, with some weapons you can knock your enemy prone and so on. Also there are some psychological conditions in effect, like panic when you are overrunned by zombies (a sure way to die quick).\n\nThere is penty of improvement to be made of course, and I list some which I think would make the game even in early access better.\n\n1) Inventory screen: at this point I could not be able to reach the other survivors inventory at the base, and as you only able to command your main character in the area you have only a very ineffective way to equip your companions. A screen where your in-party companions could be equipped from the base storage would be great). Also it would be nice to be able to drop items to ground or just simply to exchange with others in the tactical maps. At the moment I only found one solution to trade items with companions, and that is to utilize the 'containers' already placed in game, put the items there and then change the control to other character and get those.\n\n2) It would be nice to see some notes or hints in the maps you have. You encounter empty houses, or places with some corpses and you wonder what's happened there. It would add to the horror if either you might able to collect clues what happened or youhave your companions comment on the situation.\n\nAnd finally I want to praise the music. It is great, melancholic, sad, but also in a way calming. It gives back something of the theme wandering in a city emptied of life. Well done and thanks fr th experience. I am looking forward to the final game and any updates.\n","May 19, 2014","true","182.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

(Even if an ally is in a good mood there's a negative penalty to morale. ???) Also I had to use a command to remove some negative permanent status effects not being removed on its own. (I had 3 characters that were on fire for 24 hours)\n\nIt's a pretty addictive game for the most part. It reminds me of the old-school icewind dale games to some degree.

I've all but lost hope and will probably play it again once after they've completed it. They're estimate was for July so it may come out soon or it may never come out for all I know, or maybe they meant next July. Even if they released it tommorow now I'd hesitate to play it right away because of how long it took, all the momentum I had for it is gone entirely now. I like the idea of the game but there's plenty other similar games coming out lately that can fill that hole. Im still cheering for the game completion though. Would I pay $25 for the game with the knowledge I have now? I'll say no. But I would buy it once its completed.\n\n3rd Follow up: (Nov 17th, 2014) Ok, well the game now has upgraded A LOT. The game goes far and beyond 7 days now and theres new items and upgrades available, but theres 2 or 3 that don't work yet but don't effect the gameplay enough to cause problems, unless you build it without realizing it does nothing and screw yourself out of supplies. Some areas are still glitchy, but thats to be expected from a game still in development. I really enjoy playing it now, its challenging and fun with lots of new people and storyline to entertain. I really love the new intro and menu screen thats there now too, definitely makes you feel more immersed. If they had realeased this first it probably would have had a more powerful impact but thats fine because its here now and its pretty awesome. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys turn based games like X-Com. I eagerly await the fully finished game but Im very happy with what it is now.","May 2, 2014","true","116.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

After a few hours of play I don't feel the game is really as described in its marketing.\n\nIt seems that Dead State is mostly about crafting and shelter maintenance, with some exploration and combat (and some other negative reviews have described the awful combat system already). These are things I have zero interest in. I was hoping for the "social management" and "narrative" parts to be stressed more. Instead, there appears to be no story at all, no narrative, nothing driving the game save for the shelter.\n\nWhile this may be realistic in a zombie apocalypse survival scenario, I just hoped for more in the way of RPG and less in the way of "scavenge small items and make something out of them." This would have saved it from being as slow and boring as it turned out to be.\n\nAs an aside, there are also numerous bugs with the tutorial text appearing to give you tips about things you did 5 minutes ago, or are no longer in the room for, etc. More care needs to have been taken with editing and overall experience by the player.\n\nTotally disappointed, although someone else more interested in crafting a shelter could find this game fun.","November 4, 2015","false","1.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I am a big fan of turn-based games, base-builders and the zombie apocalypse-survival genre. Dead State is mature in theme and has a lot of different luxury goods to try and keep your group happy\n\nDead State is a graphically good looking game, but unfortunately one rife with bugs.\n\nThere are typos, and floating inventory items – but these minor issues which can be over looked. A big problem in the game for me was when I had started building the well for my base. My project leader became sick and had to take a day off from working on it. When she returned to work the next day, the game refused to recognize that any of my characters possessed a crowbar, which was deemed a requirement for the task. I equipped her with three, in every imaginable slot. Nothing seemed to appease the game. While I was frustrated, I was determined to play on.\n\nThe Coyotes are a violent, enemy group of rival survivors and they are VERY powerful in the early game. After several attempts to defeat them (there were no diplomatic options) I decided that you had to run from them. The Coyotes fire their weapons discriminately in combat and the sounds draws wave after wave of undead reinforcements down upon you.  Added to this, there are situations where, in combat, your move options are limited by fallen companions, KO’ed foes, terrain and areas of control of standing combatants, effectively trapping your characters so that they cannot fight enemies, while your foes continue to pump you full of lead. In tight spaces this can be lethal for your group.\n\nI finally quit in frustration.

And there is no 'sneak' option.\n\nThe AI is also pretty bad. Sometimes you can creep up on zombies, others you can't. When in a group, some attack at the same time, others just kind of stand back. But making noise does appear to spawn new zombies. Unfortunately, they just stand in your exit zone and are easily picked off.\n\nThe story has been pretty interesting though.

This version allows you to play the first seven game days of Dead State.  It gives you plenty to do and see.  I have played through twice.\n\nThere seems to be a solid framework starting to take shape concerning the characters and their personalities in the shelter.  Each seem to have their own needs and desires and balancing these while trying to be productive and survive will be a factor.\n\nThe combat is reminiscent of X com, with action points required to move and to perform different attacks (based on the weapon equipped). The Shelter, your base of operations, can be improved with different structures providing additional benefits (only "the well" upgrade is available in this version) . Different characters have certain skill sets that allow them to perform task at the Shelter as well , some based on materials on hand, others based on what improvements you have constructed.\n\nYou must decide when you venture forth if your going to leave a person behind at the shelter to work on a task or an improvement , or, to bring them along as part of the scavenging party.  The more people left at the shelter, the faster improvements get built, but the weaker the scavenger party is which could be catastrophic if you run into trouble.\n\nI enjoyed my time playing, even in this products current state, bugs and all (and there are bugs, but I expected that).  I can see the potential and I am optimistic about the final release.  I already pre purchased through doublebears website shortly after the kickstarter sign up ended.  The product description and early info was enough to convince me it would be a game I would enjoy.\n\nIf your on the fence about purchasing the game, $24 might be a steep price to pay to try it out.  Waiting for the demo might be a better bet.  I on the other hand view the current state as a bonus.  The devs have opened up their product early to the community and are very receptive to comments and feedback, and will be updating the build as time goes by.  I can't wait for the final release!","April 9, 2014","true","110.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It seems a blind foray hunting for meds, a dark sense of forboding as I know unless I track done a single dose of elusive antiboitics by the end of the day I join the hordes of undead.  Yet despite this it all feels irrelevant somehow.  Should I find that elixir I am still lost.  I am surrounded by one time allies who have grown to hate me - sometimes through bad decisions on my part but more often than not due to the cruel hand of fate.  With their ever growing sense of discontent they are sure to grow resentful and suspecious if I somehow buy another three days when so many of their loved ones have suffered the grim fate.  It feels as hopeless as the end of the world...which, of course, it is.\n\n-----------\n\nIn short - I'm hooked.  This is not a perfect game but nor does it deserve the large number of negative reviews. OK, I've only come on board post-'reanimated' release, but it still seems harsh.  I suffer from the 'floating cursor' issues (note for devs - it is related to the graphics but not as simple as just the card - if I pull the interface to an old square VGA monitor the problem goes away; would also love to see scavanging without the main character to let them heal) but I feel compelled to try and work with it nonetheless...but only a minority seem to have this.  But it is immersive - when I'm playing, I'm in the game world and I have a taste of the pressures.  I feel the strain of the unresolved crisis - I know the right course of action but am unable to take it due to spent resources.  Initially put off by the archaic weaponry I expected from screen shots I instead find a mix - you'll have some gunfire but blended with other options.  So utilising everyday tools as lethal objects - as naturally they can be - is perfectly in keeping.  Hit someone with a crowbar and it feels as though it hurt.  The noise meter makes sense - a novel twist for an under utilised sense in turn based strategy.  Yet there is more than this.  There are characters which you will feel affection for and others you'll want rid of - just as in life.  You'll regret bad decisions - neglecting morale too much, spending too many parts on repairing a wall before I upgraded it, allowing too many of my ranks to become infected being mine - and feel a boost when fate smiles on you.\n\nAs far me I realise that all is indeed lost...perhaps time to restart without the option to allow the main character to become infected.  Three days in he picked up the strain and has gobbled meds ever since...to the detriment of colleagues.  Now the landscape seems dry perhaps it is time to start over after all...","March 16","true","18.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Deathcall","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027129179/","90 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPotential, potential, potential.\n\nWhile there's not that much content yet (at least not released to public) and the updates are a bit slower than what I'd like... if you are fan of the zombie genre, this game is for you. It's not the ultimate zombie game, but it's a different take from all the other similar themed products out there.\n\nIf you are into the more psychological aspect of the zombie survival, buy buy buy. That's not to say there isn't combat, but that's not the reason why this game shines.\n\n<< 09/26/14 UPDATE >>\n\nSo the game has hit BETA state and the first patch has been released. I've also become a bit more active in the game's forums and learnt a couple things that I'd like to share with potential buyers.\n\nFirst, the game is meant to be SHORT. In game time is estimated to be about 3 or 4 months. This is worrysome when you consider that it'll probably take you less than 2 months to kill and loot EVERYTHING in the rather small area map you get to explore. This would mean that you'd spend a substantial amount of time either idle or simply dealing with repetitive task like assigning jobs or going to auto-gather locations.\n\nTalking about locations, a lot are on the small size. In most cases, you get to explore an area with only a couple of enterable buildings, which further decreases game time.\n\nCombat is still pretty straight forward and rather easy. My biggest worry hasn't been zombies or hostile survivors, but loot capacity. Once you know where you can find a good armor and a decent weapon (usually melee), you can go there almost straight away and get kitted out. Unless they substantially change how combat behaves (specially remove the player's ability to run behind an enemy and begin combat, thus always getting the first shot), I can't see it become challenging. Even big groups can be split appart by causing noise, which usually leads one or two members straight into your ambush just around the corner.\n\nCan't really comment much on the game's story as of yet because a lot of the script and dialogues have not been implemented or are currently not working, but even though it does seem to be shaping up to be an interesting zombie survival story, the presumed lenght of the campaign worries me greatly.\n\nI'd still recommend the game to any zombie fanatics out there, but be sure to know what kind of game you are getting into.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend you go check out Project Zomboid before you buy this one, because even though the graphics are worse, it's got the survival aspect nailed down MUCH better than Dead State, and survivor AI is also in the works there.\n\nPD: There's no plans of allowing modding to the game either, at least from what I've seen and read.\n\n<< 14/03/15 UPDATE >>\n\nWell, after waiting for a good while for some kind of patch or content update I find myself abandoned by the developers. There hasn't been any major changes since December and from what I've seen, the Devs already said that the planned "expansions" have been called off because the game didn't sell well enough. What does that mean? You'll get a few more patches that fix what should have been functional on release day and perhaps a few more game mechanics that also should have been there on release day. Then, it's game over for Dead State.\n\nI am angry at myself for thinking that this could be any good. I've been following this since Alpha and I should have known that this team could not pull off such an ambitious project. Ambitious because it was something new, not because it was something hard to do. Honestly, with dated graphics and game mechanics that seem out of the 90s, how could this game take them two years to make? And don't get me started on the ending and the plot holes and so much other stuff.\n\nBottom line, Dead State brings nothing new to the party. Combat hasn't been improved. Its boring, repetitive and cumbersome (when it doesn't bug out). The story is lame and the characters - while they have a few moments - are blanks that say their lines (the very few they have) and stand around in your shelter doing absolutely nothing. Music is nothing to be remembered. The rest of the game mechanics - specially the survival aspect - are badly implemented, break immersion or simply make no sense.\n\nWhat more can I say? I've been warning the devs about these faults for a long time on their forums and I was always met with blind optimism or simple denial. Now we are 3 months after release and it's exactly what I thought was going to happen: A disaster.\n\nTo any possible customer:\n\nYou want Combat? > H1Z1 / DayZ Standalone / DayZ Mod\nYou want Survival? > Project Zomboid\nYou want story? > The Walkind Dead by Telltale Games, S1 and S2\n\nChanging my recommendation to a thumb down.

I can only assume it's MIA because now this is Dead State: Reanimated.\n\nSo let me begin by saying that I was an original backer for this game, and I have followed it's development closely.  It showed great promise and intrigue, and there appeared to be a great dynamic between the devs and community.  That was, until Christmas 2014.\n\nIn what was the most apparent and appalling cash-grab I have ever seen by any professional entity, Double Bear Studios knowingly and willingly released this game in an unfinished, buggy, crash-ridden state.  The flame war which ensued between the community and devs is the stuff that legends are made of.\n\nI've hopped back to this game from time-to-time, in the hopes that it was finally completed in a halfway competent matter (again, great premise for a game and I love to support indie studios), but it looks like the project is finally been abandoned by the devs in a semi-working state.  It's still a POS final product, just not as big and stinky of a POS as when it was first released.\n\nPros:\nGreat premise of a game --  Walking Dead meets Jagged Alliance\n\nCons\nEverything Else!\nGame is still buggy as hell.  Don't even think about trying to play it on Windows 10.\nGraphics and music are just okay\nCombat is slow, slow, slooooooooooowwwwwww ... and equally boring.\nAlmost non-existent base building.  Some upgrades are available ... but .... meh.\nScripted locations and drops from scripted enemies.  Zero replay value because of this.  Almost zero percent random.\nA few different endings ... but nothing really that special.  Nothing that would make a player want to go back, retrace his/her almost exact steps again while dealing with the bugs and crashes.\n$30.00!!!!??  $30.00 for this POS buggy, game!??

Instead, spend a few hours reading through the forums starting at Christmas time, 2014.

I havent seen any patches or any significance, no gameplay changes to make it less of a boring farmfest. The balancing is still ridiculous, problems with FPS are still unresolved. Far Cry 4 on max settings no lags, no problem, -> lags galore in Dead State.\n\nThe game's name defines the game state perfectly. Devs show absolutely no desire to fix anything. In fact i should have changes my review ages ago, but i still cradled hope that it will get better. It didnt, despite assistance from Iron Tower team, game is still ♥♥♥♥. Gameplay is boring as ♥♥♥♥ as before, no replayability of any sort.\n\nNo achievements, no development or 'support' of any significance for the game, In fact let me tell you about developers. One of the most hardheaded moderators on the forums ive seen, extremely agressive and unpleasant. The ♥♥♥♥ing head developer seems to have made it his mission to be reviled by community. Well done Mr Mitsoda. And here i was thinking 'the person was lead writer for my favourite game of all times, i better support him'. Brian Mitsoda is an unlikeable ♥♥♥♥ who should be removed from gave development industry. Before i blamed publishers for Troika's demise, now im not so sure. I can totally see the situation where there is inspection of how game is coming along back in 2004. In comes 'lead writer' and after a chat with him, publishers wisely decide to get out of this deal be it competition with hl2 at launch or bugs.\n\nI know that guy is now involved in helping with new Torment and im not happy with it one damn bit.\n\nDo not buy this game unless its on sale, - on oversaturated with zombie games market with BETTER games available for cRPG or management as alternatives there is absolutely no reason to get this game.\n\nI give it 4/10. Rushed cashgrab with no support by scumbag developers. If anyone purchased the game based on my old review during BETA which seemed to be very early version of what can be an incredible game, i am sincerely sorry. Please accept my humble apologies.\n\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nOld Review (was back when there looked like game will be in 1year + more dev time).\nWhile having absolutely ♥♥♥♥ graphics and sort of boring at times gameplay, this is a real gem of a game. With its believable characters and novelty shelter management of resources, people and time.\n\nThere is innovation in this game, something a lot of AAA titles do not have. It also has a soul. A bug ridden unfinished and poorly balances/optimised soul at that, but a charming one none the less.\n\nThis is not just 'another zombie game' hell, zombies arent even that relevant here at all. They stop being a threat 1-2 weeks into the game. With frequent patches and team hard working to make this game better then it is, it has potential to become a great addition to any rpg lover collection or just anyone with great taste of games.\n\nNow, unfortunately, because of many flaws of the game, right now it can get only 7/10. But it has the potential to be an easy 9/10.\n\nIf you want more creative, well conceived games with unique gameplay features, support the developer and buy the game. You definitely get your moneys worth.","October 20, 2014","false","147.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you're in the same group as I am, and hearing those words makes you go "OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG", then the game was made specifically for you in mind.\n\nThis is and indie labor of love devoted to a very specific game mechanics that lots of old school gamers like myself find lacking in todays "PEW PEW" marketplace. People in that group probably know who they are and can accept the quibbles of low budget games like this so long as the broad strokes work, and they do for the most part.\n\nLike many criticisms have likely pointed out, the game is definitely unintuitive in certain areas, inventory management being the one that immediately springs to mind. However, in fairness, many of the criticisms I see people saying certain things aren't in game when in fact they are, such as Group inventory management at base, attacking diagonally (must have a two handed weapon). However these features can be lost in the somewhat clunky interface.\n\n\nBasically, the idea of an old school base management turn based RPG in a zombie holocaust either sells you on it's own, or it doesn't. If that premise whets your whistle, you'll likely be able to look past some of the quibbles of indie game design in favor what they did right, which is quite a lot. You'd also be able to look past the unfortunate release timing of the game which puts in smack dab in the middle of zombie mania in pop culture, when in fact at it's inception that would have made it a much more original concept.","December 6, 2014","true","17.0"," 47 of 96 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","47","96","0","0"

As the game progresses of course zombies became less and less of a problem, and different human groups became the problems, including the police, army, bikers and survivalist groups that just didn't like the look of me and  my raiding errrrr hunting party.\n\nIf what you are looking for is a game with:\n\na) zombies (And angry barely surviving humans)\nb) fortifying your base (Watchtower, stone fence, garage, garden, shooting range, etc)\nc) medium level Role play (Most role play actions are done just at the start of each day, and can range from your people asking you for a day off because they feel ill, or asking for particular items out in the world, or a crisis event which may be someone murdered another person in the group)\nd) exploration (The map has a bunch of stops with maps of varying sizes)","December 5, 2014","true","871.7"," 46 of 94 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","46","94","0","3"

The Zombie Apocalypse meets the narrative-driven styling (and structure) of the classic Infinity Engine games. If you like strategy RPGs, choice-driven narrative, and/or the setting, then this game is well-worth your time.\n\nUpdate 06/10/15:\n\nI spent a lot time with the game in beta and a bit at launch, but held off playing the game all the way thorugh because every crowdfunded game needs a while to work out the kinks. The wait was well worth it. Double Bear released a "Reanimated" edition with a slew of new content to go along with their latest patch. The game I played was a mix between a "Tactics" game, Suikoden, and your standard zombie apocalypse fare.\n\nWhat Dead State offers which is unique is the chance to take on the zombie apocalypse on a large scale. It is not a tightly narrative experience like The Walking Dead or an action/survival horror game like Resident Evil. Here, you get to do the stuff they do in the movies or on TV - gather survivors, build a safe place, manage your society, and explore out into the world in order to scavenge, find out what's going on, and find something that lets you hope for a better tomorrow. The game plays out on a large canvas.\n\nIf you are a RPG fan and/or like zombie stories, then this is a "must" purchase for you. It is also a *very* long game with different ending conditions depending on how you traverse the storyline. There are various modes (difficulty, infection levels, etc.) that offer solid replay value.

Didn't sleep a wink, Elaine was on the stairwell sobbing again setting everyone on edge. Doug's been needling me to take her on a scavenge and leave her gutshot out by the old church. He figures it will draw them out as we slip in the back, given it was an emergency shelter before it was overrun. A lot of provisions in there Doug says, and with Elaine gone, one less mouth to feed means one more meal for me. But I doubt Davis would buy it, that wily cripple likes to remind us of how he took us in. And now the bleeding heart's handing over the last of our antibiotics to some Mexican kid with the bite. I swear to the God that abandoned us, I'd walk down the halls putting a bullet in each of them as they slept if it weren't for the fact that the fence has a hole you could fit a bus through and the noise would bring them in from three counties. Now isn't the time for division. No one survives out here on their own; looters, the dead, or Coyotes, one of them will find you. Make enough noise like the Sheriff did, and maybe it'll be all three.\nSo I hunker down, listen to Elaine bleat and I earn my keep... bushwhacking and scavenging, two or three times more than most. And for what? Another week of waiting to die chewing half rations of Mr Munchie bars and mouldy fruit.\nI guess it ain't all bad.

The game's core is great, the concept is spot on, and Turned based strategy is, in my opinion, the best mechanical base for a zombie game. The final product isn't as good as I hoped it would be when I first read about it two years ago. But I still think the released game is enjoyable, if short of the potential the setting and style could have provided.\n\nIssues\nDead State uses the Torque engine just like Age of Decadence, its not that pretty. Better than 2d pixels but it also lacks the "retro charm" some pixel games capture.\n\nThere is very little scripted content like what is found in Age of Decadence, I enjoyed that content in AOD and wish some of these engine utilizations made it into Dead State.\n\nIts psuedo open world, you really have no choice in where you go or stay only in the order of actions. This is the biggest issue I have with game. There is very little emergent content, and NPC interactions are very limited. Its either friendly will join you, or shoot first ask questions later. If you shoot first you make everyone sad though.\n\nUI is clunky and this is a title you should read the manual for, otherwise you will be complaining about follower item management in the forums.\n\nThe good\n\nIts a zombie tbs RPG!\n\nClassic zombies, ie walking dead style. No sci-fi exploding, mutuant jumping zombies. Could use more of them on screen at once IMO.\n\nAll the classic themes are present. Gather supplies, fix up your shelter, defend against zombies and bandits, or be a bandit.\n\nGood selection of weapons, items, skills, upgrades, etc. You can build a self sustaining fortress, but you can't leave and live in a house of your choosing.\n\nThis is a great base and I'm excited to see what/when mods get ahold of it.","December 7, 2014","true","27.0"," 68 of 139 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","68","139","0","0"

I have been waiting for a turnbased zombie rpg with base building most of my life.  Overall the game fulfills this dream.  All it needs to be perfect is a sandbox mode for after you've played through the story several times and seen all the endings.  The devs have stated they may add that some day.\n\nThe writing and characters are the best I have seen in a long time.  This is due to the writing talent and experience the devs bring.  The head dev is Brian Mitsoda, the head writer for Vampire: Bloodlines.  His wife, Annie VanderMeer Mitsoda of Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir, also contributed her writing talent.\n\nSome may find the combat simplistic, but this game is an rpg, not a strategy game and the combat is no simpler than a classic rpg like Baldur's Gate.  There is enough variety in weapons, armor, and special gear to keep combat interesting and allow for a variety of tactics.  Especially with the inclusion of the noise mechanic that attracts zombies.\n\nOther reviews may mention bugs, and when it was first released it had a few major ones.  However they have been resolved and the remaining ones can sometimes be annoying but there is nothing game stopping.  The devs work hard to fix them and have released several patches since release.\n\nConsidering they raised just over 300,000 on kickstarter, I think it is amazing what they pulled off.  I can only imagine what they could have done with the millions other rpgs had raised on kickstarter.\n\nSo in summary, if you like classic turn based rpgs with some base building added in, you should like Dead State.","December 21, 2014","true","64.5"," 26 of 54 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","26","54","0","45"

In that time, it has grown and evolved immensely.  If you've played games such as Fallout 1-2. Brotherhood of Steel, or the Final Fantasy Tactics games, or even any of the X-COM franchise, new or old, the isometric view and turn based combat will be familiar and nostalgic.\n\nThe game is not a graphical powerhouse, and was never intended as such, it is much more focused on the story, on the myriad and drastically varied group of people thrust together into a desperate survival situation.\n\nEvery one of the more then 40 characters is unique, from the first handful you start out with to the dozens more you can find and recruit over time, they each have their own desires, demands, and (in some cases) psychosis.\n\nThe zombies, while an ever present obstacle, aren't the real threat, but then, they really never are.  From as far back as the first forays into the genre, (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, etc,) the zombies are a foe, but not the major threat.  The major threat is, as always, other people.  The dead are easy to predict, simple and direct.  Your living foes, the duplicitious, under handed, cruel, desperate or just good old fashioned bat crap crazy other survivors of this world of central Texas are where the real challenge lays.  They are, by their very nature, completely unpredictable, and profoundly deadly.\n\nOver all, this game, while it certainly does have its rough spots, is absolutely worth the money.  The dedication and detail that the development team has put into this title shows through any of the realtively minor remaining bugs, and will likely provide many hours of enjoyment.","December 24, 2014","true","144.6"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","20","42","0","0"

So naturally I was very interested in Dead State and followed its development for some time (seems like a really long time).  I didn't actually buy it and begin playing until update 3. I really wanted to wait until release but curiosity got the best of me.\n\nThere aren't a whole lot of games that do turn based isometric combat really well.  Dead State doesn't do anything new in that regard either, in fact the combat, even though it can be quite a challenge until you get decent armor, weapons and skills it is really very simple. There is no cover, crouch, stealth or very many combat options at all. But it still manages to be very engaging and fun.  With that said it really isn’t the combat that make this game so engrossing.\n\nDead State does a great job of drawing you into the world it’s created.  You need to struggle to survive. You need to struggle to keep your base running. You need to struggle to get along with your ever growing group of personalities, oops I meant fellow survivors.  You’re in charge but you’re challenged to stay in charge.  You have to choose whether to allow in, or to keep some useful troublemakers.  Word of warning some people might not be what they seem to be!\n\nAs the game has developed through various updates; it’s now on update 5.5, the dialog has gotten a little more polish. It is fairly deep as it is but it could be deeper, just a slight knock in that department. The stories are compelling but a little shallow. There is plenty to do at the base, but also not much to do at the base at the same time. I know that’s confusing let me explain.\n\nThe game progresses at the close of each day, sort of a big "end of turn".  Every day you set up your job assignments and go out into the word to scavenge. Back at base after you talk to your fellow survivors, there a few lines of dialog and dialog choices and that’s pretty much it. So even though you begin to care about some of your survivors and your base there really isn’t any way to satisfyingly interact with your base or fellow survivors.\n\nIn closing what you have here is a very solid good time playing in a zombie apocalypse.  It isn’t very deep but it is still very satisfying and it will eat up a big chunk of your time as you get into that, "well let me just see what happens tomorrow" (or the just one more turn) mindset\n\nOverall I’d rate it a solid 7.5 out of 10, it loses points because its combat is somewhat primitive and the stories inside your home community are a little shallow.\n\nThis game is well worth the cost and well worth your time if you are at all interested it this genre, in other words, BUY IT! PLAY IT! I doubt you’ll regret it!\n","November 28, 2014","true","509.8"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","18","38","0","0"

If you never played a turn based tactical rpg before, just try it. What is there to lose? If you already did, great!\n\nWhen it comes to turn based tactical rpg's, I have played a lot of them. We all agree we loved Jagged alliance 2, but all others have been received with mixed feelings. Not many of them could break out of the standard formula of a squad of six, besides silent storm, the setting was always more or less the same.\n\nThis game doesn't feel like jagged alliance at all and that makes it so great! The setting is very, very well chosen. In a post apocalyptic world money becomes unimportant, so you have to start building yourself. The combat system is primitive, but handles very nicely.\n\nAlso, living people and zombies live side by side. Every now and then that makes for interesting combat situations. Don't let knocked out foes lie around when zombies still roam the combat area!\n\nOn top of that, a lot of what you will be doing is managing. Your team will consume food, gasoline, antibiotics and so on. They will not all like eachother and you will sometimes fail.\n\nPersonally, I think the game has a lot of potential of becoming a new benchmark and making the genre surpass its never found glory.

(8/10)\nIt has right the amount of progress to keep you playing, looting and dealing with moral choices...\nBut it has some major issues too:\n\n1) You can stalk up to enemies in realtime and most of the time make the first blow. BUT the pathfinding Ai is really bad for your team (not the selected player that one is good). (especially with 4 ppl in the party) So you end up with one to two ppl next to the enemy and 2 ppl more than one round away.\nYou can't do that in Turn based mode, cause the enemy instantly knows you are sneaking up to them even if they didnt see you comming.\n\n2) You can not pause the game to make changes or give orders. That wouldn't be bad, if the turn based mode would not just end after no one is close by. (You see someone is comming, hit Space Key and want to reload before the actual combat begins. Yea.. right.. damn picked the wronge Character, Space again.. realtime continues.. bam they see you.. combat starts... all weapons shot empty -.- )\nHaving a complete Party movement without going to realtime would be great. (or a Pause mode with beeing able to give orders)\n\n3) Loads. Having loot that has weight is a nice game mechanic and (Warning potential Spoiler:) later when you get to use a car, you can load stuff into it. All nice, but im missing the possibility to have additional Horses or a Trailer for your car (cause it can only hold 200pnds of loot... even a Fiat 500 can pack more Stuff)\nAnd you must unload the car by hand. (every Character has the option to choose the whole inventory and move it to the shelter stash. But the car is no Character so you have to unload the car into your player char inventory and after that you can move it into the stash.\n\n4) Sorting of the Task Board.... it just does what it wants, after you have changed one task.\nSorty by Job... Change Char XY from No Job to Guard Duty... and complete chaos. (if its a problem with the code.. just don't sort after a change)\n\n5) Science Skill... i played now for 30+h and I only got one char in my group with science above 6... but he has NO mechanics skill.. so i can't build armor -.- (because it needs Science to research in the workshop but you need atleast 1 point in Mechanics to unlock the Workshopmenue in wich you can resarch it)\n\nIf there are coming more Patches and new content, this game will be awsome.\nUntil then its great, and if you see it in a sale.. buy it.\n\n(Maybee you noticed, im no native speaker, so please forgive me my mistakes)\n","December 22, 2014","true","31.9"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","14","30","0","0"

Best Christmas ever.  10/10 Would apocalypse again.\n\nSome crashing, but generally speaking just hitting quick save before changing zones made it a minor irritation.  Had the same trouble in Fallout back in the day.  It's almost nostalgic crashing, in a way.  Other than that, no major bugs for me to date.  For a more serious review, I give it a solid 7-8/10.  Graphics are reasonable, challenge level is reasonable so far, and the premise and execution are interesting.  No major UI irritations.   Story and character interactions are decent.  All in all it's a phenomenal concept that I can't believe hadn't been done in this form before.  If you like X-Com type turn based combat, it's a great entry in that genre.  If that's not really your bag, it's probably more of the 7/10 I gave it above.

It's been a rocky launch technically.They probably rushed it a bit too fast, but it's pretty solid. If you have the patience to put up with bugs and glitches you will find a good game here. The developer seems intent on stabilizing the game in that regard.\n\nIt's an interesting mix of survivalist group management and turn based tactical resolution. The combat AI is fairly linear (You aggro zombies and looters and they attack), but that works fine for this genre. My biggest complaint is that gun combat mechanics are VERY weak once you start fighting militia and rogue soldiers. It's the exact same run-n-gun AI from the early game except these guys have assault rifles, body armor, grenades, and a firm desire to expend all that in killing you.  Consider carefully before starting a campaign in Ironman mode.  The game keeps you on rails to start with limited options, but that opens up as you go.\n\nFor me the game's become more rewarding the longer I've played.

I am not going to list all, as there are forums for these. but I will go through some bugs that ruined my experience below.\n\nGood sides,\nTurn based, tactical combat (not great as there is not cover system etc, but decent)\nSurvival (in the first few weeks you really have to fight for each chocolate bar and manage parts and morale) later on they become irrelevant.\nopen world and a big map.\n\nGraphics\nGraphics are old but i like it anyway, I am not after shiny textures. Gameplay matters for me.\n\nAudio\nAudio is unfortunately quite poor as music variety is quite limited and static, and there is almost no voice in the game. Characters on levels communicate with subtitles over their heads, which you can easily miss if you are looking elsewhere. There is no message log (like in fallout). There is a combat log which could use some improvement. Sounds effects are below decent.\n\nGameplay.\nPathfinding and AI in general is terrible. My characters kept sliding to their destination often through walls. Enemies can also sometimes shoot through obstacles. Enemies can knock down your entire squad without a direct line of sight, using a single granade. (maybe they have thermal vision, which isnt implemented in the game :)  )\nInterface could really use some polish. there is almost no info on statuses, just an icon which doesnt tell you if that character has reduced strength or perception, etc...\nArmor in late game is too strong both for you and your enemies. Assault rifles can have problems without critical hits. Zombies are only a threat during first weeks, later on they become a joke, which destroys the mood for a zombie game.\n\nMinor bugs are somewhat ok.\nHowever, after hours of battling 10+ soldiers/mercs with full armor and assault rifles (to combat is slow, which I like as it is expected in such a genre), to crash to desktop on the last soldier is not fun. dont know about others but I have had so many CTDs. (dont tell me to update my graphics driver, or restart my computer)\n\nThe quests are also quite poorly made in the sense that the choice you make earlier is not reflected to the next day and people in the shelter complain (or are sick) as if you made the other choice in the crisis event a few days ago. quests dont get ticked off, or people in shelter keep saying the same things over and over.\n\nThe game is based Looting and keeping your people safe/well fed/ healthy. However in order to loot large maps I had to return to them 10 times.\n\nI dont want to sound so harsh (although I probably did with all the critism). it is  a small company and I appreciate that they try to bring old turn /squad based RPG back to life.  it was just an unfinished product with a lot of bugs released earlier than it should have been. if they lack manpower, they should have waited a bit more to polish the game.","January 10, 2015","false","72.5"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","13","28","2","0"

At it's heart, it's a fantastic game idea which I can't put down.\n\nTrying to coordinate the daily run(s) to grab supplies and, more than likely, get hurt a lot by both the undead and the living whilst trying to unearth valuable supplies, antibiotics and gas in particular, whilst also ensuring that you've got the right people doing the right jobs to upgrade your base is highly engaging.

Barely any music to speak of and no voiced characters (which I sometimes see as appropriate, but this game needs anything to liven up the dull repetitive dialog it has).\n- Combat is supposedly like X Com or similar. It *wants* to be like that. But then it decides to have inconsistent rules, unclear directions, and a ridiculous scarcity of options or depth.\n- It's suggested that the Base building mechanic might function like that in State of Decay. No. The big empty building you're given remains as such.\n- I will readily accept that games needn't look good.

It cuts some corners, it's not as polished as the bigger titles. Can you live with that? If yes, then it's a little gem of a game.\n\nIt's a turn-based zombie apocalypse fallout-esque "loot the world" RPG. Like scavenging? Like old-school "dumb slow" zombies? Like exploring stuff and building up your home camp? This is it.\n\nAt the moment of this writting, be aware that there are still quite a few bugs in the game, but most of them are minor or can be overlooked and the game is still enjoyable. However, the devs have been very visible and present and it's obvious they are working on those right now; expect many patches in the weeks to come.\n\nIt's not a tactical combat game; the combat is not as integrated as some dedicated game like X-Com. Don't go in expecting a ton of tactical combat options, as almost everything is organic, and battle is closer to chess than an actual firefight. Movement and positioning are as important as the type of equipment you bring to the table, and personally I like it that way; there's no artificial game effects, everything is part of the way you handle your squad. Getting swarmed by zombies? Pull back and use a choke point. Getting mowed down by human enemies with guns? Move behind cover and force them to come into melee range, or pull them into the nearby pack of zombies, etc.\n\nThe rest of the game contains a lot of dialogue and decision-making. Dealing with your ever-growing pack of survivors keeps you on edge, as you never know what kind of event is going to pop up each day, which keeps the world interesting. Exploring the map and finding a new zone full of goodies to bring back to your base camp is an awesome feeling, like finding a treasure room each time, and random encounters run the gamut from new allies to just a few random zombies to bandit ambushes.\n\nThe maps were nicely crafted, and have this sense of "events past", you can almost read the story of what transpired at the location you are visiting, with the crashed cars and the blood streaks left by the zombies that must have dragged the screaming occupants out, etc.\n\nAll in all, a nice game that will only get better as the devs fix the bugs. Its premise is also quite unique, and I'm giving this 100% of my support, as I want more games of this type to exist.","December 6, 2014","true","54.2"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

All the pieces are there, but the fun seems just out of reach. Interface awkwardness is one of the biggest hindrances in the game. The story and the feel of the game are great and there is massive potential here, but the devs really need to make a few improvements to make the game more accessable and therefore more fun.\n\nI almost didn't want to recommend this, because that's like giving the devs permission to leave this game in what I have to say is an unfinished state, despite the fact that it's been 'released'. I want so much to immerse myself in the game, but frustrating bugs and poorly designed mechanics keep pulling me back out. In short, this game really lacks the refinement needed to call it 'released'. To be clear, I am NOT comparing this to modern AAA titles, in fact I play mostly indie games, but this game still needs some love to be not held back by design issues.\n\nYou can expect a classic Fallout-esque RPG experience, with sadly few interface improvements over those older generations of games. The biggest dissapointment is that the crafting and base improvement mechanics seem so thus far to be completely on-rails and thus much less engaging or fun than they could be. This style of combat system has also come very far since those days, yet this game encorporates none of those advances.\n\nIf this was a base 100 rating system and not yes/no, I'd probably give it 72/100.","December 25, 2014","true","16.3"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

Along with adding some new challanges such as the moral feature, finding an amenity such as toilet paper never seemed like a luxury until put into the context of the game setting. The turn-based  combat system is easy to pickup and overal works very well. Also the weapons themselfs i feel all have advantages and disadvantages which could really change your play style. You need to decide if you use a gun you risk alerting looters or zombies and with a heavy weapon such as a sledgehammer you get higher damage but as i have noticed you miss the enemy alot more(it was literally the death of my character when i missed)\n\nOne of the things that has been touched on in other reviews is the expectations of the game. I personally expected a freeform game where i could just go out and do my own thing, although i do feel an aspect of that it also feels guided in a way.

But this title has a lot of originality and potential. The foremost I'd like to point out is the leveling system. The food and resources you bring into your shelter count as experience gained. So leveling is dependant on your ability to obtain what the shelter needs to survive instead of just grinding XP on zombies and looters which is very refreshing after years of playing rpg's. The characters you can interact with feel alive and well written. Which makes me excited for when we start to see more dialogue interaction added to the game.\n\nI preordered this game well over a year ago, and while this game has taken a long time to get to beta; In my own opinion it was well worth the wait. Not all of the shelter upgrades work yet, and I've only run into one bug that has caused trouble during gameplay which is when the camera gets stuck outside of the border of an area. The game seems to run remarkably stable, as I've had only one crash after 14 hours of play. My only real gripe isn't a bug, but a current feature in the game. If you don't return to the shelter before midnight, the survivors will supposedly give up on you and it's an instant game over. This doesn't feel very realistic, and should be changed.\n\nThat said, this game is hardly feature complete. This is an early beta so if you buy, that's what you should expect. I have had a blast playing so far. I like the combat; I like the leveling system, and the writing is good in my own opinion. I expect a lot from this game in the future, and I'll keep on playing it as updates come out.\n","September 11, 2014","true","24.9"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

The idea of a turn based ZRPG with survival and base building and management elements really intrigued me!  Think UFO: Enemy Unknown with zombies!\n\nPlease be aware - you are NOT buying a demo!  This EA release was a promise by Doublebear to it's backers that an early access demo\beta would be released.  I guess that it makes  business sense to put it up for preorder at the same time!   Please ignore the stupid "devs cashing in" comments on the Steam forums - IMO, they are most certainly not!  The project lead (Brian Mitsoda) has a long history in game development (my favourite being Vampire: Bloodlines).  My impression of these guys?  They're in it for the love of making the game, not to rip their customers off!  Please note - I'm definitely not a fanboy!\n\nThere are some issues with this build.  Combat is grid based, and sometimes (more often that not, let's be honest), it's impossible to attack a mob on a diagonal.  Also, due to the early nature of the build, most of the base building features have been disabled.  There are also some enhancements that should be implemented (e.g. being able to put your party into "overwatch" mode, and and the ability to look through windows!).\n\nAll that aside though, would I recommend this game?  Yes!   Even this early build shows a lot of promise.  But if you're the impatient sort, then I'd suggest waiting a while until the game's been cooked a bit longer.  You could probably derive a few hours play out of the current build, but it'll leave you wanting more!

So far I must say it is a good effort but beside that it should still be in early access, I don't think it is priced properly. I am all about helping indie devs but for $29.99 I would expect something better. This game is lacking in most areas. To name a few:\n\n1. I did not find a way to remap controls. WASD it is... I guess.\n2. Managing your base and the interface choices the devs made are just non intuitive, and cumbersome. You need to walk to certain rooms just to access a certain menu i.e. the job board. Why? How is this a good choice from the player's perspective? There are many great examples out there. Why not just copy one?\n3. The tactical part is weak compared to Jagged Alliance or other turn based games. Run to close distance, shoot, or smash, repeat... No hiding, no sneaking, no crouching, no aiming. Really weak...\n4. Player and NPC skills are overly simplified.\n5. Tactical maps are very small.\n\nThe good:\n1. The only zombie turn based out there right now. At least I am not aware of another one.\n2. Graphics are not bad for an indie game.\n3. I like the way survival is managed. You need to keep scavenging, manage morale, etc. I find this original.\n\nOverall... I still can't recommend this at full price. I would say this is a good $15-20 game. Not $29.99!

They released the game far too early in order to grab a slice of the Christmas sales.\n\nThe game is playable in it's current state, but it still feels a lot like playing a beta. Lots of graphical glitches, lots of UI anomolies (even during character creation), maps that involve stairs are still very buggy.\n\nThe game itself sees you as a survivor joining a survivors commune and attempting to...well...survive. You can upgrade various rooms in your base to provide medical facilities etc, but they haven't bothered to create a seperate graphic for the room before and after the facilities creation. So on day one the base looks exactly the same as it will once you've fully upgraded it.\n\nThe game is limited in that there are a finite number of areas, and once you've fully looted an area there is no reason to go back to it. Zombies don't respawn and while there are some random encounters they are still very buggy, areas are reused and once you've visited one area type and looted it, any subsequent encounters that use that area type spawn fully looted so are pointless (you get no "XP" for kills).\n\nI've played through this game 4 times now, and have always hit a game breaking bug and stopped. Why do I recommend this game then? I'm still holding on to hope that they keep working on it and get it properly release ready, it has a lot of potential.","February 14, 2014","true","182.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

I really started out _wanting_ to like this game; feeling the need to play a good RTS game for quite some time and was left disappointed.\n\nThe Interface is, on its surface, intuitive-looking but is in reality quite difficult to use. As an example, when your main character is fatigued, it is not recommended they be used for 12 hours due to a 25% penalty to dodge and accuracy. There is no way for you to use a different survivor to go on a mission for supplies, etc. The game's "passing time" (fast-forwarding time whilst in the shelter) doesn't seem to affect this.\n\nCombat is awkward, clumsy and frustrating. Reloading takes too many action points on the occasion where you're desperate enough to use a gun and as for melee combat: good luck. 80% of the time your character fails to connect with your victim leaving you swinging wildly at your attacker/victim and burning up precious action points which could have been spent healing yourself/party member if you're lucky enough to find bandages. On the opposite end of combat, your attacker/victim is almost guaranteed to hit you. You'll spend much of your time on a losing battle regardless of what weapon you're carrying. I do like the fact the melee weapons need to be at an adjacent square in order to attack but getting within range early on is difficult due to no armour, limited action points for attacking and not really having faith your attack effort will pay out at all. I once was in a combat situation where I was attacking 3 or 4 times a turn and ended up missing 100% of the time for *5 turns!* Needless to say I loaded from an earlier save and avoided the area all together.\n\nParty member's stand idly whilst attackers approach you without so much as mentioning you're about to be attacked.\n\nRandom encounters are a literal roll of the dice. You might find yourself equally matched (yet still using the awkward combat system) or completely outnumbered/overpowered and may as well load from an earlier save. I've gotten into the habit of saving just prior to venturing out into the world due to the complete randomness of the encounters.\n\nThe games manual touts not being able to gain experience by simply killing zombies or using any other skills directly. The way you actually level up your characters is by assigning them tasks on the job board or picking up enough of X item to meet the needs of the various types of goals. While this might seem like a good idea in theory (an interesting way to make the player level up and gain skill) it falls short due to the items being discovered are left to random change when your "zone" seed is generated. This makes gaining skill points feel like a long-dragging chore instead of a rewarding experience. Doubly so if you cannot guarantee your party members are going to be in fighting shape for their randomness that is the combat system.\n\nOverall DoubleBear has done a pretty good job but there are some things that indeed need tweaking. The combat system is fun when you're able to actually affect the outcome of the situation but for the time being it seems to be completely random and demoralizing.\n","December 14, 2014","true","10.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It is free roam in the area until u come into combat which then turns to turn based combat with the traditonal grid system, and spend Ap points to move and use actions.

Although still in alpha and still quite a few bugs and not to much content, this game has very good potential to be a great turn based strategy thats not the traditonal swords and shields.

Quicksave will be your best friend.\n\nIt would be nice if they added another few or even another 7 days to the early access, but it's good to play through here and there to see what's changed with the updates. Will take about 4-5 hours to beat in its current state (doing everything right) but it used to take a bit more as some areas have been consolidated and / or removed. There are now customizable characters and random encounters that can vary the game time depending on how you roll your character. You'll probably wanna play through again just to perfect your interactions with characters to reach that kind of game time.\n\nSome of what I've said will only be relevant for now, the next update could change a few more things, but the core of the game is damn solid and I can't wait until it's finished.","May 14, 2014","true","33.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Clawdius/recommended/239840/","Clawdius","Clawdius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Clawdius/","311 products in account","Updated 1/24/2015:\nTL;DR: Dead State remains quite combat focused, and while there is a lot of interaction to be had much of it may not be seen in a single play through the game. For a strategy RPG created on such a limited budget by a small team I consider it to be an entertaining experience that was well worth my time and money, and look forward to seeing what Doublebear does in the future.\n\nDead State remains an entertaining experience, but although it is released it still has some balance issues. Late game there is practically no reason to use the apocalypse armor over the Advanced Tactical Vest, which is a required component of the apocalypse armor. Combat can be rather enjoyable, but for experienced players it may be too easy. That being said, I've seen numerous complaints on the forums that it was too difficult, so I suppose they've struck a reasonable balance. I'm looking forward to the release of Iron Man modes, and although the game has passed the 1.0 mark Doublebear continues to flesh out the experience and address issues in the game itself.\n\nIf you're new to the strategy RPG genre and are looking for an experience that can be completed without a lot of combat this is probably not that title. Conversely, if you're adept at playing Strategy RPGs and want consistent end game challenges, this is also not that title. Doublebear has managed to create a fairly engaging game that revolves around both combat and crisis events and ally management. Unfortunately for the experienced player, they may never lose any ally and therefore won't have a problem getting so much morale that they never experience the darker aspects of the title. Meanwhile those who aren't able to manage the combat portion of the game may well lose so many allies that they have a hard time keeping allies.\n\nI enjoy Brian Mitsoda's writing style, and overall I found Dead State to be a very entertaining experience. That being said\n\n\n\nDead State is shaping up to be a really enjoyable zombie survival RPG, and while it has tactical combat, the primary emphasis is going to be on the survivors and their personalities. Making sure that everyone has some semblance of normalcy in their otherwise upended lives and navigating the perils of the post-disaster world will eventually entail a lot of the experience. As the game stands, a lot of it is about the combat. It makes sense that they would want to expose the most replayable aspect of the game and get users opinions on it, and while it does strongly resemble the Age of Decadence on which the game has been built AoD has varied enough options for tactical combat that Dead State has a solid foundation on which to build in that regard.\n\nAs of right now (6/29/2014), the first seven days is all that is open to players for exploration and testing, but in the not so distant future plans are to open up more content for eager fans who want more. While I have only played through the first seven days twice I am likely to wait on that update before I dive back into Dead State. While the combat and potential choices in the first seven days is appealing, I'm rather more interested in how the game unfolds with regards to various factions and additional allies. At the end of the day, the first seven days is a fun tactical experience released to acquire feedback on aspects of the game that are still able to be changed. The game will revolve largely around the shelter and keeping your survivors from killing one another or hating your leadership enough to fracture your group into factions that each pursue their own agendas.\n\nIf everything unfolds in the direction it seems to be heading, you could potentially apply a variety of the shelter aspects to another type of disaster and the transition from zombie apocalypse to plague or famine or the destabilization of the magnetic poles and ensuing havoc EM radiation would have on unshielded electronics and minus the scavanging expeditions where you had to bludgeon people to death with a baseball bat things could feasibly progress in a similar fashion.","June 29, 2014","true","209.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

So from me it’s a definite yes.\nHappy skull cracking guys.","August 28, 2014","true","174.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeriostm/recommended/239840/","cheeriostm","CheeriosTM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeriostm/","678 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAwesome game so far. As of this review, the game has been released only the day before, and is only the demo of the first 7 days. The premise is fairly simple: basically, hoarde loot from missions on an overview map while also assigning jobs and tasks to npcs in your bases, which includes being able to take them on missions with you. Pretty good concept, and definitely fills a niche and itches a scratch of building a defense against zombies and hoarding loot [food, weapons, ammo, etc.]\n\nApproximately a 7.5/10 at the moment, I'd live to give it an 8 or 9 but it could use more polish and so far its in early access beta with a limit on game time. At present, it is really good, but I definitely look forward to the finished product.","February 15, 2014","true","41.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

People claiming to have finished it in 40 minutes are either lying, or just rested or rushed through content every day without exploring anything. A single combat can last for 10 minutes or more.\n\nThe game is not finished yet, being early access, and it does have some bugs. I had about 5-6 crashes, and got stuck in combat once. It also lacks a lot of functions, that will be implemented later, like character creation.\n\nThe game puts you in a situation, where you, after surviving a plane-crash, becomes the leader of a small group of people, trying to survive during a zombie-apocalypse. You have a homebase that can be upgraded (but a lot of this is not available yet, I could only fix the fence and the well in this version of the game), and in order to get building materials, food, weapons, and other stuff essential for survival, you have to explore locations like a shopping mall, a church, a camping site and other places in your surroundings.\n\nThere's a lot of tension when exploring, death can be waiting around every corner, in the form of zombies, or armed and hostile looters. A careful approach is required, sneaking up on zombies, taking them out one by one, or avoiding them. It's also important to be quiet, guns are very effective, but the sound will attract more undead.\n\nThere are interesting things to discover (when exploring), and the world doesn't feel copy-pasted. Maybe you encounter a man who has barricaded himself inside his house, writing warnings "trespassers will get shot" on the wall, or maybe in a bathroom, you find a woman who's commided siucide. Little things perhaps, but it makes exploration much more rewarding.\n\nCombat is turnbased and works well, it's challenging, and your decisions is usually what determines how well you perform, not\nblind luck. Most weapons have different types of attacks, and can cause status effects like bleeding or dizzyness. If someone dies they stay dead (or gets up as a zombie if bitten), this is not the kind of game where everyone gets up after every battle and regenerates their health instantly.\n\nIn your homebase, you can assign different jobs for the other people in your group (like repairing something, or making molotov coctails).\nYou can also have dialogues with them, and depending on how you treat them (will you be kind, threatening, or sarcastic for example) you will build different relationships with them, that will have consequences later on, according to the developers. How well this will work is impossible to tell from the EA-version though.\nWriting is good for the most part, except a few awkward lines here and there.\n\nThere isn't much handholding in this game, I personally like this, but some people will no doubt get frustrated, you do however get some directions, about where to go and what to do, when you talk to the other survivors.\n\nI also strongly recommend everyone to read the manual before playing (there is a link to it on the Steam-forums),\nthis way, a lot of frustration will be avoided. It's often difficult to figure out how to do stuff (like trading items between characters, or leaving a location) due to lack of tooltips, and a UI where some information can be difficult to spot, like when the travel button lights up.\n\nThe visuals are good enough for me, but, of course, can't compete with AAA-titles. Animations and character models are not very good, but environments looks better. Music is great however, and enhances the mood of the game.\n\nI really liked this early version of the game, it does have the potential to become a great survival-rpg, if the full release lives up to this remains to be seen, but so far so good. Recommended to people who likes challenging old-school rpgs, where a careful and tactical approach is required, not recommended to people who require non-stop action, AAA-graphics, and quest-arrows.\n\n","February 15, 2014","true","70.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I only put a thumbs up as steam wouldn't let me just skip the thumbs review. I think others should give a chance.\n\nSome thoughts though. Just my experience as a person who enjoys games and as a person who designs games as well. Take them for what they are : opinion.\n\nUI - clunky. Should be intuitive, at the beginning of the game it says to go in some directory find some manual that's more in depth. What putting a tab in the game was too much trouble?\n\nReloading a gun - I don't even know how to do this. I thought it would be obvious like drag the correct ammo type on a gun. I have a snubnose .38, it says it takes .38 ammo - I think I should be able to A) right click or whatever and say load ammo B) drag and drop ammo on it C) I don't know, something else.\n\nInstead I have no idea. Someone saying "Well you need to read the manual" How about a nice cup of shut the hell up. Reallly.\n\nI'm not asking for a hand holding - I hate that. I would at least like some idea of how the hell you are supposed to something basic like that.\n\nCombat - clunky. It's trying to be xcom but it's not. The presentation of showing a zombie right next to you, and shows you swinging your axe/club/wrench etc and it goes right through and says "miss" is just poorly presented.  It's not that I know you can miss, like in real life it's the way its presented. Feels not fun.\n\nControls are semi ok, the 3rd person rotating camera I'm actually ok with.\n\n\nI can't say I recommend or not recommend this game.  I don't think a game should be a case of "Well you will get used to it" or "You need to read about this and that" or "Well you are not playing it right" or whatever lame excuse someone wants to cook up. A game should find the fun. Period.\n\nIf I'm not having fun , all the comments are pointless. It's like concetrating on the person instead of the underlying issue. Does no one any good.\n\nI'm still playing, and I plan another hour or two before I decide if I'm jumping ship. There's your review.\n\n12/09/14 I tried playing another 30 minutes.

It really makes the apocolpse feel just like that- the end of the world. Combat is simple but brutal. Social issues and individual character personalities exist. With so many other factors. Probally my favorite part so far is that there "is" right and wrong and there isnt. I watched a camp of looters (Adverage people who just steal and run of zombies) Get torn to peices by a huge mob of undead. The looters had guns and knives and only killed 2 zombies before running away or dying. The need/want to get new surivors, new wepons, food, antibiotics, parts and everyting makes each day feel like a challenge. Im always cringing when i go to sleep and end the day for fear of whats going to happen when i wake up the next morning.

Turn based version of "State of Decay".\n\nLong version: This game is good, but not great.  If you haven't played State of Decay, get that instead. If you've played SOD into the floor  (I've played 1000+ hours on it) and want something in the same wheel house, then the turned based combat aspect of this game can be a nice change of pace.  The combat system feels more like old-school AD&D games, like think back to 90's RPG games where you take a group of adventurers out - that's not bad, it's just kind of dated - and where SOD makes you feel on the edge of your seat at high levels, this just kind of annoys you if you start losing (which won't be often if you take out a healer and make your character a melee warrior). Still, I enjoyed it and considering the amount of truely terrible zombie games there are out there, this stands above a lot of the trash on Steam.","December 30, 2015","true","68.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I've actually had in since it was in Alpha and just a one week demo. It's gotten considerably more content from then, but not much real polish. I like the idea of this game, but the execution of the design is rather clunky. First off, as people mentioned before, the interface leaves much to be desired. It's quite easy in the heat of combat to try to click on the HUD and accidentally move that character too far away to do anything useful in a single click. You are able to walk over dead bodies, but you're going to have a real hard time finding a spot that doesn't highlight the body to loot rather than the space below it to move on. Rotating the camera is necessary a lot of the time, especially when searching for hot spots where you can loot items, but a lot of the time it's in vain actually because there are usually very few places you can loot things from, although you do need to scour the whole map to find them. The turn-based/real time aspect is kind of weird in cases like where you're trying to break down a locked door. It goes into turn based for a second, makes noise, and the zombies in the area come to your location rather quickly. Like I appreciate trying to jump into combat faster but zombies aren't THAT quick. Another aspect that leaves much to be desired is the real time movement before combat. You can have up to 4 members of your team and they don't run that close together, they run sort of in a staggered formation that when you go into combat mode there's 1 person in the front that can attack and the rest are usually too far to do anything the first turn.","June 20, 2015","false","69.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","4"

This is simply because the last post full release patch has fixed many issues and the developers continue to improve this product (the next big patch is due mid-late January). In my opinion it should have stayed Early Access until this latest patch.\n\nThis is a deep game that rewards patience in the early stages. You start out with just a handful of allies and very few options but as you venture further from your base, discover more locations, and find more survivors (who come with their own individual traits and problems) then things begin to get interesting. You can develop your base far more quickly and new options for addittional facilities start to appear as new survivors bring their unique skills to the table. Plot events progress in a similar manner with most being specifically linked to certain characters and your enjoyment of Dead State will snowball as you gain momentum.\n\nDead State is not an easy game to quantify in terms of genre; being a combination of man-management and resource allocation, Sims-like character appeasement, building development, open world exploration, and story-driven role play elements. But the CORE of the game is none of these things but rather an XCOM-like, turn based, tactical combat. And this last, despite being highly enjoyable when taken in context with everything else, still has a few rough edges. Regardless of its flaws (which are becoming increasingly less significant as the developers continue to listen to the community and improve the game) Dead State has finally flowered into something unique and satisfying IF you can push through its slow start. With the promise of further improvement in both game mechanics and extra content it has been turned from something best waited on to something you shouldn't really be without.\n\nPrevious score 67%, current score 82%, expected to finish in the high 90's.","December 17, 2014","true","101.5"," 23 of 49 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","23","49","0","1"

The reason i cant recommend the game is because ead state feels unfinished, and seems to follow the same path as alot of other unfinished and rushed games lately.  I can forgive a crash here or there , but many of the story elements of the game are broken.  For example alot of characters will ask you to do certain tasks, when you do so though they wont acknowledge that theyve been completed.  At times this caused a drop in relationships for some characters such as Vic or Paul.  *SPOILER ALERT*    What broke the camels back for me was that  There is a character that you can rescue who has the possibility to produce a cure, now in a open world zombie game where alot of stories can be done or ignored, producing a cure is the closest thing as you can get to an end game for the most part and having such a major story aspect of the game broken when it is supposedly finished is unacceptable  *SPOILER ALERT END* .  Overall teh game functions solidly , barring the bugs, but it feels like a betrayal of trust when the developers tout the game as complete when it is only partially so.\n\nEdit 1: Flag was removed but the rest of the review still stands\n\nEdit 2: I just want to add in that , most major story scripts are bugged.  An event will happen that should , say make an area destroyed, but if you go to this area everything and everyone there is the same.  This effectively destroys the end game, I spent about 30 in-game days just skipping doing anything waiting for story elemnts to occur on and off.

I love the 3 genre it combines (zombie survival, classic rpg and non-linear) and thought that this was going to be one of my favorite games. However as you progress through the game you quickly realize how many flaws there are not only in coding, but also game mechanics. As for positives about the game...really nothing. The only reason why I was able to tolerate it for 20 hours is like I said, I am a sucker for the genre but as for the game in and of itself there is nothing that it brings to the table that can't be fulfilled from dozens of other games without all the bugs and hassle.\n\nCons-\nPlayer Character has 1 line of backstory...don't get me wrong, I love customization, but backstory for the main character is vital in an RPG. The only succesfull rpg series I can think of with limited backstory is the elder scrolls series, but those games use the prologue to shape the character's development. This game on the other hand has one of the most limited and useless prologues I have ever played.\n\nThe most repetitive turn based combat I have ever seen. All of the zombies are the same, the human npc have terrible AI with nothing intruiging about their movements, and the biggest baddest npcs in the game are a joke since they have such high armor class, if the player goes into a fight in the same armor its practically just flailing at each other for a few turns doing nothing strategic...sort of like a failed rpg hack and slash combo\n\nThe game uses a failed view system called "fog of war" which basically means that if you aren't in line of sight of an enemy then you can't see them and they can't see you, but it does not work for this game. In a turn based rpg if you can't find an NPC that you accidently aggroed you might be running around tiles with limited action points just wasting away your life.\n\nHorrible shelter morale system- some of the NPC express themselves almost like they are in an emotional polarity shift, they can do stupid things (don't want to give spoiler) even with a large morale rating and everyone being above average mood\n\nDroll upgrades- The shelter upgrades barely change the looks of the base at all, aside from this small garden plot on the veranda and a car showing up to put fuel in, everything looks the same from start to finish- some visual recognition of progress would be nice\n\nThere is loads more to list like technical glitches, location issues etc but that pretty much sums it up.\n\nRating 3/10\nLike a lot of other reviewers I would say to wait until it's at least 66% off, since the 30$ price tage is not so steep","December 27, 2014","false","21.5"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

Granted, it's not bug-free (though no real game-breaking bugs so far) and the interface can be a chore (as well as an enigma at times), but once you're used to its quirks, Dead State becomes an incredibly addictive and involving experience.\n\nYes, we're all tired of zombie games, but I will gladly make an exception for Dead State, and I promise, so will you. If I describe it as an interesting cross between Fallout, State of Decay and X-Com: Enemy Unknown, then it should probably be enough to make the hairs of any serious gamer stand on end. And rightly so, because the game pulls off all its aspects perfectly. And it even has a well implemented 'timer' mechanism: you're pressed for time since morale decays and food supplies dwindle daily, but on the other hand, you don't feel like you're being rushed all the time. There's no clock counting down, no constant reminders. You set your own pace, and as long as you don't waste your days doing nothing, you should usually be fine. I scavenged every day, trying to take on at least two locations per run, which is as far as you can stretch your daytime (and your characters' backpacks!), but I am currently sitting on a comfortable stockpile, so there's no need to micromanage and fuss over every single hour of every single day. But you know damn well that you can't sit still either.\n\nDuring your travels, you'll meet other survivors. Some you'll just stumble across, others will even knock on your door of their own accord. While you can turn them away, it's ill-advised to do so. Sure, every survivor you take in means another mouth to feed, but they pay off their food consumption by working for you. You can give them jobs yourself, like putting them in the scavenger party, making them construct shelter upgrades, guard the fence, and all other kinds of work. And as the days go on, the needs of your shelter grow as well, making it critical to recruit every survivor you can find. Every survivor has his or her own backstory, dialogue, demands and specializations, making for a diverse and lifelike feel of the shelter, where you have to assign jobs based on their capabilities.\n\nThe shelter itself can be upgraded, X-COM: EU style, to provide benefits and make new things possible. You can construct facilities like a workshop, a garage, a rooftop garden and even a chicken coop and a recreation room. All of these upgrades, however, take time and parts, and you'll find yourself strapped for the latter very often, so don't think you'll be able to just build everything from the get-go, it requires careful decision making, especially since unexpected events will also require manpower and parts, so you need to keep some in reserve. This makes for a paced game experience, where you'll constantly have things to strive for, instead of falling into the "build-everything-then-be-stuck-with-idle-workers-and-no-real-goal"-trap many similar games have perished in.\n\nThe scavenging party, which is always led by your characters, consists of up to four people, and their exploits will be the bulk of the game experience. You lead your team out there, in the lands around the shelter, and collect everything you can, ranging from food over luxury items, to weapons and shelter upgrade parts. Every scavenging run is a shot in the dark, since you'll never know what, or who, you'll come across, and while the zombies are dangerous enough in their own right, human enemies are so much more so. Sometimes you'll have no choice but to pass by a location because you know you're simply not strong enough (yet) to take its residents on. Which of course makes it all the more satisfying when you then come back to give them a good walloping.\n\nIf you do decide to do battle, you'll do it in classic isometric turn-based style. This gives you more tactical possibilities than you'd expect, since every weapon has its own range, requirements, and statistics. The battle system is most reminiscent of the 'real' Fallout Games (the Interplay ones), except, sadly, no groin shots. In battle, the first and most important decision to make is whether or not to break out the guns. They're powerful, but come with one massive drawback, and I don't mean ammo consumption (although that certainly counts too). Because guns, as you probably know, are loud. And loud things, as you probably know, bring all sorts of nasty things. But whether or not you'll resort to the powder burners, combat means tactical decision making, and some faith in the random number god. Which is exactly how a turn-based RPG battle should go.\n\nThere are a few minor flaws. It's not an entirely bug-free experience, but most bugs range from aesthetical (sometimes characters moonwalk), to only mildly frustrating (enemies clipping into each other, characters not following the leader correctly). Some are even kinda beneficial (being able to access the car trunk if you haven't brought the car, for instance). I have not encountered any game-breaking or truly frustrating bug yet. The interface can be a bit irritating at first, but once you get the hang of its quirks and unwieldy design, this becomes nothing but a minor inconvenience.\n\nAll in all, Dead State offers an interesting, involving, and even downright addictive role-playing experience with base-building elements. Like the Civ games make you go "just... one... more... turn!", Dead State will make you go "just... one... more... day!". This game, like Divinity: Original Sin and Shadowrun Returns, is proof that Kickstarter can, and does, produce absolute jewels, and in turn, proof that game makers make the best games when they make what they want to make.\n\nFinal verdict: if you like Role-Playing Games, Turn-Based Strategy and/or base building, you owe it to yourself to get this game. It's easily one of the best games of the year. Buy it, even if it's not on sale.","December 18, 2014","true","83.5"," 51 of 107 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","51","107","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocPleasure/recommended/239840/","DocPleasure","DevilMedic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocPleasure/","66 products in account","This is my second review for Dead State.  My first review was written almost immediately after release and was highly negative.\n\nI started playing the day of release, but it still had quite a few issues back then. I'm on my "third" character, but have yet to actually finish the game. I started anew after the recent patch as pretty much all of the ragequit worthy bugs that I had encountered worked themselves out.\n\nThat being said, I have played many indie titles on steam. This IS A GOOD BUY. My initial opinion was the opposite, but I can't stand by that anymore. The Devs and Mods are a very close knit group and the communication between them as well as the community is amazing. I would not be surprised one bit if they continue adding content over time, which seems pretty common with indie crews that create a game out of PASSION like they did, and not out of a pricepoint.\n\n\nLot's of peoples main question regarding a SP only game is the replay value and length of the game, I will give you my thoughts on that first.\n\nREPLAY\nAs it stands right now the game is definitely fun for at least one playthrough, and it is a LONG playthrough. There are lots of places to explore and cool things to see, as well as special weapons to hunt down, achievements, special enemies and special recruitable characters as well.  Now I have not reached the end-game.  I have one character around day 55ish right now, another around 45, and my first character is somewhere between 60-70, I believe.  As far as I can tell neither of them are super close to the end of the game.  A lot of it has to do with your playstyle, as well.  I made it a point to maneuver the entire world map on my last character and have found ALL SORTS of stuff I had no idea about, which will elongate my game.  Think Fallout2,  tt could be a 20 hour game, or a 100+ hour game.  While this is not as in depth as Fallout 2, the same principle stands.  IMO, at 30 bucks, even if this game was 30 hours it would be worth it.  A dollar an hour of entertainment?  Ok, deal.\n\nThis current character is my third to reach roughly day 50 so far.  Even having replayed those fifty days three times now, it was not a complete grind like I thought it would be.  The key to keeping this game interesting for me was varying my character builds.  First character was firearms.  Second, melee.  My current character is a bow character (STR and PER), and is INSANELY fun to play.  Granted, there are those "Oh, great, I have to do THIS part again" feelings, but the majority of those were routed in some bugs from older versions AS WELL as my not fully understanding the game mechanics on previous plays.\n\nCOMBAT\nCombat is... Well, it is honestly not the best.  It doesn't necessarily detract from your first playthrough, but there are no cover mechanics (xcom) and once you get some decent gear the zombie fights are as tense and nerve wracking as beating up sleeping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ toddlers with a cricket bat.  But, the devs state several times that zeds are supposed to be easy, and it is the human NPC's that are trouble.\n\n\nAI\n\nMuch like the original Fallout and Fallout 2, enemies are NOT scaled to your level.  This means if you wander into the wrong spot too early, you are going to have a REAL bad time.  I always enjoyed games that did this, so while I think it's a great perk, some may think it's poor design.\n\nCurrently, enemies are static unless agro'd by a noise or by seeing you, though I think I saw a dev or mod say they were working on a patrolling AI?  Once again, does not impact your first playthrough much/at all.\n\nWEAPONS/ARMOR\nThere is a decent selection of armor available in the game, which all have their pro's and con's and will make the critical gamer think hard.  "Do I want to sacrifice an AP for more defense, or would I rather give myself an extra chance to hit?"  Helmets with visors and masks will affect that characters visual range, which I thought was a very nice touch.  Higher grade armors CAN be hard to find, there may come a point when you think the entire selection is leather jackets and tactical vests.  Not true!\n\nThe weapons are equally varied, and also have the added spice of unique named weapons.  These are the money makers.  Increased crits, THC, damage, custom look and names, and they usually come with a little backstory.  VERY fun once you get some of them!\n\nYou also have the ability to create minor upgrades for some of your firearms and armor through the use of a player built workshop.\n\nSTORYLINE\nSome of it is event driven, some of it is time driven.  It moves along at a fair pace, not so fast that you don't have time to explore the map, and not so slow that you get bored (generally, there are a couple times where I thought my game was bugged because nothing was advancing, then the next day... it did.)\n\nYou also learn more about the survivors you recruit.  Nearly every one will come to at some point asking you to perform X task for Y reason.  Some are time sensitive, others are not.  They usually ALL give you a little glimpse into their backstory, however.\n\nThis game puts almost more stress on the aspect of MANAGING a post apocalyptic shelter than it does fighting zombies.  You will get crisis events and your "sub-leaders" (key NPC's in your shelter) will voice their opinions.  I have yet to see one where an answer you give will make EVERYONE happy.  Some of them require you to put a little thought in and weigh risk vs reward, i.e should I spend these supplies to prevent something that MIGHT NOT happen, just to be safe?  Or should they be put to use on a more immediate issue elsewhere?\n\nAdditionally, certain NPC's react differently to different conversations.  If you have a raging hard ♥♥♥ with a meanstreak that lived a rough life, are you going to coddle them and bend to their whim, or draw a hard line to make them respect your role?\n\nThere is not a lot of written/spoken backstory for the majority of locations, however I have not come across a single map that didn't leave something to the imagination (assuming someone has one :p ).\n\nI would recommend my friends buy this game at full price. The fact that it is on sale would make me buy it for them if they were still on the fence.\n\nYou can go ahead and look at my previous posts, when I first got here I was HIGHLY critical of the game on release. I have done a complete 180. This group of devs got me, and they got me ♥♥♥♥ing good.","December 21, 2014","true","87.4"," 29 of 62 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","29","62","0","0"

I had various bugs and crashes occur which I thought: "ok this is probably just because this is a game in progress. Then I realize its a fully released game and I start to hope the devs fix the problems. I notice I continually have updates for this game which encourages me to continue playing the game. Overall however I've slowly felt like I'm beating a dead zombie with this game. So here's how the story goes.\n\n1st Game Play: Awesome. Loving it. Seems like this is going to occupy a good week to 2 weeks of my time and probably have good replay value. Get somewhat far into the game and it crashes... continuously.\n2nd Game Play: After an update I load up the game only to find that my previous saved game has been completely corrupted and thought: "oh well, Ill just start over. Its got the official release. Maybe there is a bunch of different additions to the game. NO. NO THERE ISN'T. But I digress.\n3rd Game Play: I know the 2nd game play didn't really end anywhere other than I just stopped playing it for a couple days. But with the 3rd and final game play (atleast until the bugs are fixed) I get further into the game than I've gotten in the prior 2 game plays. Yet now for some reason the travel by horse has become slower than traveling by foot and for some reason when I add NPCs to my "search party" they don't come with. I don't quite know how to fix this bug (if it is a bug) but its annoyed me to point where I just stopped playing and decided I'll wait it out.\n\nSo to make a long review short. This game needs some real fixin' And until then. I don't really see the point in playing the game unless you're going to be able to enjoy it the full way through. Please please please fix this game up. I really do enjoy it (for the most that I can play) and would like to see the future potential in it.","December 6, 2014","false","339.0"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

It may be updated once a full release is made.\n\nDead State ... Me... And then there is you, reading and asking yourself : Should I purchase this or not? Let me start with the facts: Dead State is a survival RPG where civilization has collapsed due to a pendemic turning people into zombies. There are still other humans out there but most of them are hostile. If you don't like zombies, survival and exploration then this game ain't for you. For those still with us and asking what's the game?, let's elaborate with the following key points :\n\n-The game is set in 3rd person and most if not all actions are issued with the mouse. So no random shooting, gun blazing, taking shots -NO-\n-But there is combat of course. Combat is turn based and relies on characters stats as well as probabilities (luck).\n-RPG elements are not classic : You won't get points for how many you slaughter but for the objectives you accomplish. Therefore you shall focus on survival objectives rather than bloodbath.\n-Combats are not meant for lenghty bloodbath and encounters for several reason 1. The noise meter limits greatly the use of firearm, to the point where it becomes a last resort kind of option 2. Injuries are common and healing will take valuable equipment and action points (AP) 3. You will rarely encounter a horde or group unless you bust the noise meter (hitting 200 will spawn zombie in the sector) 4. Combats are not exactly thrilling and are often not at your advantage. For all those reasons it is best to avoid combat.\n-The map is divided in sectors. To leave a sector you must access the entry points (usualy on the corners of the sector). Once you do that you can select the travel option and open the large map where you can travel to various areas, idly wonder randomly or go back to your shelter (a public high school ... ugh school of all the places in an apocalypse really?).\n-Speaking of the shelter it is a microsociety with a struggle for power, where everyone has needs and where you can eventually assign tasks to members. Shall they join you on the field or repair something or clean around etc... You will have to set a daily objective. This society has needs as mentionned, the first one being food. You will often find yourself packing every piece of food you will find on your trip. You also want luxury items to bring up morale. Finding building material is also a priority since there are many things to build and repair.  Other loots include weapons, ammos, protection, fuel, tools and medical gear. Quick mention to antibiotic : A member of the group who becomes plagued with zombie infection cannot be cured with antibiotic, he can be preserved as human. Therefore each contaminated member will consume 1 antibiotic a day. Since antibiotic are rare, you might have to end up asking some of them to leave. Ugh sad.\n-Last word about the shelter: You won't have much to decide about the building location or else. It is that building, end of the topic.\n-Save often is a precious advice. Loots can be somewhat random but opponents too. Running into a troop of bikers armed to the teeth will often lead to all of your characters death and if you main character (you) die, it's game over.\n\nIt's time for What's the Game pro's and con's\nPro's :\n-Rich variety of weapons and gears\n-Decisions have an impact\n-Real feeling of crisis and survival\n-Good ambiance\n-Open-world style game with good replayability\n-Interesting concept\n-Loots don't respawn, feeling realistic\n\nCon's :\n-Combat system can be frustrating and dull\n-Graphics could be re-worked (Feels like 2001 graphics)\n-Limited party size (4 members)\n-No real sneaking/crawling/stealth mode\n\nOur final verdict:\nIs it worth buying ? Wait for the full version unless you get it from a bundle (Humble bundle or else). For those of you willing to put the cash in, it's a good game that will cost you a movie ticket but offer you many many more hours of fun. Decent game but not a hit.\n","October 8, 2014","true","18.2"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

It is a decent game which would definitelly find it's fans. It has a cool system of interpersonal relashionships management, lots of loot to play with, RPG traits and HQ development. But. The graphics are ridiculosly simple. The characters animation robotic. The choice of choosing a static picture to represent your character without any animation is pathetic. I can not care what is goin to happen to this pictuers who are constantly popping out lots of BS. Also, I came to the point when my character's face in all the dialoges was one of a Caucasian guy but there  was a black guy running in the game itself. So incongruent and off-hand the whole approach to the graphics is in this game. Another big thing, the combat system lacks depth, it is all about getting to the correct distance from the zombies to hit them first. From the variety of weapons the actual choise of combat options is limited. Due to the fact that more powerful weapon requires more action points to spend, it seems that all the weapon differes in the name but pretty much the same effectiveness wise.\nAll in all, Dead State is not a bad game. Moreover, it is still in alfa. However, animation wise as well as the character development wise it falls miles and miles  low from even TellTales Walkind dead. Similar to that, combat wise it has nowhere near to stand to brilliant Xcom enemy series.\nWhen you start thinking that there are such games on the market like Alien Isolation, new Dragon Age and even Evil Within which you can buy for roughly the same price Dead State seems to be undoubtedly overpriced. Consider yourself warned.","December 30, 2014","false","21.9"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Until the complete lack of polish started to get to me.  I don't FEEL like I'm in a zombie apocalypse.  I feel like an errand boy for a bunch of whiners.  Characters in the game are always the same, they always want the same thing (deoderant, coffee, batteries) which raises their mood level (gotta keep morale high).  However since they are unchanging, it feels like I'm constantly grinding to keep their mood high by bribing them with things I find.\n\nFor example, the one cop you start with has a gun but he says he's never used it before.  You can ask him for it but he refuses.  You can continue to ask him for it forever and he will always refuse.  I don't understand why these dialogue options exist if they do nothing.

I did however find a handful of bugs that I'm hoping will be resolved by the time the full game is released.\n\nThings to notice before purchase:\nThe full game is listed at $30 when released if you know you want it, now is a better time to purchase.\nFind the manual before running game. It doesn't appear anywhere noticeable after download and is online for anyone curious about how the game runs. I skimmed it at best due to its long length. But might be an insight for someone unsure on this game.\nThis demo only runs the first 7 days with limited things to do. I wouldn't purchase it unless you are sure you want the full version which is still under development. If you can wait for the full version to come out a demo will be free at that time.\nBe prepared for bugs. Though annoying they didn't manage to ruin my gameplay but could easily become frustrating.\n\nPersonally I loved being able to control my own group as I loot the surrounding areas for all they're worth and would easily recommend the game to anyone with a love of zombie survival.","February 17, 2014","true","120.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Mechanically the game is sound, with exception given to the combat system which has a tendency to lock up the game's global mechanics; this commonly occurs when engaging the Zombies or "those things" as they are commonly referred to within the story line; as the word zombie seems to be taboo with the developers when they were writing the games story line. The use of the word "Demo" within the main menu screen has thus far caused no end of trouble for the developers recently. As this has implied that this present itineration would not be update or replace with a full version upon its release. I would implore the developers clarify in pure and simple terms, what will happen to this release when full version is deployed and to replace the word "demo" in the main menu with "prequel". until the present bugs are fixed and clarification is given in a formal announcement on stream; I cannot in recommend this game to others. despite its obvious potential to be a really decent game.","March 14, 2014","true","82.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

I love the concept, and the interface, and I can tell it's destined to become a great zombie/survival game.  It is clearly still a work in progress, but that doesn't bother me.  I wanted to write this review to give the developers some intel on the bugs I've encountered so far during gameplay, so hopefully they can be addressed in future updates.  I love the game, but find that it has gotten a little more glitchy and harder to successfully play since the release of the last update.  Please note that these are notes I have taken since I started playing, and some problems listed here may already have been fixed.  But I just wanted to note everything, just in case.  So here we go...My notes are as follows:\n(1)  I wish you could split stacks of the same items in your inventory screen, so that you could easily split resources (like ammo) among party members or drop some (but not all) on the ground.  Right now, I feel like I have to load all the guns I have with my main character because I can't figure out how to divvy up ammo among party members, unless they each pick up some ammo for themselves here or there in scavving.  This also becomes an issue when dealing with weight, since some characters can carry more than others, and it could be possible to split heavier items to distribute the weight better among the party members.\n(2)  In my game, when there are battle effects to a party member (which appear as small icons to the right of the party member's face on the left of the screen), I cannot hover over those icons to determine what effects they are having, and how to cure them.  Instead, I have to have to open the game manual (or just use my memory) to be able to figure it out.  It would be easier if I could gain info while hovering over these status icons.\n(3) The stats for weapons in inventory should show how many action points are required to use the weapon (at least for basic attacks).  It's helpful to know, before you equip something, that it takes 7 AP to use, rather than 3.\n(4)  On the job board, the stats for party members should show their HP, so I can be sure to assign the healthiest members of my group to active party/scouting/scavving/fighting duty.\n(5)  It would be nice if I could trade/provide equipment to various party members directly from the main storage shelf in the shelter, instead of having to equip them on the field with only items in my main character's inventory.  (Or if I could at least have a way to see the inventory of these other players while stationed in the shelter.)  I find it difficult to know what other party members are carrying, unless I've recently been in the field with them.\n(6)  The pike weapon (the pitchfork) doesn't actually attack when "mangle" is selected.  It simply uses 7 AP while nothing happens.\n(7)  Priscilla's dialogue has some minor grammar errors:  "I barely every left my family's farm" should be "I barely ever left my family's farm" or "I barely even left my family's farm" and "I saw Todd's program and he preaced about tolerence" should be "I saw Todd's program and he preached about tolerence."\n(8)  When asked to make a decision about whether to engage in water purification system repairs, I was only given the option to side with Vic and refuse to make the repairs.  I don't know if this was a glitch, or something that resulted from my negotiation or leadership skill levels, or maybe my relationships with Vic and Todd, or maybe my lack of appropriate stored resources.  But I thought I'd mention it anyways.\n(9)  When Max joined the group, I was able to add him to my scavanging/scouting party immediately, even though he was supposed to be recovering after we found him at the gate.  So it was weird when he "woke up" in the game for the first time, since I had already been out fighting and scavving with him an hour before.  To avoid this weirdness, he should be unavailable for work on the job board for one or two days after his arrival at the shelter, until he recouperates.\n(10) It would be nice if there was a place on the Job Board or somewhere else, where you could easily see what day it is.  I can't easily determine what day it is.\n(11)  I encountered two glitches in association with use of the watchtower:  (a) Doug has yelled at me about 10 times for failing to construct a watchtower.  The first time he did this, we were already in the process of building it.  The next times, it was already built, and I had assigned Doug to watchtower duty, so he should have known it was already built.  I think Doug should only yell at you once if you're actually doing what he says to do.  If you don't do it, he can continue to yell at you, but he should stop screaching about it once the tower is built. (b) When I set Doug to watchtower duty (and this only happened once, but it was a major glitch) and then took my party to scavange the truck stop where we picked up three new survivors (the 17 yr-old and Japanese woman being among them), Doug ended up "accidentally" coming with my party as a fifth party member.  You are only allowed to have four party members at a time, so Doug took the place of Joel in the icons on the left of the screen (although Joel was visibly still in the party).  Thus, I couldn't trade with Joel, even though he was fighting with me in my party.  During this time, I couldn't see the blue highlights on the face icons to indicate which party member was selected; doors, walls, and objects like tables and counters were ignored and walked through by party members (leading to unintentional encounters behind walls I didn't expect to pass through); the health of my party members never seemed to decrease, despite being in a significant battle, and despite the fact that when I returned to the shelter, my party members' health was shown to have decreased significantly; the decible system seemed to get stuck in the red, even though we had stopped using guns, and the zombies continued to fill the area until there must have been more than 100 of them.  (Perhaps this is supposed to happen in the game sometimes, but I wanted to note it since it's the first time I've seen the decible system stay maxed in the red for more than 10 turns after gunfire ceased.)\n(12) After the last major update, I am noticing the following glitches in the game, which I did not notice before (though these glitches seem to come and go, and are not there all the time):  (a) sometimes dead AI players in combat still look alive, even though I can search their supposedly dead bodies and cannot attack them anymore.  Because they look alive, the combat interface seems to believe that combat is still ongoing, so it doesn't release the group from combat until we slowly leave the area; (b) sometimes my healer can't heal my party members in combat when they are K.O.ed, even though my med bag is full.  It won't show the heal option when I hover over the K.O.ed player; and (c) sometimes the game won't let me fully kill an AI enemy who is K.O.ed.\n\nOkay...that's it for now.  Thanks for listening and working to create a great game!  If I find anything else during my play, I'll let you know.  Can't wait to see the game in its final form!!\n\n","October 11, 2014","true","129.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","1"

Not a whole lot to be done. Will be interesting to see what the final product looks like. As it stands; quite a few freeze-ups/bugs, and fights are so sloooooooooooooooow. (Could really use some faster animations.) Also lacks a few characteristics of favorite RPG's such as character customization/creation and so forth. I'm also hoping it's more open-world than the demo indicates.\n\nEdit 6/11: Lot of bugs have been fixed, but still have problems with random crashes. I suspect they will be fixed too as the game is still updated frequently. Some of the stuff such as character customization has now been addressed and the game is pretty open world. My only complaint at this point is how slow fights go. For example if you are fighting two or three zombies on a map with 25+ zombies that you haven't engaged yet... you still have to wait until the game cycles through ALL of the zombies before taking your next turn. I have literally spent more than an hour in one fight, particularly when using weapons and creating noise, more zombies will spawn to cycle through.","February 15, 2014","true","49.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Well, both of those games actually have more features but the game has it's moments.  The worlds / places you travel to are limited to maybe 3 or 4 buildings.  When you gather supplies and bring them back, you are very limited with what to do with what you collected, since the computer seems to take all your loot and sort it for you.  I'd even say State of Decay has more "shelter building" features than this game.  If the shelter had more options, more building, more hands on things rather than a "labor" board, the game would be much funner.  It is very overpriced for what it has to offer.\n\nI read from the creators that the game isn't really in alpha, but more of cut short.  If that's the case, there really aren't that many features to keep me interested.

I backed this game years ago. I"m pretty satisfied with what I've playe so far (limited as it may be). there are many positives to this game, the story seems like its going to good, the gameplay is compelling. The TB strat aspect is very cool. Hopefully in the final game we will have our base attacked, be able to relocated and be able to farm areas for tools and survivors. I enjoy the fog of war, the difficulty of the game and it seems like many many more things will be available once it launches.\n\nNow onto the negative. This is NOT a EA game, this is a DEMO. In EVERY EA game I've played the game will evolve over time, more content will be opened and entire things may change. In this DEMO everything will remain pretty much the same until the game launches. We will get nothing after the first 7 days are done. I understand why they did this, however they lied to us about what we would get. We were promised early access to a beta type game and that we would have the abliity to help mold this game into what it would become. We instead get this.\n\nLet me be clear, this is going to be a good game if you enjoy TBS with a dynamic of base and npc interaction. This will be a good game for you if you enjoy zombie survival. But dont be decieved, this game is a DEMO and you can get it for free in a couple of months when it launches.

However, the graphics is not bad -except the characters when moving during fight.\n\n- People special need and Base management is a mess...moving character around the building, find stuff, find other characters, find other rooms is something very basic. Other guys are always need the same...cigar, sleeping pills, etc. After a while you are just running around and bringing cigars and spices, etc. like a grocer.\n\n- Conversation...simple, boring, flat text options. The same questions and similar answers.\n\n- Turn base fight...your guys could not hit the enemy from point range....using "weapons" means nothing, it is the same near-random generator fight. Moving during fight...I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when my team was unable to move out and died in a toilet. Nonsense. Cannot attack with meele weapon, just from 90 degree. I have seen similar game on my Commodore 64 when I was teenage.\n\n- Music, sounds, noise...the same 5-6 effects are repeating.\n\n- Characters can move across walls. Nice. Just the enemy, not your team, of course.\n\n- What I can say "positive" is the idea of the game and the base development. This part is the best written code, it is working and nice. You can build things, like mushroom farm and the whole population is living on mushrooms. Broaf....\n\n- Unfortuntely base management as I said, very simple. If something is wrong, just assign someone to fix. Cleaning and maintenance is simple...watchtower I have need some people to watch but the oldest guys can do the job. Probably with strong glasses...\n\nAll in all, the idea of this game is great, the implementation does not worth the price.","December 14, 2014","false","61.3"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

It really scratched the 'long term' zombie survival itch, something which is missing from most every zombie game presently.\nThere seem to be a few weird attempts to shoehorn in issues that are politically charged, like This gay Texas ranger shows up, the guy is really useful, really high stats, but he shrugs off his 'partner' dying in a car crash and just carries on without any problems, I know the guy was in the Army, but jeez. Knowing this 'controversial character' thing, the issue of him being gay will probably come up and you'll have to choose a side. and at one point a lady helicopter pilot wants an abortion and the preacher who was a missionary and worked in foriegn countries wants her to keep it, and you gotta choose a side, and theres more NPC conflict interactions like that, most of which aren't issues if you've got good negotiation and leadership skills.\nMaybe its just me understanding that issues like these are inserted into games, not to make a meaningful message, or take a stance, but, added to try and generate 'buzz' or 'controversy' That sort of thing feels a little hamfisted, but npc dialogue isn't that important anyways, and whats present is pretty good, nothing absurd, but, I think the writing is a bit lacking in the overall amount of it, it would be nice to see more circumstantial responses and general dialogue.\n\nNow, lets get to the meat of it, the game: Turn based like fallout 2 and a "S.P.E.C.I.A.L"-lite stat system, with actions that use AP in combat with free movement when out of it. It works, its good, I like it very much. There are the occasional out of combat pathfinding bug, but thats not a problem really. Its really enjoyable.\n\nWhat should be added: The ability to reload a single shot for less AP or something like that on certain weapons, maybe accessories you can find and attach or use with  weapons to change their stats, like speed loaders for revolvers, better recoil pads, scopes, stuff like that, maybe even give the same treatment to melee weapons, maybe wrapping some barbed wire around a bat, etc.\n\nI really do hope the developers keep adding content or open the game to being modifiable by the community and stick it on the steam workshop.\n\nIts a good game, made by a small developer, and I recommend it.","December 21, 2014","true","110.1"," 23 of 51 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","23","51","0","2"

I started to play Dead State about a week ago, and I found it pretty tough, and also frustrating in several ways. Today was patch day, and it plays so much better. Well it does for me. Now it will run in widescreen on my laptop, so that's nice. And there's an autosave, so that's nice. I am currently playing with as much survival emphasis in my character build as is sensible, I include the mom and daughter in the away team, and one other. Apparently I will be able to have 4 companions now...yes, that's also nice. On our shopping trip today we got a load of meds and fuel, and plenty of food (even a few apples), so we had the next day (gametime ofc) off. I am still laughing at the tooltip for Elaine which says "Undamaged". Ha!  I am looking forward to getting a car of some sort, because that will be also nice. So, here I am, now walking softly but carrying a big stick, and not really getting mad at the game anymore. I like it and have now recommended it. it isn't perfect, but it is cheap, and I think it represents very good value.

I spent several hours playing it. The story is ok, if you like that whole "post-apocalyptic-zombie" theme.\n\nBUT\nIt really feels that this game should still be in early access, for it has a bunch of annoying bugs and glitches that shouldn't be on a final release.\n\nThis is my little list of complaints:\n\n- Some items don't stack in the shelter inventory, while others, that are exactly the same, do.\n- You can't throw items out... You have to find a lootable container to put the things you don't want there.\n- Combat can be really glitchy, if you are on an area that has more than one floor.\n- Glass windows and doors should allow you to look inside a place before you enter it (c'mon guys!)\n\nBased on pricing and on the rushed development feel of this game, I cannot recommend it.

Turn based combat Fallout-style, scavenging in the zombie apocalypse for food and base upgrades, people management with distinct personalities, keeping morale up is a real part of the mechanic- and each morning there are some choices to make.  There are a lot of aspects and they're all entertaining, and with some nice touches of humor in the background props.  I'm not finished with the game and still the story and goals are evolving.  I feel like the characters progress and have opinions, and actually ended up taking them on scouting missions based on who I "like" better instead of strictly their stats.  Well, once.

You then return to your table. When the waiter arrives with three plates, he puts one plate down and then tosses the contents of the plates on top of the others. What do you get?\n\n\nOn the 31st of October a release date was announced for Dead State: the 4th of December.\nThis means that the game must by now, writing early November, be in a state to be sold after some minor tweaking and polishing.\nIs that the case?\n\nNow on the upside this game has many things to commend it.\nFor one is that they made your character's improvement part of a goal system instead of  the usual experience system.\nNext to that you can kind of improve you other party members by assigning them jobs and at times influence their progress through dialogs.\nAlso commendable is the way they give the game a kind of flow. At the start even a single zombie is a challenge for your group, let alone a group of them, but after a while zombies are no longer a danger but hostile people, those with guns and armor.\nAnother great idea is how the zombies can kill your party members and enemy humans and make them zombies to. One of the craziest encounters is  when your party runs into a shootout between two gangs while zombies attack from all sides.\n\nAt the core there are good ideas but this game is far from finished and beset with many issues. Here is a random list.\n\nThe game lacks a general story line, it is either not there or just not finished. There is a kind of conflict brewing between the militia at one hand and the military at the other, but  when I tried to talk to either side I was told to get lost.  There were some small incidents, like the military asking me for supplies and a proclamation from the militia, but  this didn't seem to open up more dialog.\nStorylines are broken. An example is the one of Fiona Parks, a girl who is devoted to you. At some moment I was approached by Davis, one of the survivors, telling me how sorry he was about what Fiona did. I had no clue what he was talking about and Fiona was fine. This went of every morning until at one point it was announced that Fiona had killed someone. She duly got a trial(in which she supported the side that demanded her death), then a minute later she was reported to have killed again, was put on trial again and banned. Since then the Davis conversation happens every morning. (At least it makes sense now.)\nMost zombies don't roam but just stand around so you can take them out one at a time, mostly by attacking them from behind.\nGroups of zombies or people stop being a danger because you can kill them one at a time by bashing on a locked door that is out of their view, which will then draw in your enemies one at a time(and the door will be restored to full points when you reload a saved game, so you can repeat this until all the enemies have been taken care of). That way you can gang up on one of them and thus take down stronger enemies that would normally wipe your party out.\n(One tip: give Vic a shotgun. And if you can get the combat shotgun he becomes an unstoppable force. In fact after a while you are pretty invulnerable.)\nUnfinished maps, empty maps, maps that don't work, doors that don't work properly, invisible barriers, barriers that you can walk through(the Coleman side entry).\nDogs can only be attacked from the front and the back and sometimes not be shot at.\nFifth party members showing up unexpectedly.\nThe chicken and egg issue: to build your chickencoop you need to find a chicken, when you do it gets slaughtered when you take it home because you don't have a chickencoop.\nSome quests are broken(Aggro asks you to get Alan, but he never shows).\nThere is a quest for swapping food for medicines, but you can't get food from your storage, although you can fish for fish. I did so and took the fish with me to this deal. Then the deal was made, but no exchange happened yet I got a message that the deal went really well.\nThe game doesn't keep a record of the locations that you already visited agains the locations that other survivors tell you about, so you get a message that they marked a  new location on your map, but nothing shows because you already discovered it.\nWhen fully upgraded the fence can't be repaired(unless it is completely destroyed I guess).\nSome upgrades on your shelter are described not to function.\nSome items have no icons.\nThe storage of your shelter is bugged for sometimes the tabs won't work. This seems to effect mostly the ammunition tab and this might have something to do with creating ammo\nThe radio you can create to assign jobs doesn't work.\nAmmo you can create yourself and it only costs you a one time price to give you access to an unlimited supply of them. So in the end you can just bang away as ammo isn't an issue(this might by intendend)\n\nOn and on goes the list of issues.\n\nI was amazed about all these issues for people seem to think well of this game, so I checked the game agains steam several times and even have reinstalled it from scratch. I even tried to see I could download a recent upgrade from the double bear website, but they just point me to steam. Maybe steam is hosting a old game or  perhaps what I describe is the current state of the game.\nI suspect the latter as I see in the forums many of the issues being mentioned.\n\nMaybe the game is remarkably patched by the time it gets released but based on what I experienced above and based on the price I still give it a thumbs down.\n\nNo doubt someone is going to say that what I say is not true, so what I would suggest is that you just look around on the forums that talk about this game and, if it is available, download a demo.\nI hope that the game developers finish the game properly.. it certainly has it's merits.\nI have another review here which shows pictures so you have also visible proof of what I am saying.\nhttp://meritcoba.com/2014/11/15/a-game-review-dead-statea-tale-of-errors-a-chicken-a-murderess-and-a-ghost-and-lots-of-zombies-too/\n\nLog:\n22 November: added a header.. corrected some writing mistakes.

As a fan that has been watching and looking forward to the development and release, only to be utterly disappointed.  The writing has the elequence and style of a 15 year old boy (although that is debatable as I think the average teenager might have been able to come up with better writing).  The game touts the decisions you make affecting he outcome of the game.  What that really means is that the dialogue comes to a grinding halt until you figure out what the character needs,  The controls are clunky, I would say the original X-COM has a better interface and flow.  I knew that the game would have graphics on par with what you'd find 15-20 years ago, but that being said I kept an open mind as there are great games that don't necessarily have modern graphics.  Sadly this is not one of them.  I'm a super fan of the zombie genre and would recommend either Left for Dead game or Dead Island would be money better spent,  What I expected was a game on par with say the new X-COM Enemy Unseen or at least close to that level of production and what I got was a 1996 classic, that would have been great 20 years ago, but has as much appeal to me as firing up the old adventure game on the atari 2600.","September 27, 2015","false","3.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"
