All you do is click left mouse button, obviously, this would work much better tapping on a screen.

And, in a way, it is, but in reality it's just another casual game with point-and-click adventure elements. Puzzles aren't hard to solve, they just require a bit of (random) mouse clicking and finding some of the secrets requires you to click on (seemingly) random objects. It's actually kinda fun, if only a little on the easy side. The secrets in the later levels are a bit harder to find, but give it enough time and you should be able to find them all. It won't take you hours to finish a level, just several minutes, depending on if you want to collect everything.\n\nThe animations are cute and the designs are colorful and seem targeted to a younger audience. That doesn't mean people who are a little older can't enjoy it. On the contrary. It's a game for everyone. The sounds and music are a little basic, but considering that it's ported from the iPhone it gets the job done I guess.\n\nThere are 5 worlds in total and finishing the game should take you a little over a couple of hours.\nIs it worth €13,99 ? Hell no. Companies that charge this much don't deserve your money. Buy it in a sale and be happier that way.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","December 22, 2013","true","6.6"," 76 of 117 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","76","117","0","0"

Try re-installing or contacting the publisher for assistance"\n\nsecondly, there is no POSSIBLE way this game can be worth $15 but not being able to play it kind of cements that fact.\n\nthe fact that this game costs 14 dollars more than the tablet edition is absolutely appauling. what makes it even more appauling is Rovio's excuse:\n"Hi everyone!\n\nIn this version we have made an additional effort to make the game look as good as possible, with high-quality graphics and other improvements to make the experience as smooth as possible. Additionally, the game is 3$ on mobile platforms: prices are set differently on each platform and these two markets are very different.\n\nWe've been developing Tiny Thief for over 2 years, the game has around 3.000 animations and 700 sound effects plus music; crafted by a small team of passionate game developers. We truly believe Tiny Thief to be a unique and great game with a correct price for this platform and we hope you feel the same way once you get to play the adventure."\n\nIE you have resolution options. i can commiserate with a dev studio that feels like it should be paid for its efforts. if they feel the game is worth $15 then they should charge that much for the mobile version. what... that's a problem? you mean to say that people aren't going to pay 15 dollars for a mobile game? RIGHT! so why do you believe that PC gamers should do exactly that?\n\nconclusion, there is no justification, you should have charged $5 and even that is kind of a rip-off. i understand that effort goes into optimisation, however, your reward should not be that you can charge much more for your game, but that your game is made available to the pc audience, or people who would prefer to play your game on their computer. ergo, you charge 1 dollar for the game on mobile, you charge 1 dollar for the game on PC.\n\nlastly. people are suggesting that if you want to play tiny thief, then you should buy it on mobile. honestly, i feel that this kind of act should be discouraged, i would ask that you do not buy the game at all and send a message that this kind of thing is NOT OK.\n\nthanks for reading.\n","December 18, 2013","false","0.1"," 176 of 290 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","176","290","0","10"

It's a puzzle/point-and-click adventure game. It kept reminding me of The Cave from earlier this year. Like those main characters, this tiny thief isn't all Robin Hood. One of the solutions is to tie a hot dog to some guy sleeping and push him in the water so he'll be too preoccupied being eaten by a shark to stop the thief from progressing on his way. The controls are really simple as this is a ported iOS game. The only input you need is the left-click to do everything in the game. The puzzles were moderately challenging and there are a lot of levels that have a good variety of locales and challenges. The sound design of the game is especially good. The music for each level is toe-tapping and the sound effects add a lot the charm of the game. It took me around 7 hours to 100% complete the game. This game makes a good case for the strength of mobile games. I highly recommend Tiny Thief.","December 20, 2013","true","11.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The puzzles are easy to solve, they just require a sliver of brain power; however, finding the secrets (like the golden eggs in Angry Birds [another Rovio game]) requires you to click on random objects. There is no reason or logic behind it, just random clicking will get you the secrets you need to three star every level.\n\nThat randomness aside, It is actually fun; even if it is a little on the easy side. The animations and story is cute and the designs are colorful and the game overall seems targeted at a younger audience. This does not mean that older audiences will not enjoy it, it should just be played casually and not to completion.\n\nOverall, I spent six hours playing the game (pausing for lunch, dinner, and a snack) and got all of the achievements. This is a great game to get on a steam sale, but only on a steam sale as you can buy the same game through the App Store for $0.99.\n\nSo, buy the game, enjoy the cutesy story and animations and have some fun with Tiny Thief!","December 26, 2013","true","8.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Never any lag and my computer was not build for gaming AT ALL. Surprisingly, for such a simple game of puzzles and comics, it had a very sweet story line that was easy to follow. Not only that, but it was a great relief to be able to sit back, enjoy a cute puzzle, and not have to get a headache from constant dialogue.\n\nOverall Review: 8/10.\nWhy an 8?

The main puzzle in each level is reasonably straightforward if you're just after a speedy playthrough, but if you're up for a challenge, many of the secrets are pretty tough & keep you busy for longer.\n\nI played this on a touchscreen device, so can't comment on the mouse & keyboard controls.","February 3, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wish they had changed some of the controls when they ported this over to the computer though.  Some tool tips or labels on the icons for the main menu would have also been nice instead of having to randomly click around to see what everything does.  Once you're in the game, the tablet style controls can feel a little clunky at times, but you tend to get mostly used to them after a bit.\n\nGenerally this game seems more like a puzzle game than an adventure game to me.  Expect to do a lot of random clicking on everything in the background if you want to collect all the items in each level.  You'll also more than likely end up replaying some of the levels several times if you happened to miss an extra objective when it was first there since after the beginning levels you can only get some of the extras at very specific points of progress during the level.  That can get a little aggrivating at times, but it's generally not too big of a deal since you can blast through a level fairly quick once you know how to finish it.  Overall it's a decent game you could either take in short bursts or run through the entire thing in what's starting to look like 6-8 hours or so (I'm around halfway through as of this review).  You're probably better off just getting it on a tablet instead if you have one, I can't imagine the port really adds anything to the game over the mobile version.  Plus with the control scheme, it'd be more natural on a tablet.","January 15, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall very entertaining game, with cute little high jinx though out. Not much of a replay value and i was able to 100% completly the game very easily. but i would say i really enjoyed my time with this game. The only negative i really have to say is that there is a lot of patience i suppose involved, with not being able to skip past cut scenes and having to wait for actions to play through out, along with actions sometimes not registering. but i suppose the patience of it really sets the tone and atmosphere of the game which like i stated before is very enjoyable. The game is point and click, and significantly easier than most point and click games that are featured on steam ( no pixel hunting required!! the game offers a very clear method of pointing out what items are active to use ) i would say the game is most defiantly suitable for children .... and maybe even aimed more towards them lol with the ease of it. but there defiantly are more challenging levels where it had me scratchin my head and staring at the screen for a while trying to figure it out. so it is farily easy comparitive to most point and clicks, but not so challenging where you will become aggrivated... it's a rewarding aggrivated! lol any ways i really enjoyed and game and would recommend it .. and if $15 is too much for your finacial situation i hear there is a $3 app version which seems to be the exact same game.","January 4, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do I think the game is worth buying at the full price: definitely no!\n\n"Tiny Thief" is basically a point-and-click adventure game of the old style (and even pays homage to many of the classics), but instead of a long uninterrupted narrative, it has been boiled down to byte-sized chapters/levels that are more appropriate for consumption in the current age of mobile gaming. Most of the elements are still there - the absurd combinations, the unconventional humor, even the sometimes aimless clicking around - but at the same time due to it being divided into levels the longer narrative and the more complex and longer puzzles are somewhat lacking. However, the levels still manage to combine into a good (although a bit simplistic) story and the gameplay is very enjoyable in its streamlined implementation (this, once again, is the product of being a mobile game first and foremost).\n\nThe two things that set "Tiny Thief" apart and elevate it onto an even higher level of enjoyment are its art direction and animation which are indeed word class and set the game apart. I would recommend buying the game even for these two aspects, but would still ask you to only hand over the money when the game is on sale at a very steep discount - paying over ten times more for the same title as the one on mobile platforms is definitely absurd!","January 5, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe get it when it's on sale (as I did) because you can easily play it through in one go (my play time of 7hrs include several breaks where I didn't bother closing the game, so the actual time I spent playing should be at least 2hrs less - I had it running in windows mode btw.) and I don't see much replay value. Oh, for those who care about these things: the whole game is played with the mouse - no keyboard input needed - which makes it a nice game to play while leaning back and having something to drink or eat in the other hand.

It is a very adventurous game but it was a bit too short needed to be a bit longer to play but it was fun.\n\nThe people who haven't brought the game yet you can buy it if you want and have fun playing it like I did.\n\nI give this game a 9/10.","March 3, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the game's trailers do suggest an element of stealthy gameplay in actuality Tiny Thief is more of a puzzle game than a stealth sim. 5-star title right here, worth every penny and will entertain with it's cute atmosphere and simple yet confounding puzzles.","August 13, 2014","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's really funny, nice settings, beautiful artwork. Once you completed the main story, you can start all over again and try to get three stars in every level. A lot of hidden interacting possibilities might turn up.\nIt might not be this interesting for people who love to smash on their whole keyboard while playing because you only have to point with your mouse and click. That's it.\n\nThe game is also available for portable devices but I liked having a big monitor and seeing all the small details and having a great overview.","December 27, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me maybe 10 hours to beat it but I enjoyed every second and I had a great time playing it. The art style is really cute and the levels are unique every time utilizing new types of puzzles and it's not repetitive in the least. The challenge progresses nicely but never becomes very difficult. I highly recommend to anyone thats looking to relax and enjoy themselves playing a cute little puzzle game for a few hours.","July 31, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
