As you see this game use an old game engine, so the grapics is outdated as hell, and I also doubt this game have the best handling,\nbut we have to understand it's an indie game not an AAA game, so our expectation have to adjust to the 17-19$ price range. However it's not a bad game, and this games strongest side is the massive air battle with hundreds airplane. Just check the video below, you will understand it and I also think it will help you decide if you are thinking on to buy it.:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y76CtF-tu8I","January 14","true","1.6"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","24","32","3","2"

I'll go in detail when I get some free time. However, if you like team play flight sims... THE ONLINE WORLD WAR MAP IS HUGE!!!!\n\nI wrote my more detailed review here for those that are interested in the game and the features it has to offer:\nhttp://blogjob.com/oneangrygamer/2016/01/warbirds-dogfights-2016-review/","January 23","true","24.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Spit totally uncontrollable, likes diving into the ground. I can fly the Spit Mk 1 in FSX to stall and spin and I can still recover. This game is a waste of money.","March 9","false","14.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

KISS is a milatary trum use in WWII. Means, Keep It Simpul Stuped.  The plain turns way too slow. Can not loop. No instent key mamping to refur too. Just Simpley too complated In start up play. No eazy or arcade mode for fast fun play or simpul play. your reastlick is poor when the emanes can out fly you. i can go on and on. The thing is i was spoiled. The most fun Fighter plain game i ever played was "European Air War" By Micro PROSE. ... Sorry GUY'S.  Ho,.. sorry I am stupid and can not spell. Smiles. ......
