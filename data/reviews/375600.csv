I was an alpha tester for Wilnyl (the lead developer) through his TeamSpeak server and participated in a few competitive tournaments (check out reddit.com/MLAB)\n\nUPDATED REVIEW AS OF 11/10/15\n\nAir Brawl is a great game. It has extremely tight controls, top notch game feel, and a cohesive atmosphere. This game is NOT a flying sim. The planes don't control realistically at all, HOWEVER, that's not a bad thing. They feel amazing, and there's nothing quite like a plane chase in Air Brawl ending with you on top, either by outmaneuvering your opponent and making them crash or being able to take them down using one of many, many weapons and special attacks.\n\nClass variety is pretty good, though it's disappointing that three classes have the same special attack (boost) and one is hardly usable (gravity bomb). It almost feels like the Elder is a copy/paste of the Witch Doctor with a few changes.\n\nThat being said, each class is unique enough to stand on its own and its hard to see which one is clearly the best. In the hands of someone with great aim, the sniper/DMR combo is devastating and has insanely fast time to kill. However, for someone who's a great flyer, luring people into tunnels and then gassing them up with poison gas as the Witch Doctor feels amazing.\n\nThe reason it's hard to pinpoint which class is the best is because that changes depending on the map. For instance, Neon has a lot of long corridors where you can see down a large stretch of the map. Sniper is great here because of its unique zoom mechanic. But on Sand, a map largely based around tricky, tight tunnels, the Witch Doctor is fantastic at maneuvering.\n\nThere are many game modes, but I wish that people played them more. In the game's Alpha and original Early Access release, CTF was the only game mode. It's still my favorite to this day because it gives each player a role and lets each player settle into what they're good at, whether it be combat, flight, or even distraction. Since the game has come out of Early Access, however, I've only been able to find Race or FFA servers. Disappointing, but that's not the game's fault.\n\nLet's talk about performance. The game ran perfectly (100+ fps) on my old GTX 580/i7-930/6GB RAM. I've since upgraded to an r9 290 and I can still say the same. I've had some stuttering on Race maps but only for about a second each time. Hopefully this is fixed in the future. Keep in mind I've been playing on absolute Ultra the entire time, so your results may vary. This game will likely run well on anything post-2008 that has a dedicated GPU (so sorry integrated graphics).\n\nAll in all, this game is one that you have to play to understand. It thrives off of feel and adrenaline. It takes about an hour to get 100% used to the controls. You will die A LOT. But once you get your first few kills, you'll be hooked.","June 2, 2015","true","9.5"," 173 of 203 people (85%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","85","173","203","29","6"

Currently it has -25% off, so that dismantles this point a little bit. But imagine you were me, a little while ago.\n\nI'll stand by my original review, the game is good, the controls are tight, the maps still are very interesting, the planes are balanced and well designed and the graphics are great and have time and effort put into them. They fit the style of the game for sure. I recommend the game.\n\nBut.\nAnd that is the key word there.\n\nI think of the price in a LAN party scenario, 10 USD, that's 14.2 AUD at 70 cent exchange rate.\n\nIf I asked my friends to buy the game, we would have fun that evening, but it isn't certain that we would be playing that all night. However, after the lan party, if someone wanted to play with randoms on online matchmaking then they couldn't. You know why?\n\nBecause the servers are a barren wasteland.\n\nI have never been in a server in my time playing this game that has been even close to full, and that sucks. You can see the dev on /r/pcmasterrace handing out keys like they are hot cakes, trying to get people to play his game and not spend it on a CS:GO skin.\n\nI'd like to take this time to respond to the comments on my review. I'll start from the bottom to the top and I'll give the names as of the time of my review.\n\nLeo Ortu Fenice\n"ummm $10 isn't high for such an indie game!"\n\nSure, the game is good, but do we need more people on the servers to make it fun? Yes.\n\nSausage\n\n""Price is too high for early access game" Really dude?\n\nYou really haven't seen many early access games on Steam have you. Have a look at some of those prices. £5 is nothing."\n\nReally dude yourself, dude. Sure, other early access games on steam are expensive, and I prefer until the game is out to try it, But you know what the other games have, features, a lot of features. It's not about "is it an early access game" but it's what the game is like, and if it's an early access game, it should be priced less to encourage people to stay on the game.\n\nLimping OJ Limpson 웃\n"Developers don't really understand the gaming community. Games like these will die within a month as people will need to queue for hours to find a match, only AAA games can create games based on Multiplayer only feature, games like these can't as soon there won't be anyone queueing for matches and you'll be stuck for hours on the same page and give up. Been there, done that x600"\n\nThis is the comment that convinced me to update this review, this man has hit it on the head. Only AAA developers can make games with multiplayer only. And that is the truth. If I could give this man a kiss IRL I would 10/10.\n\nThe game is good, and I won't give it a negitive recommend just because people aren't playing it, it needs to have replay value, and that's something it just doesn't have because of the playerbase, I think the base price of the game needs to be cut it half. I think it needs to be $5 USD, just to get more people onto the game, then increase the price to what you want. I just need a guareentee that there is going to be people, then I'll pick this game up again.","June 21, 2015","true","0.9"," 126 of 149 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","126","149","3","3"

Casuals beware!\n\n---EXCELLENT PLATFORM, UNPOLISHED GAME---\n\nI've flown hundreds of games and played for a little over 100 hours in Air Brawl at the time of this writing, and while fundamentally, I can recommend this as an excellent party game and at its most basic, it is a very enjoyable arcade flight sim, I can not give it a complete recommendation as of 1/14/2016 and again on 2/6/2016 (v1.02). I've owned this and played on and off since its Early Access launch on Steam, and while there has been marked improvement in the 7 months since, it is not enough to make the core experience enjoyable for newbies or veterans beyond the occasional match.\n\nVets who sink time into the game become insanely good pilots, and can end a match full of newbies and casual players in less than a few minutes, which drives player counts down until the game goes on sale again. Classes and weapons are unbalanced (heavily favoring weapons with high damage/physical output), many assets are too minimalistic to be useful in flight, and the 'Obstacle Course' mode has serious lag and difficulty problems. Ping spikes can cause friendly fire incidents and suicides. Games are simply too short, and there is no griefing protection in CTF matches. Offline mode is present, but the bots appear to be on a waypointing system and have a 360-degree fielf of view, and impossibly small turn radii, which is immensely frustrating and cannot be learned on as a new player.\n\nSeveral weapons and combinations of weapons are able to slam pilots into walls (causing very, very high damage), and makes for very small kill times (seconds or less, as there is no spawn protection) and frustrations for any victim, new or old. This is my (and many other players') primary complaint that has not been addressed, nor, to my knowledge, is there any plan to. Sunray mines, shotguns, flak cannons, sticky bombs, and the ragnarok deal ludicrous amounts of damage or physics changes (or both!), and are the de facto overpowered weapons in the game.\n\nThis game feels as if it were rushed out of Early Access far too early -- there is  a lot of polish and content creation yet to be done. The developers are somewhat active on their subreddit for the game, but appear to have moved on to other projects (Highway Fight Squad, for instance). A time-to-kill and crowd control rebalance patch was debated, then committed to, and then vanished around early November of 2015.\n\nAir Brawl is not a /bad/ game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's...frustrating, and for a lot of wrong (and a few right!) reasons. Games shouldn't be frustrating. I would be happy to reconsider this review, should support for the game resume, especially with a rebalance patch. However, as it stands I cannot currently recommend this game.","January 13","false","137.3"," 125 of 155 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","125","155","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bioluminescent/recommended/375600/","Bioluminescent","Coldlight Oracle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bioluminescent/","20 products in account","The game has beautiful visuals, solid response, and a wide variety of weapons and planes to fit a certain niche. There are many gamemodes, and poor latency also doesn't seem to impact the gameplay too much. When playing online, there are many competent players, which makes the game very difficult (for me, at least). The game is very quick and casual, as you can join a game almost instantaneously, and leave without any consequences. It does not track K/D ratio, which can be a plus depending on how you view games. There is a "Brawl Journal" which records the amount of kills and wins you have, as well as your level. Currently, there are no rewards for levelling up (besides bragging rights, and being feared by weaker players such as myself).\n\nOn the other hand, the game still has flaws. The music cuts in and out at seemingly random intervals, and the game crashes on rare occasions. There are not a lot of maps, but the quality of the ones in the base game compensate for this. When playing TDM, it's almost impossible to tell whether or not you're aiming at your team mate until you get close enough to see their plane enclosed in a barely-noticeable [light-green] rhombus. There is no team balance whatsoever when playing on team-based gamemodes - situations where you're the only one facing *dozens* of badass pilots can happen. The tutorial is decent, but the tutorial map itself is very confusing, as most of it is blank space - initially, I could not tell where I was at all. Combined with difficult [default] controls, new players (that do not pay attention to settings) will almost certainly have difficulty playing. The price is also unjust for a *small* package, and I think that the game would develop a greater playerbase much quicker if the price was dropped to the likes of $2.5-$5 USD. Most of these issues are easy to fix, and I'd assume that there will be a patch regarding these issues in the near-future.\n\nOne thing I suggest for the game is customization. Planes could be team-colored/reskined, and Steam Workshop support would be interesting. Game setting should also be able to be tweaked, so that people can play absurd games where you can use only toxic gas.","November 9, 2015","true","4.5"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","1"

It offers nice graphics, good controls (even for dogfighter game newbies), few mods (classics like Capture the Flag or Team Deathmatch) but sadly, has almost dead multiplayer.\n\nAir Brawl is worth recommending but only if you're going to play it with friends together, otherwise you'll be stuck alone with bots.\n\nPros:- Many airplane and weapon combinations. There are some crazy ideas, you can have a medieval plane that shoots exploding barrels or... witch doctor's plane? Or a dogfighter from future... just don't take it seriously, it's all about fun.\n- Nice graphics. Just check the screenshots, you'll see.\n- Short tutorial that explains enough to let you learn the basics in few minutes.\n- Gameplay variations. Capture the flag, deathmatch, gun game, obstacle race and few alterations of those mentioned.\n- Dynamic soundtrack that changes when you start fighting your enemy.\n\nCons:- Dead multiplayer. Recommended only for fun with friends, currently not worth buying if you expect joining active servers. (If you don't want to be stuck alone with bots.)\n- Only 5 maps. But all of those are designed pretty well.\n- Boring achievements. Win for your first time. Win for your hundreth time... and you already know what's coming up next for sure!\n- Most of the small active community are skilled players, so don't expect getting your ego high early.","January 4","true","0.8"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","37","47","4","0"

This game was already well worth the money in pre-release, before most of the features you see in this release even existed.\n\nThe basic concept is brilliant. It's a dogfighting game based on a tight control set and unique ship and weapon types. The ships respond to the slightest touch of the mouse, requiring skill, but don't spin out or drag like many other air combat games. That means the game is really arcadey. The weapons are completely unique, and I can only recommend you play the game or look at the videos or wiki to find out more. Here's a sample: the hammer (a comic style hammer that comes off the top of your plane and 'boinks' other planes); the sniper (yes, a sniper with a scope on a plane); the gravity bomb (that sucks planes towards it and throws them around); and so on. It plays beautifully and looks great, with a variety of graphics options and a really quick no-nonsense start-up and shut down. The game models are carefully constructed to a specific and appealing art style. The maps are designed with stunts, tricks, and complex fighting in mind. It's a simple formula carefully crafted to create a powerful and laugh-out-loud feeling of fun and joy, with long lasting appeal.\n\nThis is the sort of game that you can and will play frequently.

This game is amazing. Definitely the most fun I've ever had in a dogfighting plane game. It ignores the constraints of realistic physics and gives the planes exceedingly tight and responsive controls, allowing for a ludicrious amount of stunts and maneuvers. The maps, although few at the time of writing, are very well made and are very fun to zip around in. Whether you're on top of your game, flying through spinning fans and closing doors like a fighter ace or screaming "CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP" while frantically trying to avoid walls, it's a great experience. Trust me, 'cause I've been both.\n\nAs far as the actual fighting portion, super fun. The weapons all feel unique and powerful in their own ways. It's hard to get the hang of it, but if you play for an hour or two you'll find yourself holding your own.\n\nGraphically, it looks fantastic. It's not super stylized or super realistic -- it's a mix of the two that I personally love.\n\nNow, for the Early Access questions that everyone has:\n\nCore Mechanics: Solid. Very few bugs that I have noticed. Very little needs to be done with the core game mechanics, which is important. I'm loathe to buy early access games unless the core game is more or less done and this one satisfies that condition.\n\nContent: At the time of writing there are six planes with 4-6 weapons each. There are a total of four maps and five game modes. Lack of content isn't a huge problem in this game and more is coming. The maps that are in the game feel complete and balanced.\n\nPolish: UI could use some work. It feels sort of temporary, if I'm to be perfectly honest. Chat works but isn't great (it displays messages in the kill feed on the top right). There could be a little more sound work done (including some sort of music, as there is no music in the game currently -- I just put on my own music in the background).\n\nTo wrap up...\n\nPROS:\n-Very responsive controls (though they do take a little practice)\n-Map design is fantastic\n-Planes and weapons all feel unique\n-Graphics are great and fit the atmosphere\n-Multiple game modes (Free for All, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Flagmaster, Team Flagmaster)\n-The networking is fine and I've had zero issues with that\n-Password-capable servers so you can have private matches with friends or clans or whatnot\n\nCONS:\n-Average amount of content (not terrible but could use some more maps)\n-Controls are not rebindable (you can swap the mouse x axis between Roll and Yaw but that is the extend of customization save sensitivity)\n-UI needs work\n\nOverall Impression: Very good for the first day into Early Access, worth the 10 bucks as it is, and shows promise for the future. I definitely recommend giving this a shot!","June 3, 2015","true","29.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","0"

Not religiously, but its something that I've seen on Reddit every now and again, and its been great seeing Wilnyl update everyone with the game's latest progress. It looked like a small, fun game. But god is it so much more than that.\n\nAir Brawl is without a doubt the best flying game I've played. The control system is exactly what I expected - sensitive at first, but so tight and precise that you can execute fantastic dips, dives and loops through the game's four maps and their tunnels and obsticles. I especially like the fact you can choose to use mouse yaw - it makes the plane's so much easier to fly.\n\nThe game itself is addicting. You can play 5(?) game modes on various servers, including free for all, team deathmatch, capture the flag and two other flag games. With plenty of people, the matches are fun - my only complaint is that sometimes you can be spawn killed when people spawn near you, which is especially annoying in modes like free for all. There's also five different planes, each with their own special abilities and weapons, so there's plenty of exploring and replaying to be done.\n\nTl;dr: Seriously great game.

I cannot suggest spending any amount of money on this game or any other game put out by the same developer - They are simply the worst devs, hardly a step up from the people who throw a game in early release and never actually do an "official" release.\n\nAs someone who played on and off since just before the Steam Release, I -love- the gameplay. Its a fun little multiplayer deathmatch/objective game. There is a steep learning curve but once you get a grasp on it,  combat is great and movement is great, if a little odd with how easy it is to "stall" and yet not stall. Overall for gameplay alone it would be worth the small pricetag, especially with the current sale.\n\nHowever, Air Brawl is a game that was pushed into its "released" status before it was ready and was then abandoned by the devs completely. Wilnyl has confirmed that no work is being done on this game, and instead they are finishing some other game they're presumably going to abandon as soon as its "done", then moving on to what he described as a "spiritual succesor" to air brawl. I can't say say I'm very excited at the prospect of paying for another game this company is likely to abandon before its time.\n\nGood game, no remaining community + no relevant singleplayer + no dev support = thumbs down.","March 15","false","52.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Even better, I'm getting well over 144fps at 1080p which is always welcome in a high speed game like this. Level design is phenomenal and combat flows well both in the skies above a park and ducking through tight alleyways in a floating airship port. The weapon variety is unexpectedly diverse and offer a wide variety of playstyles and loadouts so there's gonna be something for everyone.\n\nI really can't think of anything else to say about this game. It's honestly one of the best games I've played.  Buy it. Play it.","November 6, 2015","true","13.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Come on, people, cheer up and don't kill yourself. You have so much to live for!\n\nAt first I was wondering what I had gotten myself into? The motion made me dizzy, I found it hard to focus let alone aim. After a while I  started to feel comfortable. After that I started discovering different weapons and perks in different planes and began learning how to properly use them. Frankly, this game makes me feel like a God with all the control I have over motion. Spray and Pray is not recommended. It really pays to tap fire. Also, use your secondaries and "perks" defensively. For instance, someone chasing me? I dump toxic gas behind me. Otherwise, I just pepper the air with it so it weakens enemies so that I can finish them off with my primary.\n\nThere are several weapons I just can't get the hang of (I applaud anyone  using the hammers or vines successfully which are Close-Combat weapons).  But feel like I can defend myself without worrying about someone being OP.  And the creativity of the Dev is so surprising. Who would have thought to give magical powers to an airplane?  Love bringing those curses down upon enemies (trick is to hit them to begin with).  I'm sure he'll add even more crazy planes to this wonderful game.\n\nBTW You can host a game and people will join you . Had 10 people on my "server" battling it out for an hour. Think I'll go for 20 next time to see how many actually show up.\n\nSure, the game isn't finished yet (probably never will be in literal sense of the word as the Dev loves working on it and it will continue to grow). That's a good thing. Now we just need to start building the player-base.

If you go to the game's Reddit or see reviews, you see people who love the game and like it. However I don't see it, and the lack of updates since November 2015 feels wrong to me.\n\nThe game is OK. It works, and it has more than a few features. My biggest problem is the controls. The planes have no weight to them and that just wrong. No matter what other good Dogfighting game you look at you will find that the planes have weight to them. Crimson Skies had weight in their aircraft, and Rouge Squadron had weight on its ships. No matter what the biggest problem with the game is the bad controls. The lack of weight not only feels wrong, but you also don't get a good sense of where the ground is and where the sky is.\n\nAnd the fact the developers say the game's finished, and they haven't updated it since November of 2015, is just wrong. The game needs a few refinements here and there. And they could add so much more to it.

The game is designed around having fast and responsive reflexes, so if you are coming from a game like War Thunder it may take some getting used to. However, once you get the hang of it, you'll be dipping and diving in ways you never thought you would.\nThe visual style is also atounding, you can really pull an artsy-claymation vibe from the asthetics. I also like how no matter what orientation you are, the maps are designed so well that you can always pull off a cool trick or just straighten up again.\nIt's a shame that there are no Aussie Servers, but from what Wilnyl has said it will all be implemented in the future, and lag is barely a problem. The Menus can also be a bit clunky, but that might just be me.\nthis is definately worth the $9.99 you pay for, heck I'd pay $19.99 for this masterpiece.

I recommend buying it at full price if you are an air combat fan (if you like War Thunder or Rise of Flight, you'll fit right in) or if you want a relaxing, arcade-like action game to play with friends.\n\nThe planes do feel different enough to make your decision a meaningful choice, although a couple of the planes have abilities that seem to be more "interesting" than "useful". A couple of the planes have weaponry or features that are a breath of fresh air to the air combat genre - for example, a poisonous trail to throw off your foes, or a tether that does damage as long as you maintain line of sight. Others however feel a bit too powerful or unfair - for example, laser-guided missiles that are an almost guaranteed kill when fired at close range. Others seem too complicated or situational to be of any real use, though everything can be useful under certain circumstances.\n\nDodging in and out of obstacles and buildings is a huge gameplay feature and perhaps this game's greatest strength and most unique feature. It feels tense, fun, and dangerous and is the kind of thing you would never see in a more "realistic" flight sim. Collision damage is severe but fair and the level design deserves a mention here for being very conducive to building-dodging without outright requiring it.\n\nOverall, I'd put this game at about 85/100 - it's a fun game that benefits from smart, innovative game design and suffers from a lack of balance and polish - and for the current asking price of $9.99 it's well worth your investment.","December 26, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm 5hrs in now and I'm only starting to get used to the speed of this game's gameplay. No other dogfighting game has this level of high speed acrobatics and crazy mechanics. The weapon choices are unique and interesting, even when shooting people is getting tiring you can try out the obstacle race mode which is definately challenging in a good way. The controls are tight and responsive, to make the tight maneuvering and dogfighting possible.\n\nDefinately fun, but don't expect to be an MLG pro NoScoper in your first game, this game actually rewards skill and practice. I know that is confusing to many people with 0.2 hrs played complaining about losing. ;)","May 6","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only way to find a match is to do the Quick Game option, and even then, you might find a match with only 2 or 3 other people.\n-Some servers are somewhat laggy, even if they are in your region with decent ping.

The skill ceiling is quite high but you get noticeably better as you practice, making the whole experience extremely rewarding. Contrary to some opinions, I think that this game is very well balanced and if a certain weapon is abused by the opponents me and my team mates can always pick a suitable counter-build.\n\nThere have always been servers up although in one case there was only one server, which was full. Another small issue I have is the lack of any team work in modes like CTF and TDM.

Controls make for a great, fun flight expirence.\n\n-Great Maps. Youll want to explore every part of each map. Tons of cool paces in everymap.\n\n-Very Fun Gamemodes. Plenty of Gamemodes are avalible and there all intresting and take control of diffrent aspects of the game.\n\n- Fun Dog Fighting. Battles are intense and realy on the players skill for controlling the plane and fighting.\n\nCons:\n\n- (Bigest Problem) Very few to almost no people on at all times. Not exactly a game you can open and play a match with a few people, theres only some times where you can play a match with 6 or more people. Ussualy theres mabey 2 people on or no one.\n\n- Planes/Weponry gets sorta boring quick. You can mix up the wepons on each plane but theres some wepons that are completly over powering and some that are completly usless so you'll bassicly want to use those all the time.\n\n-Lack of maps. While the maps are amazing theres only about 6 of them and sometimes most people want to play the same map over and over giving you little chance to play all of them. and they do get older quick.\n\nI Still think this game is great. The game is early acess so most of the cons will probably be fixed later on.

Im not saying this is a huge drag (puntended) but for those who have a joystick it may be a bummer. next is the game itself. i like the tutorial as its an easy way to test configurations and learn the controls turns out the game absolutly goes berserk when using non-inverted controls, which i dont recommend anyway. i like the concept but servers arent friendly to newer players. it spawns you in a tight hallway most of the time that is real easy to smash into.","January 18","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only weakness that I can pick out is the fact that it has no player base so most of the time you're left to verse bots which are inhumanly difficult. I'm talking making nearly every shot with a machine gun difficult. The should also be a bit more options when hosting a server, such as an option to turn those bots off or change their difficulty and definitely the option to set a level cap for your server because I had a level 37 enter onto my server of level 1-5's and he was continually reking us.

The controller menu only has options such as use mouse as yaw, and inverted mouse. You can't change what keys do what, and the controller support is horrible with my right joystick firing whenever I move it up, but in total, it is a good game if you somehow get controller to work or use mouse and keyboard. It costs a bit too much for what it offers though. What you get is a single player tutorial (there are no bots) which just includes balloons flying around which you can yest weapons on, and then multiplayer and LAN, which are both pretty good, but you can't use LAN unless you have someone else in your house with this game, and the multiplayer option is quick connect, which connects you to a random server. Although, as I said, it costs a bit too much for early access and what it offers.\n\nAs I said, I will change my review to positive if you change the controller menu.

I wanted the dev to succeed in making something amazing. It's clear that this is a unique product and has a passionate userbase.\n\nBut I just can't get past the terrible controls.\n\nNo matter what configuration I use, something about them just doesn't feel right. I've played a fair amound of 6-degree-shooters before, but this is something spectacularly bad.\n\nOkay, a great example: On the options menu, you have X and Y sensitivity options. You would think that setting them at equal levels would lead to equal sensitivity in their respective directions, right?\n\nWrong!\n\nBecause most modern screens are widescreen, the Y axis is MUCH more sensitive than the X axis.  You can try cranking up the X axis sensitivity to max, but it just still feels wrong, even if you try to compensate by lowering Y axis sensitivity.\n\nAs for the actual dogfighting, the crux of the game, it's rather boring and suffers from the same problem that Insurgency suffers from: actually spotting enemies is incredibly difficult. And while that makes sense for the modern military setting of Insurgency, for a colorful, fast-paced game, it is irksome.\n\nAnd if you do spot another plane in the game, you will probably have  a very difficult time trying to tell which team it is on, because despite there being red and blue teams, all the text is tiny, and basically looks gray,  I found myself squniting to read the names instead, and then checking to see which team they were on, on the scoreboard (at which point, they had usually flown away, around some object).\n\nOther than that, I don't think the weapons are as creative or unusual as some would have you believe. Especially if you've played any F2P shooter on the market for the past 10 years.\n\nDon't buy into the hype of the passionate user-base just yet. The game still needs some time to develop and fix these, and other, glaring issues.","June 2, 2015","false","1.4"," 56 of 202 people (28%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","28","56","202","12","43"

Playing with mouse/keyboard It was a little weird for the first 10 minutes, but after some training I was able to perform all the crazy stunts seen in the trailer and got pretty good scores to.\n\nThe controls are wonderfully responsive and nothing is more satisfying than rushing through tight corridors with someone tailgaiting you when suddenly doing a 180 (which is possible in tight corridores) laying a trap and seeing the enemy rush into his own downfall.\n\n\nSo, is this game worth it? At the moment, for 10€ absolutely.\nIt has a few minor issues, such as hard recognition between friend and foe at long distances, but nothing that spoils enjoyment in any way.

The game's simple graphics may fool some, but the experience underneath is better than most flight-based games out there. The game lets you choose from (at the time of this review) 5 different planes, all of which can be customized and have unique abilites. When you get into a match and choose your plane, you're spawned in to what is virtually an extreme flight maze. Some maps may seem open ended and simple to navigate, but there is always a hidden passageway to fly through, or a series of crushers to navigate. The game overall is amazing, and left a good taste in my mouth for other games like this. Good job you guys!","November 27, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As any early access game, it needs balancing, and the Gun Game mode isn't much fun because of the way the guns rotate. However, there is no one plane that has too much of an advantage over the other, and with skill any plane and weapon can take out any other plane using any other weapon. The controls take a little getting used to, and can seem jumpy at first, but once you get the hang of it, they feel very fluid, allowing you to pull off some impressive aerial maneuvers. The game also has some gorgeous graphics and effects, rounded out by well-done sound. I also wish that there were more people online, but that will come with time and reputation. Overall, 9/10 for great gameplay, graphics, and controls.","July 11, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not many people playing, so you're either going against a couple of people at a time or bots.  Nobody likes bots.\n2. No radar.  These levels aren't very complex, but with how disorienting the movement can be at times it's incredibly hard to find anyone, especially if it's 1v1.  Creates a lot of dead air (hahahahaha)\n3. IMO, some broken weapons that, once they hit you, you're pretty screwed and there's nothing you can do about it.  Weapons like that don't exactly belong in a game like this, in my opinion.\n\nIn spite of those complaints, pulling of stunts in this game is worth it and if you get a decent amount of people playing, it's a hell of a lot of fun!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN6lKqLvMnI","November 3, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's simple graphics may fool some, but the experience underneath is better than most flight-based games out there. The game lets you choose from (at the time of this review) 5 different planes, all of which can be customized and have unique abilites. When you get into a match and choose your plane, you're spawned in to what is virtually an extreme flight maze. Some maps may seem open ended and simple to navigate, but there is always a hidden passageway to fly through, or a series of crushers to navigate. The game overall is amazing, and left a good taste in my mouth for other games like this. Good job you guys!","November 27, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I reccommend this to everyone who likes fast-paced games like Titanfall or SmashBros. There is a lot of coordination involved, but you get the hang of it. The maps are detailed and well designed, riddled with tunnels and trenches (which you can fly through). There are a few small bugs, and sometimes the UI acts funny, but overall this game is seamless.

There's a wide variety of weapons and planes to choose from, with even more coming. The maps are perfectly sized and creative, and I would personally love to see even more. There's also a nice amount of gamemodes to choose from and I've found almost no bugs/glitches.\n\nThe 2 main problems I see with this game are:\n-A little bit pricey for an early access game. I understand if you need a wider budget or something, but $10 just seems a little too much.\n-Nobody ever seems to be playing it. Seriously. The servers are always deadly quite. There is a subreddit dedicated to this game with regular developer updates and the server list makes it look like nobody plays anymore. I am honestly confused; where are all the players?\n\nBut overall, Air Brawl is a good game with a bright future.\n\n(As a side note, something I would love to see in this game is music. It would be awesome to have the kind of music from the trailer playing while you're in the middle of an intense fight.)","September 14, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have tried numerous other aerial combat style games across different platforms and this is honestly the perfect one for me.  The graphics are enjoyable, the combat is fun, the classes add a dynamic that a more "realistic" machine guns and missiles style game would be.  It is fairly easy to start up.\n\nThe good of this game is that it is insanely fun.  The controls are exactly what you'd expect, mouse for look/steer and then a/d for turning, w/s for accel/decel.  There is the option to invert.  The combat is fun, there are plenty of game modes (race, capture the flag, ffa, team deathmatch, king of the hill) that will eventually be fleshed out with more maps, you can host your own servers, the list goes on.\n\nThe bad: right now the game is new and there aren't a ton of players.  There is a large skill gap and typically in any combat mode there will be one person scoring the vast majority (80%++) of the kills.\n\nHOWEVER, this can really only be fixed by more people getting into the game so if any of that makes you hesitant, buy the game and help fix the issue of low player base!\n\nI cannot reccomend this game enough, if you have ANY interest in racing, aerial combat, cartoonish flying, or supporting a game from it's early stages that actually deserves it, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not purchasing this game.","August 9, 2015","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I recomend that you buy this game while its in early access. Here is a list of features it needs in the future:\n-VR support (for things such as the vive and the oculus rift)\n-A prettier interface\n-Full controller support\n-Maybe modding support and a steam workshop\nI see lots of potential! 8/10","July 7, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fights are exhilerating, adrenaline will be had if you commit to this game; however, you can't really commit to the game much anymore since the community has died down significantly; there are still some active days/times though and you almost certainly will end up adding the people online to play with later because the community still playing are awsome.\n\nIf you want to play this game there are a few things you should know. Firstly, the online community is mostly dead; nevertheless, you can still get on during the weekends and find a match occasionally, there is a subreddit where matchmaking happens relatively often (reddit.com/r/airbrawl), and it's not that hard to find a match once you add some people in game. Second, the controls are fantastic, hard, but fantastic; you will absolutely be bad at this game when you start, but don't get discouraged, you will rapidly improve. And lastly the developer no longer supports this game as they have moved on to their newest project.\n\nBottom line: Would I recommend this game, absolutely! But only if you are willing to suck at the start, make some friends to find matches, or have some friends you want to play with.","April 17","true","34.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(and hosting a game seems not working :/ )\nOr playing with bot could be fun, but they are just too badass for me, can you ad a thing to change their difficulty ?\n\nBut even with thoses small problems, this game is insanely cool !\n","April 30","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason I say that, is because the servers right now are mostly empty and it is a lot more fun to play with a group of friends. It has a fun variety of game modes, but it could really do with a few more maps. If you have some free time and some friends that want to play I would give it a whirl.\n\nNote: This game plays much better with a controller.","April 29","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
