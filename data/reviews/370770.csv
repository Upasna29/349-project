Yeah. But there's quite a few glaring issues that I can see so far... Gonna keep this brief.\n\nPros:\nIt's cute\nIt's fast-paced and engaging\nIt's nostalgic, reminding me of the flash shooters I used to play\n\nCons:\nThe Default Weapon: This thing is ... It's meh. It feels like they're punishing you for respawning with this thing, and there's no replacement like there is with other weapons. So you can't personalize this thing, and if anyone has a pick-up weapon, you're more or less ♥♥♥♥ed. The basic gun should be, well, basic, but not inferior in functionality.\n\nCould use some tweaks.. The Grenade Launcher is Godly, Snipers are, hit or miss.. You hit and win, or miss and die.. Rocket launchers: I've seen too many people just rush to shoot these in my face...\nPowerups: Well, most of these are alright. The Ice thing feels a bit useless, and the electric shock powerup takes a while to activate for not much in terms of payoff.. Then Invisibility lets you kick someone's teeth in with minimal retaliation capacity...\n\nThe Shop: Yes, you can potentially get everything by playing, but it seems they want to limit HOW MUCH you can get in your total amount of play time for free. You get "Bits", which are the currency for everything, which you gamble away, for cosmetics/weapons. Except the weapons are mixed in with the cosmetics, you only get 10 bits per LEVEL UP, and it takes 200 bits in order to afford to gamble for the slim chance at a new weapon to equip.\n\n\nCan I recommend this game? Not yet, but hopefully I can soon.","April 3","false","8.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robyhub/recommended/370770/","robyhub","OlathianWhiskey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robyhub/","209 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe best way to put it is I have a love/hate relationship with this game.\nMechanics wise, it's extremely similar to a flash game I used to play called Raze- in essence, it's a 8 man murderfest. You have your standard (Team) Deathmatch, and also a unique mode called "collectors," where you need to kill enemies, collect their power and deposit it at a bank. And this is where the love/hate comes in.\n\nCollectors can be extremely fun when the teams are equal- but usually, they aren't. A lot of the players have a mentality where if they join a game they can't die. Ever. You'll see a person come in, get shot a few times, and then leave. This applies to any gamemode, but Collectors is where it hurts the most. You'll need people on the defensive, taking energy from the enemy's core, but also people on the defense making sure people don't steal any from yours. So whenever this balance is broken, the game becomes unfair. During a 4v4, getting an ultra kill is extremely satisfying- but if it's some 3v2 where our team is kicking ♥♥♥, it just kinda loses its fun for both me and the enemies. My teamates might like it, who knows? In the Deathmatch modes, people leaving is a bit less of an issue unless it turns into a 1v3 or something.\n\nAll this, I can deal with- I'll get a little mad, sure, but that's only a few games. But there's one issue, a glaring one that's an absolute pain and is in every match. All the players are de-synced.\nYou can get hit by bullets meters away from you, you can get killed by people not even on the same elevation as you, and that's whenever I really question why this is a thing. I can get lag and some teleporting or rubberbanding, but this desync is absolutely insane and really ruins the game whenever I manage to swan dive through an enemy's bullets flawlessly, but apparently one hit me and I'm god damn dead. This is especially annoying with the 1-Hit Kill rocket launchers, which you can see the rockets perfectly fine, but even if you're miles above it, you're dead because of it. This way of dealing with lag in a PvP game like this is a way to make you mad due to stray bullets counting as hits.\n\nI know I spoke really negatively about the game, but whenever the players have an equal skill level and the lag isn't too noticeable, the game is EXTREMELY fun. It can degrade to absolute madness at times that's left me in stitches, though some of the unlockable weapons are a bit unbalanced. For example, the Minigun can rip things to shreds in seconds, and the shuriken gun thing's shuriken mines last a little too long. Other than that, the weapons are pretty nicely balanaced and seem to encourage getting the jump and flanking enemies as most of them can kill pretty quickly. Though variety in the starting weapons would be nice, or at least make it viable enough so you don't die as soon as you spawn.\n\nAll in all, this game has a lot of good, but hampered by a small but significant amount of bad. It's also pretty cheap. Though, it hasn't garnered much of a following yet, and I'm fearful that the community might die out within its early months.","March 30","true","3.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/370770/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSomething that may surprise you is the fact that I haven’t played many arena multiplayer shooters in years. It was a phase that I thoroughly enjoyed at the end of my teenage years when I was fortunate enough to get in on the original Quake titles and similar titles from the late 1990’s. The Internet was ♥♥♥♥ back then in Australia as most people were limited to dial up. I imagine that some of you would have no idea how some games worked back then given the speed limitations. But we managed and we enjoyed what we had. LAN parties were much more popular then if you had a set up supporting one. Thankfully friends would occasionally bring their rigs and we’d party on for hours playing the best games of that era. But it’s long ago. We’ve all grown up in the intervening years and most of us, including myself, don’t live anywhere close to the same area. Thankfully high speed Internet makes playing games such as Holodrive not only possible but a reality.\n\nAnd the reality of playing Holodrive struck me within my very first matches.  Although Holodrive has its own concepts that make it a unique game I couldn’t help the fact that I was reminiscing a time that I thought was lost. It wasn’t the same friends that I had come to know and love – and love to kill when playing – but it didn’t need to be. I had forgotten just how fun a game such as this could be. I had played a number of online games in the years since my arena shooter days but for the most part they were of the MMRPG games such as EverQuest, World of Warcraft, etc.  It’s safe to say that Holodrive is an ode to some of the best gaming experiences of my life and for that I am quite grateful.\n\nThe game itself is extremely fun. The action is fast and furious. You’ll die – unless you’re insanely talented – and just as quickly you’ll be killing the ever loving ♥♥♥♥ out of your enemies. I won my first game in deathmatch mode but before the final scores flashed up on the screen when the game had finished I was certain that I had gotten my ♥♥♥ kicked and I’d have been more than happy with a mid table finish. Color me shocked when I saw the final score. It’s that type of game at the early levels. I can’t write about the advanced levels because I haven’t played the game long enough to experience the ‘end game’ but if all you are after is some casual fun and you love multiplayer shooters then there’s no reason for you not to pick this game up.\n\nI don’t generally like games that get given away on FAILMID (that’s not where I got my copy from, I got it from the developer directly as per usual) because they’re given away in such mass quantity and is a sign of a troubled game or product but I have to say that this time it is precisely why that site exists. It got players enmasse playing their game very quickly and helped them develop a community. I have yet to speak to anyone before, during or following a game but the games that I played have been filled with more players than bots and this is a great sign for the game.\n\nI’ve treasured my short experience thus far with Holodrive and thoroughly recommend it. I can’t wait to play more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheetz/recommended/370770/","Cheetz","Lone Cheetah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheetz/","168 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHolodrive is a nice little fast paced 2D side scroller shooter where you play as little cute robots that love explosions.\nIf you loved playing games like Teeworlds, Raze or Plazma Burst, you'll definitely love Holodrive as well.\n\nAs for the pros and cons\n\nPros:\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Has microtransactions, but only for visuals, game is not P2W in any way. (Taking in consideration that this will be F2P at some point)\n+ Great gunplay and mechanics. 7 different types of weapons, each with their own strenghts and weaknesses. Weapons also have different variants which can be unlocked. There are also a lot of different powerups which can be picked up.\n+ Simple and easy to learn.\n\nCons:\n- Lag and poor optimization. This is a big one. It's just frustrating to get killed by bullets which didn't actually hit you. Players sometimes are rubberbanding around the map which is annoying. It gets to the point where it ruins all the fun and you can't enjoy playing the game because it's a massive lagfest.\n\n\nAll in all, I still recommend this game. It can be a lot of fun at the times when it doesn't lag like crazy. Hopefully this will get fixed as the game progresses further. As well as more content, curently it's a bit shy on the gamemodes and maps, but I didn't list it as a con becase I trust that there's going to be a lot more content as the game reaches it's final stages of Early Access.","March 31","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To begin with this game is pure fun with fast and furious skilled action. It has good graphics and a lot of cosmetics that you can acquire either through playing matches or buying packs. Despite the pretty graphics the game doesn’t provide you with a lot of options to change the settings as it only has the preset options. It doesn’t support borderless window mode or an ability to resize the game screen. The game itself is pretty simple. It’s all about mouse movement and precision with different types of weapons and power ups but the developers didn’t economy a time a tutorial that explains every weapon, what they do and how they should be used so that’s a big plus for me as previous Early Access games that I’ve played didn’t include tips or a tutorial. There are only several minor issues that I found which is just personal preferences. I did not discover anything game breaking that would cause me to stop playing.\n\nPROS:Fast-paced – ( medium maps,3v3 probably that’s the most people I’ve encountered so far maybe it can go up more but there’s no chance of getting bored as there is no time to rest and there’s no where you can hide and camp you are always dragged into the action)\n\nGraphics – ( even though you can’t customize anything the game has eye catchy graphics)\n\nCosmetics – (It makes game more funny and enjoyble that you can customize your character and all it takes to gain the cosmetics is that you just have to play game)\n\nWeapons – (there’s couple of weapons that take completely different styles to play which makes it more entertaining)\n\nLength – ( matches doesn’t last too long, they last exactly a satisfactory length and then make you wanna hop into another)\nCONS:Missing Cons – (i haven't encoured anything like that,so im just saying it just to let everyone know that i'm not missing anything,i just couldn't find anything to brag about,i've seen some people whining about connection issues,but i personally haven't experienced anything like that)\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified[www.steamified.com] Community Reviews.

With the amount of cosmetics there are you can make amazing combinations. To put Holodrive in perspective it is a two dimensional platformer multiplayer shooter where you play as robots with a variety of weapons. A plus is also buying the early supporter pack for the price of the base game because you get to copies of the game to so you can give one to a friend. It also gives you a ton of coins so you can get cosmetics and new weaons right off the bat like I did with the shiruken launcher. Overall, Holodrive is an amazing game, but some weapons need to be balanced a bit more like the shotgun because I can grab it and get an average of 5 kills without running out of ammo where with the rarer weapons I can only get 2 or 3 at most. This is the greatest game and everyone who dislikes it is a quitter or is just trying to play the wrong type of game that suits them.","April 10","true","7.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Early access review, so take it with a grain of salt- but long story short, I don't have much hope for the long term success of this game.\n\nThe devs claim it's not a pay-to-win game, but that's not actually true. In Holodrive, you earn an in-game currency called "bits" that you can use to purchase additional items to customize your bot. You earn bits by playing the game, getting XP and leveling up. You can also earn bits by doing daily missions, things like that. You use the bits to buy item blind-packs called holopacks, and in each one is an item that you can equip on your bot. I know what you're saying- "oh no, in game currency!". Hang on- that's not the real problem.. in-game currency by itself does not make a game pay-to-win.\n\nPart of the problem is that some of these items skew the balance of the game in a PROFOUND way. IE) there's a rocket launcher that fires through walls, rapid fire machine gun that ricochets off of everything, flamethrower that does an obscene amount of damage over time, etc. Oh, and by the way most of these upgraded weapons do a LOT more damage than their non-powered counterparts. That said, that by itself isn't the root of the problem. Players need to be rewarded for their hard work, right? Giving super experienced players uberpowerful weapons is kind of lame if you're trying to sustain a community of new players, but fundamentally I get it.\n\nThe real problem is that you can buy bits using real money. Yes, microtransactions. Everybody's favorite feature. This means that you can spend a wad of cash to essentially buy the items you want- and dominate everyone else with overpowered weapons. THAT is why Holodrive is pay-to-win by even the most forgiving definition. If these items were 100% cosmetic I would have no problem with microtransactions- but they're not.\n\nWith that out of the way lets talk about the problems with the actual game:\n\nFirst, they drop you in without explaining ANYTHING. The tutorial tells you things you should already know if you have a steam acount and a pulse. "Hey, heres how you shoot. Here's WASD movement. Here's how you tie your shoes". I hate tutorials like this because somebody spent real time working on it, and it's a joke- nobody has ever jumped into a platformer and said "Hrm i wonder how you jump?". Instead, tell us about the teleporters! I had over an hour of in-game time before I knew WTF they were or how they worked- i just kept getting randomly teleported to other places and had no clue why. Or how about explain wtf the powerups are or when/why they might be useful? Experimentation is great, but when I'm getting analy penetrated by a guy with glowing armor and a rocket launcher that phases through solid walls it's kinda hard, yeah? The "Collector" game mode has great potential but so many people don't know how to play it because the only time you ever see instructions are on a loading screen, and even then they're super vague. What are the red walls? Sometimes they turn green and you can go through? Under what conditions do they turn green? Is it a timer? did somebody press a button? Information like this is ridiculously easy to communicate to the player, so it's frustrating to run into issues like this.\n\nThe UI is a complete mess- finding things on the main menu is a challenge, as the sections of the menu sometimes don't make any sense. For example- the area where you equip items you've unlocked is called "album". I could think of 100 different words that would better describe that section of the menu- here's an easy one "ITEMS", or "INVENTORY".\nThe in-game HUD isn't much better. You get helpful arrows showing the direction of other players on the screen if they're within range, but information that is immediately useful (such as which powerup you're carrying) is pushed to the margins of the screen, forcing you to take your eyes off the action.\n\nI played most of my time using mouse and keyboard, but also tried out gamepad so I could do a thorough review- gamepad support is barely there. I mean, you can use a gamepad and the game will work- but good luck figuring out which buttons to press, because all of the on-screen instructions will remain keyboard commands. Cycling weapons on the gamepad is a nightmare.. using bumpers to cycle through weapons? C'mon, it's 2016- use a weapon wheel.. infinitely faster and actually possible to utilize muscle memory rather than tap-tap-tapping while you stare at the tiny icons under your character hoping you picked the right one.\n\nI've got other gripes with this game, but I'm going to stop here because I'm ready to be done with this game in every sense of the word.","April 25","false","2.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Described by the creators as "Mario Kart meets Quake, in 2d", this game is a 2d run-and-gun set in an arena where players can run, fly and shoot their enemies into mixed nuts and bolts. Imagine Metal Slug, Contra, Shoot Many Robots or even Thing Thing. Now place that gameplay in a 2d arena with other players, and weapons and powerups to freely pick up and replenish as long as you stay alive. Now add a community with in-game purchases for cosmetics and different gun loadouts. Then make each player's character a robotic dummy which can be dressed up as yo please.

It reminds me a lot of a title I used to play called The Showdown Effect. Basically, it's a 2D arena-style shooter.\n\nYou have a target reticle that guides where your bullets go, but, unlike The Showdown Effect, your bullets are projectiles that hit everything in front of and behind the reticle, instead of only what is underneath. This makes aiming in this game extremely easy for anyone to pick up.\n\nThe game, though, is extremely casual and battles can be largely determined by the items a player holds. If you get into a duel with a player who has the "Disarm" powerup, for example, he can literally knock the gun out of your hands from half a screen away for 5 seconds. In a game where it only takes 2 seconds to kill someone, this is a death sentence. Other powerups such as an invicible force-field, 2x damage (which, combined with the already low TTK can kill enemies in a second) are not much better for creating fair fights.\n\nAs a future free-to-play game, though, I wont hesitate to recommend this to anyone interested in playing a casual, fun, 2D shooter.","April 4","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The UI is bad. Some people been complaning about the match making but ive been having no issues what so ever so pass there. The main problem. Its not a very skillful game. Here are the skills i can see in this game. Basic k+m usage, Speed, and who ever gets to the weapon first. As soon as u pick up nearly any pickup. Theres 3 kills confirmed for you, no matter what. Its just annoying that this is how the games are played. Who every reaches an item first, and the thing is, its not like items are rare and spread around the map. No there is an item pick up every 5 steps away. Like theres sometimes even too many pick ups on some maps!!! Another thing, maps are ok but not very many of them due to the fact its early access and yes take this with a grain of salt its early access everything could change\n\n\nOver all 6/10.\nNot worth $5 but if its on sale or something might be worth picking it up to see if you enjoy side scrolling shooters.\n(Note i got this game for free off failMID)\n","May 14","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However finding a game with players is rare for me. It usually puts me in a server by myself, I don't really know how the matchmaking works for this game but perhaps there should be a server list or some other way of connecting to random public games. Although barring that I totally recommend it.","May 27","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It says my ping is fine, and often times the other players ping is fine too, it just feels weird. Sometimes projectiles feel like they dont render/hit where they're not supposed to (rockets are a huge culprit of this).\n\nNeeds a gamemode selection, I know the game is closed beta and player counts are low but deathmatch is boring.\n\nFinally, why are there weapons behind your random cosmetic system.\nPlease don't put functionality behind walls like that. Have as much randomly rolling for dumb hats as you want, just take the weapons out of that system and put them somewhere else, I wouldn't even mind if they were levling rewards.\n\nBeyond those complaints I've enjoyed most the matches I've played well enough.","May 28","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
