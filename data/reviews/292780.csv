Title was a bit misleading along with the prologue, thought it was to go against Thunder and LIghtning, like going after Darkness in the first game, not help them... then again...\n\nStill, that's just minor things, and I'm being a bit nit-picky.\n\nStill a good game for kids; they may not get much of the jokes or references right off the bat. Learn a few things about weather and how it works, along with a bit of economics... although that's very boring stuff so leave that to the carrot and the board of directors to discuss amongst themselves.","May 3, 2014","true","8.7"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","0"

While there are some slight changes here and there to keep the game feeling fresh, Pajama Sam 2 is packed with all the distinct features that made the first game so amazing: more pointing and clicking, more item collecting and more existential journeys of self-discovery. Instead of collecting socks, Sam collects a large variety of puzzle pieces, which is likely symbolic of the courage and morality he must piece together in order to confront his crippling fear of thunder and lightning. Speaking of puzzles, Pajama Sam 2 is like a puzzle with every piece in its proper place: with its moving story, well-crafted characters and exciting gameplay, this game feels incredibly polished and complete. Throughout its development, the geniuses at Humongous Entertainment must have known they had a masterpiece on their hands.\n\nIf I had to give this game a score, I would give it a 10/10 with a complimentary smiley face.\n","July 3, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Like 10/10's and what not. To be frank, I like these games as well. But are they absolute perfect? Hell, no. Not by my standards at least. The best Humongous game was probably Pajama Sam 1, and I'd probably give that a 7/10 or 8/10. But what about Pajama Sam 2? Ah yes, dear reader. What ABOUT Pajama Sam 2?\n\nThe game does have a lot of color and charm. It looks nice , and there are plenty of nice jokes only adults would get, as usual. However, the biggest dip in the game would be the story. In the original Pajama Sam, the story had just enough control in the player's hands to make the story build to an ultimate climax no matter how they got their objects. In Pajama Sam 2, the same thing is present, but out of nowhere, after you put in the third missing piece, a new story element pops out of nowhere in the appearance of a new character that is there purely for the reason of building tension. What was interesting about the tension in Pajama Sam 1, is it was shown through the visuals and the build-up both inside and outside of the story. Everything was connected, but detached enough for you to have your own adventure.\n\nAnd I think the biggest reason that the story just isn't that good is because of the set-up. Pajama Sam 1 had the point of the story be that you don't need to be afraid of the dark. Simple but still good. And the story built up to that overall point being the main message. In Pajama Sam 2, Sam instantly finds out, "Hey! My fears are just controlled by a couple ladies in a sky-factory! There's nothing to be afraid of!", leaving nothing to be learned but just having the player wait until the ending finally arrives.\n\nPajama Sam 2 is, by no means, a bad game. If you liked the charm of the last game, it's still here. At least that hasn't been killed off.... right Atari?  But Pajama Sam 1 was so good, and I think Humongous tried to bring back the magic by doing a lot of the same things from the first game all over again. Sam overcoming his fears, the room with four questions, the lost items scattered across the world. It's all the same. Hell, Pajama Sam 2 loves to reference the first game a lot as well. You run into the carrot, some of the portraits have characters from Pajama Sam 1 in them for no reason, and there are binoculars for you to go look at the Land of Darkness. Pajama Sam 2 is basically Humongous saying, "It worked in the first game. Let's just do it again!" And I don't like that.","January 5","false","2.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Puzzles are easy, meaning it's a great introduction to the genre. It was one of my favorites growing up, and I am happy to report it's still fun and funny. In addition to the point-and-click gameplay, each background is full of stuff to click on. It's like a pop-up book, which for some reason totally captivates me.","September 22, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I'm absolutely positive I had indeed played this one before, though I didn't think so at first for some reason. So, nostalgia, everywhere. Again, though, enjoyable game, really, even with the nostalgia aside. Interesting enough but simple puzzles and some nice writing, I approve.","November 16, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In order to accomplish his goal he goes to his attic to "visit" the weather company high up in the clouds. Upon his visit, he accidently causes all of the weather machines to malfunction and the fate of the weather conditions of the world rests upon Sam. Like the first game, it's a simple point and click adventure that is very easy to navigate. The characters in this installment are very lively and very appealing to look at. I can just imagine the creative process for these games. The jokes are very clever and will guarantee that you will laugh at least once upon one playthrough. While there's plenty of areas to click on to entertain you for hours. If you love the first game, then this one is a must buy. Kids as well as adults will favor this game as a great sequal to one of Humongous Entertainment's most popular characters.","March 30, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And now thanks to Night Dive, I can play it forever. Not too long ago I bought all the Humongous games on sale for $25, so now whenever a new old HE! game comes out on Steam, I get those too. And since most of these games are compatable and bundled with ScummVM, I can play them with high-res pixel filters that make the games look better than ever, especially on HD monitors.

I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself exploring one room for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of not finding the solution is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the worlds are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a puzzle to earn a new area, and you would use that new area to earn more puzzles. In layman's terms, to earn more rooms, you had to perfect current puzzles. They ditched that and added the ability to google the solutions. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock the first room. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many rooms are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging rooms, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to play ever variation.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't So Frightening is its expasive community. There are lots of flash games for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:\n\n10/10\nBUY THIS GAME.","August 22, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
