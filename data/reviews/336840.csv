"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/336840/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","edit: As far as what the developer has said the glitches I stated in this review should now be fixed and won't be a problem anymore.\n\nColor guardians is a great addition to the classic runner genre with a new mechanic that makes the game have very fast paced and hectic gameplay. However it does have inherrant problems that need to be fixed.\n\nThe game is a classic runner game that is heavily inspired by experts in the genre such as temple run and subway surfer. Although that has a very interesting mechanic that makes it stand out. Your character you play as can change colours between yello, blue and red. These colours are used to progress through certain parts of the level and to collect different coloured orbs. The mechanic creates fast paced gameplay requiring you to very quickly change colours in order to successfully progress through the level.\n\nYou also have other obstacles to avoid. These can include walls, moving enemies or spikes. There is a very wide variety in these obstacles. The game never leaves you with repetitive gameplay. All the levels are very different and keep you amused throughout. They are very challenging and aren't easy to complete first time.\n\nThere is plenty in the game for collectors and achievement hunters. The levels contain optional orbs to pick up. These require you to be the colour of them. Depending on how many orbs you pick up, you get a different ranking for the completion of the level. This can keep people entertained trying to 100% every level for a long time.\n\nThe game has a very stand out graphics style. The cartoony look is represented throughout the game and is consistent. What I found really unique is the way in which the world reacts to how you are doing in the game. If you aren't doing very well then the levels turn very grey because you aren't colllecting many colours. As you collect more colours the world becomes more and more colourful. This is a beatiful addition that makes the gameplay more fun for people.\n\nThe game has multiple control methods. You can use classic mouse and keyboard. However I wouldn't recommend it. A controller is key to being able to play this game properly. The colours of your character is optimized to the colours of the buttons on your controller. Therefore it is very hard to remember the keys on the keyboard wheras it is very easy with a controller.\n\nThe game features 2 controller setups for this. They have one for a playstation controller, and another for an xbox controller. This convenience does make it much easier for people with different controllers. However this was very annoying. I was using an xbox controller to play the game. I found that every time I rebooted up the game it defaulted to playstation controls. So I had to go in the options menu each time to reset this back again. This was an uneccessary hassle and was an annoyance.\n\nColor guardians options menu is also very lacking in the needed options. There are no graphics options besides the default fastest, good and fantastic. For a 3D game this is unnacceptable. Other seperate options should be present. You then only have 3 different resolution options to choose from. This is unnaceptable range of resolutions. Finally there is a full screen option. There are also seperate audio sliders for different settings. However this is all that is in the options menu. The menu is also extremely difficult to navigate with both mouse and controller and can be glitchy.\n\nWhile I was writing this review I had a very big issue with the navigating of the menu. For some reason when I clicked the back button to go out of the options menu the game automatically by itself went onto the new game button. This means it completely deleted all of the progress I have made and I now have to start from the beginning again. They definitely need to fix this issue to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.\n\nI would cautiously recommend this game to people. There are a lot of problems that could lead to bad gameplay for people. I would recommend waiting for a fix before buying it. I also think the asking price is a little high for the content at the moment. You should wait a bit and wait for a sale before buying in my opinion.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","May 12, 2015","true","6.3"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","26","29","3","4"

I'm so glad they were wrong, heheh, well maybe its just a subjective topic and we all have the right to express how we feel about it and that's okay. The thing is, I loved this game, right now I'm on the middle of the crystal cave and running my way through the 3rd boss, I love the dynamics and the colorful art, the game is not that hard to get and the levels are not that hard to finish, but that's just not enough, I need to get the 3 platinum stars and that need keeps me going for hours!\nMy review is over, go buy this game!","May 14, 2015","true","26.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Feels like guitar hero, honestly, the only thing I think about is getting all the orbs with perfect. I even kill myself, and restart the level until I get the 3 platinum starts, This game gets really hard, but I like the fact that the first levels feel easier, as you play the other environments. Nice graphics, really nice for an indie. I'm a bit used getting 2D games for $14.99, but this game looks a lot better than most of them. Fast paced, hard, and with a bit of feeling of some old classic games. Would totally recommend it to anybody :)!!!!","May 12, 2015","true","115.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trailbound/recommended/336840/","trailbound","Commander Raj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trailbound/","318 products in account","Plays like Bit.Trip Runner, Rayman Legends, and Guitar Hero had a baby on top of a Jackson Pollock painting; and I promise that's a good thing.\n\nUnlike most endless runners you actually have a lot of control as to where your character goes. Depending on the exact path you take you'll end up doubling back for more points or missing bonus orbs (points), it takes an almost 'strategy' to correctly play this game. In that regards, Color Guardians elevates itself from the rest of the endless runner pack.\n\nHelping it ascend further is it's multi-lanes mechanic. Instead of playing exactly like a rythym game where you HAVE to hit Button 'X' at this specific time, the game lets you sidestep certain obstacles if you are out of sync or focused on a different path. It even rewards finding your own way through a level, by letting you double back.\n\nColor Guardians has the precision of Guitar Hero, the goofy aesthetics of Rayman, and the gameplay of Bit.Trip Runner, but goes a step further than all of them by granting the player a level of control I've not seen in an Endless Runner. If you are looking for a break from narrative heavy and AAA titles and just want to hit a flurry of buttons for a hectic, fun time, get this game.","May 13, 2015","true","1.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

It would have been nice if you needed a certain amount of stars to unlock the boss fight at the end.","March 11","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aimei66/recommended/336840/","aimei66","aimei66","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aimei66/","121 products in account","Its a fun colourful little game that takes the typical mobile endless runner format, and turns it into something worth paying for. The mechanics are simple change between 3 different colours to collect orbs or pass barriers etc, get to the end to progress and try to collect all of the orbs for the best completion rate. There are some nice touches in there, like hitting the  orbs colour button as you pick it up increases its score value, which give it a rhythm type mechanic.\n\nThe difficulty level peaks a little too early for my taste, but they do introduce new mechanics right up to the last world. Thing is by half way through these new mechanics don't seem to greatly affect the games difficulty. However as you can complete the whole game in a few hours the game doesn't get old before it's finished. Recommended when on sale.","February 13","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
