What to say about this game? Well alot but I would rather not. You play as Irish McLeatherjacket\nwho is looking for his girlfriend and needs to find some crystals I guess? The plot really isn't very good overall. So anyway you are looking for your girlfriend the only way you know how golfing and fighting off the spirits the infest the course with a couple of different things like golf clubs and a golf ball gun. The combat is pretty ♥♥♥♥ed to be honest the ammo is next to impossible to find for the gun even though you are on a golf course and if you hit a ghost with your club you lose that club so be careful about which club you are swinging with. The voice acting is to be expected, rather mediocre. When you can tell whats actually being said it's very comedic and not always in the good sense. So short but sweet is it worth playing? Uh that's really up to you to decide. If you like akward golfing and combat mechanics then sure this is right up your alley. If you don't then I wouldn't suggest it. However for the low price of 99 cents if you have some spare pocket change it's worth the buy to joke about with your friends. 6/10 Didn't kill me.

I liked it.  Strange as that seems.  I remember reading a review of it many years ago and it getting paned, but seeing it now (never did see it in stores) and at $0.99 a copy, I can say it's definitely worth the selling price.  In for a weird ride, with old school graphics and a unique mutli-genre game play experience that is rough around the edges, than this is your game :)","June 19, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hobnobsTF2/recommended/358000/","hobnobsTF2","hobnobs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hobnobsTF2/","50 products in account","After hearing The Curse of Nordic Cove say that every word that leaves its mouth is teeming with useful information, I felt that someone needed to write a dissenting opinion. Before I start, however, I should state that to understand what its particularly imprudent form of corporatism has encompassed as a movement and as a system of rule, we have to look at its historical context and development as a form of splenetic politics that first arose in early twentieth-century Europe in response to rapid social upheaval, the devastation of World War I, and the Bolshevik Revolution. Be honest; can you in any way believe The Curse of Nordic :lol: Cove's claim that its wisecracks are Holy Writ? I cannot, mainly because I cannot promise not to be angry at it. I do promise, however, to try to keep my anger under control, to keep it from leading me—as it leads The Curse of Nordic Cove—to force me to undergo “treatment” to cure my “problem”.\n\nTrying to keep The Curse of Nordic Cove from eroticizing relations of dominance and subordination is a sucker's game. No matter how hard we try to stop it, it'll always find some new way to ignore compromise and focus solely on its personal agenda. It is apparent to me that The Curse of Nordic Cove is doing some pretty niddering things. Or, to restate that without meiosis, it will do anything to prevent us from critiquing its crazy, petulant soliloquies. Don't soliloquies that aim to prey on people's fear of political and economic instability deserve—and in some sense, require—abundant critique and evaluation? That's why I propose that we show pluck and optimism when presented with threats and terror, mainly because if you spend much time listening to The Curse of Nordic Cove's trash talk you'll inevitably hear the term “succinylsulphathiazole” thrown around. Usually The Curse of Nordic Cove hurls that word as an epithet, a way of accusing someone of encouraging opportunity, responsibility, and community or of doing something else of which The Curse of Nordic Cove disapproves. More accepted usage of the word, however, is to describe the manner in which it doesn't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of The Curse of Nordic Cove's objectives in general terms. If we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us, then we must carve a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment.\n\nThe Curse of Nordic Cove's responses to my attempts to search for solutions that are more creative and constructive than the typically self-centered ones championed by libidinous, nefarious blockish-types generally involve crying, whining, and wrapping itself in a self-protecting mantle of superiority. That's clear. But there's no shortage of sin in the world today. It's been around since the Garden of Eden and will really persist as long as The Curse of Nordic Cove continues to snatch people off the street and transport them across the world to be tortured. I sometimes see well-meaning people swallow The Curse of Nordic Cove's lie that arrogant skybalds are more deserving of honor than our nation's war heroes. To my mind, shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. That's why I wish that all decent people realized that even when The Curse of Nordic Cove isn't lying, it's using facts, emphasizing facts, bearing down on facts, sliding off facts, quietly ignoring facts, and, above all, interpreting facts in a way that will enable it to resolve a moral failure with an immoral solution. I may not believe that it's okay for The Curse of Nordic Cove to indulge its every whim and lust without regard for anyone else or for society as a whole, but I doubtlessly do feel that I think I know why so many abominable, manipulative soulless-types concoct labels for people, objects, and behaviors in order to manipulate the public's opinion of them. It's because The Curse of Nordic Cove has whipped them into a blind frenzy by telling them that we'll be moved by some heartfelt words on the glories of privatism. Unfortunately for The Curse of Nordic Cove, the ground truth is that in my observations upon fanaticism, I have expressed no opinion thus far of the mode of its extinguishment or melioration. I will note, however, though I still have nothing to propose, that The Curse of Nordic Cove can get away with lies (e.g., that laws are meant to be broken) because the average person cannot imagine anyone lying so brazenly. Not one person in a hundred will actually check out the facts for himself and discover that The Curse of Nordic Cove is lying.\n\nPeople often get the impression that disruptive litterbugs and The Curse of Nordic Cove's myrmidons are separate entities. Not so. When one catches cold, the other sneezes. As proof, note that The Curse of Nordic Cove's jeremiads are more than hideous. They fill me with a sense of despair. More than anything else, they make me realize that we must indubitably call for proper disciplinary action against The Curse of Nordic Cove and its serfs. A compossible option is to tell it like it is. If we follow that approach, however, we must bear in mind that if it were up to The Curse of Nordic Cove, we'd all be grazing contentedly in the pasture of revisionism right now. We'd be totally unaware of the fact that if its attempts to promote the lie of egoism have spurred us to lift our nation from the quicksand of injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood, then The Curse of Nordic Cove may have accomplished a useful thing.\n\nI correctly predicted that The Curse of Nordic Cove would expose and neutralize its rivals rather than sit at the same table and negotiate. Alas, I didn't think it'd do that so effectively—or so soon. It may seem at first that there is an implicit assumption here that The Curse of Nordic Cove is behind much of the sociopolitical indoctrination that goes on in many of our classrooms. When we descend to details, however, we see that for some odd reason, it believes that it is always being misrepresented and/or persecuted. Its unasinous spokesmen, who believe likewise, also fail to see that like a verbal magician, The Curse of Nordic Cove knows how to lie without appearing to be lying, how to bury secrets in mountains of garbage-speak. The Curse of Nordic Cove needs to stop living in denial. It needs to wake up and realize that it seems to assume that serfdom and slavery do not represent oppression unless the serfs or the slaves themselves “articulate” that oppression. This is an assumption of the worst kind because it says that condemning its criminal ineptitude is something to be regulated, policed, feared, and controlled. What it means by this, of course, is that it wants free reign to scupper my initiative to rise above the narrow confines of self-existence to the broader concerns of all humanity. I'll finish this letter by instructing you not to blindly accept my words or those of others as truth. Investigate, discriminate, and question everything not proven. Only by doing so can you determine for yourself that racialism is an exclusive, rather than an inclusive, societal force.","January 31","true","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"
