Occasionally, you will also find a powerup which gives you more speed, score boost and it blocks one hit. There is literally nothing else to do, it's as simple as that.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game itself is pretty easy, but the slightest mistake will make you crash into a building, forcing you to restart the game. If you have played games like Temple Run or Flappy Bird on your phone or tablet, you will know that at first it is really frustrating, but the more you play the longer you last.\n\nSOUNDThe music and sound effects are pretty good, and the repetitive soundtrack doesn't annoy me as much as others, but be prepared to listen to its constant loop over and over again.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe game is built around getting an higher score every time. The only twist that puts it above mediocrity is that more people you save, you get a bigger and cooler podium with people chanting your name from the street below.\n\nOverall, PIXELMAN is a good high-score chaser that delivers in fun content for a very cheap price. But don't expect much from it.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 7\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 7.5\nReplayability: 6\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 6\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website","February 23","true","4.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","1"

The same addiction people had with Flappy Bird you get while playing this, although Pixelman is so much better in every way.","March 9","true","4.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/438000/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPIXELMAN is addictive. It’s the simplicity of the objective that makes it so. You must save civilians by flying the title character or his brave partner in crime Pixelgirl through the skies of Pixelcity and avoiding the enemy contraptions of Baron Von Pixel. It’s easier said than done and that is where the real beauty of the game lies. Comparatively speaking it’s a Flappy Birds type game – similar concepts, similar mechanics, etc.\n\nThe game has already been bundled, in Groupee’s Build a Greenlight 37, so if you don’t already have the game don’t be surprised to see some of your friends with time played in the game already. Unfortunately it appears to be a game that people have idled for its trading cards as eight of my friends already have the game and five them have a number of hours logged yet only one of them has actually acquired a score on the system. I’d like to advise those of you who have done that that you really should try the game. It’s much better than a game you can just idle.\n\nThe downside to the game is that after you’ve played a few rounds the game feels repetitive and lacks variety. If I could make recommendations for the game to Kindermann Corp. before they release the full retail version of the title it would  be to add some power ups or give the characters something unique about the way that they control in game. This would add depth to the game that the game currently lacks.\n\nI would recommend that you pick this one up at the low price it is. Of course, with it already being bundled previously there is a likelihood that we will see it bundled again sooner rather than later, but at less than a price of a cup of coffee you’re going to get your monies worth out of this one relatively quickly.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nPlease feel free to join our wonderful community on Steam","March 9","true","4.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It uses only a couple of buttons on the controller. You play Pixelman, a superhero quite fragile, you have to avoid squishing on the buildings, have to rescue people and pets, pickup bonus & special shots; all that while avoiding an evil dude in a plane who keeps shooting bombs, lasers and missiles.\n\nThe graphics are simple but effective, filled with silly details. Music is nice, even though it's a bit repetitive.As you keep playing - and dying! - your starting launching 'podium' will gradually evolve, with a crowd of fans and pets slowly growing bigger; very lulzy.\n\nAddictive and fun, perfect to unwind mindlessly :)","February 28","true","3.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

MEDIC!!* This sums up the fun I had playing Pixelman; along the theme song for the Greatest American Hero playing in my head the entire time. While I truly, in every way sucked at this game ... it was a wild ride from start to finish. An amazingly engrossing chaser game, hearkening back to the younger days of console play. Highly recommend you buy ... but watch out for semi-trucks, tunnels and missiles.","April 25","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I highly recommend it to everyone. I also enjoy the level design and retro feel of it, it gives some NES/indie nostalgia. 10/10\n\nEDIT 4/24 - This game rocks and has what all indie lovers like the most in a game, replay value.  I keep coming back to this game and wanting more.  Got some of the rare achievements and it felt rewarding.  At the price, you can't beat this game and Im suprised its not more well known.  If its ever on sale, I think everyone that has Steam should own this game.  Dont forget, once you get 3 power ups, you can shoot an adouken at the red baron.  Also, you gain more fans the more you play, I wonder if it will get more laggy because of this, I have tons of fans at the beginning and all throughout the level now?  20/10","February 24","true","5.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","1"
