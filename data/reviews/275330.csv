Keep in mind I got it when it was only 1 dollar.\n\n* Puzzles require rotating a map for situational awareness, which makes things a little more complicated rather than challenging. Much of the games difficulty comes from needing to do this, rather than the core mechanic. If you have to rotate make it digital not analog.\n* The core mechanic is ushering characters to change directions by swiping them.\n* This would be fine, but there is a lack of onscreen feedback for mouse or click or swipe, so your action feels disembodied from the game world and like in "Temple Run" and other less intuitive swipe games, you don't know if your action was recognised or if the game recognised some other action. A simple hovering blue line that stretches out with an arrow would be enough, or lighting up the blocks on the ground in the direction of the gesture would assist readability.\n* Have no idea why there is a Zoom in the game, but it feels redundant unless the levels suddenly get huge later and I have to zoom out to plan things. If it is there to show off the characters, zoom in at key points when the final gems or other element is put in place.","May 18, 2014","false","0.1"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","1"

The reason for that is that this game is a timing puzzler with unsuitable controls.\n\nThe general idea is nice: you need to get colored runes to the same colored altars, except for tutorial dude, each elemental can only carry its own runes, and there are specific things only they can do, and they can be combined to combine their abilities. That should make for interesting puzzles, except they're timed, your guys never stop moving (why not?), and the camera and controls mean it's very hard to translate intent into the game world.\n\nNow with the same basic mechanics, this could just as easily have been a puzzle where you draw some paths in advance, including possibly some wait times, and thenset it in motion like a machine. But instead, like Charlie Chaplin in modern times, I need to struggle to keep  up with the "machine" that I want to see solve the level. Very annoying.\n\nIf you like timing puzzle games, this is a game you might want to try. If you like the puzzling without someone running and falling off a cliff while you try to figure out what's going on, get something else.","January 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Game for an adult human is boring. Puzzles are really weak and boring - this is not puzzles at all. Puzzles from "Bug's Escape" Chuck's Challange 3d (just not on easy levels) or "Cogs" is much better. I recommended game for children but for adults or teenagers (15-18) I don't recommend.  For Teenagers and adults I recommend puzzles from "Cogs" "Bug's Escape", "Battle vs. Chess" (Check vs. Mate), or Chuck's Challange (only in hard levels)","May 27, 2014","true","0.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

For me it has been a complete surprise, because I didn't know nothing about this game.\nIt has some problems with the audio, but the music is funny too.\nThere are level that are very very devilishly.","March 21, 2014","true","11.5"," 17 of 39 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","17","39","0","0"
