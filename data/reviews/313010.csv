It was a bad idea, because you can see how identical the games are. The best part is they forgot to rename the program so it's still labelled as Cities XL if you play in windowed mode. It just shows the extreme laziness and lack of care from the developper.

But, this game is the exact same game as what came before.  The exact same buildings, the exact same tools, the exact same interface layout.  The only differences I have been able to spot are the new color of the interface (from blue to black) and apparently it has multi-thread support.\n\nI could have just saved the 20 dollars and played Cities XL, and gotten the exact same experience.  It is a bit sad that they repackaged an old game and sold it for so much while promising us "tons of new features".  Maybe a ton has a different weight value wherever this developer is located.\n\n\nEdit: Due to some legit points made in the comments section of this review I've decided to make an edit.\n\nOld players: Don't buy it, unless you play it every day, then you'll have bought it anyway.\n\nNew Players:  I would characterize this game as more of a City Editor instead of more of a city sim in the manner of the old SimCitys.  In my opinion, this game is just too easy to plop whatever you want down, and watch it build itself.  Yes, you can build a massive city in many of the ways you want.  But if you want to start with a small town, and work your ♥♥♥ off to turn it into a bustling metropolis after hours and hours of fun gameplay, and then have to deal with sprawl, aging infrastructure, and urban blight....then this is not the game for you.\n\nTo that end, I would characterize this game as a pretty boring way to spend an evening as you just point and plop whatever you want or need and then watch the grey boxes go around your city because you don't want to view your city one street at a time.","February 5, 2015","false","0.8"," 803 of 903 people (89%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","89","803","903","45","22"

IF you're coming in new to this series, or have a very old version of this game, this is by far the best version of this game and could be worth the price, but then again you could get an older version for a lot less and get basically the exact same game - except it runs much worse. The bad reviews have to do with the complete lack of any new content, controls, UI, anything - it looks and controls exactly like previous versions of the game, there is no increase in quaility, the controls still mostly stink - but it does run much better now.\n\n-------\n\nSo I've liked the older Cities games, enough that I pre-ordered this one. I boot it up and tah dah... well there is no need to relearn anything since its 99% of the exact same game.\n\nSo to recap the "NEW" version:\n\nPositives:\n\n- This is overlooked in the other reviews I've seen but the game does run much smoother than in the past. I wouldn't really say it looks better, but its no longer sluggish on my top of the line gaming PC. Older versions of the game ran pretty awful, even on top of the line hardware.\n\nNegitives:\n\n- It's the same exact game as before.\n\n- The controls still stink. If they had just upgraded the graphical engine so it ran much bettter (which they did) AND updated the controls so it worked more like SimCity, this game would have been worth the $20 to me. However they did not do that, it controls just as terrible as the previous versions of the game.\n\n- It's the same game... which means it will probably be on sale on Steam for $5 in a week.\n\nOverall this is very very disappointing. Hopefully with the workshop intergration fans will be able to do the job the devs decided not to do - and that is to give us a new game.\n\nIf you're new to this game just wait a couple of weeks, it will surely be on sale as they try to get people to buy this desipte all the poor reviews. This is the best version of this game since it runs better, but otherwise, again, it's the same exact game as the versions you can buy all day and night for $5 or less.","February 5, 2015","false","4.1"," 306 of 332 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","306","332","4","6"

For example, the blue rounded buttons have been replaced by dark grey squares with straight corners. Since these buttons are really small on my 1440p-screen (not to brag), I wonder where the extra X in its title comes from, but it certainly does not refer to these buttons. The sounds during interaction have not changed, the resources are the same, and trading works the same as it always has done. Omnicorp is awaiting your trades when you have no friends (or actually, other cities, as I have not found the online multiplayer yet which actually kind of made one of the previous editions of this game). But, I have to admit, when you start the game you get a nice but short animation carrying the word "Focus". Whatever Focus may be, a studio, a gang of angry Italian hamsters that took this game and tried to earn an extra buck by adding an "X", I dearly hope they have actually fixed the memory leak bug from previous editions. Then it may actually be worth 5 units of your national currency when it is on sale in a month or 2. Until then, just Focus. On games that may actually be worth it. Or that hamster gang.

They changed the color scheme to this black modern looking theme and added in workshop support and trading cards. The features on how to monitor and build your city are the EXACT SAME! They even had the nerve to use the same exact maps! There are probably a few more new buildings in Cities XXL but not worth buying another game just for that. Also on the old Cities XL when my city got around a population of 300k I was pretty much done because the lag made doing anything impossible. They kind of fixed it, I was able to reach about 600k population until the lag did start getting unbearable.\nSo basically all they did was make a new color scheme, sort of fix the lag problem, and add minimal buildings. I would not reccomend buying this game no matter what, even if you do or don't own Cities XL or one of their prior games. Focus Home Interactive should be ashamed for ripping all of us.

Cities X-whatever has essentially not changed very much since the original and I think that is quite apparent.\n\nThey say that the game engine is better; It still runs kind of choppy and has the same problems.\nThey say that the maps are larger; As far as I'm aware, they are the exact size that they've always been.\nThey say that the interface is new; The buttons are grey and make less annoying sounds when you click on them.\nBut hey, at least the music is all new.\n\nI don't hate the game.

If you do not own a Cities title, and wish to get one, then I suppose consider this one or a previous one. But if you want a better city-sim, go grab SimCity4. SimCity3000 is good, too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XanosPlay/recommended/313010/","XanosPlay","Xanos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XanosPlay/","187 products in account","First the most important: this game cannot really be considered as a "game", it is more of a paid patch to older Cities XL versions with many of the bugs STILL present. No surprise, that owners of older versions of Cities XL get a discount - In fact they are just buying the same game again (as I did -_- ).\n\nIf you already own one of the previous Cities XL titles, please don't make the same mistake I did: please do not buy this "game". The game is 99% identical to older ones, only the interface is now black instead of blue and the performance is slightly better. Normally, one should expect this type of change in an update instead of a new release.\n\nIf you are interested in how this game works and what it offers, I propose you may watch some gameplay videos on youtube, as they might tell you more than I could describe in a text here on Steam. However, I'll try with just a few words:\n\nYou start with one of different pre-defined maps, lay out roads, build a town hall and then start zoning residential, industrial and commercial areas. The game offers quite a few nice ideas: residential zoning is separated into different "wealth" categories. The different types of residents are required to operate different types of industry, offices or other workplaces. There are also different density options with higher density offering larger and higher buildings. The "trading" inside the city is calculated using "tokens". Heavy industry needs tokens of unskilled workers and generated heavy industry while manufacturing industry may convert this into manufactured goods which may then be used in commercial areas. If a city is in need of tokens of a certain type, or may have a surplus, tokens may be traded with other cities. However, this trading system is heavily bugged since the first version of Cities XL and was not fixed until today. Of course there is also power, water, pollution, leisure, police, healthcare, fire, etc... However, the simulation is only based on statistics, there is no "real" simulation of vehicles, inhabitants or anything like this.\n\nIf you look for an alternative in the City-Building genre Cities (X)XL might be the right game for you if you can withstand bugs. However, you might want to take a look at one of the (almost) identical older versions of Cities XL for a cheaper price ;)\nAnd again: please think twice before buying this "update" if you own a previous game of the franchise.","February 5, 2015","false","9.9"," 226 of 261 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","226","261","13","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MegaBearsFan/recommended/313010/","MegaBearsFan","MegaBearsFan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MegaBearsFan/","64 products in account","So right off the bat, Cities XXL is not substantially different from its predecessor (Cities XL). In my time with the game so far, I've only encountered two new features. Everything else, right down to the buildings available and the game interface, are unchanged. XXL hardly deserves to be called a sequel or sold as a new game. It's a content patch, and not even a very good one.\n\nWhen I first started playing Cities XL a few years ago, I was really impressed with it. I hadn't really played any modern city-builder games since SimCity 4, and so the jump to 3-D graphics, the ability to draw curved roads, and the sheer size of the maps was enough to win me over initially. But as I've played the game more, it's limitations and weaknesses have become much more apparent and hard to ignore. This is especially true in the game's interface and controls, which are very rough and full of nagging annoyances. When compared to the much smoother and organic controls of games like Tropico 5, the modern [disastrous] SimCity reboot, and even older games like Caesar IV, Cities XL really starts to look bad.\n\nThe biggest deterrent to enjoying Cities XL is its UI and controls. There's nothing that really single-handedly breaks the game, but there's a cacaphony of small, nagging problems that gradually wear down your resolve to play the game. The first thing that you'll notice is the ugly and disorganized interface. There are buttons and widgets floating all over the screen: build icons, overlay toggles, camera control widgets, zoning sub-controls, and so on. You can customize some of the UI elements by dragging them to different places on the screen, but there is no arrangement that really feels comfortable.\n\n\nRead full review on my blog:\nhttp://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2015/04/28/Cities-XXL-game-review.aspx","October 19, 2015","false","76.7"," 161 of 179 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","161","179","3","0"

And there's no vsync option so I can't help it :( In-game it's flickering terribly, random roads and buildings disappearing on zooming out.\n* New UI... Okay, maybe old one did need some facelift, but it wasn't that bad to replace it with this buggy hell. Some buttons require some searching for a spot that would register the click. Hell, it looks like exactly same UI that was in previous games, only repainted black, added transparency, and rounded buttons replaced with plain rectangles.\n\n\nI can't say much about other features, as I can't really play it because of the flickering and tearing (come on, give us vsync!), it hurts my eyes.

It certainly was more flexible than the limited options in SimCity 4. Unfortunately, Cities XXL doesn't really build upon its predecessor to really improve.\n\nThis is more of a paid patch than a new game. None of the central mechanics have been modified or improved much at all. In fact, there's only two big draws here:\n\n- An updated engine supporting multi-core CPUs and >4GB of RAM. The game is a lot more stable, especially with large cities.\n- Steam Workshop support.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the key mechanics of the game, trading, is completely broken without a mod. All trades in all cities will reset to 0 when loading a city, so it becomes impossible to actually trade resources around as intended. The mod fixes this, but why is it broken to begin with? I've also had several unexplainable crashes while playing that make me saving like a complete paranoid.\n\nIf this were a free patch for Cities XL, I'd be pretty happy. If it were a $5-10 DLC, I'd roll my eyes and be accepting. But $20 for previous owners and $40 for the "new" game? No way, son. My call is to wait for new patches to fix some of the problems, more Workshop content to improve the mechanics, and a Steam Sale so you can pay what the game is really worth.","February 10, 2015","false","5.8"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","59","67","2","0"

Yes, it does look graphicaly better, somewhat, and the Multi-core support is showen. But just barely. When theres zones being built, I see massive frame drops and the game starts to lag quite a bit. Which is surprising because it was suppose to be such a smooth game to play. The UI is the same, with only the play/fast-forward buttons moved, and the color of the UI is now a dark grey instead of blue.\n\nPersionally, this game should be running way better on my system, seeing as how I have a high end gaming PC, (system specs below), but it barely maintains 60 FPS on a 4K screen. Which makes no sence since BF4 and BF:Hardline, both way more demanding games, especially on 4K, runs better with a comfortable 74 average FPS on my 4K monitor.\n\nYes, the game does look slightly better, I will agree with that, and the map sizes are nicer too compared to SimCity, which I have played a lot of. But, SimCity does run better and looks way nicer with a better user interface then what Cities XXL has now. Yes SimCity 2013 did have an absolute horrendus launch, but after all of the patches and bug fixes that they have released, I'd much rather spend my time on SimCity then on Cities XXL.\n\nIf you have not played Cities XL 2012, or Cities XL Platinum, then you should still get the game. But if you already have one of those two, and dont mind the UI, and lower frames, then I do not recomend this for you unless you have a pile of money burning a hole in you're pocket.\n\nLet's just hope that Cities: Skylines will be better. From the game play that I have seen on youtube about Cities: Skylines, it seems to have a much better user interface and it seems to run better over all.

Cities XXL is basically cities XL with what seems to be an identical gameplay and slightly altered interface. It's actually quite insulting. But it's also a good lesson for all you young developers out there. Say you desinged a decend video game about a decade ago, made a bunch of money and lived a happy life. But now the checking account is running a little low. What do you do? Well, you sure don't feel like developing a new game, so instead you offer an amazing 50% discount to those who have already purchased the old one and promise them a new version. You add a letter or a number to the title (those suckes will fall for it every time) and you slap a few minor updates... and I mean minor, like say the color of the interface, and Ta Da!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trizzev/recommended/313010/","trizzev","trizzev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trizzev/","918 products in account","EDIT: Get Cities:Skylines and ignore this game.\n\nI've been rather happy with CitiesXL during the duration of its tenure. The first iteration in 2009 felt like it was made with a lot of love. It had with its release the promise for a bright future. Since the demise of the original developer, Focus has had the tendency to ride it like a cash cow. It has neglected the franchise like an abusive parent witholding affection from its secretly adopted middle child.\n\nCitiesXXL is the latest annual crayon drawing posted on the refrigerator from the intern at Focus. Its release was preceded by an intentionally anemic campaign consisting of decent stills and an admittedly well-done video of the city they made for their marketing coordinator. Thinking about it now, it probably took that intern longer to build that city than the entire update to the poor shattered dreams of Monte Cristo's original code.\n\nIt's been made clear why the publisher was so quiet leading up to its release as the expressed promise of a new game would have been somewhat misleading. CitiesXXL is sort of a new game...\n\n..but it's more of an update.\n\nI wouldn't call it a patch because that would imply a fix. My experience so far has been that it runs a bit slower than XL Platinum. It uses the same maps, and the same textures on some buildings which clearly spell "CitiesXL". Ironically, this seems to be the only thing spelled correctly. The updated metro-esque menus are poorly QC'd and have flagrant visual bugs on the surface. It feels like I'm beta testing.\n\nWhile I would love to be completely on one side of the black and white vitriol I find in the forums, I find myself kind of liking this update. The flaws haven't so far been game-breaking, and I really like the Steam integration. Mods are now incredibly simple to install and they have improved my experience. There is greater control of the camera, an updated soundtrack, and an Expert mode which is a wonderful addition.  I still don't like the classism that plagues the heart of the series, but I understand how it works and Expert mode helps dull that edge quite a bit.\n\nAttention to some of these details but not others has left me confused. Why are the controls so strange? I know it's European, but I would love to use WASD instead of arrow keys and edge tripping. Why can't I edit these controls? Why can't I edit mouse sensitivity? I should be able to upgrade roads in place-- especially when I meticulously curved that one to fit that ridge. Ugh.\n\nThis isn't a bad game. Yes, it is an obvious cash-grab that should have been an update or DLC. Yes, Focus is deceitful and disgraceful. It is, however, an update to a pretty fun game. Casual CitiesXL Platinum gamers will be disappointed.

Mediocre. You can see that only minimal amount of work has been injected into this "release". In relative terms, and to give you a measurable idea, the price of a small DLC would realistically reflect what Cities XXL is for previous owners of the franchise (especially Cities XL Platinum). In absolute terms, it's definitely not worth 40€. It remains a workable city builder without much life. Given other better titles out there with more customization, management options, silmulation and life dimmension, I would not recommend this game over even older titles like SC4.

ONLY RECOMMENDED if this is your first Cities XL title...This part of the review is ONLY for players new to the franchise!  If you DO already have a Cities XL game - skip to the second section below - or tl;dr - it's a rip-off patch for a game you already own.\n\nSo, if you don't already own a Cities XL game, then this game offers a lot of fun and creativity, and is arguably THE best city-creator on the PC scene at the time of writing.  Unless a new offering improves on the genre, then this is the title you want, even though it's not perfect.\n\nPros\no You can zone areas and let the game choose properties\no You can select property designs and styles yourself instead of zoning (with the community made mod in Workshop)\no The maps are huge and varied\no Granular choice of industry (you choose types of industry, farming and commerce)\no There is a rudimentary trading system\no A blueprint system as now used by Simcity 2013 for advanced developments\no Very mod-friendly with thousands of compatible mods for the Cities XL franchise\no Full cheat system so you can choose the constraints with which to play\n\nCons\no No dynamic population (unlike Simcity - no births, deaths, people who move in or out at will)\no No fires, crime or disasters\no Little choice of mass transit (nothing has been implemented properly since XL days)\no A buggy interface\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 7.5/10\n\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED if you are upgrading from an earlier Cities XL title...If you had performance issues with prior Cities XL titles, then this upgrade might be for you.  Otherwise, there is very little new on offer for Platinum owners and XL owners are justifiably angry about being charged for what amounts to be a performance patch (hence the swamp of negative reviews).  Even with my 'nice' hat on, I think FHI should only have charged a minor-DLC amount, not advertised it as an all-new game.\n\nSo what do you get?  There is a new 'sky' feature where you can select a pre-designed sky effect.  This is static (doesn't bring any weather effects) but does add a prettier ambience to your cities.  Right now there are around 6 to choose from (not many) but new versions have started to appear in the Steam Workshop.\n\nAll the primary buildings are exactly the same as before.  There are something like 8 new buildings added by this new version ('green' buildings for the climate-friendly builders) and a small number of additional maps, but no other content.  The advertised multiple international and period architectural styles are purely a category list which sorts the existing buildings (nothing extra).\n\nLighting appears to be a little improved, but old bugs remain (tree bugs, box vehicles etc).  The good news is that the mods that fixed these problems in the other games work here too - but that's not really surprising because the game is essentially the same as before.  The majority of custom content  mods from XLNations and other sites are compatible but I recommend you try a tiny few at a time because quite a few won't work at all.\n\nIn short, unless you experienced terrible performance in Platinum/XL, this is a greatly overpriced, superfluous 'upgrade' that you probably don't need.  Wait until it's around £5 or so then buy it for the prettier sky - but that's all.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 2/10","February 6, 2015","true","73.4"," 67 of 102 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","67","102","5","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/313010/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","In spite of whatever else might be wrong with it, there is no mistaking the sheer amount of creative freedom that Cites XXL allows. The ability to play as the benevolent overlord of a teeming metropolis entirely of your own creation proves to be a satisfying pursuit, yet it remains one that is uncomfortably similar to previous games in the series. And that’s the thing really; Cities XXL simply doesn’t do enough new to justify its full price tag over its predecessor and in doing so, its stunted evolution coupled with a general lack of polish ensures that this latest instalment in the Cities series flounders in the face of more ambitious city-building efforts. Nevertheless, while Cities XXL might not hold much allure for city building stalwarts and mayoral masters who already have tried their hand at Cities XL Platinum, there is enough substance here that it at least provides a suitable starting point for newbies to both the series and the genre as a whole.\n\nThe first stop for the uninitiated should be the game’s tutorial which in being divided up into a dozen or so topics, provides digestible lessons on how to get started in earnest. Certainly, the tutorial is in-depth and caters well for newcomers, ensuring that the lessons learned in the tutorial aren’t forgotten with in-game hints that are helpfully provided throughout to keep new folks on the right track. Clearly, Cities XXL is eminently welcoming to new starters. Folks familiar with the game’s predecessor on the other hand, Cities XL Platinum, will have a good idea of what to expect here and for better or worse, since Cities XXL doesn’t stray far from what we’ve seen before.\n\nBut how does it play? There are 60 or so prebuilt maps to choose from, but there are no options to manually landscape at all – which limits what can be done in the pre-produced spaces. The game provides hints about what your next action ought to be, and you can keep track of city happenings, but the interface is fair from friendly, with such data buried a few layers deep. Building zones is my favourite part of XXL. Square zones can be customized (how big should the roads be, what grid size should the blocks be) – while a free zone option allows building of areas that are of atypical shape, while the game inserts plots and roads at generally logical points. Zones can also be built plot by plot for those with an absurd level of patience. This allows for much more unique city design than seen in other games, and enhanced creative freedom. Roads benefit most from this flexibility, with the ability to build freeform curved roads.\n\nBuilding up the rest of the city is straightforward, as citizens begin demanding services at various population levels, and you add the necessary features. Trade also becomes more important as your city grows, as you must import the resources you aren’t producing, and export your surpluses. The trading interface is clunky at best, and getting a handle on what a trading token is can be frustrating.\n\nBoasting a new engine and tweaks, Cities XXL also states that many of the bugs and performance issues have been fixed, but as I continued playing not all of them have. I still ran into performance drops that spiked worse as my city grew to its limits. Sometimes my load screen would hang for a lot longer than any reasonable game should, and every now and then the game would completely crash. This may sound like a bunch of big problems but it is a step up from Cities XL, and is actually not too bad, just not as good as I had hoped.\n\nThe graphics and sound have not been touched since the 2009 release of Cities XL, but they have aged well and are still enjoyable. I love the street feature, where you can zoom all the way to the ground in a first-person view and enjoy the city you built. The level of detail and diversity within the town is also impressive, and makes you want to look around and enjoy, versus it just being a novelty. It also adds a sense of realism when your town gets big, and they can get huge. The sound is also well done, from ambient sounds to horns honking during a traffic jam. Not to mention the music is about on par with the other games in its genre.\n\nThere are a few additions to the mix here, but there’s nothing that will take your breath away. You’ll find a lot of “green” options to help tackle the rising pollution levels in your city, and you’ll notice that pollution is realistically centered around areas as opposed to just being spread across the city. There are also five entirely new environments that your map can take place in, and a moving skybox does offer a more lifelike biome for you to create your architectural masterpiece.\n\nHonestly, I’m not even sure why I’m shocked. After all, the Cities franchise does have a penchant for doing this. Cities XL 2011 was essentially Cities XL with a few new maps and features. Cities XL 2012 and Cities XL Platinum were the same type of deal as well: basically a clone of their predecessors, just with more maps and features.\n\nThe user interface and menus have been retooled in Cities XXL, but I can’t say that it’s strictly for the better. It definitely has a more modern feel to it, but it really looks like it was a rush job. Everything about it simply seems like it was thrown together. This is the definition of being nitpicky and on its own would barely be worth mentioning, but any graphic designers in the audience may want to prepare themselves for some fairly atrocious kerning. I’m not really sure how you can manage to have your typeface off-center on the main menu of your game, especially when it’s a game about micromanagement and fine details, but that’s part of the magic of Cities XXL I suppose.\n\nCities XXL represents a serviceable starting point for beginners certainly, but is simply too riddled with bugs, performance issues and recycled content to recommend to anyone else who has sampled the series previously. Much like how Cities XXL encourages the player to build their sprawling domains from the ground up, so too should the developer look to apply a similar work ethic to this tired series. Overall 5/10.","April 26","true","31.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","23","29","2","0"

I found that Cities XXL is the superioir game, but hardly. It just makes more fun to play because of the factr it is easier. Well don't get me wrong, challange is a good thing but I never felt much chalanged by cities xl as I felt "Chalanged".\n\nBut only if I look at the game without looking at the competition. I find simcity 5 still to be a much better game in many aspects of the gameplay. But finaly simcity 4 is a way better game. Even SiomCity 3000 is because of it's charme and it's mechanics a much better game. I wouldn't say it is worse than simcity 2000 or simcity classic but since those are about 20 to 30 years older than this game, this doesn't mean allot.\n\nThe best improvment over cities XL is the music.\nI say I will play it more than cities xl and will get arrant for my money but no sir, it is a rip off.\n\nAlso I didn't spell check because I don't belief the game is neither good or bad enough to be worth the time. I think that tells allot.\n\nEdit: Well the Music Tracks are awesome except "Synthesized Troughs", why is that so? Because it sounds like the put in the sound of a toilet flush with 22kbps sampling rate, severall times. How can you ruin your own music whith something that awefull that leaves a disgusting aftertaste. The good news is that you can just put that file out of the audio folder and steam doesn't try to replace itr, you can even put your own music there.\nBad thing is that for a game like this all the tracks are to short even they could be much longer. You can listen to the same music far longer but the titels are betwen 2-3 minuts while SimCity 4 for example 4-7minuts and even there I found the tracks to short for a game like this but at least there where about 20 not only like 7, but thank foxy than they don't sound all similar like in SimCity 5.\n\nOh and Btw. thje Multi Thrad Support works, but it needs a very while until it works. The game will start using one Core, at least if you minimized the window and maximized it after that. But after a while it will even use all 8 cores of an AMD FX8120.

However i caved anyway and purchased it. I honestly just really enjoy city building games. Being that i already owned XL 2012 platinum i got it at a discounted price of $20, which made my purchasing decision a bit easier. Another reason why i purchased is because of the talk of multicore support which is something the previous game suffered from, the performance was utterly garbage in XL 2012. However that being said the performance in XXL is no different, the game still has crap performance when your city finally starts getting decently large.\n\nI can't even place a bridge or road after a while as framerate drops when rendering out the bridge or road placement to the point where its not possible anymore. Starting out my city by careful planning and design, by the time large density areas are placed and built the design and care just goes out the window because of complete ♥♥♥♥ framerate when placing zoning areas or roads etc. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t performance issues as the previous game.\n\nAs city building games go the XL series of games are complete garbage when it comes to actual city building.  Sim city 5 while it has small building areas blows this ♥♥♥♥ out of the water. Also ♥♥♥♥ this company for releasing this game like it was something new and feeding us the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Lesson learned.\n\nJust wait for skylines. That game looks incredible.","February 9, 2015","false","8.6"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

The large tile zoning is excellent, giant maps are excellent, varity of buildings is pretty good, multicore processors was a drastically needed change.    Cities:XXL has many draw backs, one being that the game is very close to, or  almost identical to Cities: XL.\n\nThe game features broken promises from the developer, such as being active(non existent at the moment), adding free DLC(hasn't happened, no developer support).  Bugs aren't fixed at all either.  What is also disappointing is the modding community is very small, but the work they've added is very good in terms of mods and assets.

The UI is antiquated and looks like it was setup for the alpha version of a project with a 5 man team. The performance improvement mentioned by the developers with regards to a brand new engine is a straight up lie. The game runs just as bad as it's previous iterations.

There is honestly no depth to this game other than build a city, cool, look our artists added 500 new blurry textures with no real gameplay additions. Seriously, this does not make any sense whatsoever... there is really nothing different. Most of the differences like road upgrades are broken iterations that don't work.\n\nSound:\n\nIt has music and some noises.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPlease don't buy this game.

I'm not entirely sure what they were, because 90% of the game is identical to Cities 2012. When I played the tutorial and realised it was *exactly* the same as before, horrible character graphics and all, I stopped and went "No one else can make this mistake."\n\nAs many people have pointed out, support for various graphics or processor options does not constitute a new game, nor does slightly increasing the number of buildings.\n\nCities 2012 wasn't even that good a city builder, or one that gives you any level of connection to what you've built. The reason why I purchased this was down to it being marketed elseware as an "anti-SimCity" with much more space to build and better options overall. And it probably is better than the release version of SimCity. But that was several years ago, and things have changed in that game that make it much more engaging and less restrictive. This on the other hand feels like a £15-£30 cash grab.\n\nI am going to play more of this, and try to establish if anything of note has actually changed and if not I will edit this review accordingly to point these things out. But don't buy this game, buy Anno, buy SimCity, buy a casual city building game on your tablet but do not buy this game until other users have established whether or not this is just Cities 2012 with a slightly cleaner interface and less horrible music.\n\nEDIT: It does feel faster, having played it for a couple of hours. But it looks nearly *identical* to Cities 2012, a now three year old title. The interface is better and the music is better. Nothing else is different.\n\nI would go so far as to call this a con.

I have wanted a good city builder since SimCity 4. The new SimCity was good, but the cities were too small. When i heard about this game, i was honestly really excited. I preordered it, i downloaded it the night it came out.\n\nunfortunately, this game is just not fun. It is unpolished, frustrating, and nowhere near enjoyable.\n\nBelieve me, i have tried. My roommate and i researched the best ways to build the cities, what key points to look out for, we have made multiple cities. Not once, not even once was I ever as interested in it as i was SimCity, which is disappointing because i found Simcity to have a lot of shortcomings.\n\nThe way the UI works is terrible. Upgrading roads is horrid. the game is NOT intuitive.\n\nI am waiting on Cities: Skyline, in hopes I wont want to shoot myself after 30 minutes of gameplay.","February 20, 2015","false","21.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","0"

BUT SEVERELY LACKING THE 'NEW'\n\nAs soon as I heard that a fresh new Cities XL game was on the horizon, I had really big hopes that this would finally be a new start for the series, a proper major upgrade from Cities XL that maintained the best bits of the series whilst introducing significant improvements in gameplay, customisation and capabilities. This is a game that had to be MORE that Cities XL was and, given the title's new X, one would assume this to be the case. But, alas, two hours in and I find myself disappointed.\n\nLike with previous annual 'new releases' it feels that Focus have merely taken the same old game, given it 2015's lick of paint and sent it on its merry way. Underneath it all, this game feels exactly the same as the previous three incarnations and offers very little in the way of new. Don't get me wrong, it's not a 'bad' game. As city-builders go, Cities XL (or XXL) is a very different take compared to others in the genre, and where it excels in some areas of micro-management, it's lacking in others. But ultimately, if you are looking for an evolution from the previous versions of the game, XXL just does not cut it.\n\nFocus are crying "wolf" with this latest offering, and had I known Cities XXL would be an almost identical carbon copy of Cities XL, I would have stuck with the Platinum version and invested the money in alternative new takes on the city-building genre, such as 'Cities: Skylines'. Whilst Focus' rivals, Maxis, may have their critics and problems with their latest SimCity offering, they've atleast made the effort to evolve the series, even if it is with varying degrees of success. And while the latest SimCity has been an education for Maxis, Focus have yet to demonstrate that evolution is in their nature.","February 5, 2015","false","16.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"
