It's a nice change from the usual  square shaped breakout.  Circular breakouts have been around  for  a long time now, so it's not as unusual as the developer makes out. I've purchased a few myself and  I've also played several  flash based ones such as  X Bound aka Plastic Balls, Neon Blox, Radial 50, Ringgz - Brick Breaker and Uber Breakout.  Today's game however not only offers a round  arena, it also dispenses with the bat.  Instead you move the bricks around.  It was  the hardest  breakout I can remember playing in many years, so isn't for the faint hearted. That said it is dirt cheap at the moment with 50% off (only Â£1.99).\n\nI'm already impressed with this game and it's only in early alpha  release at the moment.  It will be interesting to see what  updates are added to this game.\n\nOne negative for me was when I tried to play the game full screen it kept freezing on me and I had to do the three fingered salute to escape the game.  It played  fine in  windowed mode, which you can select whenever you start up the game via the configuration window.\n\n\nSuggestions to the developer:\n\ni) ... Include a bat and ball mode\nii) ... Add a level editor\n\nI will return to this review to update it once I've  added a few hours of game play and when its out of early access.  Hopefully we will see lots of updates and additions.\n\n\nYou can see a couple of videos of game play HERE and  HERE","August 28, 2015","true","23.9"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","22","22","0","3"

Overall this game is fun and enjoyable and you will definetly be able to play this game hours on end.","October 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game is also priced appropriately at $5.\n\nI will say that the game is extremely difficult. While I was about to clear through the early access levels in 30 minutes, getting a 3 Star score on every level would VERY difficult, but perhaps that's part of the point. I say difficult because the learning curve for learning to rotate the playing field and calculate ricochet angles in your head, all while trying to hit objective bricks and powerups and avoiding debuffs can get overwhelming. I guess theoretical one could get very good at the control scheme, but I can't imagine myself doing it.\n\nStill, worth keeping an eye out. The game field does rotate smoothly (though I wish there was an option to make it turn more quickly, art style is good, the polish is passible though not excellent, and the music is actually surprisingly stellar.\n\nThe lack of a quick reset button was infuriating though.","October 28, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cant wait for more levels. The only problem is that sometimes the game is really hard, and sometimes its so easy it really depend on what powerup you pickup get the multiball and its all over for but the crying. Alot more fun then most of the indie games I play, never actually beating them.\n\nWhoops must have left the game on i didnt play for it 22 hours.","November 7, 2015","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
