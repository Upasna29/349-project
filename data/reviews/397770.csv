Even bad games get more attention then this, and this is by no means a bad game.\n\nWell the story is basically revamping civilization but not in the usual RPG way.  This is a time management game played by levels with certain goals to achieve at each level. (Similiar to how Faerie Solitaire, Labors of Hercules or even Tales of the Orient have level goals.) Break boulders, fix roads, reconstruct houses, construct water towers, clear waterways, mine ore, etc, etc, and try to do it under the certain time limits to recieve a gold, silver, or bronze trophy.  Relatively easy because the game does not speed up like Diner Dash or Dr. Daisy:Pet Vet, and it is long because it has an actual storyline.  Not an overly complicated story as our inventor friend moves from place to place fixing things like roads and houses and bringing "invention" back to each place improving the overall quality of life for the inhabitants.\n\nFun, easy, family oriented game or simply a game to play while taking a break from anything or everything else.","October 3, 2015","true","4.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","3"

However, where I appreciated the simpleness of Hercules and the humor in it, I'm always afraid to find complex stuff to do.\n\nIn Meridian: Age of Invention, you have to clear 55 levels with workers and carriers: you build houses, you repair some, you can work in a mine to find resources to keep building, you collect money thanks to the carriers that can transport letters, fresh food or the result of your hard work. However, the more you advance, the more you have to do, mainly because a crazy inventor is trying to help everyone (people in the desert, living on island or even a pilot). So, you end building water towers, eletrical plants, etc.. And guess what? You can tie the houses to these and get a generous income that your carriers have to take if you don't want it to be wasted. Sometimes, you have bandits that will take your money unless you give them a certain amount. Sometimes, you have obstacles that your workers have to destroy or repair so that you can advance. Sometimes, you have treasures chest with some precious gold.\n\nHowever, if you end up falling short with one ressource, you have a market: pay 1000 gold and you'll get 500 building materials, pay 100 building minerals and you'll get 50 gold for example. You need to keep in mind that it can help you speed up the process.\n\nEach level is timed and you have medals/coins corresponding as your best time. Getting a gold medal is the supreme reward, however, while some levels are easy, others will need a perfect timing and for that, practice is the best, as you can redo the levels.\n\nFinally, between all the work on land and on water, you have some actions with the levels at the end where you need to land planes at the right base (green at the green hangar, etc...). It's reminding me of Flight Control HD, minus the collisions. It's a welcome change.\n\nI'm not really fan of the graphics, I find them a little dark, I would have preferred more colors and cheerfulness. The soundtrack is nice.\n\nHowever, while the gameplay is polished, there are two problems with the title: the in-game achievements and the crashes due to fail getcontext error. While for the latter, it can happen  anytime, some ingame achievements aren't unlocking despite meeting the requirements. Apparently, given the discussions on the forum, it's happening for many of the players and concerns the 10 hours or less trophy, the gold at every level one and the unlock all trophies (which is normal if you get a problem with these two). For now, the developers are just asking to forward your data and I didn't see any update for that for now.\n\nDespite these two unpleasant surprises, Meridian: Age of Invention stays an enjoyable casual time management game, not too difficult. For the price, you're not robbed at all.","March 19","true","5.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Easy enough to play and you won't have to think very hard :) I definitely suggest giving it a go if you like these sorts of games and if you aren't sure you want to pay for it, you can download from the website for an hour trial,\n\nI'm glad I picked it up in a special as I wouldn't pay much for it (much too short) but otherwise I had a good time playing and wasting some time (have already finished the game).","October 3, 2015","true","4.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

This game is a pretty straight forward time management game, no bells or whistles and nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nYour goal is to help rebuild a society and most levels consist of you rebuilding houses, delivering food and supplying water to the houses. You also build bridges, and other things as well as play some levels on water. The game play is simple and predictable but also becomes very repetitive since the levels usually all run on the same formula. As I played this I only played about one level or two levels at a time and then quit just so I wouldn't get burned out by the repetitive nature of the game.\n\nDespite that flaw, the game plays well. If you enjoy these types of time management games then you won't be disappointed. The music and sound effects are fine though it is relaxing to play with these off I found. It's also not expensive and offers Steam cards so I recommend it, especially if you want to share a game with young ones.","November 9, 2015","true","2.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

If you want a casual tappy tappy screen time game... then this is for you, bur for those of us that enjoy a nice long strategy game with multiple ways to build and create, not so much.\n\nGraphics are ok, for a tablet or something, but only allows for a fullscreen resolution... I have a widescreen.\n\nGameplay is very linear.  Tappy screen, and watch for blinky flashy thingy.\n\nTLDR; casual game, not strategy game.","January 1","false","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game's concept is OK, this is more like a smartphone app game rather than a full fledged PC game,however it may well kill your time and your small budget. after a couple of level the game gets way too repetitive..\nPROS :\n- Simple and easy to understand\n- Very easy game, even reaching gold trophies is quite easy\n- Cartoonish graphics\n- Indie style\n\nCONS:\n- Too linear\n- Repetitive.Very.Repetitive.\n- Too short. Finishing 59 levels will take your..maybe 3 hours\n- Very small variety. You build same thing over and over, also same levels. You build electiricity for all houses in...10 levels?\n- Doesn't even worth this low price, should be lower.","October 11, 2015","false","5.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

In the best traditions of casual games, it's cheap, cheerful and unchallenging.  And, had it behaved a little better, I would ungrudgingly have awarded it my approval.  Unfortunately, on my system, once every nine levels, on average, the game hung up so viciously that I had difficulty even getting it to relenquish control of the monitor so that I could kill it from the task manager.  The first time this happened, I thought I was going to have to resort to a hardware reset; thereafter, I kept the task manager open on the secondary monitor so I could get to it when needed.\n\nThe gameplay is fair, but I cannot recommend it with this nasty hanging problem.","January 9","false","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
