I have just about all the 1c war games , love to play them all . So I went and played this one .\nQuick learning tutorial since it has almost same set ups as the other games .  Has a auto set up that you can click on to get best out of your computer. .. Next was little scared as it said Russian Ouch . Nope came through in English and was really glad I have plad a battle in a campiangn in Russia as a son of some Noble Based on Historical battles , Gives you great quick history then the battle and your pbjectives ..\nI hered a bunch of reviews about the cloudy battle field /foggy or what ever . I was in winter cold Russia woods . I felt the cold in my bones as I played the game even here in Texas at 75 degrees out .\nHave you ever looked at a water painting from the days Of Nights or Napolian era and just get so absorb in the painting because of the way it is painted blended in . This is how the battles are done here . Yes a tree is a tree a rock a rock . person is person but when you view the battle from a over all you see the picture in a art gallery ..\nThis is not TOTAL WAR big Sega mass media market . this is for hard core war gammers . who play WAR GAMES not political , games with fighting as a secound thought .\nHere you get bare bones fighting of this period , I have game tested some of the hardest and best well known games from the 80-90's .. I found this company one night by accedent I do not have a supper game computer right now and was looking for a "older game" that  it could handle . I bought another of the WWII 1c games fell in love with them they are the hardest most enjoyable WAR GAMES out there . You do not need bother with building a fur trading company , a church , none of that .\nThis is a game for fighting and historical fighting . The screen graphics are like a water color painting  that during my two battles i played felt like I was on the field with the troops . No shinny plastic looking trees or clean bright unaforms here hell  they been marching thousands of miles in mud snow . after all 1c dod not have it in the budget like Sega to put dry cleaners on the battle field so your troops can look bright and shinny before they die for you .\n\nI recomend this game if you are not a Total war freak and yeas I have a bunch of them . I get enough political games on TV . If real battles and hard core not bright shinny grphics are your thing  I got it for 2 bucks on sale the 90 minutes has already given me enough joy and look forward to many more hours . I am just into a M4 pre buy game simulation this weekend but will be playing this next rest assured ..","December 19, 2015","true","17.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

It has a lot of details to the battlefield that even one slight mistake can invite defeat for your side. Hardcore, very hard are 2 words that most suitable to represent this game.\n\nIt is however ridden with low performance issues and the support for this game is no longer active. I will still recommend this game but only if you can live with it's issues.","November 29, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

They are very different games.I acknowledge the game may not exist if Med.2 didn't but it's still an interesting period of history and a quite complex old game to play well in it's own right.To be sure it is rather like playing in a leaking diving mask in some battles,it is a bit blurred.Fog I believe it represents and that is  pretty usual up the Baltic Sometimes the view looks quite wonderful  and  the terrain  lends itself splendidly for attack or defence and there are plenty of various, well modelled, historically correct troops to choose from.  The game functions fine,load ups are a bit slow ,the music is a bit strange maybe I'm being picky but some of it sounds like a prolonged burp, battlesounds are excellent, controls of which there are far more than a certain other game and they are very good and give you tons of options for your troops.Been no glitches or crashes  it runs well on Windows 7.Ok If  I was only allowed to play this or Med 2   for the rest of my life  of course I would choose Med. 2.But none the less Real Warfare 1242 is a pretty damned good wargame especially if you  like the Medieval period ..It's a buck forty seven in my country now so its got to  be cheap in yours also and definetly worth giving it a try at that price.You might be  pleasantly surprised...","February 8","true","2.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Horrible graphics, long set-up for resolution and other options, no campaign map, bad camera control, and bad combat animation. For a 2010 release this is a poor excuse for a strategy game. If you want a good medieval srtategy with better overall gameplay get Medieval II: Total War. If you really want this game buy it when it is on sale not at full price, it's a waste of money.","July 13, 2014","false","2.0"," 37 of 96 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","37","96","2","2"

If you are looking for a game with horrible graphics, one voice actor and almost no stradegy element then this is for you.  This game dosent even have a campain.  You can ethier play a costom battle(which half of the time crashes) or lan.  Who the F*ck Plays Lan.  If you want to play a quality RTS then I suggest ethier Total War Shogun or any of the more recent instalments (Attila, Arena, Rome 2) do  not make the mistake of wasting your money like i did, Please this game will forever haunt your steam library if you do.","February 20, 2015","false","0.2"," 8 of 37 people (22%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","22","8","37","4","0"
