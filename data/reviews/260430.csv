I rarely write these anyway, but I find this game to be particularly interesting to discuss.\n\nFirst of all, it is a great idea, and fun to play.\n\nThat said, BlackJack, particularly, became utterly unplayable a few days prior to the writing of this review. Tables could not be joined; people had to leave chips on the table; dealers just disappeared into thin air.\n\nNormally, I would chalk it up to some bugs, but there is a principle of great importance here:\n\nIf you put your chips on that table, and that table stops working, I don't care if it is 1 cent or 1 billion of them, you should not lose that money because the game fails.\n\nI am incredibly frustrated by the fact that the game came out of alpha, and this is the result. They can NOT charge money for a broken game in this regard. Every casino game needs to be very secure and stable before they begin asking for our cents.\n\nThe game will charge a Steam account for the purchase of chips. How can they charge for the purchase of chips when you are forced by fault of the game to leave chips on the table when it locks up?\n\nI love the concept. I am irritated beyond belief (as are most players in the place lately) with the bugged out, game crushing, problems.\n\nSummary: I wouldn't advise placing a bet until I've interrogated everyone in the room to be sure things are working right at the time you are considering joining a game.\n","June 6, 2015","false","57.2"," 157 of 188 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","157","188","13","9"

For that I warn folks who have issues to be careful speaking up. Seems this Dev likes their dirty tricks when they don't want their filthy laundry aired out.\n\n\nThis is my final review edit. After enough time with four kings, I have decided they have completely lost touch with the fanbase who supported them from day one. Just as they did on playstion home for six long years.\n\nIm going to be honest here, I'm not liking the way things are going. I thought after they had their time with playstation home, we'd see changes that showed they learned their lesson last time from customer feedback.\n\nI remember a time when DL had a casino on ps home, it was an avitar social world with literally hundreds of mini games and places to chat and play. Game themed rooms and more. They also had a casino there and they did the same thing with chips there. The games there were PLAUGED with bugs and cheaters, very little was done. However they had no issue releasing an apartment for over 50 dollars that came with the same games you already had access to in their casino and they REFUSED to change the pricing even with such negative feedback. Oh and might I add, the people who were stupid enough to buy it lost those items anyway when ps home closed it's doors this past march.\n\nPeople lost thousands of chips with no rembursement, and the tournaments were a joke. You had to pay 4.99 for a tournament bracelet with no guarantee of any reward. Just a pat on the back for those who didnt make the cut, while they pocketed their real money.\n\n\nI was much happier with this game during EA. Now? Theyre making the game completely un fun by catering to the new players they want to spend money. Bingo nerfs are beyond terrible.\n\nIm now seated at a progressive game with over 25 players. The pot would usually be over 100k. It isn't even breaking 40k right now...and rp payouts are the same as the main floor games.\n\nThe people who bought in during early access are being pushed away to cater to the casual player with a spending problem.\n\nI have taken a break from four kings and returned today to see if the nerfs were truly as bad as they say, I'm unhappy to report they are far worse than what players are complaining about. I remember sitting at bingo for hours, and not having this back of luck either. One could say it comes and it goes, but this is just ridiculous.\n\nI was quick to respond to a gent who made a post on how this game is not only exploiting potential gambling addicts, but nothing more than a cash grab. I really would like to recall that person's username, so I can apologize and say they might be right.\n\nBecause the players who bought into this game and made is possible for it to even make it out of early access are being disregarded. If this is what developers plan to do to people who buy into their games in order to support a title, I am swearing off EA games entirely. Because this seems to be a NASTY habit with devs on here. They bend over backwards during EA, but after they get your money all bets are off.","June 19, 2015","false","300.3"," 164 of 202 people (81%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","81","164","202","13","8"

Especially after I started the game, entered my info and was expected to get a confirmation email that I had to use to verify myself. I never got it. So I tried logging into the casino anyway, and got in!\n\nSo I created my avatar, got my initial set of quests, which involved going into the various parts of the casino to get free coins, which I did to humor the developers attempt at a psuedo-tutorial. Got my money and proceeded to try out the various casino games.\n\nThe slot games were pretty good. I won reasonably enough but it was still a slow bleed of coins. Which I actually liked. It wasn't like Facebook slots where you lose everything in an hour, nor was it so generous that they were practically just free ATM machines.\n\nYou won enough to keep playing, even some nice big wins and bonus games, and yet lost enough to keep it real.\n\nI then went to play some bingo. The buy-in was a bit pricey, but it was well designed and fun to play as well. Being a semi-senior citizen myself I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was at a good reasonable pace that I could keep up with four cards yet at a good enough pace to keep you daubing those numbers.\n\nEven though they have multi-player blackjack and poker rooms, I played some video poker and blackjack to get the feel of things there.\n\nThe video blackjack was novel in that you played all 5 player slots against the dealer, and it was quite fun doing it that way. This was the ony time that I actually felt that the game was actually working against the players in that in playing around 30 hands the dealer never busted once, even when its face card was a 5 or 6, but I still won enough to play a good amount of time without feeling too cheated since I was playing 5 hands to its 1.\n\nNext I went to the video poker Jacks or Better machine which I personally felt was the one type of game where you can truly see how stacked the games are against players....and I was shocked....\n\nI don't even like video poker, but I ended up playing it for the next two hours. The odds were truly nearly perfect. I was even able to make a few inside straights, a handful of flushes on two card draws, and even keeping pairs of low cards was a reasonable and winnable strategy.\n\nIt was a thing of beauty. An honest, true to the odds video poker game. When I looked up and it was after midnight on a work night and I had played two hours on a casino game that I truly hated I was sold.\n\nThis is a good attempt at casino games, where their offerings are, at this point and time, honest and true to the odds, and actually pretty darn fun to play. I was truly shocked.\n\nThe real money shop is very reasonably priced, even better than Facebook casino's and its very liberal about giving you free coins as you play.\n\nAll in all I had a good time and was truly shocked that I did, and that I want to play again and try out other games. And I want to play more video poker...which I can't believe I'm actually saying....\n\nSo yeah...Four Kings Casino is truly in a world of its own compared to other casino-type games out there, and if you're in the least bit interested in it then it's definitely worth downloading and checking out for yourself.","July 28, 2015","true","10.2"," 77 of 101 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","77","101","7","0"

Unlike other Free Casino/Poker games, this one doesn't press you for real-world cash to actually play the game. Which instantly impressed me. You're able to spend your initial starting cash however you please, with a variety of different casino games on offer, all with reasonable in-game costs and payouts.\n\nIt has a generous system of earnings, giving you free credits every 15 minutes and an objectives system that allows you to earn extra in-game cash for completing various tasks in the games and around the virtual casino.\n\nWith all this in mind, and the overall quality of the game-world, balance and mechanics. For a FREE game, I'm incredibly impressed with it. It has the addicting nature of online gambing without the home-destroying nature of online gambling... unless you stop going to work because you sink all of your time into this game, but still thoroughly enjoyable if you're into casino games but don't want to spend your real world money on anything other than a sense of fashion for your casino avatar, I'd highly suggest giving this a go.","August 9, 2015","true","12.4"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","32","38","0","0"

However, the major draw for this game is the player interaction.\n\nNow, like any MMORPG, you're going to have your bad apples, the players who just want to cause trouble.  But, on the whole, the players are a good group, and it is fun to interact with people from around the world.\n\nYou also have the fun of creating your avatar, and buying various clothing options.  There are items available for real money, and also items available for RP - the reward points you earn when you win in the casino.\n\nJust don't expect the game to be something it's not, and expect to spend money on chips if you play a lot, and enjoy the aspects of the game that are truly exceptional.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshabee96/recommended/260430/","joshabee96","Joshabee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshabee96/","123 products in account","The game deserved better than a "Mixed" overall.\n\nIt's a 3D casino game with a bit of character customization. You can walk around, talk to other players, and lose all of your chips in a single hand of blackjack because you decided to hit on 17. It's good at what it does, and it's a shame that there aren't more games on Steam like this. WIth that out of the way, there are in fact, microtransactions, bugs, and space issues. All of these issues though, are not nearly as bad as people make them out to be. You never HAVE to buy chips in order to play. You are generously given chips frequently. Every 15 minutes you get 250. Logging in for the first time grants you 1000, and 500 for each subsequent day you log in. And finally, doing daily and weekly tasks, gives you chips. Trust me, you should have plenty of enough chips to start playing anything except for maybe Poker.\nAs for bugs, I personally have only encountered one. It's slightly annoying to join a table, only to freeze and be unable to do anything. That being said, that was literally only the first day of me playing. I haven't had that problem at all since.\nPeople complaining about "Dealers dealing to nonexistent people" are probably just having internet troubles. Now, the only REAL issue, is the lack of tables. There's tons of slot machines and plenty of seats in Bingo, but there's a huge issue with Blackjack and Poker tables being full constantly.\n\nI fully recommend this game for people that don't want to spend money on actually going to the Casino. It's a casual casino experience, and it's great at being that.","June 4, 2015","true","14.2"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","34","49","3","0"

I haven't tested every single title, but after spending a chunk of time on several, I can say the following:\n\nPros:\nA good set of titles that all function well; poker is of course only as good as the players you get, but all the basic functionality and pomp is here, combined with the daily tasks and tier increases that made PS Home attractive for folks like me.  It is, in essence, a wide array of gambling options with level ups and leveling bonuses.  That's kind of awesome.\n\nRegular influx of chips.  Playing for free long-term is entirely possible due to getting a decent chunk of chips for free from a number of resources (daily super slots, daily/weekly tasks for more chips, 250 chips every 15 minutes in game), which keeps the title from feeling locked off to any reasonable extent.\n\nLooks great.  Not Skyrim-with-a-million-graphics-mods great, but there's obviously been a lot of work to make the Four Kings look interesting, like the kind of place you could go for a vacation.\n\nCons\nLack of counter of autoplay.  This is a minor quibble but it does frustrate.  I like to play the machine game 'Instant Keno', and it's a bit annoying that when I select the autoplay option that until it gets to the final play, I have no visual indicator how many runs I have left.\n\nWasted space.  I love the nightclub and the apartment!  They look great, and again bring me back to what I liked about Playstation Home.  Except, they have no purpose at present.  The nightclub has the same music as the rest of the game.  The DJ booth, the bars, all have no interactivity.  The apartment is arguably worse, in that while it looks lovely, there's no way to interact with anything in this allegedly personal space, not even the televisions that look for all the world like they SHOULD be interactive.  I don't want these spaces excized, mind you; it helps to separate the title from generic casino titles in a similar vein, but all of the above needs SOME measure of interaction.  Mini-games, additional places to spend chips/RP/etc, looping videos, new music, I don't care what.  But for it to be lacking all of that makes it little more than window dressing.\n\nLimited spending options.  At present, chips let you play games, winning gives you RP, which can be used to buy a SMALL handful of avatar items, and if you earn X amount in a single month, you get VIP access for a month.  And... that's it.  Can't upgrade your apartment, avatar options are super limited, no special entertainment options for expending RP, etc, etc.  I hope this changes, as there's a lot of room here for enhancement of the overall experience beyond the casino games (which, again, work great and are decently diverse).\n\n\nOverall, the game is a recommend.  Yes, it has flaws, and I hope to see the title expand a LOT.  But what is there right now is a complete gambling title with solid gameplay in a good environment with countless options for snagging more chips for free and getting your fix on for the day.  And for an entry price of free, it's hard not to say give it a shot.","June 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

I haven't tested every single title, but after spending a chunk of time on several, I can say the following:\n\nPros:\nA good set of titles that all function well; poker is of course only as good as the players you get, but all the basic functionality and pomp is here, combined with the daily tasks and tier increases that made PS Home attractive for folks like me.  It is, in essence, a wide array of gambling options with level ups and leveling bonuses.  That's kind of awesome.\n\nRegular influx of chips.  Playing for free long-term is entirely possible due to getting a decent chunk of chips for free from a number of resources (daily super slots, daily/weekly tasks for more chips, 250 chips every 15 minutes in game), which keeps the title from feeling locked off to any reasonable extent.\n\nLooks great.  Not Skyrim-with-a-million-graphics-mods great, but there's obviously been a lot of work to make the Four Kings look interesting, like the kind of place you could go for a vacation.\n\nCons\nLack of counter of autoplay.  This is a minor quibble but it does frustrate.  I like to play the machine game 'Instant Keno', and it's a bit annoying that when I select the autoplay option that until it gets to the final play, I have no visual indicator how many runs I have left.\n\nWasted space.  I love the nightclub and the apartment!  They look great, and again bring me back to what I liked about Playstation Home.  Except, they have no purpose at present.  The nightclub has the same music as the rest of the game.  The DJ booth, the bars, all have no interactivity.  The apartment is arguably worse, in that while it looks lovely, there's no way to interact with anything in this allegedly personal space, not even the televisions that look for all the world like they SHOULD be interactive.  I don't want these spaces excized, mind you; it helps to separate the title from generic casino titles in a similar vein, but all of the above needs SOME measure of interaction.  Mini-games, additional places to spend chips/RP/etc, looping videos, new music, I don't care what.  But for it to be lacking all of that makes it little more than window dressing.\n\nLimited spending options.  At present, chips let you play games, winning gives you RP, which can be used to buy a SMALL handful of avatar items, and if you earn X amount in a single month, you get VIP access for a month.  And... that's it.  Can't upgrade your apartment, avatar options are super limited, no special entertainment options for expending RP, etc, etc.  I hope this changes, as there's a lot of room here for enhancement of the overall experience beyond the casino games (which, again, work great and are decently diverse).\n\n\nOverall, the game is a recommend.  Yes, it has flaws, and I hope to see the title expand a LOT.  But what is there right now is a complete gambling title with solid gameplay in a good environment with countless options for snagging more chips for free and getting your fix on for the day.  And for an entry price of free, it's hard not to say give it a shot.","June 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

This game also has some cool clothing options. There should be more options for players when no other players are available. No one like to sit at an empty table for 20 mins waiting for people to join. Some of the payouts don't seem to be distributed correctly, especially the Slots. I do like the daily tasks, it gives you something fun to do while you enjoy the games. Overall, the game looks good, has some great giveaways and freebies, seems to be a great social mechanism, but t he game play for each individual game needs some work.

This alone should be enough for you to at least check out this community.\n\n2- Assortment of games - Games from Video Poker, blackjack, Keno, Slots and various table games.  Pretty much you'll find the most common table games\n\n3- Atmosphere - The piano music playing casually in the background while playing Baccarat. Or when you walk by the bar and see some players having a casual chat about their luck. This game completely nails the feeling if being inside a casino.\n\n\nCons - honestly not really things which ruin the game or make it bad, just small quality of life things which can honestly be patched in over time. *shortly before this posting the bingo room had a patch already fixing one of my biggest gripes*\n\n\n1- Running animation - good lord the run cycle on player models.... I just feel they need to be redone completely.\n\n\nThere's some various tiny things with the player model and items, but its so minor I don't feel the need to bring it up.\n\n\n\nOverall feeling about the game?? I highly suggest anyone thats interested in playing an accurate casino style game download and try playing. You have nothing to loose except your chips if you're not lucky!!

If  like me you were looking for a fun  way to pretend to  gamble then  do not buy this game because once out of Early Access it could end up costing you a lot of money if you continue to play the game.  During Early Access you can earn small amounts of chips  (usually  25 chips at a time) for doing   several things like visiting certain area's of the casino, plus you can earn the same number of  chips  for every 15 minutes you spend in game.  When you  enter the Casino after purchasing the game you  are given 1000 chips.\n\nMy first love is  slots, so  I casually ran over to the slots and   after 10 spins  I'd spent  virtually all of my chips.   Thankfully, during the  Early Acess phase you can get more chips for   very little money; i.e.  there are several selections ranging from 500 chips to 40 000 chips each one of which  costs you $0.01 to purchase. This amount is deducted from your Steam wallet.   Once early access is over these will undoubtably change and cost much more.  Sadly, like any gambling den, the odds are always stacked against you.\n\nAfter the 10 turns on the  slots, with virtually no chips left  and not wanting to wait around for  almost an hour before I could get  a couple  more spins, I left, then rejoined the following day because I was under the impression that during Early Access we would be given   1000 chips every  day, but this was not the case (I purchased the  basic game plus the cheaper of the dlc's, (costing me a total of just over £16).\n\nI don't know whether   you can or will be able to convert  any winnings  to  real money, but even if you were, it's only a  lucky few that would ever manage to get any real money back.\n\nPersonally I'm really disappointed with this game.  I was  hoping to be able to play a wide range of different slot machines,  but there was little  variety to be found, plus until I decided to buy the  highest  slection of chips I only had enough for two spins and  four goes on the roulette table (which has a minimum bet of 10 chips).\n\nPart way through my second visit there was a server reboot.  I was given literally a  minute's warning in which I was asked to log off.  As I was part way through a gamble  when this occured I wasn't    pleased.\n\nDespite it being in Early Access, so by definition  not a completed game, I can't recommend this game to anyone but   hardened gamblers.","February 19, 2015","false","3.8"," 41 of 69 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","41","69","2","11"

Reminds me a bit of the long since cancelled This is Vegas but multiplayer. In this state, there is a lot of variety in the different types of casino games, even if they suffer from the major population issue mentioned below. But at least it isn't just limited to a few of them. Best part is that you don't have multiple spam messages all along your Facebook wall from your parents trying to get chips from you.\n\nGame runs fine on my machine at least and save for one period where I had issues loading the character customizer, everything is fine on a technical standpoint.\n\nThe only thing holding the game back is its lack of players, which due to the social nature of the game seriously harms the game even in this Early Access state. Hopefully once it launches people will give it a look. Maybe if Digital Leisure adds crafting and zombies, people will play it. :)\n\nSome suggestions to the developer for release and beyond:\nFigure out some reason for people to use the nightclub, whether its a drink-serving minigame to earn chips or something else worthwile.

There is no cash games, only sit-and-go style tournaments with extremely fast blind levels that tend to turn the game into an all-in festival within minutes. There is no variety in games.

Slots is the easiest game to sink money and time into and the current machine is rather lackluster. I'm aware a new machine is on it's way and that's what I'm most excited for.\n\nThere is some issues with the games UI still and quite a few issues regarding the VIP system and everything relating that is rather confusing and not very well explained.\n\nThe customisation of the characters is very strong and enjoyable, there is a lot of options regarding your style and the currency to buy items is a little hard to get however it's very rewarding when you finally get the item you have wanted.\n\n\nMy biggest gripe is the VIP system and that is runs on a server based clock and if you manage to get VIP one day before the end of the month you get it for only that one day, then when the reset rolls around it clocks you back to normal status.\nEven if you purchased one of the dlc packs for a month of VIP it resets you to normal status when the monthly reset happens - so if you purchase it at a bad time you could only get 5 days of VIP or however long untill the month changes.\n\nThis is a game I have been waiting for, and for a very long time. I am so glad it has finally come and it is so enjoyable. The updates are frequent however often not many new features as there is a lot of work to be done on the backend of the game and the new games etc take a very long time to produce.\nThe payouts are balance, the game is fun, and the servers are fast.\n\nA great game in my opinion and I'm glad I bought into the beta before it went F2P because I got so much out of it.

I spoke with one of the developers today and I can truly say they are putting in their best efforts to improve this game. An update is being installed as I type. I entered the casino and I must say, everything is quite self-explanatory. After playing a few spins on the roulette table I ran into a member of the dev-team and had a nice conversation. I have been looking for a game like this for AAAGES. But two weeks ago I searched yet again for a decent casino game on steam, and only a bit later, this comes out. It is truly amazing and heading in the good direction.\n\nYes, there may be bugs and things may not be as "smooth" as one would like, but keep in mind that this game is still in development. I bought the all-in package and I am glad I did. I wonder if it will be ever possible to turn your 'earnings' into real money, since you can buy additional chips in the game with real currency. Anyway this game is really a must-have if you love gambling. This is the first time I have ever written a decent review on a steam game. On a game in general, I think. But let me tell you once again: It. Is. Worth. It. The variety of games to play is good. There's blackjack, single-deck 21, craps, keno, hold 'em poker, roulette, PuntoBanco/Baccarat, slot machines and some kind of "Wheel of fortune". There is also a VIP-area which allows you to play at tables with higher stakes, which makes it possible to either win more - or loose more - being able to change your bet more to your liking. You can also sit on a bench and do some emotes while talking, this adds to the real-life atmosphere.\n\nI will keep a close eye on the development of this game!\n\n>went to blackjack table\n> bet $1.000\n>Double down at 16\n>5\n>21\n\n10/10 would double down again on high numbers.","February 24, 2015","true","76.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","2"

For example, all of the video blackjack machines seemed to have the same minimum bid requirement...it would have been nice to see nickel, quarter and dollar machines to give players a bit more longevity with their chips.  On the bright side, there are plenty of ways to earn free chips (daily quests, spinning a daily wheel, visiting the chip machine every so often, etc.).  There was barely anyone on when I played, though the gentleman I ran into was nice enough...hopefully the folks who will potentially populate the server will be equally as warm.  It has potential, but there's room for improvement (hence why the game is currently in the Early Access program, no doubt).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTLmaAArqDU\n\n","May 13, 2015","true","0.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

Remember Ceasars Palace? That was a good game made 15 years ago and there hasn't been something similar until now. The Four Kings is a huge casino and you can walk up to any table/machine and play it. 10/10\n\nYou start with 10k chips and can purchase 400k for $20. If you're smart, that 400k will last an extremely long time even with max bets. For a free game, the 10k can last you a long time. That's a pretty incredible deal. Don't like it? Stop playing, or decide to spend $20 for the largest package of chips. The avatars are cheap and you can earn quite a few perks at the poker and blackjack tables for free. $20 out of the gate is very fair.\n\nThere's tons of selection of games. Multiplayer makes this game awesome. You can sit down at a blackjack, craps, poker, roulette, war and money wheel and even bingo with real people. First person table view is excellent. Tired of playing? Go for a walk and sit down on a couch, eat some lunch, and come back. There's also a VIP area and many shops to buy things for your avatar. Call your friends up and play poker together with other people online.\n\nYes, this game requires major computer resources as people are saying, so if you can't handle it turn them to low in the settings.","June 21, 2015","true","31.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

Out of thin air crashs, freezing game tables, countless lost chips due to casino's errors, took away the tad bit joy it created.\n\nShall I mention that the BJ dealer is cheating like %80 of the time? Let me. This one time, I am playing table limit, my hand is 20, dealer's upcard is 3. OK, losing is something possible and acceptible, even in this situation, but what is 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 21? How's that even possible? Every single time I hit on 12-13 I bust, when dealer hits, it's a 21.\n\nI've been playing BJ and frequenting casinos more than seven years, and believe me, I've never seen a shameless blatantly cheating BJ like this.\n\nVideo BJ is weird though, I presume devs forgot to fix that machine, nearly %60 of the time dealer busts.\n\nVideo Poker? Scam of the century. Lot less profitable than real casinos.\n\nIt's a game after all, one should get free chips to sustain a cashroll, or enough to create a base when outta chips. (which is a strong probability with cheating machines)  All you get is 1000 from daily if you've log in on consecutive days, 250 free chips every 15 minutes, or various amounts from daily tasks (average 800 chips daily).\n\nOops, then what you gonna do? Can't even borrow from friends! "You should buy chips", they say. Dude, if I want to pay for chips, I'd be at a real casino, not here. And what happens if I gain more chips? Nothing. I can't even give away my chips, which is totally nonsense.\n\nBut give the guys some credit. The whole concept of casino is about sucking money, and here you see casino combined with f2p, it tries to suck even more. Way to go, devs.\n\n\nOverall, decent graphics, nice variety of games, cheating AI, scamming devs, borderline braindead community.\nStay away from this game as far as you can.","January 15","false","16.2"," 36 of 63 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","36","63","7","0"

I'm sure with a couple of patches we'll see this as a fully functional game.\nAs an avid casino player having played, Reel Deal Vegas/Live (when it was open), Casino RPG, and Facebook casino games I can tell you that this is one of the best casino games out there. The navigation takes a bit of getting use to and clicking (E) to interact with tables and the video machines is cumbersome but still enjoy it nonetheless a very beautiful casino. I love the fact that there's alot of detail that went into there table games and the fact that this casino has an actual bingo room. You can even sit on the chairs provided and have a hotel room which you can access.\nI'm hoping in the future they have more to customize such as changing or upgrading your room, etc. Of course more slots and more variety of table games. its def on the right path though\n\nthe only heartburn I have with it is the microtransactions, I feel they could go the subscription route but thats just me.","June 20, 2015","true","53.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

The devs made it incredibly easy to enjoy this game without spending a dime. You get free chips regularly, every 15 minutes or so, there's multiple free daily things to get chips (poker, slots) and some of the jackpots you can hit pay out tons. If you are inclined to spend money on this game it's incredibly cheap, I was actually surprised at how little they charge for chips, cosmetic items are really the only thing with a mention worthy price tag. Devs are on regularly and actively listening to feedback and bug reports. It also has a really large community for being out for a whole two days. I can only see this becoming more enjoyable.\n\nIf you enjoy gambling but you're a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this game is for you.","June 3, 2015","true","26.5"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","14","23","2","0"

Of the "bugs" that many worry about when playing a game this new (I downloaded this game, based off of the version logs, the day after it launched on steam), the only one I have scene is that when a BUNCH of people are on all at once, some of the table animations glitch a little, other than that from what I have experienced, this is a solid, fun, fluid game that I fully intend on playing regularly (which translates into whenever I have time).\n\n"And remember, we're all in this together against the blackjack dealers"","June 8, 2015","true","24.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Another big thing is the constant glitches and bugs riddled throughout the game that can make it obnoxious to play at times and even cause to lose chips. You can play this game for free, but the amount of chips they supply you with are minimal and very easy to lose so most likely this will be a pay to play game for you. The four points I gave it is simply because it is a casino and who doesn't love gambling.\ngraphics gets a 7/10... I did enjoy the graphics although there are many bugs with the emotes and things seem to be pretty cartoony (hey what do you expect) it's not very realistic but it gets the job done.\ncustomer service gets a 9/10... they are quick to refund lost chips due to their glitches and provide needed help, but one night I had a huge error in the game and they simply ignored my direct messages on facebook to their company (their page isn't even busy) which simply cannot allow me to give them a 10/10.\n\nThis game is very addicting but can also be a money sink which is bad because in reality their prices for chips are absolutely horrible and if you aren't careful about your bets you could blow through $20 in a few days. In the end i decided the game was pointless and just decided to go all in on one number on roulette (75 spins) 10k bet and it didn't hit my number a single time (WHAT ARE THE ODDS??). So I would say check this game out it's pretty fun for a while but whatever you do don't put money into this rigged game as you will never win.\n","February 5","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are slot machines and other machine games like video poker or video Blackjack, you can play Bingo together with up to 40 players, play Blackjack, Poker or War at 6 player tables and many other games. There is never a moment of boredom as you have many goals such as daily & weekly tasks, Tiers, Steam & In-game achievements, tourmnaments, and more. If you should get tired of playing & chatting you even have a hotel room where you can have some time for yourself.\nTrue, this game also has bugs and glitches, such as people getting disconnected (if you loose chips don't worry, i've lost many and all of them have been refunded), but this game has a good Team of dedicated Developers who care about making this game a wonderfull experience for everyone :)","April 15","true","756.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

About 2 years or more to be more exact.  So, back then, and even earlier, there was this thing called Playstation Home, and it was a place where you could play games, watch videos on new game/movie releases, meet people, socialize, and do other things as well.  It was an amazing place and the best part was just how you could be what you wanted to be, although some times it did have a price tag on it, and have fun.  One of the many companies I remembered was DL.   They were well known for having their Casino hub, and a lot of people liked them for it.   Now, back then, I was able to play as well, and although I spent more money than I would like to admit, I did have fun and once you got to a certain tier/level, you never had to worry about losing too much money because you just had to play smart and not be an idiot.\n\n\nWell that was nice and all but PSH was shutdown because Sony wasn't making enough money or something and all that money we spent, went bye bye.   Now, back to the present.  We have this Casino game, back up and free to play, and it has the same feel as the other casino did.   So my review is biased slightly because I really loved it back then and am happy to see it now.   Due to that, I will keep the review part, short and brief.\n\n\nPros:\nHas many different gambling games and slots\nNice way to customize your avatar in terms fo looks\nrewards for winning things or achieving things\nways to earn free chips so you can still play\nMuch much cheaper prices for chips than when it was on PSH\nVisuals are pretty but\nCon:\n\nVisuals are pretty, but if you put on max or near max, then you will lag, badly.  Its just not that well optimzied but who cares, its all about the gambling, not the visuals\nEasy to lose money fast if you don't know what you are doing\n\n\nOverall, this is very much like how Home was but with a few changes that make it nice.   And yes you can still dance in front of people and be a weirdo.","June 7, 2015","true","1.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","2"

Most typical casino games are present and the play style is that of an mmo with customizable avatars ect allowing you to navigate the realistic virtual casino setting and join the different games as you choose. Gameplay is very similar to the Digital Leisure casino that was part of playstation home, for those that played that, only graphically better. Bugs have been minimal over the several hours I've played so far and the game is pretty polished for the first few days of early access beta. I would definitely recommend this game for casual players who enjoy both casino style gaming and social mmo type game mechanics. My only caveat is that this game is not strictly a free to play game, but after its offical launch will be a microtransaction model wherein you have the option of  purchasing additional casino chips to augment or replenish your current holdings. As with any game of this nature the inherent cost will depend on what you decide to spend, so amongst those gamers who inexplicably expect to enjoy playing polished multiplayer games without having to financially support them I'm sure there will be complaining.","February 20, 2015","true","152.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

My rating 8 of 10. This is a Must try and see for yourself. Pros: Open world, Multi player, custumization, intovative and really like no other game out there and many more pros. im sure im not listing, because i want to get back on and play poker lol. This game is good!! Needs some kinks worked out. The only one i can think of really at the moment is \"rarly\" the you may buy into a game and get a server disconnect and or game freeze, but this can be very upsetting when you buy in for lets say 25k at the VIP table. However the customer service seems very on top of this issue and if and when this may happens submit a bug report to them \"very easy and fast to do in options setting\" and they will at least be kind enough to refund any buyins lost due to this bug issue. I say it happens rarley because ive played well over a 100 poker sit and goes and this has happen maybe 5 times to me. Things i would like to see happen in this game is: Big texas Holdem events \"freezout tournaments\" another would be a MUCK button i know this sounds lame but sometimes i just want to muck and not check if i know my cards are dead after the flop.... Play this game you will have fun you will laugh at other players dancing and there outfits and much mote.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJCaseyD/recommended/260430/","DJCaseyD","DJCaseyD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJCaseyD/","582 products in account","I really wanted to like this game. I'm a big fan of casino games in general. I don't gamble much in real life, but it's nice to be able to have fun with little expense. Unfortunately, this game didn't really fit the bill.  From a social aspect, it's fine. Most of the people are nice. The rest of the game though, is severely lacking.\n\nPoker has the same problem it has anywhere else. It's free. People still make boneheaded calls and go all-in with nothing.  The bigger problem is that the only tournament you can play is with 6 people at one table. You start with $50k which would be fine if the blinds didn't go up extremely fast. It makes trying to play a realistic game of poker virtually impossible, as very soon after starting you're pretty much pot committed once you bet anything.\n\nBlackjack is probably the best part of the game though, especially after the last update, it literally feels like the dealer is getting 20 or 21 every other hand. Still, there is money to be made if you know how to play.\n\nThat brings me to the worst part of the game, table machines. Slots, keno, video blackjack and video poker are money suckers with what seems like much lower payout percentages than even Vegas. I literally sat there for 30-45 minutes without a single bonus round. Forget trying to bet anything higher than the minimum because you will soon be out of money.  There are only three types of slot machines which gets old really fast especially when none of them pay.  Keno has a minimum bet of $100 and video blackjack has a minimum of $200. With poor payouts, again you will be out of money quickly.  The game also has war, roulette, big wheel, craps and bingo which are all pretty standard.  Again, especially with war, it seems like the more money bet, the lower percentage of times you're going to win.\n\nYou have daily tasks to do, receiving $200 for each of the 6. Unfortunately, most of the time you will be spending more than that to complete the tasks. There are weekly tasks, mostly revolving around getting a certain amount of XP. An example of the problem with this is me spending 45 minutes playing a $400 per spin slot machine, losing 40k and gaining a whopping 200xp. That would have been great if the weekly task wasn't 1,000 XP with a few thousand reward for doing so.  There is a VIP section for high rollers but I honestly don't know how people get to be high rollers unless they have spent real money or gotten extremely lucky.\n\nAgain, I really wanted to like the game. Unforunately, there is better poker to be had on any online site and the rest of the game is just no fun with the extremely low payouts.  If you're just in it for the social aspect and don't mind betting small, go for it. Otherwise, I'd stick with other products.","September 5, 2015","false","39.3"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neevolima/recommended/260430/","neevolima","NeevoLima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neevolima/","275 products in account","The game is a combination of Second Life and a common Casino Game. I like the idea and I think the developers' execution is well done. Using a laptop with HD3000 chip, I cannot rate the graphics.\n\nPlus:\n- The diversity of casino games is very good and even better than the average casino-only games.\n- The socializing is eased as a HUD is implemented similar to MMORPGs with some default mimics (Dance, Say Hello, Wave the hand, ...).\n- Easy start with start chips and the support through chip income with daily quests. If you do not want to spend hours on gambling, than I think it should be enough.\n\nNeutral:\n- The execution time of the casino table games is poor. It is onlz neutral, as the developer have to ensure that all players are on the same level all the times. But in a real live casino, the execution is mind blowing contrary to this game.\n- The party room seems unecessary, as there is never one in it. On first sight, this room also does not provide any benefit or interesting spot.\n- 3 Minutes to wait when all players are there to start a round of Bingo? That's far too high!\n\nMinus:\nBasically the casino consists of 5 rooms (hopefully I counted correctly). However, each room is only accessible via a loading screen. I think this concept is too much outdated to give here any possibilty for an excuse. The casino is not the Venetian and I think the level should be loadable within one go.","August 31, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You should have no problem being able to gamble and hang with friends without buying chips if you know how to play the games.  Also if you don't over bet based on the amount of chips you have.  It has 3 different slot games, Video Poker, Video BJ, multiple deck BJ and single handed BJ (in VIP lounge), Texas Hold em, Keno, War, Roulette, Craps, Bingo, Big 6 Wheel, and Baccarat. The game has events on the weekends (same 4 that repeat), daily tasks (quests if you will), and weekly tasks.  The leaderboards reset every 3 months (considered seasons) and I believe there are rewards at the end of each season depending on where you rank in each game and global.\n\nOn the downside, there are gliches which is to be expected.  They patch probably once a month, sometimes twice.  There are people that shouldn't be on the game much less within the social/online community like anywhere. Easily can be blocked though.\n\nIf you enjoy messing around with gambling then you would probably enjoy this game.","February 20","true","340.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I enjoy the real casino vibe it carries.  Almost all of the social aspects of the game fall totally flat.  Like your complimentary apartment, and the dance club.  There are zero reasons to go there.  I walked around the apartment and you can't do anything except sit on things.  I didn't even notice any customizable aspects to it.\n\nPros.\n\nReal Casino simulator in how you walk around and play the games.  Seems like most of the games simulate real life fairly well based on my experience with those games.  Poker is always agaisnt players so it is the "fairest", although it falls victim to all fake money poker games out there.\n\nCons.\n\nBlackjack.  Holy crap... the blackjack.\n\nThis game however is totally broken.  The dealer draws to 20 and 21 an INSANE amount of times.  It regularly draws to 20 and 21 with 5 and 6 showing.  The worst cards it can get.  The dealer also ends up with 20+ so often that you simply can't win even a 30 minute sitdown of basic BJ play.  I have played basic BJ rules, and in real life you can expect losing streaks of up to around 6 hands in a row.  More then that gets mathmatically inplausable, although 7 or even 8 could technically happen if you played for long periods of time.  This game however has gone on multiple 10+ hand losing streaks.  I have seen three 10 hand losing streaks in the last 2 days alone and Iv only dared play it a handful of times.  These happen in less then 20 minutes of playing.  The odds of this happening should be impossible, but it happens regularly.  10 unwinnable hands in a row when you play basic BJ.   I always play solo at the table to exclude any player errors.  Do NOT play BJ in this game.  Unless you are only going to play 3 or 4 hands and pray for a win.  But for real long term tight play, its useless.","August 19, 2015","true","19.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I enjoy the real casino vibe it carries.  Almost all of the social aspects of the game fall totally flat.  Like your complimentary apartment, and the dance club.  There are zero reasons to go there.  I walked around the apartment and you can't do anything except sit on things.  I didn't even notice any customizable aspects to it.\n\nPros.\n\nReal Casino simulator in how you walk around and play the games.  Seems like most of the games simulate real life fairly well based on my experience with those games.  Poker is always agaisnt players so it is the "fairest", although it falls victim to all fake money poker games out there.\n\nCons.\n\nBlackjack.  Holy crap... the blackjack.\n\nThis game however is totally broken.  The dealer draws to 20 and 21 an INSANE amount of times.  It regularly draws to 20 and 21 with 5 and 6 showing.  The worst cards it can get.  The dealer also ends up with 20+ so often that you simply can't win even a 30 minute sitdown of basic BJ play.  I have played basic BJ rules, and in real life you can expect losing streaks of up to around 6 hands in a row.  More then that gets mathmatically inplausable, although 7 or even 8 could technically happen if you played for long periods of time.  This game however has gone on multiple 10+ hand losing streaks.  I have seen three 10 hand losing streaks in the last 2 days alone and Iv only dared play it a handful of times.  These happen in less then 20 minutes of playing.  The odds of this happening should be impossible, but it happens regularly.  10 unwinnable hands in a row when you play basic BJ.   I always play solo at the table to exclude any player errors.  Do NOT play BJ in this game.  Unless you are only going to play 3 or 4 hands and pray for a win.  But for real long term tight play, its useless.","August 19, 2015","true","19.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Especially with friends.\n\nYou get to customize a character, you have your own hotel room, the environments are beautiful, and the games are pretty damn entertaining. I expected to have microtransactions shoved down my throat at every turn, but the starting money is generous and unless you really suck at gambling, it's hard to lose those starting funds (free chips every 15 minutes, free bingo games, chips lying around the casino, and dailies/monthies help earn anything lost back as well). Only other transactions were minor and completely optional, mostly cosmetic.\n\nI don't have many complaints, honestly. I hope to see this game grow and improve, as there's plenty of ways they can expand the experience. I might actually put money into the game purely to support the model they have going.

I foolishly decided to purchase some more chips with real money just to enjoy another game of poker, but OF COURSE the table froze and everyone lost 5000 chips, all 6 players. I see the game has only been released since june the 1st, but yeah, the game devs are definitely going to want this fixed like yesterday or this game will be useless.\n\nNow, let me say this. These table glitch / freeze are the only issue i have with the game, other then that, the game is great. I'm forced to leave a negative review because of these very frequent very frustrating crashes that steal my chips, WHEN I WAS WINNING THE POKER Game.

So far I have had the game for only 2 DAYS, 2 DAYS!!!!!!............and i have lost over 20000 chips from glitches. I foolishly decided to purchase some more chips with real money just to enjoy another game of poker, but OF COURSE the table froze and everyone lost 5000 chips, all 6 players. I see the game has only been released since june the 1st, but yeah, the game devs are definitely going to want this fixed like yesterday or this game will be useless.\n\nNow, let me say this. These table glitch / freeze are the only issue i have with the game, other then that, the game is great. I'm forced to leave a negative review because of these very frequent very frustrating crashes that steal my chips, WHEN I WAS WINNING THE POKER Game. This turns a very fun game into a frustrating anger fueler. lol, seriously tho, fix the f-ing game.\n","June 12, 2015","true","216.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

If you like casinos/casino games this is well done. The social interaction factor is a great addition. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. However, I am a bit concerned about the requirement in the VIP status section that states "minimum 30 day membership." For those of us who had enough faith in you to buy in as early access founders are you intending to charge a monthly membership fee? Considering your all in pass was almost as much as GTA V I think you would be making a critical error to charge founding members a monthly fee. Biting the hand that fed you could cause a rather nasty backlash. Example being what happened when Steam decided to allow charging a fee for Elder Scrolls V Skyrim mods. That really kicked the hornets’ nest and they quickly rescinded. Think about it gentlemen.","May 25, 2015","true","107.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As for the other games, it's all up to personal preference, I personally love roullette, but they have just about everything you'd want. You'll gain RP that will allow you to purchase cool and often comedic duds for your character. It is a solid buy, and as long as you aren't frivilous with your chips, you'll likely think so too.

The deciding factor for me was that although I get 250 chips every 15 minutes, buy-ins and minimum bets are much too high. 50 chips for a hand of war, 5000 chips for a sit and go 6 man poker game (besides the once-a-day freebie poker table), 200 per hand of video poker? I also couldn't find the payout table for the slot machine but that might just be a PEBKAC error. They really need to add about 3 floors to their casino with different stake levels on each floor.

A PS4 version is planned for the future. I must admit I was skeptical at first. Partly because I am not much of a gambler. But I wanted to be able to give our readers at yourpshome.net an insight as to what it was all about. Guess what? I got sucked in :)\n\nFirst of all, I was surprised at just how far this project has come along. I expected a very tiny begining and was amazed the first time I signed on that a whole casino was in front of me complete with a VIP room and a Club to party in. Now a nice "hotel room" (personal space) has been added which means the groundwork has been laid for future expansion.\n\nI orinally intended to just use the "free" or "beta" version, but it only took one visit to make me want to upgrade to an "All-In" pass. Well worth it.\n\nSo even if you are not a die-hard gambler, you might still want to check this out. This isn't a Home replacement but its the best I've seen so far. Check it out. Who knows what the future holds?","April 7, 2015","true","38.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I bought and install this game yesterday but i didn't expect so much because this game is still in "early access" But when i'm enter the game, i'm very shocked. There are NO connection problem and NO major bugs. This game is only needs more slot machines, but i believe, developers will handle this. The developers are very polite and friendly, this is very good. Optimization is good, with my GT 710M graphics card, medium graphics option (Anti Aliasing is set "0" and Texture quality is "High"), FPS is between 40-60 (Fps dropped when i enter the crowd)\n\nWhen i went to Cyprus for holiday, i was play gambling in some casino's in Kyrenia and Nicosia. I love to slot machines and generally, i played slot machines in casino's. There are many but different slot machines in Cyprus's casinos. In real life, casino atmosphere is unlike anything. You can see different slot machines, poker and roulette tables, happy, sad, excited and angry people in casino. Anyway, i must admit that, this game have high potential, there is no doubt. I believe, developers will put many and good slot machines in this game.\n\nFriendly Advices:\n\n- More slot machines will be very nice\n- Adding croupier (dealer)\n- Adding waiter/waitress is maybe nice detail in this game. We can order drinks :)\n- Adding some events\n\nThat's all for now, thanks for this game :)\n\nEdit-1: Unlike many MMO's, almost all people in this game are very friendly and polite each other. Especially in the VIP Area, every people are very gentle. I admit that, i'm very glad in this situation.","April 28, 2015","true","277.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","1"

The dealer in Four Kings gets a 20+ more than half of the time after 30 hands and most of those are a starting pair of 10 value cards.\n\nThe chances of these things happening aren't impossible, but for my first example, you would literally be more likely to pick an atom in your house at random and then accidently pick it again. And this somehow happened 5 times, if that's not cheating then I must have a luck of about 1 or 2 because I have lost over 100k chips to the blackjack tables.","July 26, 2015","false","10.0"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","17","31","7","1"

Bingo is easyly the most played game, while the nightclub is a joke of a room no music no simulated drinking or ablity to buy a person a drink as a gift no reason to go there. The other games are fun (Blackjack being my fav!)  but the slots all 3 <--  -_-  of them need a lot of work there simly cheap looking crap they look nothing like the Vegas quality of flashy fun and the art on them is browser flash game quality at it's worst. The casino it's self isn't my style for a casino but it does the job, I would add the ablity to pick a theme for the casino set by the player like how a skin mod on L4D2 works only the player who picked it sees it that way you could theme more to your style. The clothing shops are lacking and the RP points are kinda silly sense a cash shop feature is in one of the most lacking shops already they should have it where you spend real money on the clothing outside of the free stuff you win of course. Overall i'd say that for a free game it's not bad but needs a lot of work to be anything worth remembering. Sense this game is theonly one of it's kind on steam let alone online that i personaly know about i'd say it's a 6 out of 10 good to unwind but nothing to be impressed with long term.","February 6","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With vibration toggle mode.\n\nAbout the game.\n\nYou play with a 3D Character which you are able to customize. You can even unlock new clothes and tools.\nYou can change Gender/Clothes/effects at any time you wish.\nThe game can only be played in online mode.\nYou are able to level up in activities. For whatever reason it is.\nYou are able to compete other players in some gambling modes.\nYou are able to add "Timestamp" in the chat window.\nYou can use emotes.\nThere are alot of different Gambling modes in the game.\n\nCasino slot machines\nBingo (My favourite)\nBlackjack\nPoker\nRoulette\nWar\n\nAnd some other activities.\nHowever sometimes it feels that the game is a little too unfair and makes you lose many or multiple times.\nOn the other hand, Casino's never were fair even in real life.\n\nEvery 15 minutes you will get 250 chips for free, however these will not stack (which means you have to collect them).\nYou will also NOT receive the free chips if you are offline. You will only get them if you are online in the game.\n\nYou are able to complete tasks to get some more Chips or even clothes.  There are daily and weekly tasks.\n\n\nOther things.\n\nThere are leaderboards for certain Casino games.\nThere are alot of immature people or people that are offensive and swearing.\nAlot of people do not want to sit next or close to someone else. They prefer to sit in the middle, or having 1 sit next to them empty or they sit entirely alone.\nThe game is sort of addictive, Not because it's a "Gambling" Game. But more it's easy to play and easy pick and leave game. Time goes fast too.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 6/10","February 20","true","17.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(I also like to gamble with black jack, but poker is why I keep coming back to this game).\n\nThe avatar simulation, in-game chat and community is also very nice and adds to the realism of it all.

That being said, they WILL reimburse any chips that you lost to bugs if you send in a ticket, contrary to what many other reviews have claimed.\n\nBut aside from the bugs, the game is really quite solid. Most of the time all the games and machines work perfectly fine, and the variety is good. They also run tournaments periodically for when you're feeling a bit more competitive.\n\nSo what's the bad then? Since the game is free, they'll try to coax you into buying chips with real money. Now, you're never forced into a situation where buying chips is the only way to continue playing, but if you go broke often it will definitely test your patience. In order to get free chips, you can do both daily and weekly tasks that reward you with chips. After that, you get one Super Slot spin per day. And if you're really desperate, you can collect free chips from an ATM every 15 minutes.\n\nBut beyond that the game is reasonably generous. When you win chips, you also slowly build up premium currency. You can win your way into the VIP lounge by playing enough, and many of the cosmetics can be attained by earning achievments.\n\nThe social elements of the game feel somewhat forced but that's true of most MMO-styled games.\n\nOverall, if you like casino games, you can't go wrong giving this a try.","July 31, 2015","true","23.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I think it deserves higher then a mixed review by far. The game has had some issues with bugs like bingo games freezing and black jack not working, but the devs seem like they are working very hard to fix these issues as fast as possible. And I should also mention that both times i had chips stolen from me from a game bug, I REPORTED the bug and GOT my chips back...so quit whining about losing chips to bugs if your not gonna report it. They have bug and optimizing updates what seems like almost everyday, which only has been improving the experience overall.  The community so far has also been mostly positive while playing. I have only encountered a few jerks so far but most people are on to have fun with everyone. As far as people saying you have to buy chips to get anywhere, they clearly havnt put the time into learning how the games work. Once you learn how machines and tables play with rules and mechanics, it is super easy to make money. I give this game so far a 9/10 if you like casino like games and hanging with people.

I understand that there can be some compatibility issues within the game, and a list of bugs (especially when it's in early access) but honestly, the whole atmosphere/environment in this game is great.\n\nObviously, if you're not into games a casino would feature (like poker, blackjack, 6wheel, slots etc) then you'll probably not like this game. But with the features included in this game, such as the limited freeroam offered within a virtual-type casino is quite unique and it gives some quality to the game. This game reminds me of the good old playstation home, it's really nice. I've already invited a handful of friends to play the game with me and they've also enjoyed it. So far, the players within the community are all quite mature and are really enjoying the game.\n\nAlthough I would like to see if there is some kind of forum or website where you can hand out some suggestions or help in regards to playing the game. If by any chance, someone does have a link, I would appreciate if someone would send me the link.\n\nAnyways, great game guys, I recommend it!","June 19, 2015","true","13.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I can't figure this out. I'll Have to go back with a system I guess and try again. Overall the game is a blast and it is cool to walk up to a chick and ask her to dance. Most of the time they don't know how to react. Just don't harrass them, please.\nMachine play is pretty normal give and take, I still have not hit a straight!  Good fun and you can spend a few bucks without breaking the bank. Lots of table games that are fun. If you can coerce an invite to the Vip club it gives you a 24 hour pass. That brings with it a Baccarat game and some serious minimums on the other table games. High rollers only (or you can just hang out and see how the other half lives) lol!\nHave a little fun, don't get your undies in a bunch. It's just clean fun.\nHope Digital continues to improve the solid product that they have.\nP.S. If you bingo, a must have is the $4.95 Auto Marker. You can kick back and watch the numbers come in all marked for you. On the longer games you can wander off, have a smoke, vacuum the living room, etc. come back and presto... all of your cards are marked! Way cool. And I'm not a shill for the Devs. Just tryin' to help! Please don't think I'm trying to sell ♥♥♥♥. You get the marker you'll love it\nPPS I hit a straight tonite! celebration time.\nPPPS I won on bingo 50000 last nite and 26000 today. Am I on fire or what?","August 20, 2015","true","230.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

(for reference I can run Planetside 2 at 35FPS with this rig.)  That is beside the point though.  There is a game here, where you can go almost anywhere you'd go in a normal casino, and you get 250 free chips every 15 minutes.  The theory is solid, but the execution is inevitably boring.\n\nWalking around with 400,000 chips from my slot jackpot, I found that there was absolutely no way to splurge my money.  I played literally every game in the casino 20 or so times and still couldn't throw away my money.  That's not a bad thing, but normally in my situation, a player would be having major fun.  I think it's the fact that there is NOTHING to spend chips on aside from the crappy games that take forever to even get going.  Once I got into the VIP area, I figured all of this would be different... but the VIP area is just the same as the non-VIP area with 2 different games and the same level of boredom.  I would say the rating system kept me going, but there was no actual pride to be had with it... yeah I'm tier 12 at poker.. what do I get?  Nothing.  Tier 25?  Nothing.  Lets not delude the fact that even if there were a prize, there would be nothing to do with it\n\nIn summary, the game is a borefest with a casino skin.  If you like sitting around pretending to play poker and blackjack, then this game might be for you.  But if you are a normal human being who enjoys mental stimulation... Steer clear of this waste of time.","June 11, 2015","false","11.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I mainly got this game due to searching for casino based game on steam to feel a gap from test drive unlimited 2's casino (which I played on console) and I am not disappointed.

I haven't tested every single title, but after spending a chunk of time on several, I can say the following:\n\nPros:\nA good set of titles that all function well; poker is of course only as good as the players you get, but all the basic functionality and pomp is here, combined with the daily tasks and tier increases that made PS Home attractive for folks like me.  It is, in essence, a wide array of gambling options with level ups and leveling bonuses.  That's kind of awesome.\n\nRegular influx of chips.  Playing for free long-term is entirely possible due to getting a decent chunk of chips for free from a number of resources (daily super slots, daily/weekly tasks for more chips, 250 chips every 15 minutes in game), which keeps the title from feeling locked off to any reasonable extent.\n\nLooks great.  Not Skyrim-with-a-million-graphics-mods great, but there's obviously been a lot of work to make the Four Kings look interesting, like the kind of place you could go for a vacation.\n\nCons\nLack of counter of autoplay.  This is a minor quibble but it does frustrate.  I like to play the machine game 'Instant Keno', and it's a bit annoying that when I select the autoplay option that until it gets to the final play, I have no visual indicator how many runs I have left.\n\nWasted space.  I love the nightclub and the apartment!  They look great, and again bring me back to what I liked about Playstation Home.  Except, they have no purpose at present.  The nightclub has the same music as the rest of the game.  The DJ booth, the bars, all have no interactivity.  The apartment is arguably worse, in that while it looks lovely, there's no way to interact with anything in this allegedly personal space, not even the televisions that look for all the world like they SHOULD be interactive.  I don't want these spaces excized, mind you; it helps to separate the title from generic casino titles in a similar vein, but all of the above needs SOME measure of interaction.  Mini-games, additional places to spend chips/RP/etc, looping videos, new music, I don't care what.  But for it to be lacking all of that makes it little more than window dressing.\n\nLimited spending options.  At present, chips let you play games, winning gives you RP, which can be used to buy a SMALL handful of avatar items, and if you earn X amount in a single month, you get VIP access for a month.  And... that's it.  Can't upgrade your apartment, avatar options are super limited, no special entertainment options for expending RP, etc, etc.  I hope this changes, as there's a lot of room here for enhancement of the overall experience beyond the casino games (which, again, work great and are decently diverse).\n\n\nOverall, the game is a recommend.  Yes, it has flaws, and I hope to see the title expand a LOT.  But what is there right now is a complete gambling title with solid gameplay in a good environment with countless options for snagging more chips for free and getting your fix on for the day.  And for an entry price of free, it's hard not to say give it a shot.","June 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

I haven't tested every single title, but after spending a chunk of time on several, I can say the following:\n\nPros:\nA good set of titles that all function well; poker is of course only as good as the players you get, but all the basic functionality and pomp is here, combined with the daily tasks and tier increases that made PS Home attractive for folks like me.  It is, in essence, a wide array of gambling options with level ups and leveling bonuses.  That's kind of awesome.\n\nRegular influx of chips.  Playing for free long-term is entirely possible due to getting a decent chunk of chips for free from a number of resources (daily super slots, daily/weekly tasks for more chips, 250 chips every 15 minutes in game), which keeps the title from feeling locked off to any reasonable extent.\n\nLooks great.  Not Skyrim-with-a-million-graphics-mods great, but there's obviously been a lot of work to make the Four Kings look interesting, like the kind of place you could go for a vacation.\n\nCons\nLack of counter of autoplay.  This is a minor quibble but it does frustrate.  I like to play the machine game 'Instant Keno', and it's a bit annoying that when I select the autoplay option that until it gets to the final play, I have no visual indicator how many runs I have left.\n\nWasted space.  I love the nightclub and the apartment!  They look great, and again bring me back to what I liked about Playstation Home.  Except, they have no purpose at present.  The nightclub has the same music as the rest of the game.  The DJ booth, the bars, all have no interactivity.  The apartment is arguably worse, in that while it looks lovely, there's no way to interact with anything in this allegedly personal space, not even the televisions that look for all the world like they SHOULD be interactive.  I don't want these spaces excized, mind you; it helps to separate the title from generic casino titles in a similar vein, but all of the above needs SOME measure of interaction.  Mini-games, additional places to spend chips/RP/etc, looping videos, new music, I don't care what.  But for it to be lacking all of that makes it little more than window dressing.\n\nLimited spending options.  At present, chips let you play games, winning gives you RP, which can be used to buy a SMALL handful of avatar items, and if you earn X amount in a single month, you get VIP access for a month.  And... that's it.  Can't upgrade your apartment, avatar options are super limited, no special entertainment options for expending RP, etc, etc.  I hope this changes, as there's a lot of room here for enhancement of the overall experience beyond the casino games (which, again, work great and are decently diverse).\n\n\nOverall, the game is a recommend.  Yes, it has flaws, and I hope to see the title expand a LOT.  But what is there right now is a complete gambling title with solid gameplay in a good environment with countless options for snagging more chips for free and getting your fix on for the day.  And for an entry price of free, it's hard not to say give it a shot.","June 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

This game also has some cool clothing options. There should be more options for players when no other players are available. No one like to sit at an empty table for 20 mins waiting for people to join. Some of the payouts don't seem to be distributed correctly, especially the Slots. I do like the daily tasks, it gives you something fun to do while you enjoy the games. Overall, the game looks good, has some great giveaways and freebies, seems to be a great social mechanism, but t he game play for each individual game needs some work.

Chips are WAY overpriced, there's only two poker tables total (!!!), the poker blinds go up super fast, rampant bugs, people losing chips they paid real money for (the devs are doing refunds but still- it shouldn't happen at all).\n\nThe devs need to switch away from their income coming from chip sales, and more towards the cosmetics or something. The payment model as it is is NOT going to work. There is a solid game here, but it needs changes. Play some for free if you want, but I wouldn't suggest investing at this point. Changing my review to a 'no'. Sorry devs, but it's a mess right now.\n\nEverything below is only left for posterity, you can ignore it as it is completely outdated info\n\n_______________________\n\n\nedit 5/12/2015: Apparently the game has gone free now, just a few days after I purchased it. Bad timing on my part aside: The game now has a decent population going, and there's definitely no reason to not recommend picking it up, since it's free!\n\nVery solid game- the only real complaint I have is that poker blinds go up waaay too fast, but the devs have said they're looking into it.\n_______________________________\n\nSince it is simply "YES" or "NO", I'm going "YES" here. But that's not really how I feel about it.\n\nThere is a great, functional core here. But the game is empty. Very empty. In two hours I've seen a total of 5 other players, all but one of them were just at a slot machine and unresponsive to greetings. At some point, once there's some sort of population, I think this will be a great game. Right now I don't really see a reason to reccommend buying it.","May 4, 2015","false","4.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Reminds me a bit of the long since cancelled This is Vegas but multiplayer. In this state, there is a lot of variety in the different types of casino games, even if they suffer from the major population issue mentioned below. But at least it isn't just limited to a few of them. Best part is that you don't have multiple spam messages all along your Facebook wall from your parents trying to get chips from you.\n\nGame runs fine on my machine at least and save for one period where I had issues loading the character customizer, everything is fine on a technical standpoint.\n\nThe only thing holding the game back is its lack of players, which due to the social nature of the game seriously harms the game even in this Early Access state. Hopefully once it launches people will give it a look. Maybe if Digital Leisure adds crafting and zombies, people will play it. :)\n\nSome suggestions to the developer for release and beyond:\nFigure out some reason for people to use the nightclub, whether its a drink-serving minigame to earn chips or something else worthwile. Seems useless at this point in time. Same with the Hotel Room. I'd love a GTA style TV where you watch pre-made shows but that's way too expensive for this kind of indie development studio.

Might be better with consistent players, but probably not much.  All the games are very generic, without any of the themes or personality that make casinos fun.\n\nThe poker room is pretty disappointing, and I don't see any sign in the early access notes of there being plans for any sort of major overhaul here. It's not at all like an actual casino poker room, and seems like it's been designed by someone who doesn't know much about poker. There is no cash games, only sit-and-go style tournaments with extremely fast blind levels that tend to turn the game into an all-in festival within minutes. There is no variety in games. The tables don't even have enough seats for a typical casino poker game. The poker setup seems geared toward getting games over with as quickly as possible.","May 3, 2015","false","7.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

I'm actually kind of glad I did lose all of my chips since I was able to find out how terrible the game is when you're out of chips. Even with VIP status, which doubles all of the free chips that I can earn, I just can't earn chips anymore from playing games. This was my experience when I had a lot of good luck early on in the game, imagine what it would be like to constantly lose with the chips that you begin the game with and run out not even an hour into playing. I might have even considered spending some money on a cosmetic or two, but there is no way I'd do that when the game can become boring in an instant. It doesn't help when the daily free slots has bugged out on me and not giving me any chips, even when I match three in a row. This is also the first free game that I have tried where you can't even PLAY it without having chips, unless you just want to play free poker 24/7. That would be like playing a free shooter game where it limits how many matches you can play, and losing matches decreases the amount of times you can play, until finally you are forced to buy more matches.\n\nI would change it so the free chips that you earn over time gives you a small amount even if you aren't online, even 10% of their normal value would be enough to help people off the floor. This could even earn you too many over a long period, so a chip cap should also be in place.","July 7, 2015","false","39.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Another big thing is the constant glitches and bugs riddled throughout the game that can make it obnoxious to play at times and even cause to lose chips. You can play this game for free, but the amount of chips they supply you with are minimal and very easy to lose so most likely this will be a pay to play game for you. The four points I gave it is simply because it is a casino and who doesn't love gambling.\ngraphics gets a 7/10... I did enjoy the graphics although there are many bugs with the emotes and things seem to be pretty cartoony (hey what do you expect) it's not very realistic but it gets the job done.\ncustomer service gets a 9/10... they are quick to refund lost chips due to their glitches and provide needed help, but one night I had a huge error in the game and they simply ignored my direct messages on facebook to their company (their page isn't even busy) which simply cannot allow me to give them a 10/10.\n\nThis game is very addicting but can also be a money sink which is bad because in reality their prices for chips are absolutely horrible and if you aren't careful about your bets you could blow through $20 in a few days. In the end i decided the game was pointless and just decided to go all in on one number on roulette (75 spins) 10k bet and it didn't hit my number a single time (WHAT ARE THE ODDS??). So I would say check this game out it's pretty fun for a while but whatever you do don't put money into this rigged game as you will never win.\n","February 5","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I requested refund once and I think you re not realize about the game\n1) Its not on "My Library" so i cant play it even if I want( fact i dont want to)\n2) Game Introducing and gameplay are so diffrent\n3) There is no one to play with Even you cant play a game like bingo etc..\n4) When Bugs came to destroy your humanity like turning screen, cant move etc.. you are not playin it you re just try to fix it\n5) I was hoped updates gonna make this game better. But I only saw my character turning on middle of casino\n6) If I cant get refund its okay you can take my money but I will gonna let people know what kind game it is\n\nNote to mates: If this problems arrived to you people DO NOT TRY TO FIX IT AFTER THE 2 HOURS OF PLAYTIME YOU'RE DESTROYIN YOUR REFUND CHANCE !!\n","July 27, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Chips are WAY overpriced, there's only two poker tables total (!!!), the poker blinds go up super fast, rampant bugs, people losing chips they paid real money for (the devs are doing refunds but still- it shouldn't happen at all).\n\nThe devs need to switch away from their income coming from chip sales, and more towards the cosmetics or something. The payment model as it is is NOT going to work. There is a solid game here, but it needs changes. Play some for free if you want, but I wouldn't suggest investing at this point. Changing my review to a 'no'. Sorry devs, but it's a mess right now.\n\nEverything below is only left for posterity, you can ignore it as it is completely outdated info\n\n_______________________\n\n\nedit 5/12/2015: Apparently the game has gone free now, just a few days after I purchased it. Bad timing on my part aside: The game now has a decent population going, and there's definitely no reason to not recommend picking it up, since it's free!\n\nVery solid game- the only real complaint I have is that poker blinds go up waaay too fast, but the devs have said they're looking into it.\n_______________________________\n\nSince it is simply "YES" or "NO", I'm going "YES" here. But that's not really how I feel about it.\n\nThere is a great, functional core here. But the game is empty. Very empty. In two hours I've seen a total of 5 other players, all but one of them were just at a slot machine and unresponsive to greetings. At some point, once there's some sort of population, I think this will be a great game. Right now I don't really see a reason to reccommend buying it.","May 4, 2015","false","4.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Another big thing is the constant glitches and bugs riddled throughout the game that can make it obnoxious to play at times and even cause to lose chips. You can play this game for free, but the amount of chips they supply you with are minimal and very easy to lose so most likely this will be a pay to play game for you. The four points I gave it is simply because it is a casino and who doesn't love gambling.\ngraphics gets a 7/10... I did enjoy the graphics although there are many bugs with the emotes and things seem to be pretty cartoony (hey what do you expect) it's not very realistic but it gets the job done.\ncustomer service gets a 9/10... they are quick to refund lost chips due to their glitches and provide needed help, but one night I had a huge error in the game and they simply ignored my direct messages on facebook to their company (their page isn't even busy) which simply cannot allow me to give them a 10/10.\n\nThis game is very addicting but can also be a money sink which is bad because in reality their prices for chips are absolutely horrible and if you aren't careful about your bets you could blow through $20 in a few days. In the end i decided the game was pointless and just decided to go all in on one number on roulette (75 spins) 10k bet and it didn't hit my number a single time (WHAT ARE THE ODDS??). So I would say check this game out it's pretty fun for a while but whatever you do don't put money into this rigged game as you will never win.\n","February 5","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Digital Leisure opted to turn their Paradise Springs Casino area into a stand alone game. So they rebuilt it and renamed it The Four Kings Casino and Slots. As an attempt to lure Home users to it they decided to try and emulate Home. Sadly though they decided to emulate Home as it was near the end of its life. So the game is a bit shoddy, users suggestions are ignored most of the time, and they're more interested pushing cash store vanity items that have sod all to do with a casino (like pets and doofy avatar zoning in and out animations).\n\nLike Playstaion Home was, this game is something that could be fun but is ruined by the cheap cash grab mentality of the Devs.\n\nCannot recommend.","October 14, 2015","false","69.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'd like to give an honest and unbiased review, which can be taken at face value.\n\nThe concept of this game is brilliant and it is the only game of its kind I have ever seen. It is full of potential and could have been one of the greatest free to play games of the decade. It offers an immersive casino experience, with many of the most common casino games. On the other hand, there are many reasons that this game fails to fulfill that potential.\n\nPrimarily the poker is a joke. The only game available is single table 6 player hyper turbo short stack tournaments. They can be fun in the short term, if the cards fall your way, but it completely negates any element of skill. You start with 50k and a 1k big blind. After 10 minutes, the blinds are 8k. Even in a tight game with good playets, you're at the stage where it's all in or fold after about 20 mins. Some people obviously like this pure gambling format, but to me, the point of poker is that skill can overcome chance in the long run. With this format though, you're forced into ridiculous all-ins with hands like K8 vs Q6 all pre-flop.\n\nThe devs have categorically refused to change this format over the last 4 months and have indicated that they have no plans to improve this joke format.\n\nThey have 3 slot machines. The 888 slots (the original) is quite slow and boring, with the only bonus being free spins, which still don't pay very much. They introduced a second machine, Spinning Cogs, which has a bonus round but still bores you to death and very rarely pays out. The 3rd slot machine 'Big Top' has a decent concept with a bonus round but still pays peanuts. Even a perfect bonus round only pays 90k for a 3k bet. The main money is to be made by hitting the wild symbols, which usually come up in the 3rd to 5th reel, therefore paying nothing. Even 4 wilds in the first 4 reels only pays around 100k.\n\nBlack Jack is available, but you have to play perfect strategy and even then you're lucky to break even. This may be the closest to real casino play that this shambles of a virtual casino offers.\n\nRoulette is on offer too. If you play roulette you have to expect to lose in the long run. Big 6 wheel is an option but it is slow and boring and not a good way to make money. It runs smoothly at least in my experience.\n\nBingo games run with up to 40 players, but it is agonisingly slow, even with the auto dauber (which costs as much as a few beers). You endure multiple false calls and a juvenile chat crowd with no moderation. Racism and sexism go unpunished, unless you can be bothered to find the offender and run up to them, wait for them to stand still, open your menu and report them.\n\nWar, which may as well be a heads or tails coin toss is another option.\n\nVIP status offers Baccarat along with the chance to lose even more at all the other games.\n\nThe developers are happy to accept multiple accounts from the same IP, same person even, as long as you don't play poker together.\n\nThere are a number of hacks available, including one which allows the cheater to view all players' poker cards. The devs seem unable to counter these hacks.\n\nIf you want a game where you can log on for 10 minutes a day and gamble a bit, you might love this. If you want a community that  enjoys gambling and takes an interest in odds, poker and improving their all around skills, this is not the game for you. The devs would rather spend time designing pets than fix bugs or increase the gambling options available to the loyal players. Poker players are especially neglected in this pay to win game.\n\nDownload this if you want to be a guinea-pig for the console version that the devs admit is their priority.","September 17, 2015","false","723.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It must have been, I have just over 500 hours in it. I met a lot of good people here, enjoyed playing poker and slots the most. Now I have at least four times more people on my block list than friends list. As I write this I am in the VIP room on Saturday night and none else is here, at all. The game used to have a reason to want to level up in VIP ranking, to get more free chips. VIP 3 received 1000 chips every 15 minutes, now the devs took that away and everyone gets 250. I see no reason to want to keep playing to level up for no apparent reason after all the time I spent reaching nobility.\n\n\nThis is my opinion, but it also seems that payoffs have been drastically reduced. My wife and everyone I talked to in the game believe the same. All I know is I I used to have almost a million chips, now I have les than 10 K, and not from extreme bets. The devs seem to be doing everything possible to get people to spend money in the game. That is understandable as the game is free, at least on pc. With no incentive to want to increase level, less and less friends in the game and less chance of winning in games, I see no reason to stay in the game, much less spend money in it.\n\nAs I said, this was an enjoyable way to spend time, now I'm bored of it and noone staying in it. btw, there is nothing in clothing or pets I want to buy either. So now I have decided to uninstall a game I used to enjoy a lot. Make up your own mind about the game, but I think the devs destroyed it in a money grab.\n\nOh, did I mention the glitches, which are getting worse and not better? Nothing is as frustrating as being in a poker or even bingo game and getting booted out of it in the middle. The devs are good at refunding chips when it happens, but the idea of gambling in a casino is the chance to win money, not get your money back. You can wait 10 or more minutes for a bingo game to actually start, instead of the usual 2, if too many people didnt walk out of the game by then, leaving less than the required 3 to play. Or when you are about to win the table in poker and suddenly find yourself standing outside the table and your chips are gone, as well as your chance of winning.\n\nThere are just too many reasons for me to not want to play the game anymore and not nearly enough reasons for me to want to stay in it.","October 25, 2015","false","617.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Chips are WAY overpriced, there's only two poker tables total (!!!), the poker blinds go up super fast, rampant bugs, people losing chips they paid real money for (the devs are doing refunds but still- it shouldn't happen at all).\n\nThe devs need to switch away from their income coming from chip sales, and more towards the cosmetics or something. The payment model as it is is NOT going to work. There is a solid game here, but it needs changes. Play some for free if you want, but I wouldn't suggest investing at this point. Changing my review to a 'no'. Sorry devs, but it's a mess right now.\n\nEverything below is only left for posterity, you can ignore it as it is completely outdated info\n\n_______________________\n\n\nedit 5/12/2015: Apparently the game has gone free now, just a few days after I purchased it. Bad timing on my part aside: The game now has a decent population going, and there's definitely no reason to not recommend picking it up, since it's free!\n\nVery solid game- the only real complaint I have is that poker blinds go up waaay too fast, but the devs have said they're looking into it.\n_______________________________\n\nSince it is simply "YES" or "NO", I'm going "YES" here. But that's not really how I feel about it.\n\nThere is a great, functional core here. But the game is empty. Very empty. In two hours I've seen a total of 5 other players, all but one of them were just at a slot machine and unresponsive to greetings. At some point, once there's some sort of population, I think this will be a great game. Right now I don't really see a reason to reccommend buying it.","May 4, 2015","false","4.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I'd like to give an honest and unbiased review, which can be taken at face value.\n\nThe concept of this game is brilliant and it is the only game of its kind I have ever seen. It is full of potential and could have been one of the greatest free to play games of the decade. It offers an immersive casino experience, with many of the most common casino games. On the other hand, there are many reasons that this game fails to fulfill that potential.\n\nPrimarily the poker is a joke. The only game available is single table 6 player hyper turbo short stack tournaments. They can be fun in the short term, if the cards fall your way, but it completely negates any element of skill. You start with 50k and a 1k big blind. After 10 minutes, the blinds are 8k. Even in a tight game with good playets, you're at the stage where it's all in or fold after about 20 mins. Some people obviously like this pure gambling format, but to me, the point of poker is that skill can overcome chance in the long run. With this format though, you're forced into ridiculous all-ins with hands like K8 vs Q6 all pre-flop.\n\nThe devs have categorically refused to change this format over the last 4 months and have indicated that they have no plans to improve this joke format.\n\nThey have 3 slot machines. The 888 slots (the original) is quite slow and boring, with the only bonus being free spins, which still don't pay very much. They introduced a second machine, Spinning Cogs, which has a bonus round but still bores you to death and very rarely pays out. The 3rd slot machine 'Big Top' has a decent concept with a bonus round but still pays peanuts. Even a perfect bonus round only pays 90k for a 3k bet. The main money is to be made by hitting the wild symbols, which usually come up in the 3rd to 5th reel, therefore paying nothing. Even 4 wilds in the first 4 reels only pays around 100k.\n\nBlack Jack is available, but you have to play perfect strategy and even then you're lucky to break even. This may be the closest to real casino play that this shambles of a virtual casino offers.\n\nRoulette is on offer too. If you play roulette you have to expect to lose in the long run. Big 6 wheel is an option but it is slow and boring and not a good way to make money. It runs smoothly at least in my experience.\n\nBingo games run with up to 40 players, but it is agonisingly slow, even with the auto dauber (which costs as much as a few beers). You endure multiple false calls and a juvenile chat crowd with no moderation. Racism and sexism go unpunished, unless you can be bothered to find the offender and run up to them, wait for them to stand still, open your menu and report them.\n\nWar, which may as well be a heads or tails coin toss is another option.\n\nVIP status offers Baccarat along with the chance to lose even more at all the other games.\n\nThe developers are happy to accept multiple accounts from the same IP, same person even, as long as you don't play poker together.\n\nThere are a number of hacks available, including one which allows the cheater to view all players' poker cards. The devs seem unable to counter these hacks.\n\nIf you want a game where you can log on for 10 minutes a day and gamble a bit, you might love this. If you want a community that  enjoys gambling and takes an interest in odds, poker and improving their all around skills, this is not the game for you. The devs would rather spend time designing pets than fix bugs or increase the gambling options available to the loyal players. Poker players are especially neglected in this pay to win game.\n\nDownload this if you want to be a guinea-pig for the console version that the devs admit is their priority.","September 17, 2015","false","723.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It must have been, I have just over 500 hours in it. I met a lot of good people here, enjoyed playing poker and slots the most. Now I have at least four times more people on my block list than friends list. As I write this I am in the VIP room on Saturday night and none else is here, at all. The game used to have a reason to want to level up in VIP ranking, to get more free chips. VIP 3 received 1000 chips every 15 minutes, now the devs took that away and everyone gets 250. I see no reason to want to keep playing to level up for no apparent reason after all the time I spent reaching nobility.\n\n\nThis is my opinion, but it also seems that payoffs have been drastically reduced. My wife and everyone I talked to in the game believe the same. All I know is I I used to have almost a million chips, now I have les than 10 K, and not from extreme bets. The devs seem to be doing everything possible to get people to spend money in the game. That is understandable as the game is free, at least on pc. With no incentive to want to increase level, less and less friends in the game and less chance of winning in games, I see no reason to stay in the game, much less spend money in it.\n\nAs I said, this was an enjoyable way to spend time, now I'm bored of it and noone staying in it. btw, there is nothing in clothing or pets I want to buy either. So now I have decided to uninstall a game I used to enjoy a lot. Make up your own mind about the game, but I think the devs destroyed it in a money grab.\n\nOh, did I mention the glitches, which are getting worse and not better? Nothing is as frustrating as being in a poker or even bingo game and getting booted out of it in the middle. The devs are good at refunding chips when it happens, but the idea of gambling in a casino is the chance to win money, not get your money back. You can wait 10 or more minutes for a bingo game to actually start, instead of the usual 2, if too many people didnt walk out of the game by then, leaving less than the required 3 to play. Or when you are about to win the table in poker and suddenly find yourself standing outside the table and your chips are gone, as well as your chance of winning.\n\nThere are just too many reasons for me to not want to play the game anymore and not nearly enough reasons for me to want to stay in it.","October 25, 2015","false","617.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

As an attempt to lure Home users to it they decided to try and emulate Home. Sadly though they decided to emulate Home as it was near the end of its life. So the game is a bit shoddy, users suggestions are ignored most of the time, and they're more interested pushing cash store vanity items that have sod all to do with a casino (like pets and doofy avatar zoning in and out animations).\n\nLike Playstaion Home was, this game is something that could be fun but is ruined by the cheap cash grab mentality of the Devs.\n\nCannot recommend.","October 14, 2015","false","69.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I know it sounds like I'm just being idiotic, but I started testing a few things in the game.  First, when playing slots you almost never hit bonuses. Once in 200 spins or so seems to be the average.  If you've ever been to a real casino, you know bonuses are a lot more common.  In fact the payout on the slot machines is ridiculous.  You can expect to lose 75% of the money you put into the slot machine over about 10 spins.  Slots are money losers, I know, but 75% over 10 spins, nine out of ten times? Come on.  Yes you can go on win streaks, but its as though when the game feels you have built up enough using a Martingale system (doubling your bet after you lose), it will make sure you keep losing.  You can go up to max bet and lose, which is normal using that system.  But to continue losing 10 more bets after that?\n\nNot convinced?  Blackjack.  I counted the number of cards between yellow cards.  Instead of the standard 6 decks.. there is 4.5.. not 4, not 5.. but 4.5.  So which cards are extra and who gets which? Go ahead, try it.  You can bet 15 times in a row using basic blackjack strat and not win a single round.  Meanwhile the dealer will pull 14, or 16.. and they will get just enough to beat you.\n\nWhy?  Well, the problem is the whole pay-to-play structure.  While it would take a lengthy amount of time to lose your chips making minimum bets, you will never make VIP.  VIP allows you to play Baccarat (not available on the normal floor), as well as play higher stakes games, and a few other perks. You earn VIP status through earning Reward Points.  You earn Reward Points for winning bets.  The higher the bet, the more reward points you are eligible for.  It takes a lot of grinding.  So couple the fact with you need to win big bets (or play long nonsensical hours (probably 8 hours a day for minimum bets)) with the fact that the game in tilted more in the odds of the casino than a normal casino.. you come to the realization that if you enjoy playing the games enough you need to purchase chips.\n\nI don't mind paying the developer for the game, I understand a developer deserves to get paid for their product.  But atleast make it fair.  If I spend money I want atleast a chance to win.  Either make us pay for the product, or find another way to make revenue.. because it sucks supporting a game by buying more chips, just to lose them on their broken system.

I would almost just call it a gambling sim but with the fact that you have a customizable character, a ranking system, and a decent social atmosphere makes this game more like a trip to a Casino IRL (without the akwardness of real life strangers haha) I reccomend this game for anyone who is into gambling/social games. I would like to point out that you start off with more than enough chips in the begining and their are alot of ways to earn free chips and if you're smart with your gambling you should b able to maintain a decent amount of chips until you win big (which will happen) I recommend The Four Kings Casino and Slots. *7.5/10","June 30, 2015","true","13.9"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","17","34","0","0"

It's a third person online casino where you can make friends, customize your character and  play casino games like slots, blackjack, and poker. It has a chips system and everything for you to be immersed into the game and feel as if it's a real casino. Let's get right down to the aspects of the game and how they work really well with it.\n~\nPros:\n-Great Graphics\n-Alot of Casino Games to Chose From\n-Multiplayer\n-Nice Community\n\nCons:\n-Buggy\n-Insane FPS Drops (Occasionally)\n-Unfair Dealers (More Below)\n~\nClearing up the Microtransactions:\nYou might automatically turn this game down because you've heard about microtransactions. Whatever you do, don't do that thing that I just said. You CAN but are not FORCED to buy chips with real money. It is COMPLETELY OPTIONAL and you can get chips from playing the games, waiting 15 minutes for your free 200 chips, getting your daily chips, doing your daily or weekly tasks. I just listed off 4 ways you can get chips do you realise how UNNESSASARY buying chips is. If you complain abut the buying of chips just stop it.\n~\nUnfair Dealers:\nI've heard many people talk about the unfair dealers and I too have experienced it. In Blackjack when you're playing the dealer will seem very unfair at times. Lets say me and the dealer are against each other and I get a 12 and I hit, I'll automatically get a 22. Lets do this again, I get a 4 the dealer has a 17, I hit and get 7 he hits and gets 21. Where's the equality? This happens alot of times and I lost 2,000 chips to this happening many times in a row. It seems as if when you play with more people the dealer becomes more fair though.\n~\nGames:\n-Many different types of slots\n-Bingo\n-Blackjack\n-Poker\n-Video Blackjack\n-Jacks or Better\n-Keno\n\nOverall this game has some great potential and I'm glad that this is a thing.

It is going to get a 3 out of 10.\n\nThe games themselves feel good, when they are working. It is like visiting a casino, playing games, winning money, losing money. It seems random enough that it feels like going on good or bad luck streaks, and sometimes you make a ton, and sometimes you lose a ton.\n\nThe framerate is still crap, there are times that my framerate locks to 0 FPS when the server has alot of people on it. Some of the games are buggy, just had an issue where it was as if the dealer had passed out on the table because I sat for almost 10 minutes after putting my bet in before it gave me my cards. Currently there is a bug on the roulette tables that I have reported and it should be being investigated. It honestly feels like this game should still be in early access. If it was in early access I could excuse the bugs and the framerate, and it would potentially have a 8 or 9 out of 10, but with this being it's "final release," (yes, I know they will and are updating it with content and bug fixes) it is rather inexcusable to have this many bugs.\n\nHonestly if these devs would get their ♥♥♥♥ together and crack down on the optimization and bugs, this would be a really good game. But until then, I stand by my 3 out of 10 rating.\n\nFinal Edit: These devs are not very bright. Instead of fixing the framerate issues, they have added pets, which makes the framerate even worse. The playerbase for this game is all but non existant at this point with a peak of 112 people playing at once in the last 24 hours. If the devs do not get their crap together they are going to be left with an empty shell of a game, at least on PC, I cannot speak for the future console users. Bottom line, this game is not worth the time to download. Maybe sometime in the near future we will see a new dev bring a new casino that actually works. Until then, I'm cutting my losses and cashing in my chips.","August 10, 2015","false","100.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I started playing the game on 4th or 5th of june and Steam says that the game ran for over 432 hours. I didn't actually play for all these hours, but i still played A LOT. I have played this game for about 25 days, which means that it ran for 17+ hours on average every day. With that amount of time you can safely say that i am a hardcore gamer and enjoyed it most of the time. I also recently became a volunteer as a translator for Digital Leisure, which is the company that created this game. For a long time i was not sure if i give this game a positive or a negative review, but after the Blackjack tournament that happened last weekend i finally made my decision, but more to this later.\n\nFour Kings Casino and Slots is a casino simulation. A virtual casino where you create an avatar and play popular casino games like Blackjack, Slots, Craps, Video Poker and others. In every game, except Poker, there is a house edge like in a real casino. So, if you like gambling and losing your chips most of the time then this game could get you somewhat addicted.\n\nThe game was fully released out of early access on june the 1st with many bugs, errors and easy ways for people to cheat. Especially within about the first 1-2 weeks the game was plagued by cheaters and bugs. They definitely released this game too early and after almost a month now it still feels like you are playing a beta/early access version. I still don't understand why they did that.\n\nIt is free to play, so how are they making their money? First there is a shop where you can buy cosmetic items like clothes for your avatar and then you can buy chips with real money.\n\nAs a new player you get 10k chips to play with, which sounds good at the beginning, but it is not a lot. You can lose them quickly if you are not careful enough. Especially for Poker players it can be painful, because the buy-in at a Poker table is 5k. So, if you lose two Poker games then you are already broke. There are some ways how you can get free chips and i will list them for you:\n-Every 15 minutes you can pick up 250 free chips at the chip station.\n-Once per day you can play at the free Poker table and only the winner can get 5k. There is only 1 free Poker table in the room, so you will have to wait and sometimes be fast, because there are many players waiting.\n-Every now and then there is also a free Bingo game and depending on the number of players you can win some chips. With the maximum of 40 players it is 10k if i remember correctly, but good luck winning one of these.\n-5 daily tasks where you get 200 chips for completing each one of them and an additional 600 if you complete them all. Most of them are very easy like using an emote, playing at the free Poker table or dancing in the nightclub.\n-5 weekly tasks. You get 2k for completing each one of them and right now i don't remember how much you can get when you complete them all. Some of them are ridiculous like earning 1000 RP at Keno or Slots. Don't even try if you don't have many chips.\n\nI mentioned RP and this is like a second currency in the game that allows you to buy items in the shops like clothes. You mostly earn RP by winning chips and if you earn enough within a month you can get vip status for a month, which gives you some benefits. You earn RP depending on how many chips you bet/win. There are leaderboards for every game and there is a global leaderboard that are based on the RP you earn. Players who buy chips for money have a big advantage to get to the top of the leaderboards - they are kind of pay to win since these players can max bet all the time and don't have to worry about losing the chips.\n\nThere were many errors and bugs. Some of them have been more or less fixed and some games have been improved, but there are still enough that it's annoying to some degree. If you run a casino then functionality is the most important thing. In Four Kings Casino and Slots you can lose chips to bugs and this is kind of ridiculous, because there are people who pay money for their chips. Tables can glitch and become unplayable, players get kicked off tables, game crashes, disconnects and people lose some chips when things like that happen. It also happened to me that one time i didn't receive the chips for completing the daily tasks. You can request chip refunds through the bug report system in the game and most of the time they will give you back your lost chips, but not always. It happened at least twice to me that i can definitely remember where they just didn't refund the chips that i lost although i made these bug reports. Again, especially painful for the players who spent money for their chips. Within the first 2 or 3 weeks the game often felt like a chip refund simulator and not a casino simulation. It is better now, but you can still lose chips to bugs, make a chip refund request through the bug report tool and not receive the chips that you lost. I would not recommend spending money in that game unless you really don't care. If you go to a real casino they don't just kick you off the table for no reason and keep your chips.\n\nSo, there was a Blackjack tournament last weekend and i saved up enough chips to play. First, Digital Leisure posted wrong information about the tournament on the Steam discussion board where they always post their information about the tournaments. For example, they wrote that the tournament would be split into segments of 2 hours each and there was also a overall leaderboard. In reality these segments were just 1 hour each. After 3 or 4 hours of the tournament running they restarted the server to make some fixes. Great timing, isn't it? Unfortunately and to my anger these "fixes" still didn't help to prevent some bugs happening. For example, if you played to the end of a 1 hour segment and let the extra time fully run out your score did not count, but if you stood up a few seconds earlier your score did count. They didn't tell us anything about that before.\nOn the second day of the tournament i had to experience it myself where i made a score that was enough for overall 3rd place, but it didn't count because the timer fully ran out. I had a pretty high score already at 3rd place, but this one was only good enough for place 5 at the end. It also happened to other players and we made a post about it on the discussion board. A Digital Leisure employee responded in that thread and said that we should make screenshots next time. Are you kidding me? It was not our fault, it was a fault on their side. He also said that the score of ALL players in this thread would be corrected and they did, but not with mine. There was a player who had a higher score than i previously had and he posted after me. He got his score corrected, but i didn't get my score corrected. When i mentioned that they forgot me he only said that it wouldn't affect MY payout and still didn't correct my score. What a joke since before that he posted that the payouts would also be corrected by the team. At the end i only ended up at rank 5 instead of rank 3 on the overall tournament leaderboard. Their game bug cost me 2 places and a better payout.\nOn the final day of the tournament i had 2 really, really good runs that had great potential to make the best score and reach rank 1 in the whole tournament. In one of these runs i had it for sure. My luck and my earnings were crazy this time. I was almost alone in a room sitting at an empty table to play as many hands as possible. I knew it. I saw my score, i saw the time that i had left and suddenly in the middle of these 2 runs the game disconnected me. Very strange that it exactly happened in these 2 runs. I knew what i was doing. I won about 10+ of 48 of the 1 hour tournament segments and made some 2nd and 3rd places. I barely slept this weekend, tried so hard and didn't make it to #1, because of game errors. Unbelievable and ridiculous.","June 29, 2015","false","990.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

Both of them result in loss of any bet you might have had at the time, regardless of the outcome of the game.

I sat down at a video blackjack and doubled my chips. Eventually though, the dealer would constantly get blackjack, and I was in the negative eventually. I've found it IMPOSSIBLE to win chips on games vs computers (aka blackjack, video poker, war). To get into a human v human game (poker), you need 5000 chips. Every 5 minutes, you get 250. You would have to wait over 3 hours to do it this way because its impossible to win chips without it. Honestly, I will most likely go on this every once in a while to see if I can build up to 5k to play poker.

Buggy, sometimes unplayable experiences that result in the loss of chips-in-play\n2. A considerable lack of variety in machine games\n3. The VIP room carrot-on-a-stick\n\nAllow me to shed some light on number three. There exists in the game a 'VIP' area unlocked for entry when you achieve a certain amount of 'RP' (your secondary form in-game currency used solely for purchasing aesthetic items).\n\nThe amount of points required to unlock the 'VIP' room is absurd, so naturally I was curious as to what lay behind the golden gates. Could it be higher betting caps for machine games? Different, perhaps better machine game backgrounds than the machines in the pleb lobby? I needed to know. Also I was pretty tired of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ castle slots characters.\n\nTook a month to get enough of the damned RP points only to walk in the 'VIP' room and be greeted with the same machines  with the same betting caps. Only difference was I could play Baccarat and a higher cap of Poker. Huge let down.\n\nOh, and everyone was wearing a horse helmet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hazereaper33/recommended/260430/","Hazereaper33","Haze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hazereaper33/","17 products in account","Alright, let me start my review by stating that I'm going to cover each game that is within the Casino by bracket.  I'm going to be starting with Jacks or Better Video Poker as it will lay the foundation as to why nobody should waste the ten minutes it takes to install this game.\n\nJacks or Better, Video Poker:\n\nFirst, if you get a Jack or better... It's not a push and you do not get your bet back.  Second, if you get a pair below Jack, you do not get credit for the pair.  Third and most importantly, it seems you only get a winning hand on average, once in every ten or so plays and usually that's just a pair or three of a kind.\n\nSlots:\n\nOkay, first of all the buy ins to play slots are insainly inflated.  You're talking 88-3,000 chips per spin.  When you play any of these brackets, the "big wins" or "jackpots" are squed.  I got a big win with a 3k buy in and the pot was 9,000 chips.  You would have to be insain to play slots in this game for an extended period of time.\n\nVideo Blackjack:\n\nThis is the only game that doesn't seem to be calibrated to destroy you.  The only game inside this casino I do not have  a poor review for... Yet..\n\nKeno:\n\nMy only complaint about this game is that it seems as though your win ratio turns from 1 out of every 9 plays to 1 out of every 3 whenever this game becomes the daily.\n\nBig Wheel 6:\n\nThis game seems to be working in the opposit fassion than it normally should.  Obviously, you should have a statistically higher chance of seeing a 1 or a 2 over any other number correct?  Yet, if you were to sit down and bet 5, 10, 20, J, and $ you would magically come out ahead almost every single time.  Isn't that curious?\n\nWar:\n\nWar is supposed to be a game that is literally 50% win ratio.  You're lucky to win 1 out of every 5 hands.  Unless of course, War happens to be the daily.  Then, you are magically coming out ahead always.  Outside of the daily, going to war is supposed to be a stistical 1/8 or so chance.  Yet, in this game.. I've averaged it with about 1/14 or so.  Isn't that curious?  What's crious is it seems to be almost exactly 1/7 when War is the daily. Huh??\n\nBaccarat:\n\nJust like war, a tie bet should be about 1 out of every 8 chances.  Yet, i've hand counted time and again that 90% of ties seem to occur between 12 and 16 times.  Maybe it's because they don't want someone who's rich enough to spam bet come out ahead?  Hmm?  Curious!\n\nBingo:\n\nIt seems you have a 25% chance every time you sit down for the table, your mouse, or something involved with the game in general to be buggy.  Outside of this, there seems to be all kinds of kinks and issues with the game that make it unplayable or slacking on a fun scale.  Lets not forget the insain buy ins to play a round of bingo however!  The progressive bingo games which have the biggest pots are 5 grand to buy in.  Most of the time, 20 people are playing.  You're going to lose that money.  Of course, the free buy ins only have about 3 grand for the pot.  True, you can argue that's because nobody is buying in.  But, can we expect the casino to fetch in some chips towards the pot? NOPE!!!\n\nRegular blackjack and single deck:\n\nBlackjack is one of those games that you should have the statistical advantage over the house simply because the dealer is forced against their will to hit until they reach 17 or higher or bust.  Yet, magically...  It is a mirricle to see the dealer bust in this game.  As a matter of fact, i've clocked blackjack busts to average for me one in every 12 hands.  Usually, some witchcraft occurs where the dealer will hit 7 times and get a perfect 21 more often than not.\n\nRoulette:\n\nFinally, we are now starting to talk about a Casino game I enjoy to play.  Why do I enjoy this?  Well, I believe myself to be keen with math and statistics.  I also enjoy the game in general and know many play styles.  However, the first thing to point out is that the dimonds on the table are backwords which automatically means more randomization for predictions.  Curious?  Then, there is what I like to call the conservative betting system.  You know?  The system where if you sat there 10 hours straight you'd come out ahead?  Bet on red, closest row, center row leaving you know? 4 blacks, 0-00, and the 8 reds minor loss?  I promise you if you did this system or its mirror, you will go bankrupt and FAST.  Isn't that curious?  Or when you happen to just spam the 50/50 bets and lose far more often than not.  Or you know, betting on seemingly anything and its seemingly elsewhere the ball finds itself no matter what you do?  You could say I'm a conspiricy therist with regards to roulette in this game but maybe some of my comments coming up will change your opinion.\n\nPoker:\n\nOh yes, Poker...  There are 52 cards in a deck and four of each card with a different suit.  Nobody will argue this.  What I will however argue, is how I manage to get Queen with an off suit 2 through 7 twice at the same table, every single table I've ever played since I've installed this game.  Curious how that keeps happening, huh?  It's almost statistically impossible.  Yet, it keeps happening.\n\nCraps:\n\nAh yes, save the best and favorite for last.  The game that the house doesn't have the advantage of.  This also just happens to be the one game that is the reason that I'm now out of chips entirely for the fourth time in a row.  Curious as to how it happened? So am I...  One of my favorite and also simplest bets to do is to simply min bet the come out roll like you should.  When it rolls and you are On, you simply bet three times the come out roll or more on the Don't come Bar, then you bet some chump change on craps, any 7, and 12.  This ensures that you lose a little change but are gurenteed to not lose money.  You roll and if it's on, the chips get moved to that number.  From there, you roll trying to get a 7 before you roll that number.  No matter how many times I do this, magically, I will lose.  I'm not just talking about once, but numorous times in a row for hours on end.  Just yesterday, I depletted 120 grand on this system.  One time in particular, I rolled a 7 to lose when I'm trying to get it ready to win... 9 times in a row... Curious how more things that shouldn't happen occur constanty in this game, huh?\n\nTournoments:\n\nAh yes, I entered the poker tournoment over a weekened two weekends ago.  I placed in this tournoment first with 166 seats.  Guess what the grand prize was for placing first?  14 whole grand.  That's right.  Sounds like it's missing a few zeros in that total?  You're telling me.\n\nPlayer base:\n\nAh yes, the final topic about this game.  I'm right around my one month in marker from starting this game.  Yet, I'm globally ranked 96th as of this specific moment for this season.  I've been informed I'm over a month behind in the rankings and that they will end at the end of this month for season 2.  How come there are only 96 people ahead of me?  Well, you could argue that I'm good at gambling outside of when I hit magical, near impossible lose streaks.  Or, you could be observant and see that the halls are fairly empty most hours of the day.  Why?  Maybe it's because the chances of winning any game at this casino is far less than even one in real life.  Why is that?  Well, you can buy more chips with real life money and it seems to me, they designed this game so you lose chips and are put into a sitation where you have to buy more.\n\nThank you all for reading my review, post your hate all you want, I will love it.  Find me ingame to hate me more, I'm Hazereaper.  I'm sure you will find me losing at craps, winning tournoments for cents to the dollar.  I still have hope that maybe this game will turn around.  Regardless, the only reason I'm still playing this game is that I enjoy the Casino games but the moment I find better that doen't involve real life money, I'll move on.  Or, when I finally get sick enough to uninstall.","November 11, 2015","false","386.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Hackers on day one with access to every feature the game had to offer. It's an unfortunately greedy company preying on gambling addictions as you are paying the same price here to play games and not get anything from it as you would any other online casino. It's a legal loophole they're taking advantage of.\n\nImagine a casino where they host daycare, and you have this game. It is taken over by little boys who run around spamming profanity because the filter makes it 'cool'. Expect the same type of people you would find in a game like League of Legends or CSGO. It's not a mature community, it's not a friendly community, and it's definitely not a social community like you might expect.\n\nDo not play unless you plan on giving away money to play imaginary casino games. Still overrun by hackers; people can see your cards in poker and there's nothing you can do to find out.","June 3, 2015","false","90.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I still have 4Mil+, however, I do NOT know how you are planning to maintain a new base because unless people are willing to pay for chips only to lose them (like 100K in BJ in less than 10 minutes), or weekly tasks where you expect someone with minimal chips to maximum bet on whatever to achieve the task that will pay out FAR LESS than they put in.....

Especially in Blackjack. The times the dealer comes out with 20 and 21 from seemingly impossibly dealt cards is just pure CRAP!\n\nAs for the slots well you might as well throw your money away. There is only 3 types as well and trust me they get really boring. They do not pay hardly anything at all and free spins are a joke and the features are just crappy. No excitement at all.\n\nDont even waste your time.","March 1","false","26.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
