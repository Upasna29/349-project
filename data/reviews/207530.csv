Frantic, fast, furious, and fun. It can take a bit to come to grips with the unique control scheme, but once you've spent some time in the tutorial and gotten mastery of a few stages under your belt, you'll be up to speed and zip around the screen causing all manners of chaos.\n\nThe game features an incredible amount of variety packed into its arcade length. There's no shortage of stage gimmicks and unique fodder enemies to pound away on, and how could you forget the positively over-the-top boss encounters, which will push your dexterity to the limit and require a good bit of thought to truly best.\n\nNoitu Love's difficulty is also balanced very well. Each of the game's difficulties suits a range of player skill levels, and advancing to a higher difficulty level doesn't only make enemies hit harder, they also have a few new tricks up their sleeve which keep things fresh and interesting. It's far from punishing like a lot of 2D platformers and action games these days tend to be, but you will be tested and failure only leads to more learning.\n\nAdd a couple unlockable playable characters with some fun stage variations between them on top and you've got an amazingly solid little package just eager for lovers of frantic old-school games to take hold of and enjoy.","May 26, 2014","true","3.0"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","1"

Do you like Gunstar Heroes? Do you like Alien Soldier? Do you happen to enjoy highly-rasterized cult classics with fast movement and faster combat (Treasure games)? If you answered yes to any or all of these questions, then pick up Noitu Love 2. Each one of your punches and kicks resonates with that distinctive crunch and pop that calls pixel art games home, while an unrelenting lo-fi keyboard soundtrack and and screen-filling explosions whenever anything blows up (there's hardly a moment where something isn't blowing up) seal the aesthetic deal. It's very satisfying when all's said and done. Good game for speedrunning if you're into that, too, since the entire game is built on that very concept.","November 18, 2014","true","13.2"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

Controls are quite innovative - they take advantage of mouse & keyboard setup and create a beat'em-up game that works suprisingly well. Bosses in this game show up at killer rate and each one of them is pretty imaginative and fun to fight. Graphics are also solid. 16-bit feel is present here.\n\nThere are only two hickups. Firstly, one level forces you to use unique weapon and game is not that good in explaining how it exacly works. This can lead to few deaths before you eventually get that devs wanted you to do. Secondly, title is little on the short side, but fortunetly unlockable playable characters make up for it.\n\nIf you are looking for Hidden Indie Gem on Steam, this is it!

The length is just right to finish it in one session, and come away feeling satisfied. The combat flows extremely smoothly, and while the amount of things going on the screen might be a bit overwhelming to some, with a bit of practice, figuring out what to do becomes a matter of picking up on signals. The pixel style and colors of the game complement each other greatly, leaving behind fun atmospheres that are easily differentiated and nice to look at. The characters are all unique, and their personality is shown despite their simplicity. The pace of the game may leave you wanting to see stills of certain scenes, as things happen so quickly.

It features some fantastic mouse controlled gameplay with tons of robots to smash up and plenty of firepower to do so. To be blunt, every single bit of this game is absolutely fabulous.... the boss battles are challenging but fair, the pixel-art style is gorgeous, the level design is awesome, and the music... is great!\n\nReally, what better could you possibly ask for out of a $5 game? Granted, it's not all that long with the base story, but I found myself completing the game many times with the variety of unlockable characters available to you and the multiple difficulty settings. Too easy? That's okay, the game is more than happy to crank up the difficulty for you... no matter how experienced you are, there's always something fun and challenging for you here. Beat your previous score on the levels, shoot for an A ranking, or even just something as self-imposed as trying to go through the game without taking any damage.\n\nFor those few saying the combat is "Boring"... did you even go through the OPTIONAL tutorial available to you? There's many different attacks you can use, not just the simple punching up an enemy to bits one... (although even that is great fun) and the other two characters you unlock after beating the game in various ways each feature their own unique attack and movement styles... it's all great fun, so you really need to give it another go.\n\nTo anybody debating about purchasing this game, just go ahead and do it! It's well worth the money, one of the best games you could buy at this pricepoint.\n\nAs for me...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/potentpillow/recommended/207530/","potentpillow","Dora Lemon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/potentpillow/","135 products in account","A very accessible beat-em-up. Controls consist mainly of clicking LMB to dash/jump/kick. The environments and enemies are well-designed and the boss battles are the highlight of the game. However, there's one little thing that's been more or less standardized in modern arcade-style games that has been excluded in this game, which is a "Restart level" option.\n\nI wouldn't say the bosses are Nintendo-hard, but they are pattern-based, which can be a bit of a jump from the button-mashing that the game establishes. You could be doing well in the level, fail to figure out the boss pattern quick enough, die, and if you "continue" in any way, instead of giving an option to restart the level, you reload from the nearest checkpoint and the score resets, rendering it nigh impossible to avoid a "D" grade. I just feel that there should be the option for players (especially new players) to redeem themselves in each level and not have to start the game from the very beginning if they want a good score.\n\nApart from this minor complaint, there is little else wrong with the game. I would recommend it for everything it does right -- the simple cathartic pleasure of beating things up, the music, graphics, and the style-over-substance story (which actually works in a game like this).

It's bright, colourfull, silly and most importaintly - fun. The gameplay is almost inovative, as it's rare to see such a mix of mouse and keyboard action in a action-platformer. While it feels like there should have been a bit more strategy to it, it's still loads of fun. The game is packed with content, funny remarks and scenes, and some very classical aesthetics. If you are not bothered by the feel of the game and you are into platformers, you will most certainly enjoy this gem.

Unfortunately, the game is both incredibly simple and incredibly easy, and not worth your time.\n\nStory\n\nThe game’s story makes no sense; it involves some bizarre time-travel plot which isn’t really time travel… it doesn’t really make any sense, but it doesn’t need to and really isn’t supposed to.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is very simple and is at the heart of the game, but unfortunately is also terrible. You control an on-screen reticle with your mouse, and by clicking, you attack to that spot, if there is an enemy highlighted. You can also hold down your mouse button for a charge shot, jump, move side-to-side, or do a dash attack or spinning jump attack. In the end, while these attacks are theoretically meaningful, most of the time you’re just running to the right, frequently using dash attacks to get through the stages faster to fight the bosses… where, mostly, you just wait to do your thing, or sometimes just straight up attack them as fast as possible, depending on the boss. Many of the bosses don’t require any strategy, while others require a little strategy but not very much.\nUltimately the gameplay is very unsatisfying, and there is very little “meat” to it – the game requires very little strategy and very large amounts of mindless clicking. There is some enemy variety, but most of it is fairly meaningless as strategy has little meaning with the game’s control scheme, and most of the ordinary enemies are both trivial and easily bypassed. Even the bosses mostly are not very interesting, with only a very small number requiring any sort of real strategy. On the whole, the game feels far too simple and straightforward, like you are only there to click to attack a large number of times.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game does a fine job of emulating the era it is trying to emulate; it isn’t particularly beautiful, but it isn’t ugly either, and it is significantly better than a lot of the 8-bit pseudo-retro graphics indie games floating around the market.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nNoitu Love 2 Devolution is not worth your money, but more importantly, it isn’t worth your time. You will derive more satisfaction out of doing most anything else.\n","January 6, 2015","false","1.5"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","6","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/discipleofhomer/recommended/207530/","discipleofhomer","discipleofhomer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/discipleofhomer/","430 products in account","This is a fun game. I'm bad at giving things numeric ratings, so I'll just go over my thoughts on the most likely reason people wouldn't want to buy this game. For the most part they're pulled from the negative reviews (which are all relatively ostracized and 'unhelpful', suggesting these people are in the vast minority. Then again, that's also because a lot of them are quite ineloquent).\n\nSo without further ado, things people may gripe about related to buying/playing this game:\n\n"The game is too short"\nIt took me about 1.5 hours to beat the game without caring about taking damage or getting a good score on normal. If you don't care about beating it on hard or if your motto is 'D stands for Diploma' then chances are you may think the game is 'too short' although I'd argue that it's still a better time/money ratio than going to a movie.\n\n"All you do is click on things"\nThis is something of a 2D-action beat-em-up where you jump around, enemies show up, and sometimes (but not always) you have to kill a certain number of enemies before being able to scroll the screen. A key mechanic is that, if you're hovering over an enemy, clicking the mouse will jump/drag/move your character to the enemy. That in combination with the fact that rapid-clicking will result in pretty quick basic attacks that will destroy most normal enemies.\n\nThis is not to say that you still don't have to move left and right. Add to that the fact that ducking is also required on more than one occasion, means that anyone who says 'all you have to do is click on things' is clearly exagerating, which is one of the reasons why no-one likes them (er, 'finds them helpful').\n\nIn reality, you have 4 keys for move/jump/duck and can perform special moves by double clicking up/left/right or holding the right mouse button and swiping. Aside from further invalidating the afforementioned argument, this also provides a fun way to move faster than walking/jumping speed, which is always welcomed.\n\nBasically, yes, on normal you COULD beat MOST of the game with only the right arrow and the left mouse button, but I wouldn't recommend it. If you're never using specials then, well, I don't know why you would do that.\n\n"It's too easy"\n*shrug* I'll admit, I didn't die that much on normal and I didn't spend too much time paying attention to boss patterns or trying to avoid hits or etc. That being said, I did die a few times and I got the lowest letter ranking on every level. Getting an A (I assume? maybe higher?) rank would, probably, take at least some effort to achieve. Also, I tried to play level 1 with the same carefree attitude on hard and managed to die without too much trouble, but I probably wouldn't have if I would have been taking it slower.\n\n"It's boring"\nWatch the trailer. That's the game. If you think that's boring then don't buy the game. Not every game is for everyone, but I seriously don't understand this argument once you see what you're getting yourself in to.\n\n"The art style is [insert criticism]"\n*Shrug* I think it's fine, but my first system was a Genesis so I'm no stranger to pixels. I think the art in the game is great, but I wasn't playing full screen. Really though, just see the above comment and replace 'that's boring' with 'that represents a sub-par art-style' and I think we're good.\n\n"Rawr I made a complaint about the game and you didn't include mine, I hate you"\nUm... my bad, maybe your complaint should be more logical ;-). If you think your complaint is logical, please just leave a comment or, y'know, don't bother me and go away :-D.","August 2, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Having some spare funds in one's Steam Wallet is also a big plus)\n\nI'll try and keep it short. This game....is ridiculous. In a good way. It throws you right in (I would recommend the tutorial so you're not going in blind) and never stops the action all the way to the end. The enemies are varied each level and the bosses are unique and well designed. First playthrough, you will probably die more than a few times. Don't let the controls fool you--be smarter and don't just rush in and spam. (At least for the bosses.) I beat the game in about 90 mins of total gameplay time (not in one sitting). But there is a hardest mode to unlock as well as a character to unlock so it does have replayability. Also, prepare your carpal tunnel kit...you're gonna need it.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced action and creative level and boss design.","January 15, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, a TON of fun and quite a lot of replayability, with 3 difficulty levels (Normal, Hard, and Hardest, which gets unlocked when you beat Hard), 3 playable characters that are all quite unique in style, and a hidden boss. Normal is quite easy, as there's no significant penalty for death. Hard give you 5 lives and then it's game over for real, and I've yet to actually unlock Hardest. It has trading cards, but no achievements, which seems like an odd omission. Hopefully they get added at some point, but the game stands up on its own without them.\n\nIf you like intense character action games and 2d sidescrollers, and don't mind  using a mouse for controls, this game is for you.
