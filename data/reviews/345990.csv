This game is probably one of the best Local games out there. I don't know how the heck the others managed to rate this game after playing for like 20 minutes, but think i tried it enough to give it a rating.\n\nThere are three modes: Race, Arena and Challenge mode.\n\nThe race mode is 2-4 player. This the mode that makes the game shine. You have to get through 9 stages before the others, and in every round, the chosen one has to go as far as possible within 60 seconds. While the chosen ones struggles to get through the stage, he have to escape from monsters which is controlled by 1-3 local opponents. (NO BOTS. ONLY THE OTHER LOCAL PLAYERS) On their way to comleting each stage, he/she have to escape the opponents either by avoiding them or beating them to move on. Every character gets a chance every round to be the chosen one, who has to go through the stages. If you are lucky and good then you might go through 3 stages within 60 seconds. And if you are unlucky then you might stay in the same stage until the next round. After every round the first chosen one is being chosen by a battle between friends (works like smash bros). The one who is finishing and beating the stage 9 boss the first will win the game.\n\nThe arena mode works like smash. But there's no strong attack and it's not about getting each other off the map. The arena mode depends on what the actual task is of that specific Arena mode. One of the tasks is to collect coins and beat them out of each other and put them into a golden chest full of coins, there's also the standard ones like Survival Mode where you have to be the last one standing the map.\n\nChallenge mode (single player): This mode is just about small challenges like hitting a few targets before the time is over.  There's three kinds of Challenge modes, but they all have the same principle, which is to make you understand and be better at playing the game. Don't buy the game if you are only thinking of playing Challenge mode.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Insanely fun Local Co-op game.\n+ Each character has their own unique skills and playstyle\n+ You should be good to go as long as you know how to play super mario.\n+ Can play with family and friends.\n\n\nCons:\n- no bots\n- no online mutiplayer\n- no singleplayer mode except for the challenge mode\n- if you are playing against your girlfriend, then you might have to act like a noob if she sucks. lol","April 4","true","6.2"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","30","30","5","0"
