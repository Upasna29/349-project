No.  Does Angry Birds have mages that cast spells to destroy one or more of your siege engines?  No.\n\nYes this game has the same basic ideas as Angry Birds:  launch a projectile to hit all the enemies in a set number of turns.  But Angry Birds was not the first game to do that, so why do people disregard games like this just because they are similar?  Who cares which was first, all that matters is if a game is good or not.  Sure there are lots of crappy games that are made to try to get easy money, but dont' assume that this is one of them.\n\nFor one thing, this game has no animals.  No birds, no pigs.  The player has siege engines such as catapults and arrow launchers.  The enemies are mages of different types.  If you don't kill them in a turn or two the mages cast a spell and destroy one or more of your siege engines.   And the mages don't laugh and mock you for losing like the pigs in Angry Birds.\n\nThere are 4 different types of siege engines you get throughout the game.  You can't choose which to use, they are set in each level.  But you can choose which ones you want to upgrade.   You get upgrade points (I can't remember what they are called in the game) from time to time (I think for beating a level fast or maybe not losing a siege engine or something) and there are occasional orbs in the level that you can get, though they are usually in hard to reach places.\n\nThere are also spells you can use.  I've gotten one at the beginning of each world.  Once you use it, it's gone.  But it does help when you're in a tough spot.\n\nGraphics are nice, cartoony, cute.\n\nSound is ok.\n\nThe price is great.  Pretty cheap for the amount of content you get.\n\nPlus there are Achievements and Trading Cards!","August 1, 2015","true","4.7"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","27","31","3","1"

It has some obvious, simple-to-fix design issues that make it seem like an unpolished cash-grab.\n\nEdit: if you want to get 100% achievements in this game, it is not enjoyable, it is a tedious chore and it looks like the developers never tried to do that while testing, because the design flaws fly right into your face then. On Steam you cannot buy spells (which would make things very easy) like in the mobile versions through microtransactions, but the game was built around that feature it seems.\nIf you are not a completionist but want to have some hours of simple fun, the cautious recommendation still stands.\n\nGood:\n+accessible gameplay, if you don't have Angry Birds, this game fills that hole very well\n+your weapons are upgradeable\n+varied level design. Some are contraption mechanisms that I found quite funny (you hit a ball that rolls down a slope to topple a stone and so on and so on). Most of the levels are not like that ofcourse, but still are varied.\n\nBad:\n-the trajectory of the previous throw is not shown (as in AngryBirds), and the parameters of your previous throw are discarded. Aiming is made more difficult for no reason.\n-depending on the weapon, you can not adjust all parameters (the power of the shot is fixed for some weapons, for no reason, very annoying)\n-the enemies attack your weapons randomly afaik. This makes a huge difference and brings randomness and alot of restarting the level.\n-your highscore for a level is not shown anywhere. You only see if you have beaten it or not, but not how high it was/is.\n-upgrading your weapons can have a negative side, because for example the range of the standard catapult can not be adjusted when using it (only the angle). If you extend its range, it is extended and you are not able to reach some close enemies anymore.\n-it doesn't show you in the list of levels in which levels you still have to collect something. You have to play the level to look for collectible spheres.\n-it doesn't show you what those spells do, and if you activate some of them at the wrong time, they have no effect and you just loose them. They should be greyed out during those times.","August 26, 2015","true","18.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","2"

But instead of playing those mobile games, you get to play this on a desktop PC, even though theres actually about 5k other games out there that are better to be played on a PC. Do you like every level looking and feeling almost the exact same? Do you love basically no story? Do you love being rewarded by beating levels with purchasing incremental stat bonuses that don't actually really do anything noticeable? If you love all that then this game is for you!","September 30, 2015","false","9.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

There are a fair number of levels, and when you first start you will be knock off the first dozen in just a few minutes.\n\nStill, despite the simplicity there is a fair amount of polish.  The artwork is simple but pleasing.  The sound adds to the overall cute atmosphere.  The game was a joy to play, if a little short.\n\nIf you like this type of game, this is a worthwhile title to try.\n8/10","March 30","true","4.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game seemed okay for an Angry Birds clone but what really lets it down is the slow gameplay. I found myself waiting constantly to take my next shot and that was even with liberal use of the restart button. Some of the shots were incredibly difficult to make and if you mess up you have to wait way too long to have a second go. Overall it just felt far too slow for what it was and the physics weren't really satisfying at all. A real shame. Probably worth the super cheap sale price for some but not the relaxing casual game I had hoped for.","June 3","false","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a lot of reviews saying this game is a clone of Angry Birds; to an extent, they are pretty similar. The mechanic that makes this game stand out is that the targets are able to attack you.\n\nIf you've played slingshot-style games, it's a familiar setting with different graphics.\n\nMy few criticisms of the game would be the Ice world, and lack of controller compatiability.\n\nMy beef with Ice world is that the dotted projectile path is much harder to see, compared to any other world. Games like Angry Birds could get away with  something like that because the projectiles pull 180 degrees away from where you want to go; you can't tell what direction you're launching projectiles in Siege Wars.\n\nController compatiability wouldn't be game-making, but I think it would complement the playstyle very well. The projectile style for Siege Wars ironically opposite of another projectile-style game - Castlestorm. In Castlestorm, projectiles are much more effective with mouse, due to point-and-click behavior, making controller support less efficient. In Siege Wars, wth the lack of point-and-click behavior, controller joysticks would be a perfect option.\n","December 4, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
