This should just be a demo.  I like that they let you rent gear, and try stuff out, but you need every key they give you just to unlock enough gear to play a single game.  If you go in as a free player, you will not have access to the highest tier of upgraded gear.  Which means in end game, on equal skill level, you have no chance.  The time it takes to unlock anything as a free player is ludicrous.\n\nThat being said, I love the theme and style of the game.  I'll leave it installed in hope that there's some balancing to happen.  I would gladly play a little money to play a game where there's no major team disadvantages than to play a free game where I have to hope there are no free players on my team.","April 14","false","4.1"," 191 of 231 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","191","231","7","11"

You must pay additionnal heroes/weapons/sentinel if you want to have a reasonable content in game...\nI started with the 8 euros pack then I went to the 40 EUR pack because the game was too poor with only one hero... Then I added some silver coins 2x 20 EUR. So I spent about 88 EUR for this game and I have the 9-8 available heroes (they removed one in the meanwhile but should come back), 2 skins, 2 sentinels and a bit more than one third of the artefacts.\nI could afford that, but\n1) many friends don t or just don t want to spend so much for such a game (even if they spend without counting dota2 heores skins)\n2) I consider the game still in a very early stage and expect much more content, (aretfact/breed/sentinel/map). But presently it also means much more content to pay... Will I finish to spend more than 500 EUR to get a complete game?\nWhen you are used to other games like dota2 where only skins are not free (and god knows how much i spent in dota2 skins) you can only get disgusted by the deabreed approach of making money.\n\nOk people could tell that I could get these stuff for free with copper coins...\nIndeed you can either pay with real money (silver coins) or by farming copper coins without end... For example the cheapest weapon is a bit more than 1000 copper coins. Without quests achievement, you get about 80 copper coins per game (about 20 min per game) You can get some 100 coins more per quest and you have 3 quest per day.\nSo if you have plenty of time and you are very patient you can get one or two cheap item per day.\n\nSo in conclusion Deadbreed is potentially an excellent game that could even put dota2 in the grave. But it will never happend with such a stinky payment system (kind of pay to play or even pay to win), and I would not recommend this game for this reason.\n\nMy recommendation to the guy who make this stinky system:\nHow are you going to attract sufficient people to handle good equilibrium in matchmaking and without waiting for ages?\nPlease consider instead a dota2 or even starcraft2 model.","December 18, 2014","false","39.0"," 208 of 273 people (76%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","76","208","273","17","6"

Copper coins can be earned by completing games, opening chests during matches inside the dungeons and opening chest outside matches as you progress with different breeds. Silver coins can be purchased for real life money and allow you to buy breeds/artifacts/chest without grinding for the copper coins.\n\nPretty common system, but along with the normal currencies their are keys (bronze, silver gold) you can unlock breeds and artifacts for a certain amount of time depending on the key (bronze=1 game, silver=1 day, gold=1 week) Now here is where people say the game is pay 2 win, they say that the only way to earn artifacts and breeds is with real life money or that you have to grind to get keys to try them out, but most people dont even play the game long enough to realize that while in game and you break a chest/barrel you have a chance to get a bronze key, so as long as you break these things you will always be able to play any breed and any artifact. On top of that you start with 8 of each type of key and gain 2 of each type of key everyweek.\n\nSo for the people complaining about the developpers being greedy and that the game is pay 2 win, its not. Just play the game, you will have acess to every artifact just like everyone else who actaully took the time to understand the game. Its worth a try, it has a really unique end fight and each map as its own different play style and strategies.","May 8","true","39.2"," 89 of 104 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","89","104","5","17"

I have 48hours on this game and I'm like 20th on the leaderboard.\nWhere to start... When I first began playing this game, I kind of understood the concept with keys and stuff. It was a bit harsh, but farmable even in practice mode. But after the "Beginner week" everything fell apart.\nArtifacts (OP items you unlock/buy out of your games) and Breeds are locked behind rotations. You can't even unlock them with keys if they are not in the rotation.\nFor starters, making pay to win items that modifies greatly the gameplay has NEVER been a great idea. But "keys rotations" and breed rotations are just bad. The game is already behind a thick enough paywall with the keys. Yes, you can farm keys and drop some crates, but if you're not lucky, you actually gain 50 copper coin per game won; the cheapest artifact is 3015, cheapest breed is 6667. And you can't complete quests unless you can win the games, which means you need artifacts and good breeds.\nSome heroes concept are okay, but some spells are badly tweaked : for example, you shouldn't upgrade your stealth skill with demonata because each level adds 10mana/sec (and a few %damage on first hit). To compare, you have around 600 mana pool with 6mp/sec at level 10, which means you can't hold this 2sec cast time stealth invis for long if you level it. I'm not talking about the smart cast and the AoE of Pyre Gemini which is not the same as the animations. Some other heroes have the same problem, but not as drastic as this breed.\nOh and I forgot, the "you can build your breed how you want" is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. there's mostly two ways to build your breed : dps/mage, and then you add some tanky items or artifacts here and there. Or just have artifacts all socketed in hp. You can reach 6*240 hp with all sockets in hp, and a breed late game has around 2000hp. So, yes. Artifacts matter.\nA lot of little details makes you feel like the developpers are too busy rubbing their hands together to actually fix the game, like the botlane creepwave on Mirage which splits in two for no reasons (and then the ranged creep sneak attack your monolith and you then lose half exp/gold), or the global unresponsiveness of the actions. Everything feels a bit delayed.\nThis game could be much better by using common sense, I would play it only for the dark fantasy style, but basically, apart from the base idea, the development of the game is a big disappointment. I've never seen such waste of an idea in my entire life, and I can't even begin to understand the reasoning behind every new ♥♥♥♥ ideas the developpers are coming up with, while there's still only 12 breeds, 27 artifacts with half of them useless, 2 endbosses and no sign of the third we can see in the sentinel selection screen.\nThese mistakes were acceptable when the game was in pre-release, but now that it is officially released, I can officially say : you are failures, DB devs. Do you even care about your game ? I've yet to see a bigger update than 5mo in 2 months.\n","April 23","false","58.2"," 83 of 102 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","83","102","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThingsToSwallow/recommended/277950/","ThingsToSwallow","ThingsToSwallow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThingsToSwallow/","271 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo this is an early access review as of 4/10/15 of this neat little diamond in the rough, soon before a large patch that might solve a lot of issues that are in game, and my hopes are that the patch will be a reliable gateway to the official release. Anyways, let's begin.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n● A very unique take on MOBAs, without feeling like a rehash\nWe all know what it's like when we see another rehash of a popular genre; we look, we scoff, and we turn our heads without looking back. Well in this case, I'm glad I went beyond looking. Deadbreed brings forth a lot of new ideas and unique features such as dungeon crawling, resource management (beyond life+gold+mana), and a variety of interesting objectives along with a wonderful assortment of neat features like character building that I'll discuss in a bit.\n● It looks wonderful\nDeadbreed has a dark and gritty theme, unlike it's competitors, and it pulls it off very well. It reminds me of Diablo 3 mixed with the darker netural tones of Dark Souls. Whatever you want to call it, it looks and feels genuinely good to play, and the feeling good part will only get better as it develops.\n● Great concept for character building\nIn most MOBAs, you pick your character with a set of moves and you build them in very particular ways. With each character in this game (called Breeds), you have multiple ways to build them. Each breed has four class presets, which change their base-stats to reflect your playstyle. You can unlock artifacts as well to build unique powerful items to compliment your breeds and classes.\n\nTHE BAD:\n○ Small community/Player-base\nThis seems to be where half of the complaints are focused. It's hard to get into a game at the moment because the player base is so small and split amongst servers. I think it was a bad decision to create regional servers at this stage, because now there are not enough players to compensate. But that can be fixed just by getting more players to play.\n○ Glitches/Bugs are still frequent\nThis game is early access, and that means you should expect problems. The devs have said many times that they are fixing everything they can, and they are working hard to make this game great. That said, the glitches and bugs can be game-breaking and very annoying, but it's best to log them and report them when you see them. This game isn't done, and you should treat it like you would a beta: report any bugs, contribute to the community, and critique its development. If we can look past the bugs/glitches, and we can see them fixed, the game will reach its full potential much faster. That said, if you don't want to deal with it, wait for the release.\n○ Game balance isn't too much of a thing right now\nFirst the glitches have to be fixed, then the game balance can be a primary goal. In its current state, things can be slightly chaotic or snowball-ey or flat out wrong. I don't blame anyone who thinks that is an issue (because it is), but I want to remind you guys yet again that this is in early access. The devs are trying to get this game into a playable state before managing breed balance- which in my honest opinion, isn't too far off as it stands.\n\nOverall, I like this game. A lot. I want to see it become a big name, and I want to see it flourish because it deserves to. The devs have a lot of wonderful ideas, and a lot of the active community so far has been really positive and helpful. If this game's glitches were alleviated, I think it could go far- and I think it will go far, but only if we can start looking past the issues and at the game itself (and if those issues are all we CAN see, then please be helpful and report them. CONTRIBUTE to the game instead of instantly dropping it because you don't like the fact that it's early access).\nThanks guys for looking at my review. I want this game to succeed, and if you give it a chance and help with the development, I really believe we can make Deadbreed a great game.","April 10, 2015","true","6.9"," 67 of 83 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","67","83","4","1"

This was pretty boring and didn't exactly compel me to play more, get better, earn more gear, etc. There's also something about this game that just feels generic or creatively shallow, like they thought the dark aesthetic would be enough to convince players that the game is cool, or hardcore, or whatever. It was all just instantly forgettable. Then I looked around a bit more and saw how much content actually costs if you want even a minimal amount and I couldn't help but roll my eyes and cynically chuckle. This game isn't horrible by any means but still serves as another example of a type of game development and subsequent marketing that most of us are just hoping will finally die off soon. If you're really inspired by cosmetically dark themes and really into mobas then you might want to putter around with Deadbreed on a rainy day. Otherwise you can safely pass this up and do something cool like your laundry or taxes.  :P","April 30","false","1.7"," 52 of 68 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","52","68","10","0"

It's just not in beta condition by a long shot. There are TONS of good ideas in this game, it's not a DotA/LoL clone. However, there's just too much wrong with it to recommend it in its current state even for beta playing. This is not beta state. This is mid/late alpha at best. Minion waves seem to spawn at uneven intervals and tend to wander to the other lane for no descernable reason, the troll you can send after you enemy will often just go forth, do nothing and vanish or attack at the spawn forever because in that spot it keeps coming right back to life and not dying, and objectives (which are a good idea) should have timers but do not. Plus, there is a time limit on matches that makes it hard to actually win the game by anything other than points. I literally did a bot match 1v1 and got troll every time to push the lane as fast as possible and never saw the bot. COMPLETELY UNOPPOSED I still could not beat the timer. Plus, the cost of everything is just too freaking high to warrant playing this. It's too money-grubby.\n\nIt looks decent, has great ideas, and when complete it will be amzingly good if they amend the above issues. Right now?

It just doesn't seem like I got enough out of it after spending so much. Hell, you could buy $50 or so worth of the in-game currency that you could practically have enough to buy a ton of content.\nBut enough of all that negative crap.... (Don't worry, I've got more to say)\n\nPositives:\n-Good character customization\n-Lots of items now\n-Artifacts that can change the outcome of a game\n-Vote for the boss you want to appear in your team\n-Interractive objects in the game\n-Lots of item customization (Putting thingamabobbers within Artifact sockets to increase its base stats)\n-Good updates that come with plenty of content\n-Admins/Creators listen and reply to emails\n-Easy to make a PVE match (bots on both teams)\n-Dungeons within the matches!\n-You can spawn trolls to fight on your side!\n\nNegatives:\n-Updates take forever to come out\n-Not made for everyone (Especially those who hate grinding)\n-Not a guaranteed chance to get in a PVP match (But when an update comes out, this game becomes very popular)\n-A somewhat difficult to navigate homepage\n-Glitches (but it's excusable because none of them are game breakers)\n-New characters/updated characters can be over powered (but updates usually fix this. Most games have things like this though, like League of Legends for example.)\n-Items cost a LOT. This is why there is a lot of grinding.\n-Artifacts are game changing but are hard to buy because of grinding.\n-Characters cost a lot and you are only given one at the beginning (might be different)\n\nI'll keep this up to date as each update comes out.\n\nI know the negatives are massive but this game has the potential to overcome most, or even a good amount, of the issues. I somewhat regret spending money on the DLC because now that I look at what the most expensive DLC gives I see that it would have been better to just get that instead.\nEach update that comes out has a large amount of positives to it with so much to offer, but with bugs as well. As stated before, this game isn't for everyone. You don't need to pay to play, invite friends and play PVE or PVP for coins and then use them to buy artifacts or characters.\n\nI'm looking forward to see how this game does out of Beta and I'll stick with it for as long as it continues to give the players what they want.\n\nUpdate- (To the commentors/anyone else)\nI know this game may seem trashy now, especially with how it's somewhat Pay-2-Win when you just start playing. Just give it a chance and if you don't like it then that's fine.

What I love most about this game is that the objective is a boss with 3 stages at the end! Yes there are a few problems.\n\n1. Money Money Money\nJust look at it yourself, It really needs no explaining.\n\n2. Deadbreed brings "dead" colours\nYes the colour pallete matches the title but it isnt eye candy now is it\n\n3.Title matches community\nSelf explanitory\n\nAnd this is the thing I hate most\n\n4. On a comeback? Too bad! Times Up!\nMy first match in this game was exactly that. Be it the enemy or the final boss, the clock is the true boss. Why on earth would you put a clock in this game? MOBA matches are long yes but COME ON! The most hype comes from comebacks and the boss fight! When you have the euphoria of making that comeback or defeting that final boss or even killing an enemy who has been harassing you, It brings you to play on! Once that is removed, there is no point to continue if the clock just flipped you the finger when you were at the beginning to make a difference in the fight! There is nothing that will make you say "**** YOU!!!" like the clock. All your efforts will be in vain when you are at least one point lower than the enemy team.\n\nIn all honesty, I will continue if that clock is removed. Hell, I would play heavily if the clock was removed! But as I log back on to Darkbread after typing this review, the clock will still be there and I will cry. It is a horrible wa to end a match. I don't want to win by time out. I want to win by KILLING THE GIANT BOSS! Sorry if I am repeating myself but this is a huge flaw to me and I hate it so.\n\nI will continue to play this game and, If there is a God, hope this game will not be dropped. So much potential that I would cry if it was dropped. I wish the best for the game in its future endevors into the vast world of gamming and hope no "Edge Lords" ruin this game for me and the future community. I hope this review was helpfull (even though I pointed out negatives more than positives) but please, please, OH PLEASE! try this game. Its fun. The End.","January 11, 2015","true","2.0"," 39 of 58 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","39","58","5","2"

The comunity atm is quite small so dont expect game after game at the moment im sure this will improve as with every update the game becomes more polished.\n\nyou will need to play atleast 5 bot games before you look for a normal match just to get yourself used to the way you buy items test skills and get the general flow of the game this is quite easy to pick up you may not even need 5.\n\nAll artifacts and breeds ( heroes whatever you want to call them ) in game can be purchased  with silver ( premium paid for ) coins or copper coins that you can earn from daily quests and playing in matches though not required to win a game will help. you can unlock these for a set amount of time with keys copper for 1 game silver for 1 day and gold for 1 week you get a set amount of these keys per week and they are replenished every week. i would suggest while in bot games you use the copper keys to unlock artifacts/breeds to try so you can find which ones fit your play style and so you know what to buy 1st, you can get copper keys as a random drop from chests in dungeons inside the game weather your in a bot or normal game.\n\nif you get a beta key you will start with 1 breed there are currently 9 to choose from.\n\nwhen you buy a piece of armour or a weapon ingame you can see it on you breed skins and other bits of customasation will become available at a later date.\n\nthis game has alot of potential and i would highly recommend it if you will take the game as it is currently ( early access ) if you want a 100% polished game then i would suggest you wait till later in its development when more of the kinks are polished.\n\n","August 6, 2014","true","86.8"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","35","52","0","5"

It does however have its faults like many other Mobas, the player base is rather small so I have yet to get into a game, the item system can be confusing for those who dont memorise it, the dungeons dont feel like that play that big of a part in the actual match and that it, in comparison to other mobas is rather lacking in content. Buuuut thats why its in early access, to get feedback and input in, and get the feed back of the players, now if this was a full on release and was expecting only praise then I feel it would have been mostly in the wrong, but I feel if it makes into the long run then it may build into quite a fine moba (Also, I feel an in depth story may be needed, I always find a good story to be a nice touch, like why are they brought there detailed backgrounds terrain info ect)","June 21, 2015","true","15.7"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","25","36","0","3"

I AM JUDGING THE GAME FOR IT'S CURRENT STATE AND AM AWARE IT IS EARLY ACCESS. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL REVIEWER (JUST A GAMER WITH AN OPINION)\n\n\n\nI am very sorry, this game has A TON of potential. But in it's current state I do not recommend this, at all. There are a TON of bugs, a very user-unfriendly interface (Both in-game and in the lobby)  and no tutorial (Atleast have a tutorial when you're selling a MOBA)\n\nAnother reason being is the lack of players. The average amount of players is around 5. No I did not miss a 0 behind the 5. Literally 5 people. On a side note, I have bought the Beta Deluxe pack which is far from the value you would consider getting for 35 Euro's.\n\nAt the moment the choices in Breeds (Champions, Heroes, however you would like to call them) is very minimal. The ideas behind the Breeds is very good and innovative, having Daybreeds and Nightbreeds, depending on your Breed of choice this might, or might not, impact your abilities and/or game.\n\nThe thing I liked the most about the game is the ability to see what you have bought. By that, I mean that if you buy an axe for example, you are wearing that exact same axe in your hand, or both of your hands if you like to dual wield.\n\nDespite of this game having alot of potential, having to pay atleast around 20 Euro's to get into the closed Beta is ridiculous, I understand it is Early Access but this has gone a bit too far.\n\nYou can also level up and gain Rank Points which you can spend to Upgrade your artifact, an in-game item which you have to buy with Silver Coins (Premium Currency) or the currency you gain by playing games, which is hard to do with a lack of players. You can also spend them on your breeds to increasy their stats such as Vitality, Strength etc.\n\nPeople might say that the lack of players doesn't really matter this much because you can play against bots. There are 2 main problems with this. #1: Eventually you would like to play this game against people, if people have to play bot matches to give feedback, they might take the bots into consideration without noticing because a game with bots is far from the same as a game with actual players. #2: The bots are so damn easy, I have literally seen this a dozen times, an ally/enemy Breed attacks an enemy/ally breed while they are at 50 HP and the opposing breed is at Full-HP, this should be basic programming and should already be fixed.They also appear to not care about any Creep aggro what so ever since they will most likely die to Creeps more than to enemy Breeds. Instead of trying to kill you, they will ignore you when you are on low HP rather than chasing you a bit and trying to actually kill you.\n\nBelow I will list the pros and cons (My personal opinion) of this Early Access game (I am not a professional reviewer, I just like to write these. I am just a gamer with an opinion):\n\nPros\n\n- Appearance changing depending on the items you buy.\n- Interesting Breed "System".\n- Cool theme, dark and creepy-ish.\n- Good graphics, runs well on low-end PC's as well.\n- Good concept with having PvE mixed in your PvP match, altough this needs alot of updates to be fun and good (For now it's just killing skeletons by clicking on them and waiting for them to die.\n- The Behemoth, when you destroy the enemy Crux (Nexus, Ancient etc.) a doorway opens which leads to a Behemoth, which I have yet failed to kill because of the timer (!) on the one and only map available, for now.\n\nCons\n\n- A ton of bugs, this can be forgiven by it being in an Early Access state, I am just stating reasons for why not to buy this game at THIS moment.\n- A serious lack in players, ranging from 3-9 daily.\n- A lack in Breeds.\n- A clunky and non-immersive combat.\n- Poor hitboxes, I have often see myself throwing my ability into someone's face and not hitting which is extremely frustrating.\n- No tutorial, you have to hover over an item or object to have an indication of what it does or what it's purpose is.\n- The difference in prices between the Barebones Pack and the Beta Deluxe Pack is too much for what it offers. Even though this isn't a direct influence of the game, I like to review the game for Price-Performance.\n- Frustrating UI. You will be banging your keyboard trying to find your way out of the shop, trying to sell an item or trying to find that 1 item you want.\n- It's worse than the F2P MOBA's out there in it's currrent state. But I do think that in the long-run this will be better.","July 13, 2014","false","2.4"," 70 of 123 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","70","123","2","7"

Let me set this straight.\nIt is a brilliant unfinished game with all the downsides of, well, unfinished game. But it is still brilliant.\n\nWhat's so good in it?\n1. Artwork.\nThe game has its own style, that resembles a little the Bloodborn and the Dark Souls universe. It's dark, it's grim, it's a no-hope-ever kind of a world with undead fighting undead.\n\n2. Character gear system.\nAmazing quality character models with the gear that customizes the looks, the stats and the gameplay at the same time. Remember getting all sorts of weird things to boost stats in other MOBAs? Forget it. No more buying two-handed axes for an archer.\nAaand btw, it's a game where you can be literally anything. Did you ever want to build a heavily armoured archer? It's your pick.\n\n3. Unlocking system and ranks.\nWhen you first time peek inside it may look a little too much of everything to get/unlock, but it's fairly easy to get everything to play. Key drop is more that enough on its own, and you can get extra keys (!) in actual game, raiding lootboxes in the dungeons.\n\n4. Easy to start.\nI've got the basics in the first five training games (against AI), and totally loved one of the breeds. In fact, I've found a class I really like in less than an hour, and that is amazing (didn't get a hero I like in Dota after 1000 hrs).\n\n5. Character and class balance is unusual and challenging - some characters excel at AOE DPS (while being tasty targets), some are good at disabling enemies and duelling them (heavy-armoured champions with Stun abilities) and some are fine as supports. Counter-pick here is way, WAY more important than in other MOBA-style games.\n\n6. Time limit.\n24 minutes is more than enough to have fun and a perfect point before I get bored. Those hour and a half Dota runs I hated are gone. Well, you'll feel how good the time limit is it when you hit the score victory.\n\nWhat's bad?\n\n1. Low player base.\nSince the game has little to no marketing there's not much people to play it. This leads to facing very experienced opponents from your very first PvP matches, so better bring your friends... Or risk getting ♥♥♥♥♥ in the worst possible way.\n\n2. As I've mentioned already the balance is unusual. It exists, but, well, it may feel unfair a lot when you farmed all slots to the top and still being ♥♥♥♥♥ by asassins.\nLet's say the balance in this game does not forgive you for the mistakes you make on the battlefield.\n\n3. Confusing controls are very confusing. It was an hour to get the thing: you have to manage the range between your character and the target manually, since the character just won't attack if the target is out of range. Silly standing in the middle of the fight because you misclicked? It's here, wrap some.\n\nConclusion: while the game feels nice, there's a lot to go for. Hopefully devs can make something to inscrease the playerbase (most pressing issue, as I am not a fan of being professionally ♥♥♥♥♥) and remake controls. Some polishing here and there won't hurt aswell.\n\nStill, a nice game to play with firends.","March 23","true","5.7"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","19","29","3","0"

The graphics and atmosphere is really good and different. But the gameplay is just broken.\n\nFirstly lets talk about what is good about this game. The gothic atmospehere, character models look great up-close. I like the idea that that when you buy an item in-game, unlike Dota 2, it actually appears on your character. Heroes are very flexable, meaning they can fill any role with the right build. Pacing of the game feels good. The game is slow paced but it is actually a good thing if you are tired of right clicking like crazy in dota 2 or lol.\n\nAbilities are just broken, animations and effects of the abilities are just bad. You can't even understand what is going on when you are playing it. And abilities themselves are just designed bad. They are mostly useless and you can't make good combos with them. Obviously the game has a lot of bugs but i don't mind it, it's beta after all. Controls are just again, bad. Sometimes you won't even know why an ability isn't working even though you have full mana. Right click does not cancel the ability. There is no auto-attack, or maybe there is, sometimes your hero will start to runing backwards or just stop fighting in the middle of a teamfight or when you are farming. Even though the character models are crafted beautifuly, the animations are bad.\n\nMatchmaking can take a lot of time. Sometimes same person appears again and again, declining the match, stoping you from playing the game and this happend after you wait for like 5 minutes for game to find 6 people to play with.\n\nThere are a lot of impovements needed if this game wants to have even 10% of the success dota 2 or even Smite has.","December 19, 2014","false","10.2"," 41 of 71 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","41","71","4","0"

This game would be a lot of fun if I could get in a game! The only things I can say about this game is from playing against a bot when I first started. But that was enough to tell that this game has huge potential, and is truly unique. It is a MOBA with mini-dungeons, RPG elements, and a final boss that you must beat to win the game. This game could make it to the "Most Popular" section in the free-to-play category, I know it can. The one thing that it is lacking is players. With more advertising, and more people reviewing, this game would be great.

It can be some while, before you get your second champ permamently\n2.Low population\n3.Some mechanics aren't intuitve and player needs to get used to.\n---Long review---\nThis game is mix of traditional MOBA like Dota 2 or League of Legends and roguelike dungeon crawlers like Path of Exile. Maps are only for 3v3 or 2 v 2. Interesting part of this game, is that items that you buy for your champion actually affect their looks and abilities, like auto attacking. UI isn't really intuitive, but if you can read, you will manage. Champion rooster isn't really big, but each one of them is really made. Maps have interesting affects and objectives, like in Zodiac map you can spawn additional hordes of undead skeletons and such.Also, if you really like a champion, you can add stars to upgrade their stats. It works like runes in League of Legends.\nThe game has really interesting and different pay model, for theese kind of games. Firstly, every champion can be bought by ingame currency or real life money. The campions are pretty expensive around 8k ingame money. At start you get one free, which isn't as bad. But to ceck out others, you can use keys - bronze, silver and gold keys. They unlock champions for a limitted time - 1game, 1day or 1week.\nThe game has progression, but it actually makes new players lose more. Many objectives or artifacts (unique epic items, that reallly change the flow of the game) can only be bought on high profile levels. This really puts new players in disadvantage.\nThe population isn't really big, but if you got free time on your hands, usually you can get match in 2-7 minutes. The match length is 25 minutes.","May 29","true","5.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

I find it amazing that the items you buy in the match are automatically equiped on your character, and you can also customize your character's class; haven't seen that in any other moba yet so far. The atmosphere is excellent aswell, makes me feel as if I was in a movie hunting beasts or being the beasts myself. Also, at the end the match you get to fight a final boss, instead of just destroying a building, and thats really cool. On the other hand, there's like no people playing the game, which is a let down because I want to play the game in PvP not PvAI. Although, I would recommend if we all play 1v1 until the game's community grows, that way we won't get bored and will get to play the game.","March 12, 2015","true","3.3"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","1"

(Newest update, 12/16/14)\n\n\nAs this game is still in early access, my review will be in my early stages of the early access.\n\nThis MOBA has a lot of excellent, innovative ideas. Some ideas are implemented to perfection, while others are extremely lackluster. I'll shine some light on a handful of ideas that I love, while I go into detail about some of the things that could use some work.\n\nPros:\n\n- Ridiculous number of in-game items: Not only do have a choice of a number of different items, but the items are placed on your character straight away. You can dual wield two different weapons and look like a bad ♥♥♥! Your helms, shoulder armor and body armor will all appear on your character, which could make you look like an intimidating specimen. Some armor and weapons are so cool that you need to unlock them before you can use them, which brings me to my next point.\n\n- Keys and currencies: Keys (which are separated by copper, silver and gold) are for a number of different purposes. You can use keys to unlock playable characters (for one match, one day or even one week), unlock items/insignia, or even enter a dungeon in-game for a chance at obtaining even more keys and loot! The currency is very similar to other MOBAs, as you have silver coins, which is purchased with real money, and you have copper coins, which you gather from playing in-game. Of course, you can use either currency for character, weapon/item or insignia purchases.\n\n- General characters: Although I have only played with a few characters, I can tell you that I really enjoy each particular creature's unique talents. The detail on each Breed or Sentinel is fantastic and the dark, horrific scheme that is given to each character is different from your everyday MOBA. Although the character details and skills are different from one another, you can customize your character in-game to play any way that you wish, as your items will generally determine what type of class you are (this doesn't change your skills, only the power of your basic attacks)\n\n- Boss fights: This is an interesting twist on the MOBA genre. In general, the end of a 3v3 or 5v5 game in a MOBA ends with one team destroying a large tower or power source. In Deadbreed, the object is to defeat a gigantic boss, which is voted upon before entering the game. Theses bosses can have multiple health bars and could take time defeating, depending on how early your team makes it through the Crux (the door leading to the boss room). These bosses add an extra challenge and spin to the genre, and I prefer that to simply beating on a dead, worthless pillar for 30 seconds.\n\nThese are the more positive things that I have gathered from my short playing time thus far. I am sure I will continue to update my post as I play more often and add to my (short) hour count.\n\nHere are the ideas and implementations that I am hoping the developers could take a look at, and possibly change.\n\nCons:\n\n- In-game shop and filtering: Although I am extremely pleased with the amount of items, weapons and armor that is available via the in-game shop, I grew increasingly frustrated with how much time it was taking to find particular items that I was searching for. You can filter by the item type or by the effect of the item, but it does not seem that you can filter by the cost of the item. I like to spend pretty much all my gold at the shop, and would love to use it all on one item, but I have to sift through a number of randomly priced items in order to find the one I'm looking for.\n\n- Shop location and purchasing: Probably my biggest issue with this game thus far, is the fact that you cannot purchase items while you are in the process of respawning. As a matter of fact, you cannot purchase items unless you are in an extremely precise location in your home base. At one point, I had to basecamp while standing in my home base, because I was not in the correct spot to purchase items. We should be able to purchase items while respawning, as it will keep the game moving quickly. We should also increase the size of the area in which purchases are allowed (maybe at the top of the steps on each side of the base?).\n\n- Creepers: I thoroughly enjoy the creepers in this game. They can be troublesome early on, but I have found them to be more annoying then anything. In most MOBAs, you can stand behind your creepers and let them take the punishment. In general, the enemy creepers won't attack you unless you're the first person they see or all the friendly creepers have died. In Deadbreed, you can be attacked by creepers at any moment, regardless of how many friendly creepers are attacking them. I don't like this idea. I feel like creepers should be used as decoys so champions can go toe-to-toe without having to worry about getting their butts smoked by little creeps.\n\n- Community/Player base: I haven't had any issues with the community in general, but I will say that it does take quite a bit of time to get a PvP game going. Perhaps, it's because there isn't a large community of players? Either way, it's frustrating when you pay $9.99 for a game (I got the Undertaker version) and you have to wait long periods of time to get into a game. I am hoping this game either goes free-to-play, or makes the appropriate changes to increase it's player base.\n\nAgain, I will continue to update this as I go along. I have really enjoyed this game and will continue to play. I am hoping the developers will take a look at these suggestions and at least acknowledge what could be used to help make this game even better! Until then, I will add to my current record total (in terms of hours played) and see what else I can find during my gameplay. Thanks for reading!\n\n\nUPDATE (12/16/2014): The developers implemented a new patch on December 12th and a number of the concerns/issues I had with the game have been addressed!\n\nPositives:\n\n- You can now open up the shop while you are in the process of respawning.\n- You no longer have to stand in that one specific spot in your home base in order to purchase items. As long as you're in the general vicinity of your home base, you are good!\n- You can now practice with one or two friends, instead of just yourself.\n- There is an auto purchase feature that allows you to purchase items much faster.\n- There are now breakable barrels scattered throughout the map with gold inside to use for in-game purchases.\n- The banners (used to obtain team points by capturing and burning the other team's banner) have been moved to opposite sides of the map, which proves a bit more challenging than before.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- AI is more intelligent than before, but can still be pretty stupid. They generally don't try to avoid getting killed from turrets and they only start running from human players when they are extremely close to dying.\n- I find it difficult to hide in the grass. You kind of have to stand there for a few seconds before going invisible and when you try to base camp, you are no longer invisible. You should be invisible in the grass even when you are trying to base camp.\n- Would like if you could open up the shop at any point in time. Would make it easier to purchase items if I could open up the shop in the process of base camping.","November 26, 2014","true","16.3"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","18","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/recommended/277950/","yolodomo","Domo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yolodomo/","623 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOkay, I only played one match, and it was just a practice match with AIs since it's my first time playing this game.\n\nI have played DOTA2 alot, and I am aware of what MOBAs are. As for this game, the setting, the map, some of the new mechanics (such as Spirits, Blood, or Nectar) are very nice new features I haven't seen in a MOBA before. I also like how there are dungeons in which one can enter (which takes you into a different area) to fight monsters, and collect gold from chests. Also, instead of destroying a boring main base at the end, you have to fight the enemy team's Sentinel (which is awesome, looks badass, and is a new take on winning the game).\n\nNow, for the cons...\n\nFrom just playing one hero I chose (chose one already unlocked, didn't wanna waste this other one I used a bronze key on for a practice game), I could not understand WHY I couldn't use any of my abilities. The tutorial told me to "Click one of my abilities to learn it. As I level up, I will learn new abilities and can even rank up the abilities I have already learned." Sounds simple, just like DOTA2, you have 4 abilities, first 3 being your starter skills, 4th being the ult I assume. HOWEVER, I couldn't, for the life of me, LEARN THEM! My hero kept saying "I need to unlock them first" and I was like "WTF!? UNLOCK!? WHAT!?" I haven't the slightest clue as to how to unlock them. The tutorial said to just click the ability to LEARN IT, there was nothing about UNLOCKING IT! So I played my first practice tutorial match completely without skills. If this is one of those games where you have to pay cash to unlock a character, then MORE cash to unlock the abilities TO that character, then I would NOT recommend this game until this is fixed.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me. There is just too much money grubby options in the game to "pay" for silver, or "pay" for this, or that, and you don't even get to permanently keep your heroes. Bronze key only lets you use a hero you unlock for 1 match, Silver key for 1 day, and Gold key for a week. Where's Permanent unlock!? If I can permanently or had the option to buy or permanently unlock characters and ♥♥♥♥, alright. But the way it's set up, it's like you're just "RENTING" heroes. Sorry, if I'm gonna be doing pay-2-play, I'm gonna go play Final Fantasy XIV, or WoW...actually, screw WoW, game's over rated.\n\nMy point being is, if I wanna go "Pay-2-Play", I'd be playing a Pay-2-Play game, not a "Free-2-Play" game that's wanting money for every little aspect to the game. Unless this ever changes (like have every hero unlocked, but have a cash shop for cosmetics like DOTA2 or something that isn't a game breaker or isn't pay-2-win), then I may change my recommendation. This game has so much potential to be different from other MOBAs, as well as have a large community if it just loosens up abit on the restrictions. More maps also would be a nice change, as well as 5v5, cause so far I only saw up to 3v3 matches.\n\nWell, that is it for now. Thanks to anyone and everyone that has taken the time to read my long, boring, rantiful review. Feel free to like, dislike, whatever. Just don't click funny, I'm not joking! This isn't a JOKE, THIS IS SERIOUS! WE NEED THIS GAME FIXED NAOW!!!

Don't know why they seemed so intent on making a 3v3 only moba. Some of their ideas are cool. The look of the game is cool as well. But, they decided to shape the game around making money. They basically tried to make a "Make me money app" instead of a cool game that everyone can love and make then a little bit of money for thier effort. Nope. They decided to make the game all about them making money instead. which is terrible. Don't get me wrong. I'm not one of those that floats around expecting for the game to be absolutely free and not support the dev at all if I like the game. If I have money and I like the game and its cool and I will be spending time on it and I feel the devs deserve it. I will give them some money. But, this game. Business model so bad lol. They really need to take a big look at thier game and look at LoL, Smite and Dota2 business models. Those games are actually making money. Because they are built around having fun and not pushing you to have to buy something every match or always have the fact that you need to buy this or that in order to be better at the game in the back of your mind. That is just awful. If they restructrize the business model the game might have a chance in hell. They also need some more damn characters with powers that differ more. More unique characters, not in the way they look, but in the way they attack and the way they move in general. I'm going to have to give this game a thumbs down for now. If it ever gets better, ill take a look at it again and change it if I decide it deserves to be changed.","May 16","false","3.2"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","15","28","4","0"

I played a bit of Dead Island: Epidemic, and I think I like this one more just because of the depth in gameplay mechanics (DI: Epidemic is definitely a lot easier to jump into right away).\n\nIf you like MOBA's, challenging gameplay, and demonic/dark themes, then you will definitely enjoy Deadbreed.\n\nThe aesthetics are very, very good. I was so surprised when I realized every piece of equipment you buy in-game is actually visible on your character. League of Legends and Smite were my two main MOBA's of choice, and neither had that kind of aesthetic mechanic. The music and sounds are pretty good too, and they work well with creating a grim, dark atmosphere for the player.\n\nThe controls are not too difficult if you are familiar with MOBA's, however, there are times when it may feel unresponsive and messy (keep in mind this game is still a long work in-progress). The learning curve may be somewhere between moderate to fairly difficult if you are not used to this style of gaming - there are a few new mechanics that allow for deeper gameplay than MOBA's like League of Legends.\n\nGrinding is reasonable, nowhere as slow/long as Dead Island: Epidemic's (sorry to compare, but that game is still pretty fresh in my mind and they are both currently in early access). In order to fully experience the game - in particular, the highest-tier equipment - you will need to farm a large number of resources by playing many games. There are artifact equipment (weapons and armor), and each item is a considerably stronger upgrade from its previous tier.\n\nDuring gameplay, you will be doing either 1vs1, 2vs2, or 3vs3, spread over 2 lanes (top and bottom, going left-to-right). I strongly recommend you try out practice mode with bots just to get a feel for the gameplay. There are 3 different types of drops you can pickup - yellow nectar, blue, and red (forgot the names). The red drop will always be in the middle of the map, while the yellow nectars will be in fixed points in a circle around the middle of the map. For the blue drops, enemies will periodically drop them as they die. The primary function of these 3 drops is to beef up your artifact items (which grant them bonuses AND carry over through subsequent games), however, you will be using these for more basic things in the beginning - at least until you play enough to unlock your first artifact.\n\nThe red drops can be used to summon a troll (the summoning stone is located in the center of the map, on the top lane). After placing the red orb, the troll will appear in a cutscene after 30 seconds. The troll is primarily neutral, however, you can issue commands like follow and guard to it (thus far it seems a bit unreliable). Be warned, you should make sure you have at least 1 nectar in your possession so the troll does not decide to attack you on sight - in fact, having more than 1 nectar may be advised.\n\nThe yellow nectars will initially be used as a repel for the troll. The blue orbs are extremely useful because you can spend them to decrease your respawn time (which is already very reasonable).\n\nThe item selection is fantastic, however, it certainly needs A LOT of work. The menu and screen for the store is small and very, very annoying to navigate through (especially if you are used to playing other MOBA's). The tabs for the inventory are very small, and it is hard to scroll through to find the item you want. A nice feature during the preloadout is the 10 seconds you are given to select your equipment before the match starts (if you want that head start). While in the store, you can see your character standing and how each equipment piece will look. Numbers on your avatar represent which equipment slot will be used (ex: "5" for shoulder armor). Currently, the information given for each equipment piece is short and simple - no lore if you were looking for that. The overall feedback for the game (ex: character info bars) needs lots of work, but can only get better from here.\n\nJungling (deviating from the "lane" to fight neutral monsters so your partners get more experience since you won't have to share) is very, very refreshing in this game. To jungle, there are 3 dungeons that you have to enter (the one in the center being the most difficult). After defeating enemy mobs in each area (the dungeons are small), there is a chest at the end that gives you some extra gold. I really like this method for jungling because you can't see what's happening outside, making team communication even more critical to success. Waiting outside (or even rushing in) to ambush a jungler is so very fun and satisfying.\n\nThere are only 2 towers to destroy, one on each lane, then you must destroy a seal on the enemy's door. After that, you enter a room where the enemy's sentinel (similar to the guardians in Smite, but these bosses do not move to chase you) will appear in a cutscene and fight you. This seems to still be clunky, as archers can dodge many of the bosses attacks if you space yourself properly.\n\nThere is also a day/night cycle that is really cool - line of sight decreases considerably when it is night. Furthermore, different characters have slightly better stats depending on which part of the day/night cycle they are aligned with. This adds to your strategy for determining when is the proper time become more aggressive/defensive.\n\nThe game plays very well for an alpha, and you should definitely give it a chance (or at least keep an eye on it) if you are interested in MOBA's.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\n","July 28, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The update fixed most crucial bugs and so on and updated the interface, graphics and gameplay to pure awesomeness in my opinion.\n\nThis review is coming from a person who has played MOBAs for about 4 years.\nFirst, I'd like to address the good and bad sides of this game, then tell about the gameplay.\nPros:\nEpic music\nNice graphics\nInnovative and good design ideas\nUnique features\nGreat illustrations\n\nCons (Remember that this game is Early access):\nGlitchy at times (but only sometimes)\nSmall playerbase\nBuggy sometimes (only sometimes)\nNeeds a slight bit of work (Inconsistent hitboxes etc.)\nKinda stupid AI (bots just go forward and hit whatever they encounter and don't stop until it's dead pretty much, although it has been improved.)\nThe game may crash sometimes but it's rather rare\n\nAnd now, the gameplay: Deadbreed is pretty much like your normal MOBA, if you have played League of Legends' Twisted Treeline-map, this game's map is very similar to that one: two lanes and a "jungle" area in between of them. (a new map came out in the update I previously mentioned, it is similar in core gameplay as the 'normal' map but there's a quest to it: there's a sword in the middle of the map that you can obtain to gain special powers, otherwise the goals are the same)(EDIT TO PREVIOUS STATEMENT: that new gamemode is in the works but it hasn't come out yet.)  There are no neutral monsters like in LoL or Dota 2, instead there are dungeons in which there are neutral monsters that attack you automatically. There are also a few minibosses in the dungeons. The core gameplay is the same as in LoL and Dota though. You have to destroy the enemy's towers and then their Crux (a door). Behind that door is the boss that you have to defeat in order to win the game. This boss is much like LoL's Baron or Dota's Roshan. If neither team has defeated the enemy-sides boss when 25 minutes have passed, the team with most points will win. The bossfights were made very very intense and fun in the update that came 15.11.2014. You get points from kills, towers, neutrals and resources found around the map that are used to boost specific abilities and to summon special units.\nThe major unique feature in Deadbreed is the itemization: all items that you put on your Hero, are visible in game. The games  menus and HUD are a bit wonky though. Also there are some more powerful items that you can buy with the in-game currency (not real money). These items often come with an ability of their own, like temporary flight and so on. With the in-game items you can build you Hero to whatever you want. For example: 'I have this mage Hero, but I really want to play a fighter.' No problem! You can just equip that mage with fighter items so it becomes melee. (Heroes don't have a predetermined attack-range, it depends on your equipped weapon.) Also there are preset roles that you can equip before a match, so you will be equipped with a certain roles items, like if you pick the mage-set you get a hood, a bit of armor and a spellbook.\nAll-in-all, Deadbreed is just pretty amazing and if you're a fan of MOBAs, and want to try one with some fresh gameplay-mechanics, why not this one? It's free after all. :D\nUsually your reaction to this game is either "It sucks!", "It's awesome!" or "Meh".\n\nI'll give Deadbreed 9/10=pretty amazing.","August 11, 2014","true","59.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mezugon/recommended/277950/","mezugon","Mezugon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mezugon/","87 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDeadbreed is a moba that has dungeons and really cool breeds (champions) as well as really cool base bosses. Now in a usual moba you're destroying their base's power source but in this game you kill a huge demon monster (at the moment there is only one). Breeds are also pretty unique in this game as in their abilities grow stonger with one of or more of these pick ups, these picks up are Spirits which you get from killing minions, breeds, or dungeon creeps, Blood which spawns in the middle of a map next to a tree, or Nectar which spawns in three places, next to your base, at the vary bottom of the map, and next to the enemy's base. About the enemy's base, where they (the enemy) spawn they don't have an in base turret so you can just walts right in and take their flag, I'll get to that in a moment. There may not be a tutorial but you can also go into practice mode to look at the shop and experiment with w/e you want.\n\nThe dungeons in this game are what you'd see in a flash game on newgrounds which isn't a bad thing. There are three dungeons in the Graveyard map (the only one at the moment) Your base's dungeon, the middle dungeon which alternates between a crypt of skeletons or a lair of spiders, and the enemy's base's dungeon. Each dungeon has a boss, your dungeon and the enemy's dungeon both have goblins in them while the middle one has either skeletons or spiders. Also each dungeon has chests in them, yours and theirs (the enemy's) dungeon both have three chests in them while the middle one for both kinds of monsters have five chests. Depending on which kind of chest it is results in the amount of loot you get. Small chests drop 50-60 gold pieces and have a chance to drop keys and copper coins. The medium chest has a chance to drop 80-150 (I think) gold pieces and keys and copper coins, some times you can get two keys and two drops of copper coins.\n\nNow there are three types of keys, bronze, silver, and gold. They can unlock artifacts or breeds depending on which key you use. Bronze keys unlocks an item one match, silver keys unlocks an item for one day, and the gold key unlocks an item for one week. Its a good way not to get burned on a purchase. For the coins you earn the copper coins you get are from completing matchs and daily quests and silver coins are acquirable by spending real money.\n\nThere are also two ways to win in this game, either winning by points when the time runs out or killing their Sentinel (The big bad demon monster). You can earn points by killing enemy players, collecting nectar and blood, and by grabbing the enemy's flag and burning it at your base's forge.\n\nOhhhh goodie my favoirte part about this game. In the in game store (not inside a match) there are these powerful armor pieces and weapons you can buy with either real money(Silver coins), copper coins or unlocking with keys. Each artifact can hold one spirit, blood, or nectar. Spirit adds health, Blood adds attack damage, and Nectar adds power damage. These "gems" lets call it, will level up with each win. Artifacts can also be leveled up while in a match to add more w/e it has/does.\n\nComing to my conclusion Deadbreed is a worth while buy, sure it has its bugs but what online game doesn't? If you don't like it that's fine but you should leave a comment on the forums of why you didn't like it and maybe they'll improve on that.","July 8, 2014","true","29.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

This MOBA has the capabilities of being something far greater than any MOBA anybody has played, and I am extremely excited to see where it goes.  With Unique Mechanics such as the Banners, Nectar/Spirit/Blood, Dungeons, and Boss Fights, it gives players a unique feel to what once was just a tower rush.  Yes, you can play just like your Standard MOBAs, shoving the lane to the home base, destroying it, and gaining victory, but that would just scratch the surface of this MOBA.  I could write all the great things about the game in this review, but it's easier if you either find someone on Youtube who has made videos on this game, or someone who is streaming it on Twitch (which there are a few people who are doing so.)  That, or just play the game yourself.  Only warning though, it's still an Early Access game, which means that sometimes, abilities don't work right just yet, or sometimes, your characters won't be animated when they move.  However, I still recommend this game to any MOBA lover out there.","October 17, 2014","true","43.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

You would really appreciate the design : simple but effective. Characters are really nice and create with some specifications that make them attractive and beautyfull. The battle part is really interresting, you would really enjoy donjons, being able to summon the troll, capture the flag. This innovative way to play a MOBA will be appreciate by the large majority of gamers.\n\nI expect for the futur :I'm still wondering for more maps. Only a graveyard with two paths, three nectars and a blood generate only one kind of way to play...\n> Why not create map with more paths, more blood, maybe less nectar, and then create a new way to fight and playing with other strategy!\na 3vs3vs3 battle.\n> THAT would be really innovative! Until this kind of game, you've got MOBA beetween some others, this kind of map would make deadbreed unique and awesome!\nSee all the gods in game and be able to see their differences, their influence in game.\n> The actual God (Behemot) is to easy to fight, don't make damages if you are not too close of him...\nI dislike: really regret that you cannot use the chat and your menu at the same time.\n> Why not create a windows which can be reduce... Because at the moment if you want to launch a game, you have to disconnect from the chat and lost all your discussion.\n> Secondly: is there a way to change the writting color ... That would be great!\nBut okay: that's currently not your priority. But this details make the game less attractive.\nthe lake of player for the battle: Having a 2x2 or 3x3 game is the hardest part of the game... what a sad story bro!\n> BUT i guess that will be okay with time... Hope ...\nthe customisation of your character is really limited ( & that's supposed to be a major point/ argument of the game) disappointed me. your objects are really limited: i mean: there is a lot of different appearance, okay, but if you play as a mage/ tank/ ... you have not that lot of choice!\n> Why not customize your character like his skin, clothes (just color for ex.), without this customization influencing the game\nI like  Gamers are really nice, friendly, ...\nYou can improve your hero ability, and your artifact ability.\nThere so many way to improve your score, then so many strategy can be use. (flag capture, donjons, Killing hero, ...)\nThis game is really not a Pay to Win, cause the only thing needing real money is your insignia which doesn't influence your game! BUT pay can help you to acquire characters/ objects faster\nMenu is really easy to use, and to understand (especially if your english skill isn't that good ... like me)\nCharacters are really nice, expected more coming soon (currently only one real tanker ... a second would be great) Battle really enjoying, with some strategy, ...\n\nCi-joint la même évaluation mais en Français:\n\nCe que j'en pensesDe manière général, ce jeu est vraiment prometteur, Il y a encore plusieurs choses à regler et developper. MAIS pour le moment, il est déjà assez impress]onnant. Vous devriez apprécier le design: simple mais efficace. Les personnages sont vraiment bien faits et magnifiques avec des caractéristiques qui les rendent attrayant et assez agréable. La artie combat est vraiment intérressante, vous devriez aimer les donjons, l'invocation du troll et la capture de drapeau. Ceci, est selon moi, une manière assez innovante de jouer a un bon MOBA et devrait convenir à une grande majorité de joueurs.\n\nCe que j'attends pour le futur :J'attends toujours plus de terrains. seulement un cimetière avec deux voies, trois nectars, et une goutte de sang n'amène qu'une manière de jouer.\n> Pourquoi ne pas créer des terrains avec plus de voies, plus de sang et peut être moins de nectar, cela permettrait de crer de nouvelles manières d'envisager le jeu et les stratégies.\ndes  combats 3vs3vs3 .\n> CECI serrait vraiment innovateur! Une fois que ce jeu se sera doter de ce genre de combat, il ne sera plus un MOBA parmis d'autres, mais quelque chose d'unique et sans doute assez impressionnant!\nJ'aimerais voir tout les deux en jeux et voir les différences qu'ils amènent en jeu.\n> Le dieu actuel (Behemot) est vraiment trop facile a battre. Et ne fait pas de dommages si vous n'êtes pas trop prêt de lui...\nJe n'aime pas: je regrette vraiment qu'il soit  impossible d'utiliser le chat and le menu en même temps.\n> Pourquoi ne pas créer une fenetre de chat qui peut êtrereduite ... Parce que pour le moment si on veut pouvoir lancer un jeu, il faut se deconnecter du chat et ainsi perdre toute la discussion...\n> Deuxièmement: y a t'il un moyen de changer la couleur de l'écriture? ça serrait pas mal!\nBon, ok: c'est actuellement pas la priorité. Mais ces petitsd étails rendent le jeu moins attrayant....\nle  manque de joueurs  pour les combats: recruter 4 ou 6 houeurs est la partie la plus difficile du jeu... C'est tout de même dommage les gars, non!?\n> Mais j'imagine que ça se réglera avec le temps ... enfin, j'espere...\nla customisation des personnages est assez limitée ( & c'est sensé être un point majeur du jeu!!!) sincérement, ça me déçoit. les objets sont sont vraiment limités, je veux dire: il y a différentes appareances, oui, mais si vous jouez un mage. un tank / ... vous n'avez pas autant de choix qu'il n'y parait!\n> Pourquoi ne pas personnaliser son personnage comme par exemple : sa peau/ ses vetements (même juste sa couleur) ... sans que cela n'influe sur le jeu\nJ'aime  Les joueurs sont vraiment  sympas, amicaux, ...\nvus pouvez améliorer les capacités de votre personnage, et de vos artefacts\nil y a aussi  différentes manière de gagner des points et augmenter votre score, donc, plusieurs stratégies peuvent etre devellopées et utilisées. (capture de drapeaux, donjons, tuer les autres héros, ...)\nCe jeu n'est pas un  Pay to Win, la seule chose nécessitant de l'argent "reel" c'est les "insigna" lesquelles n'influent pas sur le jeu. MAIS payer permet d'acquerir plus rapidement des personnages/ ou des objets.\nLe menu est vraiment facile d'utilisation, compréhensible ( notamment si comme moi vous n'êtes pas doué en anglais! )\nles personnages sont vraiment bien, j'en espère plus dans l'avenir (notamment un autre tanker, parce que pour le moment il n'en existe qu'un seul...) Les combats sont dynamiques, sympas, ... fluides, ... bref on s'amuse.","August 26, 2014","true","42.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Don't get me wrong but it seems this game is souless and doesn't provide long-lasting enjoyment. I was curious about this game cause it had some interesting character design but when the game released it nothing what i had expected.\n\nGAMEPLAY : 4/10\n\nUnlike some MOBA games that have 5 vs 5,this game only provides 3 vs 3 which baffles me why did they go with this design choices. In my opinion,the less player they are,the less fun and chaotic it gets.\n\nTo those who is a hardcore of MOBA fan,this game is an easy,pick & go. However to those who are new to MOBA games may struggle because this game doesn't provide any tutorial on how to play the game. You will be wondering what the hell am i doing and what item i going to purchase.\n\nOnce you picked your guardian and your breed,you are given an amount of time to buy your equipment before the game start. Why not just let you buy your equipment after the game start ??? Such a incompetent and horrid design choices.\n\nI suggest you play with online player and not with AI. Why ? Because the AI is braindead !!!! Each AI don't have their own pathfinding and they just charge straight to a tower like a raging idiot even though there is no minion to help the Breed ( known as Hero or Champion ). The tower is design to shoot all the minion first then the breed last which is a bad design choice when the breed have a powerful items which can utterly destroy the tower in a second.\n\nYou basically have two towers,one crux which guards the behemot. If they manage to destroy your crux and killed your behemot then it game over for you.\n\nEach breed have their own skills & spells but it no fun to use and just rather spam the right-click button instead.\n\nOh did i not mentioned that the higher levels you are,the stronger your breed get ? Yup,as each level up you gained,you receive an rank points which able to let you upgrade your breed and artifacts. Why do they think it a good idea it just make me shake my head even more. Basically low level players will struggle against high level players.\n\nAnd also you are force to choose only one breed and the rest you need to unlock. If i am not mistaken there isn't even have breed rotation so you are stuck to that one breed until you have enough gold to purchase another one. Take note that each match gained you 100 gold point and you need 4k+ gold points to unlock a breed. Really grindfest.\n\nGRAPHICS : 3.5/10\n\nThe graphics in this game is bad. You can't configure your graphics settings because their isn't any options apart from vertical sync and resolution. Environment is extremely bland as well as the character when it is zoom out. The particles is just bad looking too.\n\nDon't get me started on the animations. Each breed doesn't have their own unique death animations and they all share the same death animations. The walking animations is ok but the attacking animations is just laughable especially the behemot.\n\nThey also rip-off the day & night transitions from Dota but it extremely poorly done.\n\nOnly one things i like is that whatever equipment you buy it will actually show on your characters but that about it.\n\nAUDIO : 4/10\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is just meh. Each of the breed voice felt like they wanted to sleep and don't felt like a bad-@ss. It applies to the same as the announcer voice. The sounds of the spells & skills is average at best.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 3/10\n\nLong-lasting appeal for this game ?? Hah,there isn't any at all. Not at least for this early access version. You will be playing the same things with the same breed over & over again. I already get bored playing 2 match and don't want to touch this game anymore.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 3.6/10\n\nStay far away from this game. If you don't believe me what i have type in my review then go try it yourself. The game is an extreme borefest and just a lame attempt cash-off from a MOBA genre. I know from this start this game is going to be a generic MOBA games despite it interesting character design. Even though i don't speak for all,there is some MOBA fan that understand this games is just another lame MOBA games.\n\nGRADE : U ( Catastrophe )","July 25, 2014","false","0.8"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pissflake/recommended/277950/","Pissflake","Razzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pissflake/","200 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI think this game has great potential, but for now still needs work (of course it's still an early access beta).  Despite being a MOBA, it plays differently than League of Legends or Dota 2, which is refreshing considering there are games out there that copy that format.  However, it could use a tutorial and a more user-friendly interface, as trying to figure out everything by yourself is a little exhausting.  A description for each character in the lobby area would be helpful, as sometimes I don't know what kind of character each is until I start playing.\nThe items in the shop are all in a long list so it's hard to look at them all and compare to see which you should get.  Also it's difficult at first figuring out how to buy and sell items (e.g. you can't buy a two slot item if you already have one of those slots full).  The slot system is neat, however, as well as all the equipped items showing on your character.  It does add a nice touch.\n\nSome other things are still a little rough, like some blank animations for certain attacks (like Cinder attacking with a staff or some of the troll's animations), and some of the voices could use work.\n\nAnother point that I think most everyone else has already addressed is that it's very difficult to find other players...I spent 5 minutes waiting in the queue and found not a single person, so I decided to just mess around in practice matches, which still level up your profile fortunately.  It would be nice if the prices were slightly lower on some items, as they seem unattainable without grinding for several hours.  Perhaps a few more starting characters would be good as well (one for each class/play style?), each with a backstory and a unique personality.\n\nThe graphics and the character designs are all very nice, and I wonder if the developers will add customizable appearances (such as the "skins" in LoL) later (cosmetic changes, not the in-game armor/weapon equipping).\n\nOverall, it's an interesting little game, and hopefully everything will be smoothed out before the release.\n\n-Sandi","August 18, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is Unique, fast paced, and an absoloutely beautiful game. the creators put a lot of work into it, and it shows.\nit truely is a spooky themed game. every breed seem's valid throught all stages of the game, all roles have their use, and i absoloutely adore how the diety's work. the artifact system is so unique it's one of the things that drove me to sign up for the game. the breed's feel unique, and look the part to. the dungeon's are entertaining to dive into and take the loot to upgrade yourself with, and wearing items is the coolest thing i have ever seen in a moba. but, along with the good, also comes bad. time to get into the darker side of this game. the movement does not feel very fluid, and the combat can become very one sided, pretty early on. some heroes are slightly unbalanced, as i find corpus to be a little silly when he get's a bow artifact. it requires 2 or more people to kill one person as a general rule, sometimes 3, and the fact that corpus can solo just about anyone except tanks is very rediculous. and since you have to buy, or save up coins to unlock new breeds, some people can't counter him. ranged is FAR to powerful compared to melee. either buff melee or debuff ranged, the unbalance between the two is rediculous. some breeds abilities feel like they don't have any real use, or are just to much of a pain to cast. for example, Nekros's ultimate reanimates anything you killed to fight by your side. but it is point target, and you cannot select corpses and they despawn very fast. it is such a painful ability to use i have given up on his ultimate completely and just spam his E. and Nekros is just an example, there are more examples. next, some skillshot abilities feel like they do not have enough impact. surem, they deal fair damage, but late game they are pointless as the damage can be outweighed by a couple of right clicks, and the cast time is not worth it. there is no real hotkey customization, and you cannot traverse the map with the arrow keys, a feature i find a staple in most MOBA's. now, the resource system is VERY unique, but it is a bit of a pain. having to wander around the map can be bothersome at times, and there is only one bloodstone that respawns slowly. the crux should have more HP, as it can easily be solo'd which beats the point of it being a team game. the artifacts have to be bought like heroes, or save up to get, which i find stupid. sure, you can use keys to unlock them for one game, a day, or even a week, but not all are able to be so, and having to pay for the right to buy an over powered item in game is rediculous. it just adds to the unbalanced nature the game can have at times. now, i still love playing this game, despite all it's flaws, and believe me, it has many flaws. but these can all be fixed, and quite easily might i add by a bit of balancing. maybe decrease attack speed of ranged, or decrease damage. make skillshots more powerful, make corpses targetable... add hotkey support... the beauty of the game is that it is still in development. and if it were not, i would probably rate it poorly from a reviewers standpoint, even though i do enjoy it. but i see so much potential in this game that it i can't wait to see the finished product. i suggest you pick this game up, as i am sure you will have as much fun as i will. thank you for reading my review.","December 17, 2014","true","3.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","4"

They are actually trying to do something new here and even though I feel like there are quite a few fixes that need implemented I *must* recommend this to people who want a fresh take on the genre and not just another Dota clone. It is worth trying out just to see that there is potential out there in a watered-down, mobile-port-filled sea of boring.\n\nThe atmosphere and art style are very nice, the game has a lot of good things going for it.

The game froze up on me when I selected my hero, so I have to wait for it to respond. Once it responded the game just tossed me in with no help as to which keys are used and no option to change them while in the test. Everything you clicked on your character yells "I haven't mastered that yet." Which can get annoying, I kept dying because it didn't teach me properly (but it sure knew how to show me the store) lol.

Has the potential to be downright awesome, but isn't yet.  Best bet is to wait for it to be F2P\n\nDon't take the Unrecommend at face value.  Deadbreed has handled pretty well for me.  Granted I don't have a huge amount of playtime.......  From what I have played thus far....DeadBreed appears to be trying to be LoL and Dota at the same time.  It has a Tower-Base-Core attack system that mimics LoL to the letter, the creep spawning as well as skill use is pretty spot on too.    And while I have never played a Dota...I have been told that the Day/Night cycle which empowers different heroes at different times, is right out of Dota's handbook.\n\nNow, multiple reviews trash this game as a clunky/laggy/bumpy etc. piece of crap.....but those can all be chalked up to the fact that this is an Early Access.  When I played I experienced minimal to irritating lag, and a couple animation bugs that soon fixed themselves....nowhere near game breaking.  My biggest issue was the fact that there is absolutely no way to check the control scheme.  Even though it handles like any other MOBA, I was fairly rusty and needed a while.  P gets you out of the shop window BTW.\n\nGOOD THINGS!!  (There are some)\n-DeadBreed handles fairly well considering its level of completion, and it shows tons of promise.\n-The heroes look fresh to me, some of them don't quite hit the grim/dark/spooky bullseye that DeadBreed appears to be aiming for but Yin and Yang right?  (I was thrown for a bit of a loop at first though as two of the heroes' name sare Nekros and Corpus....and I'm a bit of a Warframe nut.)\n-The ability to buy gear before the match has started is really nice.  One thing I found difficult about LoL was that I needed to do things to get money to buy a weapon to be able to do things.....Plus you can actually see the weapons and armor you equip.\n-Boss Fights......freakin boss fights.  And I'm not talking about Baron Nashor.  These guys are badass.  Killing them requires good gear a few players and some actual skill.  Plus, praying to them (fighting with them as your selected boss) makes them better!!!\n\n\nAll things considered...DeadBreed is far from perfect but has a definite chance of becoming awesome.  However Buying Early Access for a game that will be F2P is only for the hardcore..a mistake I made.","July 4, 2014","false","0.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

Unfortunately I still do not recommend it.\n\nThe biggest problems I feel are design decisions at this point and not neccessarily related to the state of the game.\n\nFirst of all the complexity of the game.  You have levels, you have  a gold resource and then you have three more, nectar, blood and I believe essence.  These are collected different ways (blood and nectar found on the map and the third by killing creeps).  The problem here is it's just a mess, you can fight over these limited resources, but there is a lot going on in the game already and I don't feel it adds in any way.  Furthermore these resources are used in different ways including some champion abilities which i might add, are not great to begin with.  One ability that requires nectar to use sets a flower on the map that acts as a mine, but it does not provide warding and all it does is damage someone who gets too close to it.  Really not that sweet for all the cost of using it.  Worse yet?  Abilities do not appear to scale.  This means abilities (like that mine I was talking about) is quickly useless.\n\nWinning a game requires defeating a boss monster but this monster has a ton of health and even a dominating team can expect to have to assault it multiple times to win, especially since it does not scale with the team size it is up against.  This completely removes the purpose of having 1v1, 2v2 matches when the boss monster takes for ever to kill in those cases.\n\nI wanted to like this game.  I liked the smaller team sizes and I liked the darker aesthetic.  The graphics and sound is nice too, but the actual game play is just over complicated and in ways that detract rather than add to the experience.\n\nIt is still alpha so certainly a lot can still change, but at this time it is looking less and less likely this game will end up being a competitor in the genre.","July 2, 2014","false","3.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

No free hero rotations im stuck playing as one garbage character named corpus and his skill set doesn't even reflect the way you should be able to play as him. He's a mage but his skill set is basically that of a melee character. His stun is horribly bugged. If you throw it one way it will go the complete opposite and probably miss. There is no Smartcast function so for ppl who tend to use Smartcasting like myself, good luck to you. Character's mana pools allow you to use abilities once maybe twice. I'm almost convinced Corpus doesn't have an ultimate cuz it did nothing when i activated it. (Ultimates are available at level 6 like the Moba standard.) If someone dives you under turret you half to get the last hit on them so if you get killed from a turret dive and your killer dies to turret they are not penalized in any way and you get nothing for it. The game looks great I'll give them that... but they really should fix all the bugged gameplay before they try making a landfill of problems pretty. Give me the ugliest looking game ever but as long as it plays well I won't mind. Maybe my standards are too high after playing Dota, LoL, Infinite Crisis, and Dawngate. I truly fear that this small team of developers may be wasting their time with their competition. I truly hope this game does well because it looks great if only it had the gameplay to match it. I may have been a bit harsh in my review but I truly do hope that this helps... I'll probably play this game periodically to see if it gets better but for now go play a free moba, cuz this one is not worth your time right now.","July 7, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","4"

This game is fairly unique with a lot of things, example the dungeons (gates you walk through to fight monsters in a confined area for gold and keys (keys can unlock things in game like champions, artifacts, etc.)like walking through a portal to another place) The game is definitely creepy themed, and if you love MOBAs i recommend this, because between the PVE (fighting monsters in "dungeons") and the PVP that goes on in the game, AND the epic end boss battles when you push the crux (a gate to your "Dungeon" AKA "Nexus" or "DIRE" When you enter the dungeon you fight a boss called a  "sentinel" which is picked by the team at the beginning of the game. AND the customizations make the game very enjoyable for people who are into the looks and such. Able to purchase ANYTHING in game with in game currency, AND there's a currency for real money. it's a great ton of fun. That is if you can get passed the few bugs here and there.

The controls were clunky but that's to be expected from indie developers. I'm sure later updates would fix that. So I kept playing. The AI was horrible, it was like a toddler was given a keyboard. But that's forgiveable too - single player was not the intent of this game. So I finished wrecking the bot and I tried my hand at pvp...\n\nIt took fifteen minutes in queue to find 5 other players to play with. And once the game started the true nature of the mechanics were revealed. Did you know if you shoot projectiles, and you move before the projectile fully gets to the target, it just vanishes and damage is never done? The players I played with were all brazilian so we could not communicate, but that's okay because you don't actually have to take towers or defeat the final team boss to win the game. You just have to run a flag back and forth. And since the rules aren't explained well nobody tried to stop you.\n\nAll in all a disappointing play. 1/10, would not play again.","March 15, 2015","false","1.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This game provides a relatively new form of customization as well as a darker more cultish theme to it which I personally like.

I hope I will have the opportunity to come back in a month or two and change it to a positive one.\n\nI mean, I like the game and will continue to play it occasionnaly in hopes it will change/evolve to another state but I can't guarantee this will happen.  Don't get me wrong, the game have a good parts and I will all describe them but the negative aspects counter-balance the positive.\n\nFirst, the pros.\n\n1 - Very good looking.  The game is beautiful and its atmosphere is awesome (gory, dark).  One the best aspect is that your equipment actually appear on your character which is a thing that don't happen in most (if not all) other MOBAs.\n\n2 - Multiple maps.  The game have three maps that offers different strategies which is a really good thing.  You can enter digeons to grab cash for your equipment and points for the team victory.\n\n3 - Fluidity.  Even on my computer-slug the game runs pretty fine for its good graphics.  The programmers have done a good job.\n\nNow, the cons.\n\n1 - Pay-to-win.  The game is not really free to play.  Of course, you can enter the game and play without spending money but you will lose a lot.  The model used is that you have to pay for almost everything ; from changing your staring gear, getting cool icons for your profile or particularly to get ''stars'' to boost your characters so you will be competitive with other players.  Many things can be bought with in-game cash (Characters, Artefacts) and you get some ''stars'' by leveling but the grinding is too slow and you will be stuck with one character and bad gear for a long time if you dont invest real cash.\n\n2 - The community is very toxic.  As I didn't paid any money yet, my characters are under-average and I'm always behind other players.  This have for effect that they think I do not play effectively.  The fact is that they have access to better gear and boosted character (which I don't) really makes them think I'm rather useless if compared to them.  I have been insulted, reported, left alone, etc... just because I can't be as good as a premium player.  You will also have to face totally overpowered opponents that will even follow you to your spawning area and kill you as you respawn (WTF??).\n\n3 - The battlefield view.  The game looks good but the visibility is cramped compared to other mobas (camera is too close to the character) and you are constanly moving the camera from all edges.  Targetting is also a problem and is not very efficient either you target friends, enemies, creeps or interactive objects.\n\n4 - The game lacks the best aspects of other MOBAs.  A community must be populous so you will find matches fast and you will find opponents of your skill.  Right now, the pay-to-win system is cramping the community to a small number (which is a really bad thing).  Balance is not to the rendez-vous and  MOBAs need to be balanced so a player cannot get an advantage because of his $$$ and its clearly not the case here.\n\nOverall... I would say that you should only play this game if you want to invest money or else you will just be left behind.  The game is basically good but Alas, as I said, it lacks in the most fundamental aspects of MOBAs : Balance.  I'd say that you should invest at least 50$ from start if you want to get efficient, have a few characters/artifacts so you can really have fun.\n\nIf the devs begin to hear the community they will maybe save the game but right now the game is almost unplayable for free players.  This will lead the game to its grave as the community will not expand and will stay too small.  Free players are the cornerstone of success (for reasons I have described up there).  Almost everyone will eventually pay but they need confidence their money will not be lost.\n\nVISUAL : 8/10\nSOUND : 6/10\nCONTROLS: 4/10\nBALANCE: 3/10\nDIFFICULTY: Variable: Easy if you pay, hard if you go free-to-play\nFUN: 4/10 (I guess its more fun to crush other players when overpowered rather than being crushed... but I don't know for sure).\n\nOVERALL: 5/10 (Poor)\n\nGive it a try, look at the options the game have to offer and make wise decisions with your starting investment.  The game is not THAT bad.  It just hides its true nature : Pay-to-win.","May 6","false","24.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Danso3000/recommended/277950/","Danso3000","Danso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Danso3000/","324 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI really didn't want to give this game a negative review, I'd been looking forward to it for a long time but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't dissappointed and have to be honest in my review. These packages themselves are very expensive. £5 for the game but if you want the game with a single character unlocked it's suddenly £15? Otherwise you have to use your keys to temporarily unlock someone to play (None of this is explained to you in-game btw). Any game that you must purchase, having cash shop items within as well tends to be seen as greedy, especially in a game where you HAVE to purchase characters and items to actually play. It becomes a pay-to-win and being able to earn in-game currency at a tediously slow rate, to purchase these item doesn't change that. The keys, for example, are a horrendous idea. You have your copper (Earned in game) and silver coins (Paid for) so why not leave it at that? The addition of bronze keys to unlock items for the next game only, or silver keys 24 hours or a gold key to unlock item use for a week, sucks. All items should be available for us to use anyway, these "uber" artifact items are a dumb idea anyway. It creates a number of problems:\n\n1) If you own a single artifact you wish to use and someone else buys it before you, you're out of luck. No artifacts for you. Only one of any artifact item can exist at any one time, in a game.\n\n2) If you wish to play multiple characters with their own builds, you're probably going to need to have a number of artifacts unlocked for them which require many more keys to unlock. Likewise if you are playing a mage and your mage artifact gets bought, then equip your Tanky artifact instead? Then your team tank may have needed that item and now (s)he can't purchase it.\n\n3) People who play this game enough will earn plenty of copper coins, buy all of the artifacts to unlock them (Around 10-20 games to earn enough, per item) and then they have no use for these keys anyway as it's all unlocked, so they're only a hinderence for new players who havn't purchased these artifacts yet, as it limits the amount of items they can buy in the ingame store. These players might have used their keys on unlocking breeds (Characters) to play as, so may only have a single (if any) artifact.\n\nThe game itself feels extremely tinny, yet clunky at the same time. Targeting enemies is a nightmare, with no real indication of who'm you're targeting and clicking directly on an enemy doesn't seem to work, it usually selects the enemy next door unless they're all spread far apart, so you end up having to click around the enemy until it finally targets the right one. A cluster of enemy mobs with a "breed" (Champ/Hero) in the middle of them can sometimes become completely untargetable through all of the mess. The enemy can also become blocked by the corpse of their dead ally so you can't click on them, the cursor is constantly highlighting and selecting the dead guy instead, it's extremely irritating. Abilities often go through the enemy without affecting them and when you select an ability, you should be able to cancel it with right click (move) instead of having to press escape every single time.\n\nCurrently the dungeons that exist upon the map are not worth the time. You can open the chests without killing the mobs that guard them, so you can literally speed run in and out with the gold. The amount of gold you earn is so negligable however that it's not even worth that. Speaking of worthless, the AI is horrendous, it doesn't even go back to heal up. They will just push and push endlessly until they die, even under monoliths (turrets). I know it's only a practice mode therefore not really meant to be challenging but, it's hardly practice when the enemy are literally trying to suicide. Hopefully that will be looked in to before release.\n\nThe game is actually made up of many other games! You have your standard 3vs3 moba, 2 lanes and a "jungle". Kill enemy players. Awesome. So far so good. Then there's this blood in the middle of the map, if you collect them and take them to troll (Super minions) spawn points, you spawn them and they push your lane for you, just like Seige mode in Smite. You might also notice that your team and the enemies team both have flags. Capture their flag and return it to your base to earn points. But what are these points? Well, at the top of the screen is a countdown timer (That's right, the game has a time limit) and at the end, the team with the highest score will win. Then the map has these little yellow/white glowy orbs known as "Nectar" to collect as they spawn every 2 minutes, to earn a point. It's essentially a pacman mini-game you have to play to keep ahead of the enemy team in points. "So if it's all about points, then why even bother pushng lanes?" Well, I'm glad you asked. Each team has a BOSS monster inside a door at the back of their spawn area. If you manage to push past their spawn area, bash down the door and kill their Boss, then you win the game regardless of points...\n\nSo, yeah. We actually have a: VS Team-3v3-Seige mode-pacman-CTF-dungeon-arena-kill the boss-tactical-time limited-point score based-multiplayer online battle arena. Wow, try saying that 5 times fast?\n\nThese are all cool game modes but, having them ALL in there just makes it a bit of a mess. There's never really a clear objective for your team to strive for. The game is extremely confusing for new players to grasp what the heck they should be doing and the lack of tutorial/tips doesn't help. The point scoring to win system needs removing entirely, 1v1/2v2 League of Legends showed that having a score to win doesn't sit well in moba style game. It's not fun. If you insist on having a time limit then why not have it simply set so that the team with the most kills wins? It's straight forward and makes sense, it works, people understand that right away and will try to die less, rather than say "Yolo we haz more points LEROY JENKINS".\n\nI do love the fact that any character can equip any item to presume any role however this still lacks a very important feature, the ability to assign your stat points upon levelling, wherever you wish. If you want to take a character that's primarily an assassin, but play him as a tank (for the lols) then you should be able to level him up as a tank. By excluding this option, you're not actually getting anymore freedom and characters are stuck with their pre-defined role. You end up being that "noob" who's buying only tanky items for an assassin and getting outplayed by the enemy team's Tank, who is an actual tank. This makes it no different to any other moba, except that you can physically see the items you equip on your character. It would have been great to be able to play any role you like with your character, to have no idea which character is what class, unless you look at what items they have equipped. It's an opportunity lost, right there.\n\nThe most important factor here I believe is actually the level of fun that you are having with a game. I can endlessly sit and play Dota2/league, an entire day could go by and I'm still not bored of those same maps. This game though, I lost interest pretty quickly and it soon became what felt like a bit of a chore, as opposed to a form of entertainment. Right now, I don't think I can put up with another game, not for a little while atleast.\n\nI understand that this is early access and technically a WIP but I am doubtful that the amount that needs altering here to make this game become the next big thing, is achievable before release. The game is already in Beta stage and thus it should technically be coming to an end of it's early-access. It's because of this that I will unfortunately have to give it a non-reccomendation. The game has a lot of potential however, there is simply too much that needs to be done to this game before this becomes anything other than a "break" from league or dota that you'll quickly tire of.","July 18, 2014","false","5.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That being said, I will not review the game's mechanics.\n\nI will however mention that the game thus far is poorly optimized, so poorly that trying to start a match in anything other than 1v1 causes the game to crash. I am unable to play with anyone in 2v2 or above due to this crash, and trying 1v1 with another player seems to make the game highly unstable.\n\nSo far I have only been able to play 1v1 "practice" bot matches on the lowest possible settings while still keeping my native resolution.\n\nFor clarification, my system specs are:\n\nWindows 7 Professional 64-bit, Sp 1\nIntel Core2 Duo CPU E8400 @ 3.00GHz\n4096MB RAM\nNVIDIA GeForce 9800 GTX+\n\nI understand my system is on the verge of minimum requirements, but the game needs to be better optimized to suit the requirements listed. I should be able to play 2v2 or 3v3 without crashing after breed selection.\n\nFor anyone with a system similar to mine, it would be best to wait for more optimization and crash fixes before investing time and money into Deadbreed.","May 18, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not a fan of how they implemented the coin shop into. You have copper coins, and silver coins. In order to buy any of the heroes, save for 1, you need to buy the with coins, thats kind of understandable(although you should have more than 1 unlocked) but the issue is with the amount of coins you need to unlock the. The good ones cost like 5400 copper coins, and you make very little per game you play. The hero customisation on the other hand is real cool. Finally a MOBA that lets you choose a hero AND customise is fighting class(Fighter, assassin, mage, tank).\nOverall, I wouldnt recommend it because of the coin shop, only 1 toon unlocked at start, only like 10 people to choose from, I think even less than that actually, and the lobby cant go full screen.","June 1, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

AND THEY WERE ALWAYS THE SAME 3 PLAYERS!!! Finally in the forth attemt it work but my partner just disconnect and i end up in a 2v1 forever...\n\nFinal thoughts : I seen this in countless multiplayer games that take on the "creepy/horror" theme as their core identity... they all suck at giving a great gameplay experience that stand on its own and they can actually be played properly. The only one that really made its name was Requiem : Memento Mori and in the end is not really an amazing MMO but i did play it quite a lot and i might play it again if ever redo it with a huge update. In the case of Deadbreed the only thing i actually like is the trailer... i like the idea, the aesthetic and i was hyped when i saw it but the execution is very poor, from the lobby up to the gameplay everything feels cluncky and not even worth trying. I would love to play this game instead of Heroes of the Storm... if this game has a gameplay and matchmaking on par with HotS.

The fact that it gives you the liberty to change your role during a match alone makes this the best gameplay feature i've ever seen in any game of the genre.\n\nPros:\n+ Incredible setting with a dark atmosphere.\n+ Your character's visual appearance changes according to the items you buy and the visuals of said items are great too.\n+ Versatility in gameplay. You're not locked into one role per hero and can change your play style even during the match itself.\n+ Seems rather balanced.\n+ Heroes are diversed and unique.\n+ GREAT graphics that don't weigh on your machine\n\nCons:\n- So few players it literally takes ages to find a match, assuming the server doesn't go down.\n- Matches have a "run down clock" thing, making the games locked at 30 minutes. After those 30 minutes the match ends and the team with the most points wins. This feature is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n- The toturial ♥♥♥♥ing sucks balls.\n- It's expensive as ♥♥♥♥ing hell.\n- Devs seem to not be working hard at fixing the problems the game has\n- Literally the worse AI i've EVER seen since i've played videogames (about 10 or so years)\n- Map is rather small, not too small but should be bigger.\n- The Queue for a match on this is long as ♥♥♥♥ and sometimes the game won't let you join a match after you've accepted it for some ♥♥♥♥ing reason.\n\n\nSo those were my 2 cents on the game. I decided that i will not recommend this game because of the lack of polishing on some of the game's most important things, like propper AI and better servers.\nI wish the studio behind the game were as large as valve or riot so that this game would get more players, it truly deserves atention. With more players comes more money, with more money comes more resources to fix the game.\nI hope some better devs pick up on this game in a few years, making it the game this should've been.","February 12","false","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

And even now Deadbreed is far better than majority of moba's.

Link, und zockt es lieber selbst an als auf andere Leute zu hören, denn jeder hat eine eigene Meinung.\nDavon mal abgesehen dass die meisten schlechten Reviews in der Steam Community nur entstehen weil die Leute das Game nicht lang genung zocken !","December 18, 2014","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A sleeker, cleaner interface would do a lot to make the game more appealing.  The in game armory is very confusing.  I don't see a mechanic to deny creeps, although I may have missed it.   In a few hours of playtime I did manage to get a lot of 'practice' games in.\n\nThis game needs a lot of work before it's ready.  The customization options for the character classes are interesting, and I like that mechanic, but again, it's not very intuitive.  Only being able to access one hero at the start of the game is definitely uncomfortable, and the mechanic which allows you to temporarily unlock them is not satisfying at all.\n\nGame developers that hold content hostage for money and still call the game 'free to play' are doing a disservice to gamers and this isn't a game element that should be rewarded.   I can't recommend this game as it is right now, but I truly hope it does become a game I can endorse in the future as it is unique and engaging as far as mobas go.\n\nI'd really like to see this game improve.","March 19, 2015","false","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The heros are pretty awesome, and all though it takes a bit of grinding on to get enough credits to buy them out right, they provide a fantastic way to rent the heros you want tell you have enough. You are able to use keys that you get from playing to rent the heros for a match, a day, or a week, which is much better then just having to use the standard heros tell you can afford them. The biggest problem I have noticed is after playing a few matches with the bots, I was ready to play a real pvp match, but never got the chance because it seemed I was the only on queued.

A fresh look at the MOBA genre. I do, of course, have suggestions for how to make the game better.\n\nAttack Move: Action Move does not function as "attack move". Sometimes it's difficult to target, especially when the camera is locked to your Breed and an attack move function would be beneficial to these scenarios. Another place I would see it being useful is for characters like Corpus and Cinder who have dash/teleport type abilities. It always feels like the character model has to reset before continuing to move or beginning to attack which wastes precious milliseconds. So, yeah, attack move.\n\nPricing: I get it, everyone needs to make their cash somehow. However, the pricing scheme for artifacts, skins, etc. feels a lot like League of Legends where everything is at least 5 dollars. Massive amount of content for a game that's only been out for 12 days. However, it's only been out 12 days. The player base is small and while the weekly keys are an amazing mechanic, it would be nice if pricing was toned down for now until you guys had a larger player base. It's hard to say "I'm going to spend the cash/the key on this artifact" when you know that for the next few weeks (at least) you're going to be waiting 10+ minutes per game.\n\nHit boxes: Need a larger hit box on all creeps. If my cursor isn't exactly on a model, and this is for both creeps and heros, I simply walk to the spot. This kind of ties into the attack move thing. You wouldn't need an attack move with larger hitboxes because it wouldn't be so dificult to actually hit things when you click on them rather than just running up next to it and chilling.\n\nBreed/Class select: We can see the breeds as people select them, but have to wait to load in and then use our knowledge of the meta to figure out what classes are going to be fighting. This makes it somewhat difficult to construct a functional team. Just a little dagger for the assassin class or an axe for the fighter class somewhere on the breed portrait would simplify the hell out of composing teams.\n\nOff-hand slotting: If I click on my off-hand and buy an item, I clearly want it in my off-hand. Whether or not I have anything in my "main" hand is irrelevant to me. This is the only aspect of the armory that has me kind of feeling "meh". I used some bronze keys for Malign and the lifesteal sabre and ended up not even getting to use them because I'm really particular about the look of my hero. I wanted Malign in the off-hand and had to sell it twice because it kept going into my main hand.\n\nFinally is balancing. All of the breeds I've played feel really good to play, but with someone like Cinder you just pick up the first Blood drop, the first nectar drop, and then proceed to outlevel everyone else playing the game. Of course I don't know ALL of the games mechanics as I just started playing yesterday, but there are some Breeds that, as a dedicated MOBA player, feel really scary to play. New game and all, so it's not that big of a deal, but there's potential for a veteran MOBA player to take serious advantage of certain Breeds/Classes and ruin the game for people who have never played a MOBA or aren't comfortable with the control scheme.\n\nAll in all there are some kinks that I personally feel can be worked out, but the game itself is beautiful, challenging, and most importantly, fresh. So you have to drop a few bucks to get the artifacts that really start opening up the game and the customization to you, but it really feels like a game with potential.\n\nI LOVE THE DUNGEONS. I LOVE THE BEHEMOTHS. I LOVE THE NIGHT/DAY MECHANIC AND HOW IT INTERACTS WITH YOUR BREED. I LOVE THE ARTIFACTS. I LOVE THE ARMORY.\n\nIf I had stars to give I'd give it a 9.5/10. But I'm not IGN.","April 26","true","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didn't play much but didn't find any bug, no bad designed controls or any other problems.\nIf you like league of legends or other similar games try this for a nice variation with a dark atmosphere and undead/mystical/demon characters.

It's kind of an odd mix of a lumpy Dota 2 + League hybrid that fails to really meet any valuable expectations one might have for a game of this caliber. I'm not saying don't buy it, I'm just saying if you really have to get in make sure you buy the cheapest pack for now as the game is far from ready to be in Beta. Combat is incredibly dim while not being as "spooky" as advertised.\n\nCreativity is the second name of the game. Do you equip this, that, spec into this or maybe the other one; lots of questions which is great! At the end of the day though the game itself just feels like a big waste of time that fails to really excite or wow the average player. Better luck in a few months when more content comes out!\n\nTl;dr: Check back in a month or two and maybe the game will have improved. Not going to judge any glitches as it's the first day it's been out.","July 1, 2014","false","2.9"," 30 of 62 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","30","62","0","3"

Yes it's quite well done.. each hero is unique, scary and dark in it's own way.\nFine combat music and sound effect. It's also quite well done. The enviroments are simple and easy to understand.\nTutorial lesson is needed! There are quite a few things that u need to learn from tutorial.\nIf u skip it like a DOTA Vetern. You are in a world of hurt very soon.\n\nThis game right now is quite heavy in the range of pay to win.\n\nThe base game is free.. but if you want to be successful and win all the time.. those payed dlc are must need.\n\nGold keys and other things can be unlocked by playing and winning but it's just so much simpler to pay and get better heros and items at start.. Quite unfair and will surely kill a lot fan base since 90% people are poor and stingy when there are cheaper alternative that's much more famous.\n\nI understand developer needs more money to develop the game but I really don't think making another MMO would be a good idea to start since market is quite focused on 2-3 famous one already.\n\nLike DOTA you do need a good team that know what they doing to win this and currently there are very few people in beta testing and it's hard to find a game.\n\nThe developer said they want to complete close beta by the end of feburary. I would encrouge them to at least remove half of the pay to win status at least and add more skins. Items and character are already cool and fun to use so you don't need to change any of that at least..\n\nWho knows maybe we will get more people to play from this review.. maybe the game will be a bigger success when it's out of BETA...\n\nCurrent rating is 7.5/10 but i would remove 3 points to 4.5 not recommend unless we can find more people to play this and cheaper dlc at least...\n\n","January 2","false","3.6"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","20","42","2","3"

The art style is pretty great and the gameplay is unique enough to stand out from the crowd, its not clone.  The game does however have a few glaring issues.  One the UI is just terrible. it reminded me of an early 2000's or even late 90's UI. It just needs work. the UI is ugly and inefficient.  The bigger problem however is there are so very few people playing it. It has a very small community from what I can tell. So if you just want to play at any given time chances are it will be with bots unless you get lucky and find a game.\n\nI would recommend Deadbreed to any MOBA fan to try, its not that bad and it needs more players.\n\n5/3/15","May 3, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

After 10hrs of playing i love the game. But there are some serious issues with ranked matches. There is no penalty for abandoning the queue, or character select. There seems to be a bot by the name of KILL4KILL that just keeps entering bot matches, says nothing and does nothing. So it times out the match queue and you have to restart. After 24 matches of me attempting to play and 40min of my time i cant recommend this game.

You can choose your role differently for each heroes. You can be fighter, assassin, mage or tank with only one hero.\n+ Also there are  dungeons  in game. Yes, when you fight your opponents you can go to dungeon for getting more gold, exp or  key . (which giving you chance for trying new heroes)\n+ You don't have to destroy enemy Ancient, Nexus , Crush or something else for finishing game. If you score more points before time ends you can still win. And there are several ways to do it ; gathering resources, carrying banners (Like capture the flag thing) , killing breeds.. But of course you can still finish it before time ends with killing  final boss which chosen with votes before match.\n\nCons\n-  Grind for nothing.  Every game giving you like 50 gold something and you have to make it 6k for unlocking heroes , items or maps.\n- Unbalanced heroes or Unbalanced matchmaking system or Unbalanced something.. You have to grind to get weapons which make you op, otherwise someone who had paid for it gona rekt you in late game.\n- Combats not realy smooth. I'm not realy sure about what is problem but it seems like lacenty. My ping was not that bad. It was around 80-100 so i can't be totaly sure about it. It reminds me Fb games made with flash.\n- Skills need more  detail and function. Stun, slow, knockback, maybe a little bit flashy aoe ulti.. but nothing more..\n\nAnyway, nothing seems realy unique or special for now..","April 15","false","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The devs became active and are fixing a lot of stuff. There is also a lot of new things to be implemented in the game soon and the breeds are getting reworked and balanced.\n\n\nUPDATE: There was a "big" update that should fix some issues. However it still takes too much time to find a game so i have not checked it out yet. It also took the devs way too much time to release this "big update" that is only 18mb and mainly consists of some bugfixes.\n\nI will try to keep this updated and check out the new patches, as this game could be a really good one.\n\nI cant recommentd this game, even though it has some good ideas. The main problem with this game is its development. 3 guys are doing the whole work: programming, design and community work, which is nearly nonexistant at the moment and makes improving of the game impossible.\nAlso there is a tank in this game that can onehot people with an aoe-dot and he doesnt even have to build any dmg-items to do so. All he has to do is stay on lane lasthit 20 creeps and collect their souls, which can be done rly quickly. His q-ability does 15(+ 2 per point put into this ability) dmg PER SOUL per second. that means that he does 500 dps+ lategame easily, while the strongest fighter/carry with an attackdamagesteroid and a full dmg build can crit a max of ~400.\nI m pretty sure the devs never played their own game seriously, as this tank only has to build defense and could still oneshot himself!?\nThere are other minor bugs, balance and gameplay issues, which may be fixed, but this instantly made me quit the game and i can tell for sure i wont ever come back, although i was rly rly hyped for this.\n\ntl;dr: good idea, nice graphics, slow devs, bad balance, no support, technical issues, update probably wont change much atm","July 18, 2014","false","73.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I don't really recommend it in it's current state, but it has a lot of potential and I don't want to make the recommendation statistic reflect poorly on the game.\n\nSome pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nThe game is very original. It has a much MUCH darker feel than other MOBA's, and it uses some interesting new ideas, such as an RPG-esque shop and new resources to use.\nThe game is pretty fun. The game has interesting characters that can play many roles.\nKEYS! This is a neat feature that, after logging in every day ([EDIT] week. You also earn keys in dungeons), you get some keys which lets you use an item for a short period of time (bronze allowing 1 match, silver for 1 day, and gold for 1 week). There still are permanent purchases with real/in-game money, of course. This is a good attempt to remove the P2P aspect.\nThe things that you do in-game affect you out of game. Doing dungeons get you keys (and in-game money, of course), putting blood in artifacts gives it permanent effects, and there are probably other featuers to be added.\nCons:\nSmall playerbase. Hardly anyone plays. This will change with time, of course.\nExtremely confusing. The tutorial is extremely basic, and the game adds a ton of unique elements it really doesn't explain at all. Why is axe 1 better than axe 2? What do all these resources do?\nTons of locked content. This is alleviated by keys greatly, but a ton of things are locked and it makes the game difficult to learn.\nStupid AI. The AI for everything is very very dumb. The AI heroes facetank creepwaves for lethal periods of time, the trolls have strange priorities, and the creeps are extremely aggresive to the player (they also do very high damage compared to dota or league)\nOverall, amazing game with fresh, new concepts, but it needs a ton of work.

Scrolling on the game area by moving the mouse? No keyboard for that...

Still relatively rough, but that's to be expected, seeing as it's a Early Access title. It has a lot of fun aspects (the "jungle" in this game a series of Diablo-esque dungeon crawls), and it's really cool to see your character's appearance change as you purchase items.

Sadly though those great new additions are overshadowed by to many problems currently with the game. With so many MOTA games out there available that are free there is no way a new comer like Deadbreed should list itself as free and yet implement so many restrictions and lock outs on content.\n\nIf Deadbreed would like to continue to have such restrictions in the game they are going to have to offer a larger pool of available things that are free to even build up a community base of players. The lack of people on is also hurting the game as trying to match make even a 3v3 game is taking a long time if ever even formed.

I must say the game looks great and the gameplay is pretty damn great too, combinig an RPG style with MOBA to remove some of that boring stuff I hate about LOL and others.\n\nHowever the game has one major flaw, lack of players, you will end up playing against the BOTS in Practice games instead of PVPing.\n\nPROS: Great visual looking, I love the fact that when you buy an item you actually see it equiped on your hero, that new weapons, that cape etc. You can select the hero style before games (Mage, Fighter, Assassin, Tank)  no need to actually own 10 heores as your one will do everything you need. Make sure you buy the ones you want. Again the models and graphics are best MOBA yet.\n\nCONS: Lack of maps, lack of heroes but see my pro point above, worst con is the lack of players, you can end up waiting 10 minutes without any luck, worst matchmaking in any MOBA as I can never get a mach, tried different times, after school, late night, weekends all with same result. Forced to play with BOTS which is very easy and boring like any MOBA vs BOTS.\n\nI will casually play it and see how it develops. I really hope it picks up and more players will be on, more features and extras.","June 13, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There were 3 Corpus in first match.\n-Long cooldown (20-30 secs) on spells, most of them does nothing useful.\n-You can upgrade the  ultimate skill at lvl 4 or 5, then you can upgrade it to max in the following levels. That was the only useful spell. (In LoL, ultimate skills are upgradeable at lvl 6-11-16).\n-I started a Skirmish match with bots on the loading screen but I played against other players.\n-There is not enough time to read the instructions in the beginning.\n-The only thing I used in the shop was the "Upgrade items", because I didn't know what to buy. There are no specific details about characters. My spell said dealing damage based on Ability Power although I dealt more damage with normal attack.\n-After 20 mins of match, the game stopped working and crashed! I wanted to log back to continue the match I started but there was no option to reconnect, plus the match was not visible anywhere in my history.\n-I got teammates and enemies with no experience at MOBAs at all... There should be first a match to measure skills.\n-I can't target correctly the enemies. It is more difficult to last hit.\n-I wanted to go down the stairs but my character moved the opposite way, straight into an enemy.\n-The movement of camera is also bad.\n\nPros: (not much)\n-Music\n-There is a side mission.

The first thing I noticed was how the characters skills transfer throughout ALL the weapons. Thats ok and all, but come on. It's obvious you want us to play a certain way. heres a simple idea. make the items you buy give you the skill set. (Like, a main weapon gives you all the skills, and a few stat buffs, and from there you upgrade everything else.) or somethign similar. don't stick us with pre-set characters, because that gives the entire game a very limited game-play feel. the next thing I found is that I have found ltierally no use for almost any of the yellow tear blood things, though the nromal blood is usefull, yellw and blue are so far almost completely useless. Another bit, the characters, I can see being locked untill you buy, but certain weapons? Thats kinda insane. you are basically telling us to pay to win. NOW, if you use my logic and make the weapons your skills, I can totally see the weapons being locked, and there being rarer ones, and all that. My thought unlocks a much larger ammount of potential and game style. Well, other than that, I did like the graphics and the darker scenery, just, the gameplay needs a major update. I hope you all use my thought on how it should be ran, and I feel if you do you guys will go a rediculously long way. keep going,  you are on a good path, just tilting a wrong way!","March 30, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

If you play this 10 hours in the entire time you own it you got your $ worth 1$ an hour is a pretty good trade, with that in mind proceed to the rest of the review.\n\nOK this game could be great and would be fun if they fix these things. IF THEY DON'T FIX the player base, and add a 5v5 mode/map, then I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.\n\nif you buy this game buy the standard for 9.99 and use the other 10$ for the ingame market you get 450 silver for like 3$ and for 10$ for the barebones ed you get 200 silver (not enought for a breed and most artifacts)\n\nGame devs a message to you, the customizing is why i and most others baught the game so keep it up, and if you realy want to make this a major MOBA heres a perfect way to make that happen (add a 5v5 no timer) inv people to your game instead of make people pay for it, then people wont complain about no one playing it (which is true). Great way to get the game out there would be to give some beta keys to your player and have them invite friends.\n\nThe abilities in the game currently i know its not final product and this would be one of the things done later the animations are kinda stale and not very knoticeable. The troll in my games has just walked past everyone and kiled itself on the tower, but it also has no cool down which them it can just be spammed by lilith.\n\n","November 4, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

In my Opinion the Game offers great Potential due to its uniqueness. Some will say "wait its a moba, bet a ripoff to get money" NO. Yes it has the concept of chosing a new Hero (Breed) every Match and you have 2 Lanes and Creeps and Towers BUT !! the Games Charactercustomization is so awesome. First: you can equip more then 2 Weapons and only if they are 1handed. You cant equip more then 1 Helmet and so on. Lets say you buy a Cloak/Cape and a Scythe, then your character wears this cloak and a scythe. Thats awesome, nice RPG Aspect + you can Customize them after each "Accountlevel" up. For example putting 1 point into "Force" increases the Breeds Power by 2%. And dont worry guys. The MM-System tries to match you with Ppl on your level so you dont have WOW AWESOME OVERPOWERED Breeds VS Tiny Breeds that feels like Creeps xddd","July 8, 2014","true","10.1"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

The ambient  is dark and intriguing\n\n2.  Characters are well built  in design artistically and in gameplay (which I'm referring to the skills that the characters use at least for early access.)\n\n3.  The shop  for items is very comfortable and easy to learn (It has a button of auto-equip so it automatically buys the ideal equipment for your character.)\n\n4. Has more than one possible way to achieve victory. (Which gives opportunity to the losing team to have a comeback, which I believe makes it challenging and awesome.)\n\n5. Lets you decide and test, with Keys that are given weekly, the few characters that are locked and can't be played unless you spend the in-game currency to buy them. Upon starting the game you are given one free character, that is the same for everyone.  But with the keys given to you, weekly and a certain amount at the beginning of the game by buying it, you can test a few locked characters for either: one match, one day, or one week until you purchase them with the in-game currency.\n\nThe Bad:\n1.  The game-play interaction:  the mouse pointer, the attacking, the movement of the characters are very inaccurate at times which makes sense now at least in early access but it just happens a few times throughout the game. Not all the time.\n\n2. Very  few characters  to play with (Which again makes sense for its Beta-phase)\n\n3.  The matchmaking  takes too much time for the obvious reason that not many people have it and those who do might not be playing it at the same time as you. Of course it can't be compared with "League of legends" or "DOTA 2" at least for now... But It CAN be compared to "Awesomenauts" matchmaking PVP system and the pricing.\n\nThe Ugly:\nPrice.\n\nYes... the price is hurting the games potential but I, as a person who has a job and can afford to invest on an early access game so it can grow to be what it is meant to be, bought it believing in its potential and its developers.

MOBA has to be repetitive. After hundreds of hours people should still have fun with it and not get bored.\nHere, people who played like 2-3 hours says that this game is good. But those are empty words. Those people did review months ago and didn't touch the game since. How to trust people who recommend the game after 3 hours of playing it and then abandon it (have in mind that it's MOBA - should promote endless gameplay)?\n\nThis game in current state is trash. Sorry to be mean, but that's true. With competition like LoL, DoTA, HoN/Strife, Smite, this game has no place on the martket.\nLaggy servers, "wooden" movement, terrible aiming (ever wondered why nobody use bow? just try aiming with it, you'll go into melee). Not many characters or maps.\nSome people may say "what this guy know, he played this game nearly nothing". So here it is.  I myself got about 2000h in LoL and  193h in DoTA2 so I have some exprience in Dota based MOBA.\nBut to the point, the game couldn't let me. 5 second delay on any action while 0.5s would be hardly acceptable.\nThat's some joke. Dev probably hosted this game on his machine from 2000. Instead I took a sneak peak on mechanics, champions, equipment, movements, controls and well, it's horrible.\n\nI just don't see anything that would say worth mentioning. Maybe that only masochists will enjoy it.\nMasochists with lot of free time to spent in lobby waiting for players, as servers are as dead as main theme of the game.","December 30, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What i personally like as well is that items you buy will show in game as an equiped weapon or armor, with obviously makes you look more badass, which is nice.\n\nThe biggest difference with regular moba's i think is that there is not really a jungle area, although it has dungeons, which can be done in game whilst your team hold lanes. It really shows a new few on the tactic building, and the moba genre as far as i've seen. This also shows in the endboss, where, in order to beat the enemy, you fight i big monster, instead of shooting down a structure. which is alsno a new, yet very nice touch in my opinion.\n\nAll that being said though there is something you should consider: the game is still in Alpha, which means you will find the occasional bugg and glitch, which is simply a part of the programming process im sure. If you can't look past that, i suggest waiting before getting this game, because once it's done, im sure any will have a good time playing this.","December 30, 2014","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Early access - still needs polishment. Complex pay and unlock model.\n\nDeadbreed establishes a dark atmosphere, and makes use of a day and night cycle. Apart from the last-hit money for buying items, it introduces three additional resources you can find on the map and minion kills. These can be used in conjunction with abilities or on the map.\nDungeons can be explored (including/mainly dungeon bosses). A capture the flag is in there as well.\nThe game using a count-down timer and if the enemy boss could not be beat the team with the most scores wins, is an interesting concept, making the time you will spend in a game much more predictable.\n\nThe Pay-Model is overly complex and thus confusing. There are three types of keys and two currencies. There are 5 or something types of stuff to buy or temporarily unlock - heroes, items, ranks, …\n\nThe game is early access, and you can see it’s not ready for prime time yet. Missing polishment in usability and understandability.\nThe main problem I see is that this very complex game has such a high learning gap on entry, that few people will actually want to invest into it when there are already Dota 2 and LoL, which people likely know, have friends playing, or can learn easier.\n\nI’m not really a top-down MOBA player, but control- and gameplay-wise, this is not worse then the others.

Doesnt play quite the same, Same concept, odd mechanics.\n\nOverall:\nIts a wonderfull game, hitting its first bumps in the road that it needs support to overcome, Write as negatively as you want, it has great potential.","January 5, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play it as you would play Warcraft 3 map DOTA or the game with same name. But Deadbreed gives you an intriguing opurtunity to go dungeons and clear them for more xp and gold and keys (I will mention them later on). This is still an early beta indie game and I give my full support for it. I will recommend this game to 5 of my friends to try it out and we shall play few games to see if it met their standards. Deadbreed has a BIG potential.\nTo win  the game you must either : Kill enemy dude ( I dont know how to describe) witch is esentaly a giant monster in far end of enemy dungeon. Or win by time expiration of 25minutes and the points counted to determinate winner.\nThe game gives you 3 kind of resources to collect during the fight : Spirit - use it for items that are in category of "totems" , Blood-get it from center of map or by killling enemy players and used to reinforce team by finding a skull and putting it in to summon a big creep in terms of stats and finally Nectar - activates "totems" (see bellow equipment)\nThe purchace system for opening new heroes is kinda uniqe and a bit of confusing. You can open new heroes by using silvers or coppers that you get for finishing the game. But! There is another way to open via keys. You get keys from clearing the above mentioned dungeons. Dont know how it works.\nThe thing that intrigues me is the equipment category. You can make your hero to be anything (mage,warrior,asassin) and the same hero will preform different ways depending the items you equip. You can equip special items that you buy with silver and copper for in game where they are called "totems" and you activate them with Nectar things during the battle.\nCurently you can play 1v1 2v2 or 3v3 PVP or practice matches so it seams that it aims to be a fast-paced MOBA,\n\nThe sad thing is that the developers are doing is to sell silver coins 2.50 euro for 450 silvers. Doing that in early beta isn't a smart move. A guy will pay 50euro and he will get 11000 coins to buy all heroes or "totems" so the new peopel will be overpowered with ease and will quit the game. I would recommend to turn it off for now. There is no community yet for the game to be greedy.","February 28, 2015","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s a newly formed studio but the founding members and the development crew have tons of experience in the gaming industry. Some of the Deadbreed developers have worked on Just Cause, famous open world action title. Long time RPG fan and MOBA enthusiast, Stefan Ljungqvist (one of the developers) decided to make Deadbreed after realizing there isn’t an action MOBA with in depth role playing character customization. Players want to create characters with unique play styles but also original looks so cosmetic options are on the features list too.\n\nTeam battles are the core gameplay feature. There are no single player campaigns or solo mode scenarios. Players group up in teams of maximum 3 members and fight in 3 vs. 3 matches. It’s possible to fight against a computer controlled team but the best Deadbreed experience comes from PvP encounters. Hero customization and progression are 2 RPG features that deserve a closer look. First of all, there are multiple hero classes to choose from. There are nightbreed and daybreed heroes but also a mix called halfbreed. Archer, warrior and wizard are the main Deadbreed class archetypes. All heroes have unique spells and play style that can be further customized by equipping different items. There are items that boost offensive abilities and damage and also items to enhance hero defense. Armor is worn on head, chest, legs and arms. Heroes wield class specific weapons such as bows, swords and maces. Deadbreed has a very rich weapon selection. There are items that increase movement speed and consumables to provide short term boosts. Deadbreed allows players to craft and use powerful items known as artifacts that can be upgraded with relic slots. Artifacts lose durability when playing matches.\n\nHero experience is won by playing Deadbreed matches. Heroes level up after they accumulated enough experience, each level unlock additional perks like crafting features or wearable items. Deadbreed is a free MMO with original match mechanics. At the end of each match, players have to fight a boss chosen by the Sentinels, an NPC Deadbreed faction. Players earn reputation with the Sentinels and gain their favors to receive all sorts of bonuses. Matches are normally fought between 2 teams of 3 players but there are some features to make things interesting. Players are able to summon creatures to fight by their side. Battlegrounds have dungeons and a PvP quest system. Deadbreed has a dark fantasy visual style and gloomy atmosphere.","March 11, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unique heroes, very unique objectives, a whole new take on mobas. Jungling is replaced with small dungeons, and there are resources other than gold to collect to help you scale. Also, the acient/nexus/main base objective to win is A BOSS FIGHT! Your team votes on the boss they want for their side before the match starts and the enemy does not know what it is until they get to it. Also, the heroes are customizable. Like an assassin but want to play it more magelike? you can do that! you can scal more toward Assassin, Mage, Fighter, or Tank. Your heroes also wear the items you buy in the shop during matches, so you change as the match progresses. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a unique yet fun moba. Worth a try. The only downside is that basically noone is online ever, hence this review to persuade people to play it! 10/10 for what is there so far. Only occassional minor bugs like pathing issues but those will be fixed as the game goes on. Give it a shot.","February 13, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This felt like a Diablo-style game that was could have been released as such but due to budget cuts, they decided to scam players of their cash by releasing it as a MOBA. Everything I see looks like it could have been Diablo but someone decided "Let's scam players by calling it a MOBA"\n\nPROS\n1. Trolls\nYou can summon a giant Troll that hunts down other enemy heroes by offering blood from a Blood Tree (you have to collect a drop of blood from a tree) to a Troll Stone in front of the Troll Cave. Trolls basicallly function like Super Creeps in Dota, high hit points and only 1 objective.\n\n2. Dungeons\nThere are dungeons that you can use to fight mini-bosses\n\n3. Sentinels\nThe final boss that you must kill is called a Sentinel which is a gigantic immobile Behemoth. Don't be fooled, it fights back similar to Mephisto in Diablo. There are other sentinels but I've only seen Baal. It is actually harder to end the game this way as the bosses heal every new day.\n\nCONS\n1. Pay to Play / Pay to Win\nYou have to use silver (cash currency) to buy bronze, silver or gold keys to unlock the character you want to play for 1 hour, 1 day or 7 days respectively. There is only one permanent hero, Corpus.\n\n2. Empty\nReally no one playing. You can't even get a Duo game.\n\n3. Spelling Errors\n"Aquire" instead of "Acquire"?\n\n4. Item Shop / Armoury\nHorrible interface. Some items are actually locked.\n\n5. No balance\nWith a stupid idea like using keys just to play, you will never be able to balance the characters.\n\n6. Nectar\nAnother silly idea, now you have to go around the map picking up "Nectar points" for unlocking Artifacts.\n\n7. Banners\nYou can steal your enemies' banner which is just outside his base, to bring back to your base and destroy. For?\n\n8. Barrels\nYou actually break barrels in this game to get +13, +17 gold. Worst, the gold falls on the floor so you have to actually walk over the gold to pick it up, else someone else could take it. Items costs hundreds to thousands of gold.\n\n9. Spell bugs\nCertain spells can't be cast or used near Monoliths (towers) or when they are no enemies around. You will see a white Area of Effect Circle and the spell picture but you can't use it on anything or anyone.","January 29, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s a newly formed studio but the founding members and the development crew have tons of experience in the gaming industry. Some of the Deadbreed developers have worked on Just Cause, famous open world action title. Long time RPG fan and MOBA enthusiast, Stefan Ljungqvist (one of the developers) decided to make Deadbreed after realizing there isn’t an action MOBA with in depth role playing character customization. Players want to create characters with unique play styles but also original looks so cosmetic options are on the features list too.\n\nTeam battles are the core gameplay feature. There are no single player campaigns or solo mode scenarios. Players group up in teams of maximum 3 members and fight in 3 vs. 3 matches. It’s possible to fight against a computer controlled team but the best Deadbreed experience comes from PvP encounters. Hero customization and progression are 2 RPG features that deserve a closer look. First of all, there are multiple hero classes to choose from. There are nightbreed and daybreed heroes but also a mix called halfbreed. Archer, warrior and wizard are the main Deadbreed class archetypes. All heroes have unique spells and play style that can be further customized by equipping different items. There are items that boost offensive abilities and damage and also items to enhance hero defense. Armor is worn on head, chest, legs and arms. Heroes wield class specific weapons such as bows, swords and maces. Deadbreed has a very rich weapon selection. There are items that increase movement speed and consumables to provide short term boosts. Deadbreed allows players to craft and use powerful items known as artifacts that can be upgraded with relic slots. Artifacts lose durability when playing matches.\n\nHero experience is won by playing Deadbreed matches. Heroes level up after they accumulated enough experience, each level unlock additional perks like crafting features or wearable items. Deadbreed is a free MMO with original match mechanics. At the end of each match, players have to fight a boss chosen by the Sentinels, an NPC Deadbreed faction. Players earn reputation with the Sentinels and gain their favors to receive all sorts of bonuses. Matches are normally fought between 2 teams of 3 players but there are some features to make things interesting. Players are able to summon creatures to fight by their side. Battlegrounds have dungeons and a PvP quest system. Deadbreed has a dark fantasy visual style and gloomy atmosphere.","March 11, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But its playable nothing the devs cant fix i believe. Deadbreed has so much potential and as a moba player i could see some epic battles taking place in this game if ppl give this game a chance. Not sure if this game has any community gathering players could be a good idea to have someone recruit players for more pvp games. Just saying.

What i personally like as well is that items you buy will show in game as an equiped weapon or armor, with obviously makes you look more badass, which is nice.\n\nThe biggest difference with regular moba's i think is that there is not really a jungle area, although it has dungeons, which can be done in game whilst your team hold lanes. It really shows a new few on the tactic building, and the moba genre as far as i've seen. This also shows in the endboss, where, in order to beat the enemy, you fight i big monster, instead of shooting down a structure. which is alsno a new, yet very nice touch in my opinion.\n\nAll that being said though there is something you should consider: the game is still in Alpha, which means you will find the occasional bugg and glitch, which is simply a part of the programming process im sure. If you can't look past that, i suggest waiting before getting this game, because once it's done, im sure any will have a good time playing this.","December 30, 2014","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This felt like a Diablo-style game that was could have been released as such but due to budget cuts, they decided to scam players of their cash by releasing it as a MOBA. Everything I see looks like it could have been Diablo but someone decided "Let's scam players by calling it a MOBA"\n\nPROS\n1. Trolls\nYou can summon a giant Troll that hunts down other enemy heroes by offering blood from a Blood Tree (you have to collect a drop of blood from a tree) to a Troll Stone in front of the Troll Cave. Trolls basicallly function like Super Creeps in Dota, high hit points and only 1 objective.\n\n2. Dungeons\nThere are dungeons that you can use to fight mini-bosses\n\n3. Sentinels\nThe final boss that you must kill is called a Sentinel which is a gigantic immobile Behemoth. Don't be fooled, it fights back similar to Mephisto in Diablo. There are other sentinels but I've only seen Baal. It is actually harder to end the game this way as the bosses heal every new day.\n\nCONS\n1. Pay to Play / Pay to Win\nYou have to use silver (cash currency) to buy bronze, silver or gold keys to unlock the character you want to play for 1 hour, 1 day or 7 days respectively. There is only one permanent hero, Corpus.\n\n2. Empty\nReally no one playing. You can't even get a Duo game.\n\n3. Spelling Errors\n"Aquire" instead of "Acquire"?\n\n4. Item Shop / Armoury\nHorrible interface. Some items are actually locked.\n\n5. No balance\nWith a stupid idea like using keys just to play, you will never be able to balance the characters.\n\n6. Nectar\nAnother silly idea, now you have to go around the map picking up "Nectar points" for unlocking Artifacts.\n\n7. Banners\nYou can steal your enemies' banner which is just outside his base, to bring back to your base and destroy. For?\n\n8. Barrels\nYou actually break barrels in this game to get +13, +17 gold. Worst, the gold falls on the floor so you have to actually walk over the gold to pick it up, else someone else could take it. Items costs hundreds to thousands of gold.\n\n9. Spell bugs\nCertain spells can't be cast or used near Monoliths (towers) or when they are no enemies around. You will see a white Area of Effect Circle and the spell picture but you can't use it on anything or anyone.","January 29, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unique heroes, very unique objectives, a whole new take on mobas. Jungling is replaced with small dungeons, and there are resources other than gold to collect to help you scale. Also, the acient/nexus/main base objective to win is A BOSS FIGHT! Your team votes on the boss they want for their side before the match starts and the enemy does not know what it is until they get to it. Also, the heroes are customizable. Like an assassin but want to play it more magelike? you can do that! you can scal more toward Assassin, Mage, Fighter, or Tank. Your heroes also wear the items you buy in the shop during matches, so you change as the match progresses. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a unique yet fun moba. Worth a try. The only downside is that basically noone is online ever, hence this review to persuade people to play it! 10/10 for what is there so far. Only occassional minor bugs like pathing issues but those will be fixed as the game goes on. Give it a shot.","February 13, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gave a thumbs up for now if the issues I'll mention is not fixed or changed regardless of my vote I believe this game will be a failure.\n\nLets start with positive things;\n\nI am really liking this game so far because it has an excellent atmosphere, well made hero designes and a lot of ways to win. You can capture an enemy banner, collect stuff from trees, kill enemies, bring down towers... These all will give your team points to win the game. If no one can bring down the enemy boss in 24 mins, team with the most points will win. This is also great because it prevents the game from being too time consuming. I also liked that you can choose a role for your hero at the start of the game and make your own play style with that hero, rather than heroes having specific roles like in dota 2 or league. Another part that I like about the game is that the items you buy actually appears on your hero which is nothing more than a visual but it greatly improves the atmosphere. There are dungeons instead of jungles which I find very creative and likeable. The game can consist of 3vs3, 2vs2 or 1vs1 which makes it less overwhelming and it seems there are going to be more maps than one which is always good.\n\nBefore getting to the negatives I want to mention the playable hero system. The hero system is like LoL's champion system, meaning you have to buy the heroes you want to play. Although I don't find that system very nice, this game actually allows you to try the hero out before buying it by giving you keys that will make that hero available for a time. This system applies to every purchasable item in the game which is much better system than LoL's weekly champion cycle. There is also a quest system which in return gives you copper coins to buy new heroes or other items which is also very nice.\n\nNow going on to the negative sides;\n\nI mentioned dungeons in the positive sides, though they are nice and all, after you kill a camp of creatures you get to open a chest that is guarded by that creatures, there is usually gold inside which is fine but sometimes it gives you copper coins which are used to buy heroes and stuff or keys to try out heroes. This is where the greedy side of the game comes into the scene. Those keys or copper coins don't effect the winning or losing in anyway. they are only there to make you want to buy things. Instead of this I would recommend giving a small amount of free keys weekly to every player. For the copper coins; you can already get them by playing the game or doing the quests so you dont need them to come out of chests. Another bad side is that there is only one free hero. The reason for that might be the very limited count of heroes which is expected because this game is still in the process of making, but still there should be atleast 3 free heroes so everyone can pick something different. There is no denying your own creeps or towers, no creep deny is fine but since the demolition of towers give points to the teams a tower deny mechanism that will prevent the enemy from getting points would be great to see. Also the thing about towers is that they actually one shot some creeps, so there is no way for you to get gold from them, it is irritating for me. The spider boss, equivelant of Roshan in DotA and Nashor in LoL, is too weak. You can kill it on your own with some medium level items. Dungeons are too small, they only have 3-4 camps. Now the biggest problem is the artifact system the game introduces. Artifacts are cosmetic items that actually effect the ingame, again as I said; greedy game. After you fill your item slots, if you don't have artifacts your gold is no use. People with artifacts will have better and more items than you do. I would be fine with it if they were cheap like runes in LoL but some of them are as expensive as heroes themselves. Thus, game becomes pay to win. Some people tell me to use the keys to unlock artifacts but as you know, keys are limited. So the better way to overcome this would be making the artifacts cheaper. Another problem with artifacts is that they are very very powerful. So I would recommend limiting the number of artifacts a hero can get to one artifact only.\n\nOverall I give that game 6.5/10, it has real potential to become a great game and I would hate to see it go to waste so please consider my suggestions.","January 14, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Waiting in que for a match is very long. Most times you'll notice you are the only person in the que, or at least I did.

The ability to play a character any way, which will also change up their animations (choose a bow and your animations follow suit, swap to a sword and shield, that changes things too,) makes it quite different from other MOBAs I have run into.

This allows you to purchace artifacts (weapons, shields, etc,) as well as characters, so everyone has access to all of these in due time. It's not a pay to win system.

Mild language.\n"Ok, this is an interesting take. Eh, mized reviews... We'll see."\nFirst thing first, the art style. Among my favorites it is certainly gorgeous and is actually the reason I installed in the first place.\n\nSeries of Events:\nGame Launch... Register... "WELCOME!"... Tutorial begins while I'm being spammed with "keys". Finally get informed that these keys are dished out weekly just for playing. "Cool, I can dig that." Without mousing over you're not exactly told what each key does, but that is sort of obvious. Game asks me to unlock a hero, which it tells me is called breeds, but still decides to call heroes because calling one thing two names is cool I guess.\nI go to check out a hero who looks interesting, base stats show up in a nice lil char sheet. But wait... where the hell are their abilities? This isn't a right click simulator is it? Seeing tags like mage tell me surely each breed does something. Ok; now lets sto-... where is the return button? Nevermind that I'll just click Hero again. Tutorial continues on as if I had used a key and insists I start playing... Well, I can't disappoint the all-might tutorial...\nI drag over the lowest key and unlock Ivy... Gut told me she might have a heal, and she kind of looks like a chick from Avatar so win win... click play, choose graveyard, cause... I mean... it is a friggin graveyard!\nOut of game UI goes poof, game ui pops up telling me to Vote for something or other; gives abso-friggn-lutely NO information about what the heck I am looking at... looks pretty though... "Ok, lets clickkkk this one... its a daybreed like me. Huh... nothing happened, timer is still ticking." Continue clicking around because my mind tells me the big VOTE button was to lock in my selection, which... I never got the option to make one. Ok, no worries, maybe it is an incoming feature being previewed.... yeah...\nGet in game and the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. Looks GORGEOUS, which is great, cause eye candy helps... But while trying to pick my skill it constantly yelled at me as though I was attempting to cast... Hrm... Ok, I'll be a wood-league player and click to learn the skill Q looks good (later on ctrl+Q/W/E/R finally started working, though with serious finicky time spent holding ctrl in advance else it would cast). First hurdle done. Next, find the shop. P, well, lot of mobas use it for shop so why not (why though? why p?)\n"Your monolith is under attack"... Uh... what!? Sure enough the other fella decided to suicide dive my monolith (not towers, do not mistake them for towers). He'll proceed to do this throughout the game because the AI doesn't understand that to-monoliths hurt. Ok no biggy, I'll let him ♥♥♥♥ around up there for a bit... I'll go to the other side and see ho... Ok no attack move? What is A bound to? Banner... ok maybe that's like summoner skills or such. Nope, found the banner on the map. "Return it to your starting area to trash." Bully! Off I go. Meanwhile there goes SuicideMcgee again. What a champ. dance around my starting area... Oh bannnerrr? Do something? After another suicide dive and monolith damage actually becoming a concern I check the amount of gold I have acquired. "Crap" Rush out to farm, attack animations aren't to bad, last hitting will take some getting used to, good thing there are these barrels to get some chump change out of.\nUlt acquired! Spend the next chunk of time trying to figure out what the heck it was supposed to do. For those who are curious, she puts down a seed. The seed itself doesn' do squat except fade away if left alone, wasting a chunk of your very precious mana. "Drag and drop..?" Ok back to the shop, maybe I missed something. Took another chunk of time before accidently stumbling on something glinting as I passed by...Another three mins to find the tiny little numbers next to my skills that I had mistaken for Kills, death, assists, farm. Silly me. Good thing I gave up a tow-erh... monolith. Also spot a "dungeon door"... Sure why not. I need some fat lewts... Turns out to be similar to jungle camps, except the main guy did more damage per swing than the enemy Breed did... TACTICAL WITHDRAWL. No back function, guess I'm waddling back to base...\nSpend another five mins mousing over things in the shop because the game has pulled a FROM Software on me and not told me squat about what does what. I'm a mage, so clearly I want Power... I don't like dieing so I want Health... but... why are there so many if they don't do anything really unique... Plus side, they actually affect how you look, brownie points acquired.\nOK, Suicide McGee has annoyed me to no end, time to fight. Run in, W him... and he runs off of it, which makes sense... but so do the minions... This guy understood that a spell from me did damage, but had died twelve times to the same monolith...\nGame goes on as I try to make up apparently mass quanities of loss ground. Figure out how to summon the Troll, who bugs out at the last enemy Monolith because a minion stood in his way and he couldn't figure out how to switch targets... or something like that. Eventually kill Suicide Mcgee and then hear a 10 second countdown... "Huh, it didn't count down other day/night cycles did it!?"\n\n\nDEFEAT...\n...\n...\n"Well ♥♥♥♥ you too." I just lost a game, to a troll deciding he wanted to have that gargoyal lil fella as a pet instead of just smashing the monolith his massive club could have reached twice over.\n------------\n\nThis game needs so much work, so very much.\nIts artistic style will be something that will get it a following, its little rpg elements of resource management might put people off (If everyones R requires it I'm going to tableflip).\nThe in game tutorial might do well to not be off by default though... Oh! And being able to SET KEYBINDS. Clicking input and seeing an empty menu made me almost alt-f4 the damn game.\n\nI personally do play to keep my eyes on the progress, perhaps even play to learn a bit but there is so very, very much that needs to be done.","August 26, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(The Devs say it will soon be at a 'Release State' but I believe otherwise - Maybe CBT at best)\n·Unique features (such as: your character's appearance change with the equipment you buy, change your role according to the equipment you are wearing - even at the middle of a match, buy equipment with unique skills each, gameplay changes according to your Sentinel (Guardian - Final Boss) which you and your team votes for, GREAT visual effects and much more, It is not your typical MOBA) plus Dark freakin' atmosphere, which make this my best MOBA by far.\n·BUT the game needs more Devs and a LOT more Players.

Don't make this into a Dota 2 Overthrow Mod.\n4.Needs more unique items than just pure OP stats like massive armor pen and damage\n5.Balance Frost Gemini... A skillshot that does half of your hp with massive range and EVEN splits, an aoe dmg overtime that heals 45% of the damage dealt?! And a buggy as hell ice wall... Her ult is actually fine.\n\nThat's my current opinion as I make this post, other than that, well keep up the good work :D.","April 16","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Still not that polished & I haven't gotten a single PVP match (15min+ wait times) :| Total character pool is about as much as 1 weekly free roll in LoL & still only a few of them can even be 'rented' per week.\n\nEDIT 2: Uninstalled a while back but I'm pretty sure it had never gotten an update while I had it, lol.\n\nThis is one very interesting game. I've tried a few different mobas too. If you're looking for a moba/RPG-style game give it a try. This review is kinda rushed after under an hour of playing the game - I've only played a 1-v-1 practice match & a 3-v-3 (normal) practice match. I've essentially gotten 'hints' about all the features of the game and didn't get to experience many of them indepth, largely due to its most controvercial feature of having a lot of (severe) time limitation.\n\nDeadbreed has several interesting innovations - from the visuals to the business model - that seem to work and I think your overall enjoyment of the game (i.e. your decision to stick with it) would fall onto a couple of details that might be a deal breaker for you or would just up the challenge/depth. I think I would describe this game as a MOBARPG - a combination of LoL style gameplay (over DotA) and MMORPGs (the dungeons & instanced fields kind).\n\n*TL;DR review (i.e. features) followed by (clumsy) details, then final verdict.\nMain features:Fantastic graphics with a horrific-yet-interesting theme that runs very smoothly and feels polished. Fog of war is a little hard to identify though (until you see enemies). UI can be complex/deep but is non-intrusive.\nHeavily narrated game (fully voiced tutorial).\nDetailed & heavily modular hero models (better than dota 2's I would say). In-game shop items are visually equipped on your hero! (As if u're carrying "Butterfly" or "Infinity Edge" as your weapons in DotA/LoL)\n3-v-3 matches with 2 lanes & 3 towers per team, followed by 1 boss to kill behind enemy lines to end the game (like Dawngate). Tower damage & health are not very big. 3 additional dungeons per map.\nInventory consists of slots for head, shoulder, right hand, left hand and lower body (this might be consistent or it might differ between some heroes, I'm not sure). The item shop in a match looks like a character equipment screen in an MMORPG.\nPlay any hero as any one of four roles - assassin/fighter/mage/tank - and switch as you please in-game according to the items you equip E.g. Choose "fighter" to start with a sword and a shield, then mid-game sell your shield for a second sword & buy equips accordingly to become assassin~ Some 2-handed weapons.\nCosmetic skins make the hero models look very different (e.g. skeleton ver., gothic ver.)\nLimited creep models (as far as I know)\nSound effects aren't particularly interesting/exciting (not-so-epic battles)\nBots are quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ & pathing is not the best.\nControversial features:The limited pool of heroes is locked (except for 1). Unlock the hero temporarily with bronze key (for 1 game, u start with 8, weekly 2), silver key (for 1 day, u start with 8, weekly 2) or gold key (for 1 week, u start with 2, weekly 1 I think). You can also buy the hero for permanent access. These keys (at least bronze) can also be found in-game in dungeon chests (I had to use one for the tutorial, then I found one in a dungeon by chance).\nMatches are limited to 24mins, after which gameplay is ended & a victor is announced according to team's points.\nThere are a few in-game shop items that are only accessible after they're unlocked (bought?), whether they're unbalanced or not I dunno.\nHero must be unlocked for practice mode (i.e. 1 single-game bronze key unlock will be used up to practice with bots unless hero is already unlocked, you will be notified of course), but you will get rewards from bot matches too.\nDETAILS ||\nSetting/theme/aesthetics/graphics...visuals I guess(?)The aesthetics of the game are already something that might deter some. From the thumbnails I felt it looked quite dull, unlike many vibrant-coloured counterparts available out there (after all, vivid colours are healthier for your brain while greys are mind-numbing/make you dumber in the long run, right?) but rather the game uses earthy colours and the maps have a nicely rendered netherworld feel to it complete with smoke particles, elemental wisps & whatnot.\n\nI feel kinda dumb not getting the theme from the title. The heroes in this game are essentially zombies; they're various souls that have been resurrected into this nether realm to fight their way back to life (if I understand correctly thus far). Accordingly, the (2) maps I got to see are graveyards and the starting point/base shop are where your tombstones stand. This team base also seems to be very accessible by enemies but you will probably heal too fast to be pwned by them there at any point (probably).\n\nGameplayIt's not easy for me to seperate every feature as most of them are related to each other but I'll try.\n\nMAP & OBJECTIVES\nIt consists of 2 lanes that form an elongated circuit around the centre. The base is on the inside of either end of this 'track'. There is a tier1 tower on either side of the base (on each lane) and one tier2 behind the base. Behind that, after the 3 towers are down, there is a locked door to be broken and a boss inside to be defeated to 'win' the match (like Dawngate - now closed). The centre of the map consists of a 'jungle'/labyrinth which contains chests, stat pickups (more details in-game...) and 3 more doors leading to dungeons. The sad thing among all this adventure-liciousness is that you must complete the match within 24 minutes or have it cut short and the winner decided according to points collected thus far... this is the single strangest idea in this game. 24mins is just about enough time to rush the towers & fight the boss, ignoring every other aspect of the game, if you're pwning...\n\nBATTLES & SKILLS\nThe 2-lane 3-v-3 setup does make for a strange - if a little interesting - match up. You could essentially have 1-v-1 games on each lane while a third (maybe assassin?) player goes through the 'jungle' & dungeons and collects pickups/points etc. before the enemy hero does , but you'll likely end up with many 1-v-2 encounters too (constant ambushes I guess).\n\nFighting mechanic is quite similar to LoL: quick-cast on by default (press the corresponding skill button to instantly cast it where your mouse pointer is) but without the OP passives on each champ; skills have many levels like in LoL, no seperate stat leveling (unlike DotA); items affect skill stats (% instead of constant).\n\nDifferences include: after killing enemy hero you can pick up 1 soul where they died (1 of 3 stat modifiers that can be farmed & spent/allocated in a match); edge-of-screen camera panning is silky smooth; no apparent OP ulti skills.\n\nThe skills seem like the least innovative & least attractive aspects of the game, they're similar (pretty much identical) to skills from other mobas, this might be to render the character more 'role-free' so you can be effective with them in any role but I dunno...\n\nFinal VerdictDeadbreed is quite satisfactory as a beta and a MOBARPG (heh), it delivers a lot of new things and I didn't see any freaky bugs yet. I do recommend this game, whether my excitement is only temporary or long lasting. More than anything I think Deadbreed has a lot of potential, especially if the dev team is willing to develop the game along with educated players' input. Even if the game doesn't grow in the end, players should at least experience these innovations to the genre.","August 15, 2015","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Some of the design ideas are silly, like having to purchase new maps to play on. Most of the abilities either don't work half of the time, or just make no sense at all. This game tries way too hard to be way too unique.\n\nThe most fun I had with this game was the tutorial. The thing is so ♥♥♥♥ing buggy. You can legit press any button, and it'll highlight some imaginary area thinking that you've opened the tab you asked it to. I'm here looking at the store while it's telling me to pick a guardian for the map that's "about to start".\n\nToo many ideas to work with, none of them well executed.\n\nNot to mention the game crashes all the time out of nowhere. Also... time limits on maps are just... why? One of the developers must be some salty League of Legends player who didn't like getting absolutely creamed by the enemy team, and decided that the game should be focused on team points with a time limit. You can win this game without ever killing anyone.\n\nDevs bit off more than they can chew, that's all I can say. Interesting in theory, lackluster in product.\n\nEdit: Please top saying you've updated your game, devs, when it really hasn't been. Thanks for letting me know your game is available with the 5 emails now saying that it's somehow become the greatest game in the world overnight.","March 6","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(The Devs say it will soon be at a 'Release State' but I believe otherwise - Maybe CBT at best)\n·Unique features (such as: your character's appearance change with the equipment you buy, change your role according to the equipment you are wearing - even at the middle of a match, buy equipment with unique skills each, gameplay changes according to your Sentinel (Guardian - Final Boss) which you and your team votes for, GREAT visual effects and much more, It is not your typical MOBA) plus Dark freakin' atmosphere, which make this my best MOBA by far.\n·BUT the game needs more Devs and a LOT more Players. (maybe merge the f***ing servers till we actually get a big player base going)\n\nI play it off and on when there is an update...there is one every 5 months or so...... 10/10","March 17","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Control is extremely limited very few options, no screen zooming, screen scrolling is difficult there is almost zero tutorials, you not instructed how to gain/upgrade or even use skills and abilities during play. Even the first solo starter mission is very confusing. All in all I cannot in my right mind recommend this game in its current state. It has tons of potential, nice graphics and some interesting starter lore but it needs so much more fleshed out for it to be made a interesting and even playable game.","April 16","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a cash grab.\n\nFrom its earliest stages, everything had a real cash price tag attached to it, including things necessary to playing the game. I woke up this morning to seeing that my forum post addressing this issue was deleted with no comment as to why.\n\nFrom here, I'm going to go with a simple pros & cons.\n\nPro:\n+Beautiful character and paperdoll assets\n+Items are fully functional\n+Dark environment with music that matches\n+Dungeons are the new jungle\n+Resource collection minigame is kinda neat with the different resource functions\n+Character rental system is nice in a game that requires character purchase\n\nCon:\n-Game is severely difficult to jump in and play\n-Lack of players means longer time waiting in queue\n-Items and abilities are difficult to read, text is small, monotone, and littered with irrelevant information\n-Small character pool, not all are unlockable with keys for rental\n-There are only 2 tanks, 2 Assassins, 3 Fighters, and the rest are all Mages\n-Abilities are not very synergistic with each other\n-Full of gamebreaking bugs (like running your character off of the map)\n\n\nI wanted to touch on one other key point, the paperdoll equipment system. It's super cool that I can load up Corpus with a bow, heavy armor, and (if I purchase them) angelic wings. Previously, that would have been viable. The game's initial selling point was hey, you can deck out any hero any way you like and play this beefy guy as a mage if you want. That used to be viable, now though, it's like playing AP Riven or building INT on Phantom Assassin. You totally can, but why would you?","January 4","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
