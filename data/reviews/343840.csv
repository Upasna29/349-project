"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarthegryphon/recommended/343840/","fubarthegryphon","MattchuDeePorkupineh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarthegryphon/","1599 products in account","Click here to see pictures and the score I gave it: http://www.gamewalkers.com/games/trash-tv/review/\n\nIt’s really rare that I find a game that I enjoy quite as much as Trash TV. Over the years, I’ve watched 2D platformers become a genre known for how criticized they are, gamers all over the world convinced that they’re almost all the same. There are a few exceptions in the indie community, Rogue Legacy and VVVVVV come to mind, but there are still a lot of gamers that are convinced they won’t find anything new with 2D platformers.\n\nThose gamers will miss out a lot with Trash TV. I’ve watched this one since its earlier days on TIGSource and it’s quite incredible how far it has come. From the moment you boot it up, chasing colored pixels to the lifeless television that is your character, rebooting it, a stunningly well-done CRT effect overlaid on the screen, creating an outline as if you were playing the game on an older television, the game captures your attention. It’s surreal how well it draws you in. There’s this world just beyond the screen in which a television is desperately trying to find his remote. You have to help him find his remote.\n\nYou do this by solving all manner of puzzles and platforming challenges. It starts out easy, jumping around and moving boxes to facilitate jumping around, always getting dropped back in a central hub. Then explosives get added in. Then weapons. From there, it becomes a lot more challenging, having to organize boxes on a multitude of buttons, time shots at explosives to get them to go off at the right time, and set up multiple explosives to launch you in different directions in a specific order, among other challenges. The amount of variety that Lawrence Russell has packed into this game is insane and I had fun figuring out each challenge as new elements were constantly brought forth. The torrent of new and creative puzzles simply doesn’t stop and there’s not a whole lot of repetition beyond using what you’ve learned in the hub.\n\nI feel that at this point I am obligated to praise the hub a bit. It is designed incredibly well, constantly challenging you to use what you learn in each of the game’s six locations to reach new locations. One or two were as simple as activating a platform or tearing through boxes with one of the weapons you acquire but it was a largely satisfying experience. What’s more, the game tracks your progress intuitively, providing a map of the factory in the hub that shows locked locations in red, unvisited locations that you can reach in white, and completed locations in green. There’s even a puzzle to unlock a weapon in the hub!\n\nBeyond the general feel of the puzzles, there’s even more detail. The minute details that are thrown in make it all the more “real.” You are a living television. Instead of boxes, occasionally, you will be provided with other televisions that look at you and feel happiness when you pick them up, only to be tossed into a trash compactor so that you can get by, killing them. When you are near a compactor and it comes down, the screen will shake and static will show up on your screen. Story segments and teaching you how to overcome certain obstacles are done through a transmission of sorts that comes from the antennae of the main character. There are times it almost appears to become contemplative, even, reflecting on what it might be like to be a television stuck in this situation and what sort of moral dilemmas you might face. There are a lot of little details like that build this feeling and make the experience all the more immersive, despite being a 2D platformer.\n\nAnother of those details is that you’re a hardy television that can survive an explosion. The game loves to use this one and there are a large number of puzzles that center around using explosions to propel yourself around. Personally, I can say that they are extremely well-done and warrant mentioning separately because there are a lot of games that don’t get such puzzles quite right. This one did.\n\nThere’s also a small bit of combat, which comes with almost all games that have weapons and, instead of dying from combat, what happens when you get hit is that you sort of go “haywire,” automatically running until you hit something, at which point you turn around, the screen going fuzzy to disorient you. You can jump to try and avoid certain death but most combat segments are placed in places where there are compactors and other traps that can easily be run into. It was rather entertaining, and a nice touch, that you fought toasters, other televisions, and vending machines that charge at you. You are in a trash facility of some sort.\n\nShould you die, in going with the TV theme, there is a brilliantly-designed “rewind” mechanic in place. It’s essentially just a great checkpointing system that is incredibly lenient, never forcing you to replay completed puzzles but it’s a nice touch. You can also choose to rewind at any time from the pause menu, should you feel stuck or actually be stuck.\n\nIt is unfortunate, however, that its best mechanic is the most short-lived. Near the end of the game, you unlock a weapon that changes everything, one that is extremely clever and gives way to some of the game’s most challenging puzzles. I feel there was a lot of untapped potential with this one, mostly focusing on the sole use of that weapon, giving you only a taste of what more complex puzzles utilizing multiple weapons might be like. Judging from the rest of the game, it seems as if everything was carefully designed to keep from overstaying its welcome but it feels as if you barely say hello to this new mechanic before it’s gone. Similar experiences occur at other times but this one is the most devastating.\n\nThat doesn’t change the fact that there is a lot to like about Trash TV. From the well-designed puzzles to the little attentions to detail, it is one of the single greatest platformers I have ever played and, at a budget price of $6.99, it is really hard to say no to. It is a bit short, sitting at an hour and a half before I hit the credits, but that hasn’t stopped games like VVVVVV and Escape Goat from reaching greatness. I genuinely hope that it doesn’t stop this one either. It’s a great game from start to finish and that is something we don’t get often enough.\n","February 23, 2015","true","2.3"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","24","25","2","2"

In fact, its the exact opposite.  For example, the variety of weapons available make it so you can (for the most part) choose your own fighting style.  However, what really drew me to this game is the puzzle elements - it starts off easy enough, but some of the later areas can be brutal!\n\nIf I had to pick a downside, I'd say it was the fact that the controls aren't explained if you just start a new game without looking at any options.  Even so, this is a minor thing and is very easy to get around.\n\nWould I recommend it?

I quite enjoy finding shortcuts and speed running through. The graphics have a nice indie feel to them but at the same time have a unique and eye-catching style. Important level areas are nicely highlighted in green which helps identify where to progress.

It’s also noteworthy to mention the usage of explosions in the game. You’ll find many of the challenges centering around the usage of explosions to propel the TV around.

As you go through the game you collect different weapons which can be used to solve different puzzles. It's surreal watching a sentient television blast the crap out of things with SMGs and C4. You can choose the order in which you will complete the levels, which are connected by a central hub area, and you may find another way to complete a puzzle depending on which weapons you are carrying. I liked the sound and visual style, and although some choices were a bit questionable to me (pixel art with varying sizes of pixels combined with non-pixel-art), the game looks nice overall. For stylistic reasons the game is in 4:3. I kind of wish there were more enemies in the game, considering how many great weapons you get. It takes about 2 hours to complete. I wish it was a bit longer because I really enjoyed it, but as it stands it's a fine game.

I was happy to see its finally out on steam coz i played the Demo which came out month before the real release.\n\nBut i must sadly say, and give it a down vote.\nWhy? it gives really really REALLY a lot reasons.\n\nBut first, dont get me wrong at all - it is nicely made but i better count up why i gave it a down vote, with reasons:\n\n- First i love the idea behind, you play an old TV which solve some (pretty easy) puzzles. And here we have already one reason: the puzzles are pretty much the same (destroy a box, go there, throw that, use this gun, explode this to jump higher), really.\n\n- I also was happy to see you will finally got a lot more weapons, yea!....Yea....now i miss things i can really shoot with. I mean, honestly, it gives only 3-4 enemy areas which are more puzzle like and not shooting areas. Other problems that THOSE guns are (more or less) only to solve puzzles, NOT to shoot things (in the way we know).And the other problem: You maybe need those weapons 1-3 times in the whole game ONLY. At the end you just need 2 and that out of...8?\n\n- I also was happy to read it gives new areas! Finally! The demo made me wana play more of it for real...and what did i get? 6 short levels??? Heh this guys gotta be kidding. Also i finished the FULL GAME in LESS then 1 1/4 HOURS. REALLY? i mean...FOR REAL? Just a play time from 1 1/4 hours and thats IT? I wasnt even GOOD!\n\n- The other problem is the Story, i mean, how i said already the IDEA is cool...but really (SPOILER):  Your TV comes to "life" to search its remote (i guess?) by unknown pixels, finds the remote, gets a way out the yard and just "DIES". Yea, thats f*cking it. WHY??? That makes NO sense at all! Why does it die? Why do it search the remote?? WHY TO HELL IS THE ENDING THAT BAD???\n\n\n\nI must admit, i had fun playing it but it is waaaaaaaaaaayyyyy to short for THAT price (maybe 2$ and thats ok) and the story ends SO bad that i cant give it a up vote. It IS a good base, really but if they (at least) let people really SHOOT things or make more areas where ALL weapons (more or less) would be used, i think maybe again about my review but im really honest to say that:\n\nTrash TV is it -NOT- worth to buy or to play in the state it is right now, sadly.","May 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

Why? Two reasons (The last one is a huge spoiler so be advised):\n\nA) The game is only 2 hours long at a base price of 8 dollars. This is too high for a video game of this length. This is how long good free games on newgrounds are, or how long games like 140 are (which is 5 dollars). Even when edmund mcmillen bundled all his flash games into a bundle and sold it on steam the price was only 4 dollars. It is unacceptable for this game to cost as much as it does. However, this game does have a great potential for a multiplayer deathmatch mode and if that is added then this will definetely get a recommendation and be worth the money. This game cost almost as much and knytt underground and that is 24 hours long (and has better controls)\n\nB)When you reach the end, all that happens is that the TV dies for no reason and the pixels that reaminated it dissappear. To make matters worse, the game fails to remove the background noise from the final area and so any emotion that could have been invested in the ending is just erased by that noise.

Took me a little over two and half hours to beat in its entirety and its totally worth it for $7.","July 7, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Short as I played through in just under 80 minutes.\n\nBasically a puzzle/platformer.  Worth the play though.","October 5, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play an old CRT television trying to find its remote and escape an electronics recycling facility, and for some reason the TV has guns... that it uses to solve puzzles. There were only a handful of puzzles I found challening, the rest being fairly dull and unimaginative. There are better games in this genre, IMO.","March 3","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It'll keep you occupied for a few hours.
