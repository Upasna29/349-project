This means that both sides are giving orders and they are executed together when you hit next turn.\nYou get a lot of playtime in this one as it has Grand Russian Civil War scenario (1918) the Russian-Polish war (1920) and a what if scenario set in an alternative post-WW1 world in 1921 called Drang Nach Osten where the victorious  Central Powers are attacking Soviet Russia. Along with these, you also get some smaller scenarios that are great for beginners or a fast game when you are short on time. Such are a 1917 early Revolution scenario and Finnish civil war one. The later is really recommended for beginners as it is pretty easy to play as the Whites and it is not too complex. But playing tutorial scenarios and reading the manual is a MUST for absolute newbies to any AGEOD game!\nGrand scenarios are really HUGE and you are in total control there. You create new  armies, you lead them to glory or defeat and you have tactical and strategic choices. Here you can win a lot of smaller battles and still lose the war if you are not careful. Every action has its re-action and not two games will play the same. Your nights will be short and mornings will come too early :)\n\nAll and all I simply love this game as a lot of attention to details and revisions and changes/fixes of the old version was put into it.\nThere are not many (if all) games with this topic and if you want something different, are not afraid to sink a lot of hours learning things and love history ... then you will also like this game like I do.\n\nA personal note:\nGreat work  Mr. Chopin and the crew!","July 2, 2015","true","24.0"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","66","72","4","0"

You can play as both sides, whites and reds, and turn the tide of war and history!

I find their games very complicated and require huge time investments due to the steep learning curve... However, this game has made a fan out of me. After spending about 5 hours in tutorials, the game manual and replaying the Grand Campaign, I can finally say I understand how to play Revolution Under Siege. And what is under the hood of this game is simply amazing. An epic, period-piece soundtrack, indepth game mechanics that range from random Officer/unit spawns due to random events, Commander stats ranging from Seniority to Offensive Fire, and even tooltips and manuals full of gameplay information. I know that doesn't sound exciting at all but it actually creates a very well done strategy game that makes you feel like the actual commander during the Russian Civil War. I love the detail that went into the game... it's absolutely crazy how many stats each unit in the game has, the amount of factions involved, and the terrifyingly fierce AI. And do you not what my personal favorite feature is? Under the Objectives screen there is a losses counter!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PyHUI8qAkE\nWell done, AGEOD and Slitherine!

Dr. Zhivago, Quiet Flows the Don, and Riley Ace of Spies will finally have some historical context.\n\nThere are a few (maybe all of two) games out there that touch on this subject with single scenarios, but this is the only game that concentrates on giving you the whole Civil War.  If you weren't paying attention in high school you might remember something about American troops landing in Russia, but you probably won't remember all those Germans running around in the Ukraine.  It throws an interesting side light on what happened in WW II when you realize that they had done it before, and not in some remote period of history, but in many cases earlier in their careers.\n\nThe music in the game is probably the best music that has ever been included in any game ever published.  I should also mention that I used to be the lead domra player in a balalaika orchestra: I am extremely partial to Russian music but I also know what it's supposed to sound like. The music in this game is the real thing.  It's worth buying the game just to get your hands on the mp3 files that come with it.\n\nThis is an Ageod game, and a very mature one.  It doesn't follow the gaming logic that most people are used to, and learning it is a bit tricky at first because the manual is written with the implicit assumption that you have some understanding of how Ageod games work.  It's probably the easiest to wrap your mind around, but really learning the game is a three step process.  You have to play the three tutorials, you need to read through manual very quickly so you know where to go back to to look things up that you won't understand the first time you encounter them in the game, and you need to play a simple scenario like the Ice March a few times  and keep making a mess of it until you finally figure out how to handle troops.\n\nAn important concept is that units are collections of men that need to be well-rested and organized.  Keep an eye on your units' cohesion and strength states, and if a unit isn't up to snuff, make sure that it sits around doing nothing inside a town for a few weeks or it will melt away when you try to march it across an increasingly hostile steppe.\n\nIf you are interested in 20th century history this game is a must-buy.  It also just happens to be a lot of fun to play, and you'll catch yourself not starting battles because you're so entranced listening to the music.","July 8, 2015","true","9.1"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","34","37","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deidaraakatski/recommended/374380/","deidaraakatski","Mrepitome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deidaraakatski/","282 products in account","Disregarding what I wrote in my RoP [Rise of Prussia] review it turns out I did delve into another AGEOD game.\n\nAfter spending two hours with the game so far I actually learned how to play, and what I want to say is this game is amazing. There is a lot of depth in crafting an army, and while I thought it wouldn't be much fun, turns out I was wrong. It's very rewarding to see armies you nurtured duke it out with enemy armies and try to figure out the best configuration to lead your faction to victory.\n\nAlright so to keep this review clean, organized, and productive I am going to start off first with a list of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nCompetent AI The AI will often go for undefended regions and try to cut off your supplies. If you have the upper hand the AI will avoid your troops and won't suicide which is a good thing. Therefore, winning a scenario is very rewarding, since the AI puts up a very good fight to the end.\n\nHistorical Accuracy Revolution Under Siege Gold goes through the events of the chosen scenario through messages in the message box and scripted events. For example, in the ice march scenario mid-game most of Ukraine is not accessible (you can't move troops into it) except for Kiev. At some point the regions will be accessible at some point so keep any eye out for that.\n\nChain of Command feature like in the other AGEOD games Create divisions, army corps, and front GHQ in order to effectively manage your army. Also there is naval units, but they are bogged down to gunship and such so the impact of their involvement in the war is dependent on the scenario. It took me a long time to learn that you should turn off activation rules for leaders (in the game settings) since this really challenges your abilities to form divisions with generals and sometimes locks them in regions. (Even the manaul suggest you turn this setting off). Combining elements is actually the only way to effectively avoid combat penalties due to unorganization, and will heavily effect casualties and movement and coheision (unit's ability and readiness for combat, and morale). Don't forget to add Politkom to your forces as well (political commissars) who will prevent previous imperial generals from causing armies to lock for one turn for idealogical reasons from time to time. Elite Cheka police units will give some of your unit stacks moral and combat bonuses against Militia (White or Red Guards and Peasants).\n\nBrilliant use of the unit cards and overall break down of the army, aswell as excellent simulation of the depth of logistics (ammunition and food are both accounted for the well being of the units and how well they perform in battle).\n\nSound effects during combat and using the ledger. I really do enjoy the sound effects during the combat phases and when I click on the ledgers.\n\nMusic  this is probably the best part of the game besides the historical accurracy and battles. There is a variety of music from the era of Imperial/soviet Russia, therefore the loops are hardly repetitive but rather engaging.\n\nRegional Decisions bring the masses to your cause in friendly or enemy regions. Sentiment to your faction will give you production boasts if in friendly territory and can also mean stopping the enemies ability to produce troops in their territory if the support for your faction is greater.\n\nHistorical decisions Like events, sometimes you can choose between two historical decisions or options which will give you different benifits depending on the one you choose.\n\nCon:\nGame can crash\n\nMassive map I might recommend if you are new to AGEOD games you play Rise of Prussia or Alea Jacta Est because RUS has a lot of regions. It will be daunting to players who have never played any games of such magnitude as this. However, if you live in Russia, the game might be rather easier to manage since you know the geographic areas well.\n\nFPS capped this is to avoid crashes\n\nSlight learning curve you are going to at least need to be able to read, and have a little common sense. The game holds your hand for a few turns but after that you need to be planning your moves and carefully assemble your army. Your army needs to meet the needs of the objectives indicated at the beginning of the scenario. Carelessly glossing over important events and clicking the end turn button without making sure everything is right can result in series of defeats in battle. You will also need to read the manual to understand how combat works and make notes of important details like the effects of bad weather and why your troops may be taking attrition.\n\nPlease note this review is subject to change and will be updated as more play time occurs, thank you","July 21, 2015","true","45.9"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","18","19","3","0"

The game is complex, true. But read the manual and learn it well, once you start winning armies, taking cities and crushing those fascist whites, you'll love it!

The Bolshevik armies have driven me away to the last bastion of sanity and civilization in Russia, Rostov. For a moment, all seems lost to me, Tuchachevsky and Trotsky are advancing on Rostov against my pitiful army and any reinforcements are months away. I fortify Rostov and hope for the best, retreat not being an option, except Suddenly Tuchachevsky is called to another area, and Trotsky is distracted by Anarchists, leaving subpar bolshevik officers in command, giving me a glimmer of hope. Im severely outnumbered as they begin their final assault, wave after wave of bolsheviks smashing against the walls of Rostov, until suddenly, a nearby corps I had forgotten about reinforces me, and suddenly the Bolsheviks seem to be driven back. Suddenly, a great light explodes accross the horizon, blinding all soldiers. A tank rolls over the battlefield, and a man, beautiful and immaculate, with an impecabble mustache and fashion sense emerges, Stalin himself has decided to reinforce this battle and thunders "Helo where are the socialisms :DDDDDDDDDDDD" My armies instantly surrender due to Stains immense charisma, and my generals all convert to Bolshevism, before being willingly purged by Stalin.\n\n\nIn seriousness, Stalin is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If you are able to get past a few bugs and can handle a somewhat obtuse interface than you will definitely enjoy this game. The Russian Civil war is a dramatic and often overlooked period of history and you will learn much from playing this game. It requires you to think like a real general at the time and brings you into the mindset of whatever faction you play. You will start to understand the tough decisions made by each leader, and why things turned out the way they did. All in all this is a superb game, and I recomend that people ignore the negative reviews by people with a congenital aversion to AGEOD games.","July 11, 2015","true","212.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","14","16","6","0"

Although this game might seem hard and unplayable at first (if you are new to AGEOD game style), which I have had the opportunity of experiencing it is only when I came back and played around with the mechanics that I got the game. Honestly it is very simple, you just thave to get the hang of it, this was my first AGEOD game and I must say it is very intimidating but it is really easy to play if you do the tutorial, I usually don't but for this I gave it a try and found it really easy actually. The games goes into great detail of supply, attrition, etc. Not so many games dwelve this deep which is very nice. I greatly appreciate the historical input as well when it comes to events and such, honestly I always thought of AGEOD games to be bad, not going to lie but this game has opened my mind up and in turn I have come to actually really enjoy this game, it says I may have 2 hours (As of now) but I had a lot of offline hours put into this. The soundtrack is amazing as well, who does not like themselves some glorious red army choir?

It took me years to honestly find them that particularly interesting, and their older games had serious preformance issues in terms of turn time. I can safely say Revolution under Siege addresses at least the technical flaws.\n\nThe game takes place during the Russian Civil War and depicts a fairly accurate, and fair representation of both sides and historical/a-historical events. A number of the scenarios in the game are actually fairly different. Unfortunately the game is fairly grognardy and a lot of the concepts are fairly hard to understand at first. Even after having invested 25+ hours into the game and completed a playthrough as Western Whites and the Reds in the grand campaign I can't safely say I completely understand the most effecient way to play the game. However, what I do appreciate is the freedom of action that is present in the game. It truly feels like you are on the edge of your armchair as a general and commanding the very lives and fates of each and every soldier in your corp.\n\nDo I like the game? Yes.

Comparatively, I found the user interface for Hearts of Iron 2 and HOI3 to be child’s play. I don't know how the developers ever devised such a bad control scheme, it's simply horrendous and not intuitive in the least. I still have no idea how to set up armies or even build units after reading the manual and playing for a while. I don't recommend buying this game.","July 2, 2015","false","2.7"," 29 of 98 people (30%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","30","29","98","7","4"

The problem lies in the AGE engine that is designed around the concept of "stack of troops" and these stacks are basically Your main "game pieces", originally intended to represent armies themselves and all army/corps/division arrangements You make do not represent actual divisions or corps. It is just a game element that gives You a bonus if You manage to squeeze a certain amount of troops without penalties.\n\nSomeone could argue that these difficulties to create a regular army from the random groups of irregular troops, represent "historical reality", but I doubt that a game engine was the real reason that did not let Russian whites to stop the reds.\n\nIn the essence, why i do not recommend this game is that the game AI should be the one that provides the challagne to You and not the interface.\n\nAlso I believe that the Russian revolution setting would be great for the different kind of game focusing on the squad level engagements.","July 3, 2015","false","22.4"," 10 of 53 people (19%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","19","10","53","5","0"
