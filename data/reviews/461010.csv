What makes it addicting for me is the level system, and my desire to break personal records.\n\nIf you are still hesitant about picking up Roll'd, please.. watch me broadcast... or something! This game really is worth picking up.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/461010","April 21","true","5.2"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","0"

I bought it due to my prefererence for SAS (short attention span) games and multiple levels to be unlocked with a gradual progression. Figured if I played for an hour it would be reasonable at this remarkably low price. After three days I have most of the achievements and have passed level 40 (of 50 for which achievements are offered.)\n\nThe premise of Roll'd is that instead of the character moving, the path does. Perhaps a small change, but a very nice variation from the norm. At various points new levels and variations are unlocked, as well as new and bizarre "runners". The numerous paths may only be different in appearance, but they certainly look VERY different, and give the feel of not being at all similar in gameplay. If it's an illusion, it's a good one.\n\nThe art and music of Roll'd are really nice, and all in all this is a remarkable game for this low price of less than a dollar. If you like dexterity or running games, Roll'd is certainly one to be considered near the top of the list for players of all ages.\n\nThank you.","April 16","true","3.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","6"

Right now I managed to play it online by inviting some friends that got the game. It's supper cool. Single player is slightly less fun but I think I will play it when I'm bored.\n\nThe game is really cheap but I recommend adding 4-pack purchase option for people who want to play it with friends.\n\nNot sure what was inspiration for a graphic style of the game because it has really different characters and maps. It looks weird. One time I play as some ninja guy, and the oher I play as Limbo guy.\n\nMusic is okay.","April 15","true","0.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","1"

For €0.25, you're getting a small time killer that you can play for 10-15 minutes at a time, trying to beat your old scores and set new ones, perhaps even go the extra mile to try obtain those pesky steam achievements, tied to scores for Easy, Normal & Hard.\n\nUsing A & D to shift the camera to keep you balanced, you're on the path of spirals and slopes, sharp ones too. You've gotta keep your concentration on the path ahead while trying to keep the camera balanced to not fall off from the path. As you die (many, many times), you'll earn XP to rank up and during the process, you'll earn some new skins and level backgrounds alongside additional difficulty modes.\n\nWhat is the game worth?\n\nI wouldn't recommend paying more than €0.50 for it. If you're able to obtain or craft by chance the 75% coupon, it would be easily worth the spare cents for some extra entertainment. Paying €0.50 would be the absolute maximum that could be recommended. Anything above €0.50 and you're going to set yourself up for dissatisfaction.\n\nOverall, I'd give it 6/10 based on the content and slightly 'addictive' gameplay.\n\nScore: Good ( 6 )","May 6","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's nice, yet at the same time, it got annoying after a while.  I think the problem was mainly that it was the same music playing over, and over, and over again.  I finally ended up just turning off the music. There are multiple characters to choose from, but this is done via an unlock/leveling up system.  Map selection also goes off this as well.  It's really nice they offer it as a leveling perk instead of just "You beat the course, here's an unlock!"  What's even better is that even if you die, you still get some levels depending on how far you got.  Considering I'm terrible at this game, that was quite helpful for me.\n\nThe concept of Roll'd is pretty basic and fun.  Don't roll and you win.  Sounds easy, but it can be challenging, which is nice.  I really enjoyed this game, even if I kept dying.  One issue was that even if you were full screen, the actual game was not. It's weird because every other aspect about the game is full screen except for the actual gameplay.  I suppose it's not as big of a deal, and doesn't make too big of a difference, but it'd still be nice if we're in full screen to actually have full screen gameplay.\n\nThere are actually quite a lot of high points about this game.  Controller support, Steam achievements, trading cards, mlocal co-op, multiplayer, and even cross platform multiplayer.  The developers really went all out on this game and made it very much Steam friendly.  On top of this Roll'd is only 0.99 cents.  Pretty good price for this.   I took a look at the developer interaction, and from what I'm seeing, the last developer to community interaction was two weeks ago, and that was simply to step in for a forum moderation role.  According to their Steam page, the last actual update was a month ago.  Given how little the developer is interacting now, it worries me that they've given up on this game.  If that is the case, it's a real shame, because Roll'd is very fun, and had a lot of possibilities.\n\n\nPositives:\n\nCharacter variety.\nUnlock system. (you unlock from completing or failing a course)\nMap variety.\nFun concept.\nController support.\nSteam achievements.\nTrading cards.\nCo-Op.\nMultiplayer.\nCheap.\nNegatives:\n\nEven in full screen the game itself is not full screen.\nMusic gets annoying after a while.\nNo updates in over a month, and communication from the developers has ceased.\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curations.","May 15","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It only took about 20 minutes to 100% it and get all the achievements. Once you that, the game throws a silky smooth difficulty curve at you, and it becomes ADDICTING!

Note that my ability to enjoy a game is not influenced by how I recieved it. If you would like to see the TL;DR, go to the summary at the bottom of the review.\nRoll'd is a simplistic endless runner with the same sort of novelty provided from games such as Timberman.\n\nThe gameplay is, like most simplistic games, simple. You assist a variety of characters through a variety of different worlds by making their journey across different terrains horizontal (to some extent). You do this by pressing the arrow keys for keyboard and left stick for controller. Personally, I found keyboard to be the easiest way to control the game as it felt more precise. In regards to how fun this gameplay is, it's more the type of game you can jump into for 10-15 minutes to try and beat your old highscore. For a single dollar, it gives you a fair amount enjoyment.\n\nRoll'd has decent enough graphics, and an interesting idea of switching up the art style of each area you unlock which manages to keep it mildly refreshing. I did notice that in the second area, the graphics do not seem anywhere near as crisp as they did in the other areas.\n\nThe music tends to get quite repetitive and somewhat annoying. The sounds (e.g. the annoying pig squeal played each time you die) were even more annoying and drove me to switch them off in the settings.\n\nThe only other issue I had was with the fact that the game isn't exactly fullscreen once you start playing.\n\n\nSummary:\nPros:\n✔ Fun game to pop in and play\n✔ Cheap\n✔ Decent graphics\n\nCons:\n✘ Area 2's graphics aren't as high quality (minor issue)\n✘ Music & sounds get annoying\n✘ Not exactly fullscreen\n\nConclusion:\nRoll'd is a bit of fun to entertain you every now and then. Would I recommend it? Sure. It's a small dose of fun that costs you hardly anything, just don't expect too much from it.\n\nRating: 6.6/10\n\nDid you enjoy that review?

Aesthetically its a good looking game, especially with the landscapes, there's replayabilty for sure and is actually quite addicting. So far the only issues i've seen are with the characters you unlock, Though you unlock them after a certain level, they are actually all usable from the beginning. I will say however that the only reason I thought to purchase the game was with a 75% discount. For 25 cents I'd say it's worth it, good to relax and zone-out","June 6","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
