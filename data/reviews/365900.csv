So called "action RPGs" which have a bit of procedural generation but otherwise are simply nothing "like rogue"? Well, this isn't one of those.\n\nIt isn't the most complicated rogue-like, but that's a blessing. There are some horrendously complicated rogue-likes out there, and that makes them hard to understand/master and a bit overwhelming.

This version is more or less identical to the phone version and retains it's charming simplicity to play but is also very difficult to complete. It contains all the main elements of rogue-likes with the permakill and randomised item powers, but has the nice touch that tomes of mastery and armour kits become permanently available for the character classes after reaching certain levels.\n\nPart of my hope in purchasing this is that the dev will continue to add new content now he has some cash behind him.

I've owned this game on my Kindle Fire for a long time, and it is fantastic. The price on Steam is very reasonable for the replayable nature of the game. Could use a volume level setting!\n\nBut first timers are probably asking, what kinda game is this?\n1. It's hardcore-mode. Unless you have a special item (which I've never acquired until the first shop), when you die, you die, no second chance.\n2. Almost entirely randomly generated. The rooms change, and the items/potions also change - what was a health potion last playthrough might be a Toxic Gas potion this time around!\n3. The art style is pixelated, and very cute IMO.\n4. The combat is simple turn based hack-n-slash, point-n-click, but don't let that stop you from trying it. It's still a very challenging game.\n5. Watch out for hidden traps and doors! Use the search function to search nearby blocks, or "cells".\n\nIf this is true to the mobile version, when you play late at night, the game actually gets harder. Such a cool feature to me. If you're looking for a serious dungeon RPG or anything like that, this isn't the game for you.

I never got the Windows version but was happy to throw payment to the devs for the Steam version for the past fun I had with the game.\nThe graphics are charming and look great even for pixel characters, if you have been with this for awhile you know the extra efforts put into little things like backround, lighting and etc over the bunch of updates it had since being created.  Now it's the norm "rougelike" and permadeath that will leave you tearing your hair out most times, but still drawing you back for more.  Having great armor and weapons but dying of hunger is a common thing,  or having lardders of food and getting beat to hell by the monsters.  The number of times I have died to a gnoll on the 2nd level is almost uninstall worthy.\nFor those of you from the early PC days, and I don't mean Starcraft or Diablo, but C64 days of yore and where most games were permadeath (unless you pulled the disk out of the drive after you died quick enough or created another character disc) there was a shining creation of a game called Sword of Fargoal.  Pixel could be the direct great, great grandson of Fargoal, both share many traits and each their own also, which when I found Pixel I was brought back to those great days and fell in love with the game.\nThe game is easy to learn and can be played for hours or a few quick minutes with auto save when you quit.  Classes play different as a difficulty system somewhat with added bonuses for each class.  Pretty much click where you want to go, click to pick up, click to attack/throw/use item etc, very nice for a sit back and relax game.  Potions and scrolls have to be identified or fingers crossed used to find out what they do, sometimes with horrible results.\nI know there are plenty of reviews on this game allready with gameplay and pros vs cons but for me it is a rekindling of my great years playing PC games which were designed to be hard and have days or months of playing time with no internet faq or walkthrough to help you with the game.  This is a great game period, worth the $5, for me yes and a review if it's worth the money, very much so.

I don't really play many rougelike games. The only game like this I really loved was Fatal Labyrinth from Sega Genesis. Pixel Dungeon brings all the best elements and then some. I've been playing for over a month and I barely made it to the Boss on level 5  before it ate me.\n\nI like the challenge and the random levels. It's kinda like poker. You will get awesome levels, just like a royal flush. You will also get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ levels where ghosts chase you around. I love that I can be killed at any corner. It gives you a true sense of danger and keeps you from running around without thinking about it first.\n\nI am giving a good review now but I truly hope that in the future we keep seeing updates that are cooler than the many modded versions on Android. I'll end with a list of missing features that I would love to see in the future.\n\nLevel Editor\nMultiplayer\nController Support\nMod Support\nCreate-A-Character\nMore customization options, rename characters, items, etc.","May 30, 2015","true","5.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There are better dungeon crawlers out there although for a turn-based one it does things pretty well. My three major gripes with it are the Hunger System, Attack System and the Item System.\n\nHunger is bull, it's hard enough keeping your health up but having to go out of your way to search a level that may or may not have any food on it is stupid, either remove the system or reduce the frequency of its occurences because the Item System isn't helping either.\n\nThe Item System is interesting, the fact that with Potions, Armour and Weapons you don't know what will happen until you try it is cool, I really like that feature and find it a bit humourous when I drink a potion not thinking to just throw it first and then self-igniting myself. The issue with this system is that the items are rare and sparce, you may go through an entire level and pick up maybe 2-3 items (excluding Dew Drops and Seeds but they're not that useful). Also I often find that it's only after I reach level 3 usually that I actually have a new Sword and Armour, it's annoying that it's that far down and the enemies can do near identical damage to you which makes it a real pain when you just need a Healing Potion or some better armour but you can't get to it because you keep getting killed before you can find any, because the items are so rare in this game.\n\nThe last one, and I swear to eveyone's based god, the most crippling one to this game, the attack system. The attack system is absolute crap, you will miss more times than you will hit, while your enemies will hit nearly all the time. I can understand with an enemy like the Wraith, as its a ghost that it's hard to hit but when I start at full health with a Healing Potion and can't hit this guy once before dying, that's too far and the Wraith don't even do that much damage so it was a good 12-20 hits. The other thing is that enemies are almost random with the amount of damage they do, I've fought rats that'll deal 1 and 2 damage and I was thinking that I was going to kill it and then it deals a 5 and I'm dead, seriously, the second level introduces this enemy, I can't remember the name for but looks like a squirrel-sort of and it deals a consecutive 3-4 damage almost all the time where I'm luck to land a 6 on them. It's such a pain getting killed by a single creature and it's so annoying when the only thing it says above the enemy is evaded, evaded, evaded, dodged, dodged, evaded. It's painful to watch something like that happen.\n\nSo if you want a game that'll kill you within 4 levels with no more than 30 enemies get this game, but if your looking for a genuinly fun and enjoyable Dungeon Crawler where each venture is very different, then keep looking because this game is relentless.","June 5, 2015","false","1.6"," 7 of 38 people (18%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","18","7","38","4","2"

You can choose from 3 character classes: the Warrior, the Mage, and the Rogue. You can unlock the Huntress at a later time. Your goal is to head to the bottom of the dungeon and escape with the prize. This game is quite challenging, with a large selection of weapons, armors, rings, potions, and scrolls plus a good amount of other items to play with.\n\nIt can be played with only the mouse, or only the keyboard, or you can use elements of both. Controls are very customizable and smooth. There's also partial controller support at the time of this review being typed(July 4th), however the devs are working on full controller support, and will be adding more content as the go on.
