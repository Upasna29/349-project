This game is a love letter to Q Entertainment. (Because its not made by them)\n\nChime is a block dropping game in which not quite Tetris pieces are randomly given to you to place onto the board. The main goal is to create quadrilaterals using the slightly unfamiliar pieces. I should mention the blocks do not actually “drop” You can place them anywhere on the board and as such the possibilities are greater so the game demands your combos and coverage to be better than traditional “falling” block games.\n\nThis game takes from Lumines more than the others. You build quadrilaterals and then a timer starts until it becomes solid in which you must add to it before solidification for more points and combo scores. Once solid, a bar that sweeps the screen collects the solid stuff you have made. And this continues until you have amassed enough to unlock the next stage. Its unfortunate that even in free mode you cannot even preview what the next stages song will be as unlocking new stages requires play in the timed mode.\n\nThe reason I say it borrows from those games is because of how the gameplay is integrated into the music. The more elaborate the combos the more flare is added to the music; and the music is phenomenal.\n\nTHE GIST\nI was pretty big into Lumines back during the days of the original PSP. And this game captures some of that original feeling. By that I mean a good but new sort of puzzle game that is not exactly Tetris or in this case not exactly Lumines.","February 17","true","2.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

But it is more flexible. The pieces are shaped out of five squares. You have to build bigger blocks with them. There are six levels with different combinations of shapes. Music is part of the experience. It changes due to your progress. But it's still the same track. This could be annoying if you play Chime too much. In that case you can mute the music. There is some kind of mouse lag which depends on the level. Sometimes when you have no time this could be frustrating. But most of the time it is not. Nevertheless Chime is still a great game.

Very nicely polished, very clean and colourful presentation and pleasant syncing of the music with the placed pieces.

Understandably there's no easy way to fix that.\n\nThe pace of the gameplay can be quite demanding on the player.

You'd clear the board and score points when you build up 2x2 blocks of the same colour, when a line would slide across the screen and take them out.\n\nIn Chime, you don't need to worry about colour, but the pieces are all different configurations of 5 squares connected, much like tetris' 4 squares. You can move, rotate, and place them anywhere on the grid. The 'beatline' will move in time with the music, setting off events when it hits the shapes. If you have a solid blocks of 3x3 or more, they will disappear after a short while, give better music samples, and stamped down a completed section on the grid. The aim is to get 100% coverage on these grids before the time runs out.\n\nThis game is great if you want to fill in time, or if you're into mixing a few tunes with samples based on how well you play. Probably a small cult following for that. In the end, since there are only 6 or 7 level/songs to play, it only becomes a grind to try to get 100% coverage on each level, not really much more than that.\n\nPretty good if on sale, not really something to put in a wishlist though.\n\n6/10","September 1, 2014","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I prefer the first game because of For Silence that I discovered there.\n\nChime is a puzzle game where the music plays a role. Let me copy/paste what I've written for the sequel.\n\nYou have to cover a surface with blocks, so that a "quad" (generally when you have at least 3x3) can be formed and expanded. Once it's over, the quad disappear during the next passage of the beat, letting parts of the blocks used on the grid. And after a moment, they'll glow if unused and you'll loose the multiplier and the unused stuff.\n\nHere, you have a free mode and a timed mode. You have also achievements, some of them are challenging.\n\nFor the Steam Edition, you have also Still Alive from Portal. It's because of that song that I bought Chime and got hooked on For Silence.\n\nThe best is to try the game, because surely, while I can explain it with my memory, you'll be better to buy it and play. 4 euros isn't expensive at all for the game.","November 19, 2010","true","64.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

Chime is, deep down, basically the same game. You move blocks around creating larger blocks and when the beat kicks in you get points. The trick is, of course, to create as many blocks as possible to gain a big score. The levels are not rectangular like in Lumines, but they have several different shapes. It can be challenging. But fun at the same time though.\nSo if you like puzzles, music or a combination of these two then Chime is your game.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]","December 26, 2011","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can be as casual or as arcade about the game as you like. It is a good amount of fun for about an hour, allowing replayability with high scores, setting personal goals like clearing the level 3 times before you time out, or even just trying to get the best sounding result. Unfortunately it's hard to find direction in this game without coming up wiht it yourself.\n\nIt is unfortunate how there are only 6 songs. If there were 10 songs I'd be satisfied. If there were 30 songs I would buy multiple copies for my friends so we could compete. I understand that this was a game linked to a charity, and there was likely a budget (or a deadline) that had to be kept, but it's really not enough to justify the game on its own for its price. It really is a nice game with lots of potential. Had there been a custom song feature (even if it allowed a maximum of 2 minutes with any custom song) I would've played this game for hours on end.\n\nThis is a nice game to get gifted, on sale, or with a coupon, but not for it's entirety of it's price. However, I am very excited for Chime 2 which should be coming out soon, featuring many more songs, levels, and modes. I would reccomend saving your money for the sequel instead of this game. I would consider this game better as an extention to the sequel, but on it's own it's simply not enough.","February 7, 2014","false","7.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Gameplay mechanics are terribly confusing until the random loading hints set you straight, so keep some things in mind:\n\n1. "Coverage" is not solid after the bar passes over it once. You can play pieces over removed rectangles, in spite of the color change of the playing field.\n2. Losing your combo does not actively harm you. It's okay to have fragments disappear. In fact, this is sometimes helpful for survival.\n3. Full pieces do not lose "life" as the bar passes over them. Only "fragments," which are created when only part of a full piece is destroyed.\n\nThe game never really makes this clear, but once you figure it out, it's kind of fun.\n\nNonetheless, there's not much replayability with only five levels, but for a game with proceeds that go to charity, it's worth the very low cost.","December 16, 2010","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reccomended!","December 24, 2010","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a mixture between tetris and volfied. Use tetris style blocks and arrange them to enable capture coverage of an area. The bigger the area you cover, the better your score will be.\n\nThere are a total of 6 stages which can be completed in either timed or free mode. Timed mode basically sets a time in which to complete the stage, and of course more coverage also means more time added. If you manage to to do it, free mode will then be unlocked for you to enjoy the stage at your leisure with no time limit.\n\nThe game is simple and relaxing to play. The music is a good eclectic mix of smooth electronica tunes which are actually composed by real life music artistes such as Moby or Orbital. Tis a bit of a shame that there are only 6 stages available for play.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.0 / 10\nProbably not worth to buy at full price, but still worth a look if its on sale and if you are looking for a nice relaxing musical tetris like game.","July 19, 2012","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the price that I paid, it was definitely worth it. A combination of tetris and music genre games. The aim of the game is to create quads, simple as that. When a quad is formed it will then take some time to solidify. During this period you can keep making the quad bigger and bigger to get more points. When you first play it, you will have little clue how to score big points. For example, it took me a while to work out you can stack shapes on top of the "cleared" space. Is it worth it? For $5 you only get 6 levels but it's a game that is replayable.

Its a mixture between tetris and volfied. Use tetris style blocks and arrange them to enable capture coverage of an area. The bigger the area you cover, the better your score will be.\n\nThere are a total of 6 stages which can be completed in either timed or free mode. Timed mode basically sets a time in which to complete the stage, and of course more coverage also means more time added. If you manage to to do it, free mode will then be unlocked for you to enjoy the stage at your leisure with no time limit.\n\nThe game is simple and relaxing to play. The music is a good eclectic mix of smooth electronica tunes which are actually composed by real life music artistes such as Moby or Orbital. Tis a bit of a shame that there are only 6 stages available for play.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.0 / 10\nProbably not worth to buy at full price, but still worth a look if its on sale and if you are looking for a nice relaxing musical tetris like game.","July 19, 2012","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chime would be the result.\n\nYou have various block shapes and you have to piece them together until they disappear from the board. Simple enough right? Well, it's not as simple as "fill up a row and it disappears".\n\nYou have to form rectangular areas of 3x3 or larger called "Quads". Making a quad marks off that part of the board as "finished", and the ultimate goal is to finish as much territory on a board as possible (50% or higher to get to the next level).\n\nThis alone would be an interesting concept, but they coupled it with Music. As you put pieces down, a "beat" line goes across the board in time to the music. Each piece sounds off a different note, and each quad sounds off a different sound bite from a song. The resulting music can be quite beautiful.\n\nA good sign that this is a worthy puzzle game is the fact that on my first time playing it, I played for almost 2 hours before I realized time had passed.","November 20, 2010","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can also be fun to see if you can do better than your Steam friends as the game provides various ways of comparing scores and times.\nCons: There are only 6 songs. You'll likely tire of them after a while and want to move on to a new game. There's a Chime Super Deluxe being released exclusively for PS3 that includes new music, co-op and versus modes, though. So maybe that will eventually make it to PC.\nReplayable: Only as much as you have patience to hear the same songs over and over again.

Not much changes from level to level, so it's not something you'd want to sit down and play for a long time.\n\nHowever, it's not a bad concept, and the first 5-10 minutes of each song CAN be pretty cool as you discover the different sounds that the shapes can make.

It can also be fun to see if you can do better than your Steam friends as the game provides various ways of comparing scores and times.\nCons: There are only 6 songs. You'll likely tire of them after a while and want to move on to a new game. There's a Chime Super Deluxe being released exclusively for PS3 that includes new music, co-op and versus modes, though. So maybe that will eventually make it to PC.\nReplayable: Only as much as you have patience to hear the same songs over and over again.

If you like tetris then you will most certainly like this game. It isn't quite the same, the blocks don't fall out of the sky, and most of the shapes are not tetrominos.\n\nThis is a very fun and addictive little game. I wholeheartedly recommend it. The only major con is that there isn't even -more- of it! However, as you see with my play time so far you will likely get many hours of enjoyment.\n\nPlus of course I must mention that there is a Portal board.\n\nGameplayThe idea is to place each shape on the board and fit them in like a tetris game. Your goal is to "colour in" the entire play area (defined by the white borders). As you create squares of blocks that are 3x3 or larger, they form an area that begins to time out. You can either add more blocks to increase the size of this area, or let it time out to clear some more space on the board.\n\nYes, there are only six boards, and each has a specific song (no customization of the music) but each board has as many levels as you can keep going for. It's a fair challenge just to get past the first level of any given board, which is done by "colouring in" every square on the board before the time runs out. Your goal is really self-inflicted to get as big a score as you can.\n\nThere are also achievements to this game, and some get you to explore a different way of playing. For a less stressful play there is also a timeless mode. Each board has a different set of shapes that you must get used to and learn how to most efficiently place.\n\nControlsEntirely mouse driven. The shape is essentially attached to your mouse pointer. It will move when you move your mouse. You then click to place the shape where you've positioned it.\n\nStorylineNo storyline, doesn't need one!\n\nSoundThere are six different songs, one for each board. They are a bit techno for my liking and I found a couple of them to be extremely irritating - to the point that I would call them noise, not music. However there is an epic board which I can play almost endlessly for the sheer joy of listening to GLADOS singing.\n\nRegardless of my opinion of the actual songs, I found it very interesting how the music builds up in reaction to your level progress. If you're doing well then you get more music (different layers of sounds) and if you aren't doing so well, or its the start of the level, the music is more subdued.\n\nGraphicsNothing spectacular. I would say the graphics are functional. They support the user's understanding of the game and how to play. The colour schemes are pleasant. This isn't a section that I'd say is bad, the graphics just aren't remarkable, and nor do they need to be.\n\nPros+ easy to pick up, hard to be really good at\n+ many hours of enjoyment\n+ portal music and companion cubes!\n+ leaving you wanting more\nCons- some irritating music tracks\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

The classic Tetris game is the total opposite, you only misplace pieces when you're too hasty, but here you often wonder "what to do with this stupid block", even if you have all the time in the world. This flaw in the CORE MECHANIC of the game puts me off.\n\nThe fact that there are only 6 songs is not a problem for me at all, although some of them are totally not my taste,\n\nAnd there is not enough feedback on when you achieved to extend your time limit. I haven't figured out the rules for that, and before I go look up a guide or whatever, I'd really recommend the game to give some feedback on the screen.\n\nTL;DR: This looks like a polished puzzle game, but there are little, but very annoying design flaws that make it sink.\n\nPS: the game has non-existing tracking of your progress for very grindy achievements. For example, you have to fill the width of the board in all the levels, but it doesn't tell you in which levels you still have to do this, or you have to get a multiplier of 17 on a certain level (aquiring a companion cube), and you have to do that 50 times and 100 times, but the game doesn't show you how many times you already did that.","August 20, 2015","false","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There.\n\nThis puzzle game has a much bigger emphasis on music, without simply applying graphics to a beat - your choice of location and shape of pieces can affect the song's rythm, style and beat, making the audio in each game somewhat unique. The setlist features music by Philip Glass, Orbital, Lemon Jelly and others, and moves from haunting to beautiful to lively, as the playing field and shapes change,\n\nBuild larger sets of shapes for a bigger bonus, and try to cover the level 100% in pieces to win, but the count doesn't stop at 100%, or even 200% - so keep trying.\n\nAn absolute must for puzzle nuts with quick minds and fingers who don't want an awful loop playing in the background while they perfect their mental artform.

This is a very addictive and time consuming game. You might think that getting all the level objectives is easy, yet it is not. Paying attention to creating non-fragment groups is thee most importat adivce I can give. One you have too many fragments you will surely not be able to make it. The key would be to start small and build large to stack that multiplier up high and get massive points before the time runs out. This is all about skill placement and also being able to use the entire board to clear it.\n\nDon't pay attention to neg reviews, if you like skill puzzles this is for you!  I personally also like Dark Souls, Fallout, and more so if that tells you anything I put this game right up there as if it was the Dark Souls of Puzzle Games.","May 1","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A percentage of revenue from sales also goes to charity, so it's really a no brainer to recommend this.","December 20, 2010","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Build up combos to embellish the song. The bigger the combo, the more embellishments. Watch out though! If you can't keep the combo going, unused blocks disappear and the music goes back to the way it was!\n\n\nAmazingly fun. Wish there were more track but I definitely reccomend!","May 16","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
