"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuuIsHuu/recommended/17430/","HuuIsHuu","huu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuuIsHuu/","177 products in account","Where do I start with this.\n\nNeed for Speed Undercover has been bashed, beaten & overall just despised by the entire Need for Speed community, often described as "one of the absolute worst Need for Speed games ever made". But, judging you see that giant blue thumbs up, you obviously can tell that I don't think that way.\n\nNow, those of you who really hate long reviews (because there's gonna be quite a lengthy one ahead), here's a short pros-n'-cons review to not waste your time:\n\nPros:+Can run on a toaster\n+Great soundtrack\n+Huge car selection\n+Easy-to-follow story\n+Simple controls that are even very playable on a keyboard\n+Visuals are passable\n+Gameplay is rather fun\n\nCons:-Story is inconsistent and highly forgettable\n-Visual glitches regarding the sky & the sun (sun flies from one part of the screen to the other while the sky spins in a nauseating fashion)\n-Horrible racer & cop AI\n-No "Perfect Start" (a prominent feature in Most Wanted, Carbon & World)\n-Steam Overlay (unfortunately) does not work with Undercover, due to EA not patching out the old, outdated Steam Overlay DLLs in the game's files\n\nDo I recommend?If you just want a racing game where you could really care less for story & want one that can run on your toaster computer, then yes, NFS Undercover should fill that niche for you quite nicely & I recommend the game for the price it's asking.\n\nNow then, short review done. Let's get on with the long review!\n\nThe Story & The Characters:I'm not gonna bother with a brief synopsis of the story, since that's what the store page basically tells you. But what I will give will be my thoughts on the story. So. I think the story in Undercover is garbage. It's very sloppily put together. Some characters come & go without a proper explanation, some characters are given NO INTRODUCTION and just sort of...appear, other characters for some reason or another just swap roles mid-story, eh, you get the point. I get that it's to be expected that a racing game will have a terrible story, but back when this game was announced & being promoted like the next best thing, it tried to take itself seriously, with all the trailers & promotional videos. So, yes, the story is trash, introduces characters & gets rid of characters periodically & tries to take itself way too seriously, which is why I don't like it & find it very forgettable. It shouldn't take you more than 10 hours to beat the entire story, I, for one, beat the single player campaign in around 8 hours & now am doing my second runthrough on the Steam version of this game, just for the sake of adding in more gameplay hours.\n\nThe Visuals & Audio:Before I move on to the meat of the review, being the gameplay, I wanna briefly go over the game's visuals. They look...passable. Now, I've had the pleasure of experiencing this game both in 1080p Ultra Settings & 360p Very Low Settings, and generally - I am impressed with the framerate. The game (for the most part) is very consistent with the framerate on newer hardware & back when my good PC was still alive & played this game for the 8 hours it took to complete the single player campaign, the framerate was crazy-stable at 60 FPS, with sometimes dropping below when there were too many cops at once, which is understandable. As for the visuals themselves, everything in the game world, including the road you drive on & the water beyond the shores looks "alright" at best. Yes, Black Box has done MUCH better in terms of visuals in Carbon & even Most Wanted, but I don't think the game looks ugly by any means, but certainly doesn't live up to the 2008 year it came out on. And the audio? The car sounds are remarkably pleasant to listen to, giving off the feeling that the car you drive FEELS like an actual car and not a freaking go-kart. The soundtrack is picked rather well & there are a handful of songs I don't like, sure, I like most of the soundtrack.\n\nThe Gameplay:And now, we move on to the meat of the review - the gameplay. Need for Speed Undercover's gameplay tries to emulate the critically-acclaimed gameplay of Most Wanted & Carbon while trying to introduce enough new things to stand on its own. First of all - the controls are great. Every car feels very responsive & turning even with the slowest of muscle cars while using a keyboard, not a controller or wheel, felt super reliable & the car showed no signs of delayed turns or any kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t some racing games usually have, which is great, as great control is what makes the game great. There are, however, a few things I really don't like about the gameplay. Gone from Most Wanted & Carbon are perfect starts, which require to get your speedometer stick on a certain part of the actual speedometer when it changes color to give your car a bit of a necessary boost when you start, unless you want to drag on for about 30 seconds, trying to catch up to your opponents. Thankfully though, Undercover's AI is built around the lack of perfect start, so it's not like they'll speed up instantly, no, they'll generally start out at pretty much the same pace as you do. NFS Undercover has a multitude of game modes, with a few brand new game modes, never-before-seen in any previous Need for Speed game, or even any sub-sequent games - Jobs & Highway Battles. Briefly about the other game modes - they're standard fare what you'd find in other Need for Speed games - you got Circuit, Sprint, Checkpoint, Outrun (making a return from Underground 2) & Police Events. About those "exclusive" game modes, as it were. First - Jobs. Jobs are essentially your character stealing a car & then driving said car to a drop-off point, meanwhile cops are after your ♥♥♥ and your goal is to escape the cops & get to the drop off point. This game mode doesn't have a time limit of any sorts, so you can breathe in relief, however - some jobs do have damage meters, which are rather easy to deplete. Highway Battles are sort of glorified high-speed canyon events from Need for Speed Carbon, just with ♥♥♥♥-tons of traffic & only 1 stage. The goal in Highway Battle is to get ahead of your opponent & lead by 300 m (or 1000 ft if you're using the Imperial system) whilist trying to not wreck your car with the insane amounts of traffic around you. These 2 exclusive game modes are generally executed very well, with the opponent AI sometimes being crafty enough to try and block your path by purposefully pushing traffic cars into you & they take advantage of every opportunity to overtake you and make your day horrible, should you ♥♥♥♥ up midway in the race. Making a return from Need for Speed ProStreet is domination, but this time - instead of completing an entire area to "dominate", dominations are handed out if you can manage to beat the developer time for each race in the game, not counting Jobs. Early game, beating the developer "domination" time is quite easy, but later down the road - it gets more & more difficult. For Customization - if you've played ProStreet & seen that game's insanely expansive customization system, then Undercover will bring nothing new and you can jump straight in. But for the new guys? I'll throw it out there right now - customizing your car (other than its performance) does nothing and won't give you any benefits like in ProStreet. They're just there if you want your car to look nicer, but be warned - if you will ever decide to play online (which will happen only if you have someone who plays this game after 7 years), your vinyls that you apply to your car will not be shown. Why? Who the hell knows, but they disabled it. I haven't spent much time in the customization menu myself, so I really can't comment on anything here.\n\nFinal Verdict & Score:Due to the Steam Review Character limit, the rest of this review is in screenshot format.[puu.sh]","October 16, 2015","true","12.3"," 120 of 126 people (95%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","95","120","126","18","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcjobless/recommended/17430/","mcjobless","Hugh Wotmeigh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcjobless/","590 products in account","About 5+ years ago, I got this on release, and played this on Xbox 360. I hated it. I absolutely thought it was the worst game that could have ever been produced.\n\nRecently I bought this at a Steam sale, thinking that I might as well just put down my $5 into some random cheap racing game, hoping it would provide even an hours entertainment. I'm so happy with this purchase. I regret my constant stream of hate.\n\nGranted, this is definately not the pinnicle of NFS (Underground 2/Most Wanted 2005 will always be), and that's clear through some poor design desicions regarding the lack of a main menu, the fact you can't change graphics quality until you actually get to play the game (about 5 minutes of cutscenes), and even the fact that there's too much bloom and there's some weird glitches with the lights floating a la Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing.\n\nBut, with all the negatives said and done, this...this is the most fun I've had in a racing game in years. It seems like the devs tried to be as faithful as they could to Most Wanted, while still moving forward with the rest of the game. The cars control FANTASTICALLY on PC compared to console, and the selection of vehicles is awesome, especially considering the Bugatti Veyron (which, gladly thanks to the Master Events balancing the field, isn't game-breaking). The length of the game is awesome, with a huge amount of things to do. The police chases are fantastic, and polished much further than Most Wanted (admittadely though, I'll always prefer the down-right hilariously poor AI of Most Wanted's cops, and their over-the-top voice acting).\n\nOverall, this really probably didn't recieve a lot of the backlash it got from fans. If you're a Most Wanted fan who has been disillusioned with the Need for Speed franchise as of late, you can do no harm in buying this game and reliving a time just before Criterion broke everything. And before The Run existed...","December 9, 2013","true","11.5"," 144 of 165 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","144","165","0","12"

Almost depressingly easy. So easy, you'd want to keep a lower-leveled car around just to give yourself a challenge.\n\nNo, seriously. Except for one time some dude in a Dodge Viper challenged me to a 1-on-1 race, I still outran him in a 1969 Camaro. Sure, it took me 20+ tries, but I did it.\n\nAnd finally, children: Don't be afraid to alt+F4 the game if you're about to get arrested and you know you wouldn't be able to afford the impound retrieval costs. It's easier to spend a minute loading the game back up than it is getting enough money to get another car.","August 26, 2014","true","33.1"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","42","49","9","0"

But it is not that big because you can get pinkslips as you clear other missions and easily collect money and buy a better car.\nThe biggest problem is physics which breaks the game and makes player difficult or sometimes almost impossible to control the car.\nBut overall great game with big open world, Which is the last nfs with STORY, COPS, TUNE UPS, and FREEDRIVE.\nSee what happened to NFS these days. They are just burnout series with supercars.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brummbrummquietsch/recommended/17430/","Brummbrummquietsch","Brummbrummquietsch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brummbrummquietsch/","244 products in account","I bought this game for around 5 bucks and after finishing it I'm not completely, but very disappointed so I give this game a thumb down. Main reason for this: This game has NO replayability and you probably won't even bother to finish it. Reasons see below.\n\nFirst of all: The races and missions are always depending on luck, I guess. Some races / missions are ridiculously easy, some are nearly unbeatable. Sometimes you flee from the police and you're completing the mission in under a minute and the next day you're failing at a similar mission even after ten tries. Especially the high way battles (where you have to stay ahead for x seconds or lead at least for x meters) are unfair beyond belief. Sometimes I thought a race against light itself would be easier.\n\nMission vary from 'Sprint', 'Curcuits', 'Getaways', 'Cop takeouts', 'Causing costs to state' (boring as hell, since you only gain XP, and no money at all) and some missions, where you always have to get away or take out some other drivers.\n\nThe "Speed braker" adds a great deal of fun to it. Which brings me to the fact that, when you hit the wall, you will ALWAYS end up being either stuck exactly when not more than 90° to the wall or completely reserved when you try to accelerate / manouver your way out. After so many hours and races it happened constantly, so I'm sure the makers thought: "Well, the game is already unfair hard, what else can we do to frustrate a gamer? How about your car gets stuck or completely reserved after hitting a wall in a tiny bend?"\n\nAnd of course, like in every single racing game: ALL other racers are in one place. Meaning when you're at 1st place and you make just a tiny mistake ALL other racers will overtake you and you're last. And believe me, the other racers in the later races are getting REALLY hard and unfair, like hitting your tail and stuff. And guess what? You always have to be 1st, or you won't get any reward. Why didn't they thought of a 2nd or 3rd place, with at least a part of the money to show some appreciation of the time I spent on that race?\n\nI also missed an "Test drive car" - option before purchasing a car. Wasting a fortune for the Bugatti Veyron (which accelerates like a rocket and steeres harder than a tank with a house on top of it) is kinda disappointing. Oh and don't expect ANY reward for finishing the game, like all cars, bling bling money, a special car, gimmick, anything else etc - you're not getting anything, except closing credits.\n\nThe tuning system is easy to use and minimalistic, except where you can buy a paint job. Worst. Interface. Ever, if you use a controller. I even had to use keyboard plus controller to do a paint job. Well done, makers, really. Are you satisfied with all the drugs you take?\n\nThe game gets harder and harder, but not in a challenging, but an ultra-unfair way which will drive you (no pun intended) effin insane. I played half of the game with the first Muscle Car I got via a Pink Slip, until I could afford an Audi Quattro TT. This went good for a while. After I bought the Zonda from Tier 1 I had absolutely NO chance in a race, because I hadn't enough money to buy also both Power and Handling - "Ultimate" packs for my car, which all of the other cars obviously had. Frustrating, because I had to go back to my already maxed out Audi and finish a dozen races under my current league until I could afford the upgrades.\n\nI also tried to cheat because I nearly smashed my controller through my LCD into the wall. Cheats are absolutely, f-word ridiculous. There is a cheat for 10.000 credits. Nice, eh, typing it in a thousand times and go shopping big time, eh? Nope. It's, like all cheats, a disposable cheat, meaning you only can use it ONCE. Like the game itself. Disposable. So in a game where cars cost about 300.000 credits and not to mention tuning and upgrade packages where you could buy a whole city, 10.000 credits as a disposable cheat ain't just quite cutting the deal. Where they drunk when they made those game plus cheats? No, they were obviously thinking about letting another good franchise going down the drain big time.\n\nOh, and by the way. How can you tell you're playing NFS? After you've reached your maximum speed of ~350km/h, you're gonna be overtaken. By a flying police jeep of two-and-a-half tons. And all other enemies. Speed's just a number, after all, eh?\n\nSo the longtime-fun is found somewhere else, this game has absolutely no value left after a few races or about maybe ten hours. I now own the Zonda with all upgrades and the races got too hard. Just a single minor mistake or getting hit by another driver (who drive like they're in effin Carmageddon) and you can restart all over. I mean, I'm not a pro gamer, either I'm bad at it, I just want a racing game to be fun, race now and then a few circuits, have fun. And not be frustrated more and more AFTER I have the best equipment in the game and finished it already.\n\nFurther you get stuck later in the game. I finished the game. Now I own the Paganini Zonda, a Lamborghini Gallardo, an Audi Quattro TT, a Porsche GT2 and a few pink slips from other cars (which can't be sold, just be removed. Sense, please?). The latter missions will earn you 25.000 to 35.000 credits and you will spend it all on cars, upgrades, paint jobs and aftermarket stuff (like spoilers etc). But then, after maybe four, five fully upgraded cars there's no races left (only old ones, which will earn you peanuts of 2.000 credits each or so), but there are still so many cars and upgrades left to try and buy.\n\nSo when all the missions and races are won, you're gonna be stuck with your five good, maxed out cars. And you will have to start a new game to drive all the other cars. Where are the good old times, when finishing a racing game unlocked the complete car list? I'm not willing to start five new games just to see, drive and have all cars in the game.\n\nHere are also some other thoughts:\n\nMenues: The menu is very well sorted, tidied up and everything is easy to use, even with a controller. Great! That's how you do it. Bravo.\n\nIntros: Couldn't care less about these annoying things and they are not skipable. Cutscenes are skipable, after you've played the mission once.\n\nGraphics: Graphics are not important in a game. NFS:U is acceptable, there are games with better and worse graphics. For me (I own an older pc) they were just fine and, like said, of no importance.\n\nStory: I couldn't care less about a story in a racing game. I mean, what's the big deal? Car, this is player, player, this is your car. Take the controller, hit the buttons, wipe the floor with your enemies and have fun. Early in the game I muted the volume of "Voice" in the menu to 0, because in one mission I had to chase someone and every two seconds a voice said "Catch on" or "Go faster!", like this wasn't the thing I was doing. Good thing after muting: All cut scenes were muted. So I didn't know what the story was all about but from what I saw the story was more boring, mediocre, filled with not B- but C- and D-movie actors.\n\nOverall: For a small price like five to ten bucks it's a great, action packed game to play now and then which will serve a few hours of fun until you experience the things I mentioned in my review.","December 16, 2013","false","18.0"," 72 of 125 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","72","125","7","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkia87/recommended/17430/","genkia87","Genkia87","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkia87/","10 products in account","Need For Speed Undercover. Intended to be a true successor to Most Wanted (The 2005 version...not Burnout Paradise 2), this game has received its fair share of hate and throughout all of these years, i never understood why to be perfectly honest. After the less then stellar Pro Street, i was extremely hyped for this game at the time and when i played it, initially i thought it was an absolute blast and lived up to Most Wanted in every way.\n\nBut again, that was in 2008. How does the game hold up to today's standards?\n\nWell. Suprisingly well id say. Its not even close to how good i thought it was back in the day (Bare in mind, this was back when i loved racing games and i was a Total NFS fanboy) but its still a pretty exciting racer and the hate it received wasnt exactly what it deserved. It truly was the last TRUE Need For Speed, before the series would become Burnout (Hot Pursuit was basically Takedown, MW2012 is Paradise 2, as stated). That being said, lets get a few things out of the way. If your expecting a truly engaging story with memorable characters, unexpected plot twists and perfect pacing with pitch perfect acting...then just stop, like seriously. The story is completely disjointed and random. Stuff happens for no reason and characters come and go without any rhyme or reason. And the cutscenes...my god...the dialogue is without a doubt completely unbearable. Most Wanted and Carbon were cheesy, but in a way that gave it style. Here, it just feels forced...that or these people cant write or act at all. A particular character, Rose, is without a doubt the worst. Her dialogue is just the worst ive heard in awhile. Suffice to say, im sad that the story failed. The idea of being deep undercover of some kind of crime syndicate always intrigued me and EA couldve really did something here.\n\nAnywho, enough of the story. The racing and cop chases are where this game strive off of and i feel that while its not at the heights of Most Wanted, its still good enough that you can see yourself having allot of fun with this game. The sense of speed is crazy, and the car handling is less torpedo like and allows you to casually cut corners like a pro, which goes really far into making you feel like a real bad ♥♥♥! The courses are layered out with plenty of ways to overcome other racers and you always feel like you have a chance even if the race isnt going good. Then the police chases, which is one of my personal favorite mission types, are just pure intensity, particularly when your Wheelman level goes up and the odds against you get higher and higher. Also, i love the small touch of being able to press a single button to hop into another race on the spot. It allows you to simply hop into a match without surfing into map screens and i for one love the small touch. The game is extremely easy to run too. Throwing it on max settings shouldnt be too difficult and 60FPS isnt going to be far from reach either.\n\nThis might be a preference thing, but the keyboard controls are Meh at best. You can totally work with it, as i found it atleast playable...but if you have a 360 Remote laying about, or any other form of Gamepad, id highly reccomend using it. The game feels much more slick this way and it really pays off.\n\nNow for the things i didnt like. The AI is inconsistent to say the least. In races, expect to always see the opponents lag MILES behind you. Even towards the end of the game, this happens pretty often. Im under the assumption that you could EASILY beat this game with the starter vehicle, which is kindda sad. Then theres the "Master Races" which is the perfect showcaser of why the series frequent use of Rubber Banding is a joke. You literally have to ensure you make NO mistakes...yet even when your doing perfect, someone will be glued to your ♥♥♥ like a Magnet and side swipe you when your close to victory. You can try to rear end them but they stay glued to the road as you plumet to the side of the road in shame. At these moments, i really wish we had the progression of Need For Speed Most Wanted, where the game got more and more difficult as you made your way down the blacklist. Hell, even Carbon with its Rubbery AI had a feeling of progession. As for the cop chases...they have issues too. Dont get me wrong, they are still fun, but the Police are just too forgiving. Cops often stand back, allowing you to easily out run them, and even in the higher intervals, they give you space to escape being boxed in. Also for whatever reason, they eventually call off all their units after awhile, abruptly ending a chase. The only thing that really gets you off guard is the Spike Strips, but thats only because you never even really see them.\n\nIn the end, the game is definetly flawed. But id say its worth it. Especially now that its cheap and easily attainable through Steam. The racing is fun, and the chases can be a blast. The awful story and Inconsistent difficulty drag it down but nowhere near to the levels of a bad game. Its a solid racer and if your looking for something to play, look no further. PERSONALLY though, if you still have a Playstation 2 or a Nintendo Wii (Or a Wii U even), id reccomend hunting down a copy of Need For Speed Undercover on one of those consoles. It may not be the prettiest versions, but the AI is much better and consistent, the cars feel and handle better, the cop chases are a challenge and it just overall just feels more like a Most Wanted sequel then this version does.","January 18","true","16.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You're going undercover by infiltrating a bunch of street racers who's obviously also up to no good. However, your "boss" may be up to no good herself... The cities are large, roads are wide, and there are plenty of chase-breakers as well as shortcuts and whatnot. There are 4 classes of cars, from regualr sports to superexotics, and 3 levels of upgrades for each. There are variety of races, from simple circuit to highway battle (get away from the other driver once you're in the lead), from knockout (last place is eliminated) to eliimination (crash target until he's disabled), from timed delivery (take this hot car to destination, no cops!) to cop challenges (take out 5 cop cars then escape), there are a variety of missions to accomplish, using wide variety of cars, all over the major areas of this city.\n\nWhile the production values are high, and chases can get exciting, the videos come out as a bit... hokey, and the final battle is quite lame. Some of the missions are freaking impossible by game's end as the cars are driving insanely fast, almost beyond human reflexes. Graphics are decent but not spectacular as this is an older game.\n\nAll in all, NFS:UC is not quite as good as the original Most Wanted, but the new mission and race types are welcomed. The subsequent iterations, such as Hot Pursuit (3) and "The Run" attempt to capture the magic, but you'll have to read those reviews elsewhere.","May 16, 2015","true","5.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

My Carrera GT looks pretty awesome as well. The soundtrack was pretty good as well, just great racing game music, you know. I just wish there was more races because I dominated all of them, so the game is kinda short. The story is kinda boring, but I just ignored it and raced more. And the map is pretty big, takes you quite a while to explore all of it. The only thing that annoyed me is that the police can impound your car, I had to buy another Carrera GT because of that. So just don't get arrested and you should be good. lol. It is pretty easy to race once you've gotten a fully upgraded tier one car. Also the tier system is reversed compared to carbon, 1 is fastest and 4 is slowest, so don't get confused.\n\nSo basically, its fun to race in, easy after you get a tier 1 car fully upgraded, avoid getting arrested as you only have 3 strikes, and the map is pretty big.

It carries quite a few promises, but is very disappointing.\n\nPros:\n1. Fast-paced action easily makes one EXCITED!\n2. A good collection of cars.\n3. A nice world to roam about.\n4. Cut-scenes are quite well made.\n5. Chances are that you buy this game when it's on sale, very cheap.\n\nCons:\n1. Physics is ridiculous, when crash happens, all cars seem to have infinite mass. Mario Kart has better physics and makes more sense. NFS is not famous for physics accuracy, but this game is way too off-scale.\n2. If you drive manual, you will easily feel that the cars' torque-rev relationship is pretty ridiculous.\n3. Brake is so ridiculously powerful, and the car has ridiculous amount of grip.\n4. They hired Maggie Q and others to make nice movies, so it seems that they focused on SP. However AI is ridiculous. Anything controlled by AI just makes no sense.\n5. AI racers seem to be "given" speed and accleration. Sometimes I can have 200 feet in the lead and I am faster round the last corner, but the second car just acclerates ridiculously and robs my first place. It feels that those cars do not have actual drivers in them.\n6. Roaming traffic cars are quite amazing, not only AI racers ram you like crazy, those roaming traffic cars also ram into you for no reason at all.\n7. There's almost no balance between cars and missions. You can win by miles using Lotus Elise against some really slow Volkswagen, and at some other locatons you will face Audi R8, Gallardo, and many other cars that are way faster. BTW Lotus Elise is extremely overpowered.\n8. I can't believe how bad the cops are. They seem to give up chasing you as long as you are 100 inches ahead of them. Sometimes it can be extremely hard to complete missions like cost-to-state challenge, because the cops do not chase you at all, even you are at heat level 5.\n9. You can easily use the TAB key to fast travel to just jump right to the next race, so although there's a huge amazing open world, chances are that you don't even roam about at all.\n10. Graphics are okay for a game this old, and it uses similar color scheme as the original NFS:MW. However it looks a lot less attractive than NFS:MW for some reason.\n11. Road surface is modeled quite badly. Different road surface (asphalt, grass, dirt, etc) feels quite similar, and the only difference seems to be the smoothness.\n12. Its compatibility with controllers has lots of problems. If I have my keyboard, XBOX360 controller, and my Logitech G27 all connected at the same time, the car will keep steering to the right, and the menu cursor keeps going down.\n13. The cars' performace has little to do with their real-life version.\n\nConclusion:\nIf this game is on sale, and if you want some excitment road racing, and if you are not good at braking in racing games, pick this up. It can make you blood boil (Rush-time High Way Battle is the best mode in this game IMO), and it does not require too much skill.","February 23, 2015","false","9.0"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","19","36","2","1"

A controller makes it easer to adapt to the way the cars handle.\n\nAs for the motion blur - I got used to it fairly quickly. According to google the game was released on November 18, 2008 - which makes it approximately 6 years old as I type this - and If I not mistaken motion blur was a 'feature' of older games used to make thinks look faster. This is speaking from prior experience, from recent memory I have beaten both need for speed most wanted & need for speed carbon (@#$% the final race in carbon) and they had a similar effect when using nitros.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the graphics - I was playing with everything as high as it would go, with the exception of using 1920x1080 due to my screen - and found the lense flair / sun glare to be near blinding. Honestly, more of an annoyance thean anything.\n\nI did also find the music tracks to be somewhat repeative, though I was to lazy to figure out how to turn it off. Something in the options menu I would expect.\n\nI didn't bother with multiplayer, I think the servers were taken down a while ago and I have no idea if this has any other types of multiplayer avalible.\n\nOn the subject of the games difficulty - I found the artificial intelligence of the racers to be reasonable, difficult to beat if you are driving an underpowered car and / or didn't understand that you need to turn corners and avoid traffic to win. Yhe police artificial intelligence works well enough, through its nowhere near as effective as what was in need for speed most wanted, and they seemed to be able to keep up with me and even pass me despite driving waht appears to be lower tier cars - I'm guessing thats to give a fighting chane against a human player.\n\nTL;DR\n\nValue: Decent\nGraphics: Decent\nAudio: Decent\nMultiplayer: Maybe Dead\nDifficulty: Easy to Medium","May 12","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoyed it, there were some parts of the game were it got frustrating because sometimes you would be so far ahead that you know noone is going to pass you and then the AI might just put in there after burners or something and get really close to you as you about to finish a race. The story was interesting and got you thinking all the way to the end. The running from the cops was alot of fun and challenging because you have to think of different ways to drive to try and loose them. I found my self playing it for hours on end to level up my rank in game and to get more money so i can get better cars. Some times the gameplay felt repetitive, like you were going down the same roads as before over and over but alot of times they mixed the route up.

You're going undercover by infiltrating a bunch of street racers who's obviously also up to no good. However, your "boss" may be up to no good herself... The cities are large, roads are wide, and there are plenty of chase-breakers as well as shortcuts and whatnot. There are 4 classes of cars, from regualr sports to superexotics, and 3 levels of upgrades for each. There are variety of races, from simple circuit to highway battle (get away from the other driver once you're in the lead), from knockout (last place is eliminated) to eliimination (crash target until he's disabled), from timed delivery (take this hot car to destination, no cops!)  to cop challenges (take out 5 cop cars then escape), there are a variety of missions to accomplish, using wide variety of cars, all over the major areas of this city.\n\nWhile the production values are high, and chases can get exciting, the videos come out as a bit... hokey, and the final battle is quite lame. Some of the missions are freaking impossible by game's end as the cars are driving insanely fast, almost beyond human reflexes. Graphics are decent but not spectacular as this is an older game.\n\nAll in all, NFS:UC is not quite as good as the original Most Wanted, but the new mission and race types are welcomed. The subsequent iterations, such as Hot Pursuit (3) and "The Run" attempt to capture the magic, but you'll have to read those reviews elsewhere.","July 16, 2013","true","25.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Chase Linh shooting a guy... and some gangsters, but in the game play itself all you have is driving, most of what the player does doesn't feel connected to the scenes/story line.\n\nMy goal each time I have played was to complete the lame story ASAP to unlock the map, tracks, cars, etc..\n\nThose are the best aspects of the game. You get all the good vinyl cusomiztions from older games like NFS Carbon.\nYou get an extensive car list, featuring EU, Japan, and American models.\n\nThe track and world is the largest map(I have seen in a NFS Title) - and I've played every NFS since HP II on PS2.\n\nYou have your standard freeroam, and cop chases like the  old Carbon and Most Wanted did.\n\nThere is a huge selection of tracks and game modes, like High Way Battle where you struggle to gain 1000 feet ahead of the other car, while avoiding HUGE levels of traffic(comparing traffic to other NFS games).\n\nMy personal favorite track is "East I-85" its the best track for me because it's an all interstate course, and you can really test the handling and top speed of cars.\n\nNext I will discuss the handling and driving, it is not bad, it is different from other NFS games.\nYou can do more realistic moves with your cars than in other games, but some times the handling is overkill, put max parts on a high end car, you can catch yourself turning, then snapping into an object as if the object were attracting you.\n\nIt's easier to drive if you don't hold it left or right for too long, or use nos while turning.\n\nNext I will discuss the glitches, there is lots of them. I've plalyed online matches where players could, on some tracks, exploit the driving engine and launch over clear barriers(and basically access a online-like freeroam)\n\nThere is also this god-awful(but halarious) falling glitch, where you begin a race and upon starting you fall in the ground, stuck at 460mph(rounded that up), and the car doesn't reset. This glitch happens randomly and you basically have to wait to loe or quit :P\n\nThere is other glitches... I turned too hard eon time using the Audi R8?(Le Mans?, forgot) and hit an object, bounced several hundred meters in the air doing almost endless flips.\n\nYou can also reset your car during freeroam and quickly drive inside a civilian car before your car becomes solid, then pause, swap cars, and you can twitch, flip, and do odd stunts involving yourself and your little civilian :D\nI made a semi truck literally bounce away doing that one.\n\nThe glitches are fun, helps make up for the bad textures and story.\n\nYeah the sky textures, and ground textures aren't great. The ground almost seems yellow, yellow concrete... ew.\nThe car details are great, and that's probably the best part.\n\nThen we have the music. It's what you expect from any EA game, you get a random list of songs(that were popular when what ever game was released). Rock, Rap, and some Techno stuff, similar to MW 05 song list and Burnout 3.\n\n8/10 game, would launch the semi again.\n\n","August 14, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOneRed/recommended/17430/","TheOneRed","A Lvoeable Dragon 🐲","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOneRed/","435 products in account","I have been looking for a game even relatively like Carbon for ages. I'm not sure how I missed this, but I love it. And I want more. I want so much more.\n\nJust... God, it's good. It's that perfect line between being arcade-styled racing, but not being so over-the-top arcadey that it forsakes all physics. Driving may not be realistic - as in, your tires have such insane grip that you won't spin out and crash after ripping on the handbrake for a turn - but god DAMN it's fun.\n\nOn top of that, the customization. Good LORD! The customization! Just... I can't describe how well it's done. Controls in the customization menu are a wee bit wonky, but, managable. Other than that, though, just, holy crap. At least half my game time is spent editing visuals, upgrading and tweaking cars, and I love it. Every second of it. Of course, there's also the option to not customize your car if that ain't your thing, but for those of you who love vinyls and paint jobs and all that jazz? You. Will. Be. Pleased.\n\nIt's fast, it's satisfying, it's got a feeling of personalization, it's almost everything I've wanted in a racing game.\n\nAlmost.\n\nWhere it lacks is two things. And both of them are the placement of difficulty.\n\nOnce a mission is done, you get a hefty chunk of change. Do it again? 10% of that change, at most. This is severely depressing if you manage to lose a car to the police by bad luck. Car gets impounded with less than $3000 or so in the bank? Kiss it goodbye. Customizations and all. This means that you'll likely be grinding a lot if you get unlucky and lose your favorite car at a horrble moment, or if you want to get all the cars. (Well... You can use cheat codes, but, nyeh.)\n\nAnd, then there's the missions themselves. The only times I've lost is to cars that are a tier above mine - and those times were all just barely losses - or when I made, like, 5-10 mistakes in a race. I've made it a personal challenge to not use speedbreaker - which is basically bullet time for better turning - and it's still easy. Every race is more a time trial than a race, really, that's how far ahead of the pack I normally am. But god damn, it's a fun time trial, and it's only marginally less satisfying to play because of it.\n\nFinal verdict? Unless you're a diehard racing simulator type person, buy this. Buy it now. And then wonder why the hell there aren't more games like it.","December 28, 2014","true","23.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I personally think that we are better than simply pushing tab to go to the next race (the races are rediculously easy to win, there's no challenge at all).

I've clocked some serious time on and offline on the console counterpart and wow. It's bad.\n\n\nThe controls for a start: in the menu, I was forced to use mouse control which kept skewing out randomly. I managed to put on the controller which annoyingly has to be done inside the menus; a bad thing in any game imo. when I got the controller on just wtf. The keys had been mapped to some random nonsense. And by that I mean even the pause button was out of whack, and I was using a 360 controller. I did remap them but just wtf. To remap them I had to revert ot kb+m to navigate the menus because I had no idea how to with the controller. Worked after this though but I have no idea why you would play it.\n\nThe game first loaded in 640x480... yeah... I have 2 monitors so I caused a big shift in windows placement and sizes and to make matters worse, the game starts with an un-skip-able cinematic which blends you into the game. So I was stuck watching this hideous quality game thinking when it finally lets me start, I can sort that. Nope. I maxed the settings and its hideous, I would genuinely take teh PS3 game over this and indeed only bought this because I had played and completed the console version repeatedly way back when.\n\nAs a game this is unspectacular in its prime but theres certainly fun to be had. However, its a poor port and looks terrible as well as feels worse than the console counterpart. I'm not sure if this is just me or what but its definately made this a waste fo money.

I've clocked some serious time on and offline on the console counterpart and wow. It's bad.\n\n\nThe controls for a start: in the menu, I was forced to use mouse control which kept skewing out randomly. I managed to put on the controller which annoyingly has to be done inside the menus; a bad thing in any game imo. when I got the controller on just wtf. The keys had been mapped to some random nonsense. And by that I mean even the pause button was out of whack, and I was using a 360 controller. I did remap them but just wtf. To remap them I had to revert ot kb+m to navigate the menus because I had no idea how to with the controller. Worked after this though but I have no idea why you would play it.\n\nThe game first loaded in 640x480... yeah... I have 2 monitors so I caused a big shift in windows placement and sizes and to make matters worse, the game starts with an un-skip-able cinematic which blends you into the game. So I was stuck watching this hideous quality game thinking when it finally lets me start, I can sort that. Nope. I maxed the settings and its hideous, I would genuinely take teh PS3 game over this and indeed only bought this because I had played and completed the console version repeatedly way back when.\n\nAs a game this is unspectacular in its prime but theres certainly fun to be had. However, its a poor port and looks terrible as well as feels worse than the console counterpart. I'm not sure if this is just me or what but its definately made this a waste fo money. I have a 3570k and a overclocked gtx 680 so I didnt expect it to look that bad for its age.

The graphics on everything are nice and the freeroam is great because of the miami/LA-esque scenery. The story, while it does get a bit monotonous and requires you to grind for levels to advance, still offers you a challenge. The cops are relatively competent and will give you a run for your money on later levels. Cars handle well, feels great to drive around at 200 km/h, and has plenty of variety. Even with the lacking customization options; you can still personalize your car to a very good degree.\n\nWhy won't I recommend this? It's using an incredibly frustrating version of rubberband AI for racers. It is not noticable during the first few hours of the game since the AI's still tame, but as you progress higher and higher, you'll soon see how the AI has an unfair advantage over you.\n\nFor starters, unless you're racing against lower-tier enemies, regardless of how far you leave the competition behind, they -will somehow catch up to you- (Example? I left my opponents with a 10-15 second advantage for the entirety of the race, but when I was at the 80%ish completion mark, they somehow managed to catch up and close the gap to 3 seconds and got to 2 seconds by 90%. That's not possible in any way and mind you, I didn't crash or slow down either.). They won't nessesarily beat you by default, you can still win, but it still pretty much makes your whatever careful driving you do redundant. Additionally, the AI has this amazing ability to clear chicanes, even those full of traffic, without noticibly slowing down like it's none of his business.\n\nAdditionally, the AI -really- hates you. They aren't programmed as racers competing against eachother, they're programmed as a pack of wolves who will do everything to make sure you lose. They will gang up on you, rough you up, and attempt to spin you out at the cost of their progress on every turn and the director will sometimes spawn traffic at the most inconvenient of times just to throw you off.\n\nAll in all, unless you really love to get angry, I'd recommend you pass this.","March 11, 2014","false","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wish there was an "okay" button, something inbetween the good and bad. Unfortunately, I have to give this game a thumbs down.\n\n~~~PROS~~~\nFor $5, it wasn't the worst deal I've made... I spent $20 on Goat Sim and only played it for a couple hours.\n\nThe car customization is great, the police AI has VASTLY improved since Most Wanted, there are lots of races and events, and a decent selection of cars. The soundtrack isn't too bad, either.\n\nIn terms of visuals, this game looks pretty impressive. I have a GT 640 and can max it out in 1080p, which came as a surprise to me.\n\nThe audio FX are amazing, though I don't think the cars sound quite as "mean" as they did in MW.\n~~~CONS~~~\nI came from Need For Speed: Most Wanted with high hopes, and what I got out of this game was... uh... troubling, at best. The career in this game doesn't even compare to Most Wanted, and I mean that in a bad way. In Most Wanted, I spent hours replaying the career several different times, with different cars, I grew up with that game. Undercover, however... I kind of had to drag myself through the story. It was mediocre, at best. On top of that, the career mode seems to only have two difficulties; impossible, and ridiculously easy. One second, you win a race with the next opponent trailing 20+ seconds behind. The next, you get ripped a new one and end up in 8th place. It's really odd...\n\nThe multiplayer is a joke. Good luck finding a server. Also, your graphic schemes don't show up in multiplayer.\n\nMenu navigation is NOT optimized for a mouse. In fact, I would unplug your mouse before you even play the game. All it could really do is get in the way.\n~~~~~~~~~~~\nOverall, I'd give this game a 4/10. If you want multiplayer, buy a different NFS.","August 6, 2014","false","14.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And, lets think about how fast a car can accelerate. from 0 to 60 miles, or 0 to 100 km, an average car in the game (excluding cars like Bugatti Veyron) it takes about 2 to 3 seconds at least to reach 0 to 60 miles, or 0 to 100 km. Now, if a car is around or above 160 km/h or 100mi/h, it takes significantly more time to accelerate.. And guess what, my car passes an oppoent, gains some distance which is not at all achievable to reduce in a short period of time (meaning several minutes), and the opponent reduces that distance in no time like 10 to 20 seconds, and at maximum within a minute. This is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Even if I am giving a consideration to the fact that it is a mere game, this is not something to be messed around. The fact that this game is released several years ago will be the only reason I will be accepting the fact the way it is, but this game does not in any way gives the way the cars are raced, nor how a car can catch up another car. Only the fact that it is a "game" will give an immunity to this product of failing such significant factor of actual racings.","March 24, 2015","false","22.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you do buy it here, try not to waste your CD key on the Steam version (if it's possible to activate on Origin). This game is a solid argument for why NFS Underground 2 and older NFS games would be great on Steam.\n\nWhen this game came out, the reviews were mixed, but the forum members absolutely slammed this game for being of a lower caliber than EA's usual fare. It was on sale for $2 during the Winter Sale in 2014, and I purchased it to satisfy my curiosity (or possibly vindicate the game for myself), only to find that - while the game isn't awful - it's also not anything incredibly special compared to older NFS series titles.\n\nThe game, overall, is a distilled sample of the worst problems plaguing the NFS series in the Underground (2003) through Prostreet (2007) era. The AI has a severe 'rubber band' effect that makes some early races easy, but others, like the "Outrun" races, virtually impossible (and dependent on luck and blocking rather than skill). The car customization, like Prostreet, uses "Autosculpt" for everything, making it difficult to create a good-looking car unless one sticks to stock parts. The "Action Driving Engine" makes the cars eagerly jump into caricatured silver-screen maneuvers and dramatic donuts every time you take a turn a little too hard.\n\nVisually, the game is actually impressive, especially for the time. The city map looks incredibly well made. However, between the overwrought bloom and motion blur, and the fact that the game defaulted to the lowest graphical settings through the otherwise fairly nice introduction scene (and I couldn't go into the options until the scene was over), the overall effect of the graphics is largely underwhelming. I later disabled the motion blur and realized that it was a graphical prop to hide the fact that the cars handle in an absurd manner.\n\nThe inability to access the menu up front on game start is one of many things that points to the PC game being a hasty console port. In addition, every time I quit the game, the game lost my control settings and I had to set them up again. The menus are also incredibly clunky and unresponsive. Moreover, the online mode works WORSE on Steam - EA has purposely broken intercompatibility between the Steam version and other versions. If you buy it here, activate your key on Origin.\n\nThe only positive part of the game, one I wished was present to the same extent in other NFS games, was the fairly impressive story and cutscene sequences. These were present to some extent in Underground through Carbon, but this game and The Run (2011) apparently dissuaded EA from using the same cinematics in later games until NFS 2015.\n\nMy recommendation is that you get Most Wanted (2005) instead, if you can find a copy, or else Hot Pursuit (2010). This game's reputation among the NFS community is deserved. At least, for $2, my curiosity was satisfied, and I was pretty sure I made the right call the first time around by skipping it.","December 25, 2014","false","15.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, the weird warp tunnel effect it gives you when your at full speed is very jarring and looks a mess.\n\nAs its an older game the shoddy graphics can be forgiven to an extent but sadly the gameplay doesn't make up for them, the AI is just too easy to beat. You can literally just hold down the accelerate button and let the car bounce off the walls and still win with a 10 second plus gap. In fact on one race I gave the AI a 10 second head start and still managed to win by bouncing off the walls with a 4 second lead, its just no challenge or any fun at all.\n\nAt £10 there's better racing games you can get off of Steam, I'd avoid this one and find something thats a bit more of a challenge.","June 3, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealrhysington/recommended/17430/","therealrhysington","Daddy Binks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealrhysington/","123 products in account","I have to start with; this game is a lot of fun, like hella fun, totally worth $10.\n\nThis game has no story, there's no point even pretending that it has any substance, but that's not a bad thing. There isn't plot development outside of the UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENCES and the characters are laughable. It only serves as plot-points to give you free cars.\n\nThe car selection is broad and the cars feel unique for the most part. Upgrading in tiers is rewarding enough and you can feel how much potentials cars have when you first unlock/buy them.\n\nThe races are just regular races, be fast, hit the apex, win. The AI can be a little funny sometimes with it's speeds, but the game will sometimes straight up cheat speed to make you feel the pressure to win.\nI remember the lack of pressure to win in NFS:UG1&2 where you can easily lead the last races by over a 10 second margin. So that's nice.\n\nThe only real issue with this game is the police AI. Helicopters can see you in tunnels, and out of line of sight and the GTR cops have x-ray vision and always know where you are which creates a mini-game of finding the pursuit breakers and cooldown spots.\nHowever this is "gameplay feature" is really frustrating sometimes.\n\n\nMultiplayer aspect of this game is nonexistent.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is really fun as just a brain-dead racer with some free roam, nothing else to it. Going in with any expectations above that and you've played into EA's hand.","November 4, 2015","true","50.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is not the Need For Speed I know. I'm not impressed at where the story line goes or the fact that it just dumps you into the middle of a map, with no real objective. The graphics arn't much of an improvment from Most Wanted, and to tell you the truth, I think Most Wanted has beter graphics than this game does. We are talking 3 years difference, and not much improvment, plus the camera movement is annoying. That's really all I have to say about this game.

This game, however, does not come close.\nI have played this game on Xbox360, PS2, and Pc now. The Xbox360 version was very good and I enjoyed it a lot. That one gets a 7/10. The Ps2 version was decent, but lacked a lot of the story and had very few cars. 6/10. This one, however, was ported HORRIBLY. It feels like it ported straight from the XBOX360(With much worse graphics) with about 5 minutes of tweeking. AND THE CONTROLS ARE SOME OF THE WORSE I HAVE EVER SEEN. I tried to use this with the controller and keyboard and both were tedious. The controller only is able to function with half of the game and the keyboard is utterly the most confusing set-up i have ever seen. I mean seriously? Delete was my nitrous button! I couldnt even customize my cars and had to get away with whatever they happened to give me.\nThe game crashes ALL THE TIME. for the hour and a half I was playing it crashed 4 times, twice while I was racing, and twice during a cutscene. I have a top-knotch rig, so it is definitley the game's fault here.\nThat and some other problems like blinding sun blare, jerky movement of the car, limited multiplayer, the only problem I couldn't find was what most people shun this game for: Rubber-banding AI. The only redeeming thing about this game is play-time(7-8 hours, which is fine), the customization(If you can find it) and the car list which was actually fairly large for an arcade racer.\nMy final rating is a solid 3/10. its a bad game port and I certainly don't recommend it.

To call it arcade... well, I remember arcades of 80's, so it is definitely not an arcade! It is very sub-arcade, in the terms of controls and the whole gameplay.\n\nYet I'm not so determined to absolutely NOT recommending that game. You see, that depends from where you are looking at the whole NFS bunch of games. If you are one with NFS Underground, you maybe found Undercover less colourful, but acceptable. Same goes with the fans preferring NFS Underground 2 the most. Now, the biggest group of fans, I know, love the Most Wanted. For them, Undercover will be quite bleak in terms of contest. The police there dumb and slooow, the contenders, for the most time, also not showing you any challenge.\n\nUndercover has its own nice features, sure.\nFirst, the soundtrack. It's the best from the whole serial, I still have more than dozen tracks from there in my playlist.\nSecond, the cars. There are quite a bunch of roaring road monsters for every taste, with the only downside that you should invest some time in the game to get to the sweetest ones.\nThird, Maggie Q. I'm not a fan of her, yet she certainly make the atmosphere a little less boring.\n\nStill, it is not enough for me. You see, my favourite NFS is Porshe Unleashed, so I can certainly tell you from my biased point of view, that all driving in the Undercover is boring as Mr.Obama speeches. The physics of driving is under every level of comparison. Maybe it is similar to the driving in the Watch Dogs, but hardly better. I've played Undercover on the PSP platform, but even there I was not really engaged in the races. They were not attractive even on that tiny piece of hardware, and PSP is not rich with the racing games at all!\n\nSo, the only good thing I believe you can get from buying Undercover now is the little fraction of the same drive that gathered NFS so many fans with Underground and Most Wanted titles. So far you can't buy any of those great games on Steam, maybe you'll get desperate enough and go with the Undercover.\n\nMy mark is 5.8/10. If you try to look a little harder, you'll find so many better racing games on Steam, than that. Yeah, they won't be calling Need For Speed, so what?","November 27, 2015","false","1.3"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","16","35","4","10"

I may be a little knit picky about some of these but they just really get to me and maybe a good amount of you.\n\nBut there is 1 major flaw that makes this game horrible and fills me with anger every time I see it. And it is quite common\n\n+The racing is fun when you have compeition. You want to win.\n\n+The cars have pretty good handeling. The are nice to drive.\n\n=The story you will understand and will sometimes pick up, but most won't really care and will just get into the racing.\n\n=The map is large and sometimes is okay to roam around in, but you don't get a feeling of exploration and wanting to travel the map like other NFS games made me feel. No sense of adventure\n\n-You are fined WAY too much. You lose money for many things. It gets annoying.\n\n-The soundtrack in my opinion is GOD AWFUL. It only fits to 2 music genres, Country and Hard Rock. If you don't like these genres sometimes it is hard to play hearing it in the background and the music is very unfitting at times. When I am in a tight position with a rival car racing close to the finish, the music plays a soft country tune. I don't like either genres so it feels bad to hear. Annoying.\n\n\n-You LOSER MONEY for SPEEDING. This game is Need For Speed. You are ment to go fast. I know it is against the "laws" in the game but you get fined for going fast and having fun. Speed is one of the soul points of the game. You get fined during races for speeding, too. I get so angry whenever I see that red light flash of SPEEDING -250. Other than thisd major flaw it is an overall decent racing game. Although I do not reccomend the game it is fun to try out and I suggest you buy it on sale. I got it for $2, so I won't be so harsh on it. But if you want a decent racer, play this if it is on sale.","December 26, 2014","false","2.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

I would say that it's one of the worst NFS games though. The driving is really neat, but the police chases are boring compared to Most Wanted. You start of with a good car, then it falls of after a while. Then you get a new car, which is very powerful, but then that falls of as well. You constantly have to upgrade your car, or the AI will crush you.\nThe storyline is flat, no real surprises, and the ending was expected.

And the hunter. Now you must get behind the wheel and risk everything to infiltrate a ruthless international crime syndicate and take them down. The man you're after is a maniac behind the wheel, and he's driving like his life depends on escape, which maybe it does. He's the one with all the answers you need, you will track him down. Needless to say, that fleet of police cruisers in your rearview mirror won't make things any easier. It will take all of your experience—and every ounce of skill—to outrun the law, take down the enemy, and unlock the truth that puts an end to this chase once and for all.\n\n- Go Deep Undercover - Race into an action-packed story of pursuit and betrayal. Take on jobs and compete in races to prove yourself as you infiltrate and take down an international crime syndicate.\n\n- Highway Battle - Fight off the cops and others as you take down your prey in high-speed, high stake multi-car chases. New and vastly improved AI mechanics mean more aggressive and intelligent cops focused on taking you out fast and by any means necessary.\n\n- Own the Open World - Tear across the massive highway system and discover the open world of the Gulf Coast Tri-Cities area, with three unique cities connected by an extensive highway system.\n\n- Heroic Driving Engine - An all-new game engine lets you pull off amazing moves for the ultimate driving edge.","November 23, 2013","true","645.0"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","2"

And the main cause of it isn't even the challenging gameplay, though that does contribute. No no, it's the glitches. A few corners have horrible hitboxes, if I can call them that, to where you'll slam into an invisible wall during a sharp turn that'll lose you the race. Or perhaps the issue with the turning. On occasion, the left- or right- arrow keys will just decide not to work for a couple seconds, usually conveniently when you're trying to turn. You'll fly into the barrier with no reaction time, which will, again, lose you the race. Sometimes even the AI racers will spin you sideways onto their front bumper and you'll get permanently t-boned - you'll be unable to reverse or accelerate out of it, and the AI doesn't bother steering. Your only choice is to restart or quit entirely. I've had to repeat countless events because of issues like this. Of course, some of this frustration will come from the improved AI (which, let me tell you, is a big step up from previous Need for Speed games). The police units are definitely much smarter, and will attempt to spin you out, prevent you from turning so you run into a wall or spike strip, and even box you in. Quite impressive, but extremely annoying sometimes, expecially when they come in during a race and completely screw you over.\nOkay, that's enough cons. The pros; there is a fantastic variety of roads. Uphill, downhill, winding, long straights, banking turns, the whole shebang. They provide all the tests you would need to perfect your car, whether it be suspension or traction, top speed or acceleration. And once you've fine-tuned your vehicle, you can listen blissfully to the roaring engine down the long highways, or enjoy the view of the sexy beast you just created as you take it through the banked turns. Which brings me to my next point; the graphics. I'll admit the environment is not particularly special (the cliffs kinda look like manure piles; just collages of different shades of brown), but, as you would hope for from a racing game, the cars look fantastic, and quite accurate to their real-life equivalents. I can definitely say I've spent some time simply admiring a car I've just customized, or even one of the AI racers that caught my eye. And that brings up the customization possibilities, which might as well be infinite. Seriously. Every person in the world could play this game and be able to make a ride completely unique to everyone else's. Other than tons of spoilers and rims which can be widened, lengthened, deepened, and more, there are a couple hundred different vinyls that you can alter in size, position, color, angle, etc. to keep you busy, and a huge color panel to choose from as well. In fact, customization is probably where this game excels.\nThe racing is sometimes questionable in terms of the physics, but definitely fun. The story is interesting I suppose, but will definitely get redundant if you wish to play it a second or third time, as I have done in order to get a variety of cars. But, despite its' faults, as you can tell by my gameplay hours, the appealing supercars and high-speed action has this game pulling me back every time.","April 6, 2014","true","84.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plus it had a fair share of performance issues. For what it is, it's not that bad of a Need for Speed game but just a few pointers:\n\n-Challenge Series is not available for Steam edition. But minor loss. It doesn't impact the main career mode at all.\n-While the Origin verison comes with the Challenge Series, the Origin version is horribly unoptimised. No matter what the Origin version will run at a significantly lower frame rate than the Steam version, no matter the settings.  Not sure why, but it just is. A few threads on the internet from long ago mentioned the EA Download Manager (now Origin version) had performance issues, so it's a semi known issue.\n-Setting affinity to a single core or just two cores can help smooth frame rate a little, but difference is minimal. Game runs fairly well on todays hardware, not as well as it should but it's playable for sure.","February 23, 2015","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good news: Love the free roam. I love the selection of cars. Kinda like the story line. Bad news: Police chases get WAY out of hand. Ex: I was heat level 2 and there were like 20 cops chasing me and they were laying down spike strips and all that.   But, when you ARENT in a police chase, the spawning of the cops is so bad. I had 5 police cars behind me. IN A ROW. Also, I stop at a stoplight, like a normal driver, and a police cruiser slams into the back of me and puts his sirens on. On the radio he is saying it is my fault! That ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Also, I found a spot in the map where NO COPS can go. I don't know how to explain it, but basically its an unfinished highway and you have to jump onto it with your car. And the police can't get up there! After that, you have evaded and all goes well. So the AI and the spawning of the 5-O in this game is kind of bad, but if the game is on sale for 3$, I'd say get the game :D","July 22, 2014","true","69.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where do I even begin? The endless flaws and general glitchy gameplay? The hidden charm?\n\nLet's start with the positives first:\n\n+ The smoke seems as good a place to start as any. It is gorgeous! In ProStreet, EA BlackBox (the developer) gave the tire smoke a new look and it was stunning as it wrapped around the tires in a drag race. It is the same here, with the smoke seemingly blurring your car amidst it. It even changes to brown if you're driving on dirt!\n\n+ Car selection is slightly more positive than negative I'd say. 54 cars in total with a great variety of muscle, exotic and tuner. There are no SUVs but I will never care again if they forget about SUVs entirely. They were terrible in Underground 2 lol. Each car can be upgraded (albeit with not a lot to choose from) both performance and aesthetic wise.\n\n+ Core mechanics. What I mean is the underlying gameplay, where you find the genuine fun of NFS Undercover. If you look at Undercover at the surface, you'll find something drasticly wrong with it. But scratch underneath that and you can see EA Black Box tried something a little different. The cars handle differently to any previous NFS before it, giving them an incredibly unrealistic but extremely fun feel! This is due to the "Heroic Driving Engine". It certainly gives the cars a slidy feel, but it's not to the point of feeling like you're driving on ice. You can do doughnuts easily, and then suddenly pull away. You can be driving at over 150 MPH and then suddenly veer off round a corner going nearly the same speed. You can pull off J-turns like nothing at all. It offers the chance to drive easily but with some flair.\n\n+ Graphical tuning. Undercover actually offers a pretty nice list of graphical fine-tuning for you to choose from. From anti-aliasing to texture filtering, adjusting the car detail to world detail, it provides some good things for you to match the game to what your computer is capable of.\n\n+ Photo Mode. I love taking photos of my cars! I've taken advantage of "Photo Mode" in every racing game, not just NFS however. So an inclusion in this title is no different! The graphics are... average... but they provide enough for some sweet photos.\n\nOK, I have to admit this is where the positives end.... erm... yeah, so on to the negatives I suppose.\n\n- The AI is the most FRUSTRATING, BROKEN, IDIOTIC and UNDECISIVE piece of CRAP. I have never felt so angered than I have playing Undercover. Let's start with the traffic: what traffic?! If you're driving along on your own, or in a race, it doesn't matter because the world is dead apparently. Every so often it will breathe life into a race with a car or two, but that's it. The ONLY time you'll find a busy stretch of road is during a Highway Battle. That's it. When you're in a Circuit Race, the civilian cars will randomly drive THROUGH the barriers and suddenly smash into you as they come out, or they'll drive into the barrier and get in your damn way as they turn off! When they're changing lanes, I kid you not, they LOVE to do it when you're about to pass them! They'll suddenly veer off to be in front of you, and completely screw you up! I have even found them to turn a corner and actually come off of the road... for NO viable reason. They just swerve suddenly and come off the road. It's so broken it's hilarious. And they randomly crash too! I drive over hills or around a corner, and I find a small pile up of cars, or cars that have somehow crashed into the wall... As for the bloody racers? They're just as bad. RUBBER BANDING. Why the HELL is EA still allowing this kind of crap? You had rubber banding in UNDERGROUND 1! And that is 11 years old! I could be scraping the rear end of an opponent, I make them hit a wall, I then use some Nitrous to get away, and the opponent is somehow matching my speed. I mean, how is that possible? I know NFS is not realistic in any sense of the word, but rubber banding takes the biscuit. I detest it.\n\n- Unbalanced difficulty. I guess this just relates to the AI again, but I feel this needs its own category. In a Sprint Race for e.g. I would be so far ahead of the competition that I could not even see them on the map. I didn't need to even think about them at all. And for the most part it would be like that in most races. As soon as I crash because of the poorly designed AI traffic, or my car decides to skid off the track, within seconds the opponents are closing in extremely fast! And because of the rubber banding, they can suddenly keep up with me. It's a joke. In other races, I've been struggling to even keep up with the racers in 1st or 2nd. I had a Mazda RX-7 with "Street" level tuning, and I struggled to keep up with a Nissan 240SX. It was endlessly overtaking then falling back again. Eventually I would win, but not without difficulty. And what about the cops? Man oh man are they strange. As soon as I slow down they go nuts! They smash into me like there is no tomorrow. But when I speed up they trail off, leaving me to wreck the joint. One more thing: when I'm literally cruising along the street in my car, and I cruise past the Police, they suddenly go after me, claiming I'm speeding or whatever. It's useless and this just proves how messed up the AI is.\n\n- Useless display of points. I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but when you perform tricks etc. you seem to rack up "points" for lack  of a better word. They add up, but they add up to nothing. And I can't seem to figure out why there are points in the first place. There is no tactical advantage, no bonus, no unlocks for gaining a certain amount of points. It's the same when you smash a fence or hit a car and you see some money pop up for the damage. I understand you causing the "State" money during a pursuit, but whilst cruising in free roam? What's the point in even having either come up?\n\n- Unbalanced tuning. Let me put it this way: My Mazda RX-7 with "Street" level tuning could OUTRUN a LAMBORGHINI. Lamborghini, do you even tune brah?\n\n- Most pointless story I have ever come across! Again, let me put it this way: You're a typical nameless nobody with no voice or face. You are an undercover police officer trying to worm your way in to a drug-smuggling ring of "thugs" (EA's terminlogy, not mine). It literally takes ONE race respectively to impress the top guys and you're suddely their new favourite pet lmao. And before you know it, within a couple of missions, you're already taking them all down by smashing their car's into a thousand pieces. Story writing at its utter worst.\n\n- Also the shortest story ever. You'll complete it I'd say in 5 - 6 hours at best. If you put in maximum effort, I'd say possibly under 5 hours. What a joke.\n\nLook, I could go on and on and on and on with this review, but the truth is, there are SO MANY NEGATIVES and things wrong with this title that I would never be able to recommend it.\n\nAfter everything however, I can honestly say it has heart. This is a game aimed at the most casual audience possible. This would be enjoyed by young teenagers and children. But I'm 23 years old (today lol it's my birthday!) and I want a game waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more polished and fleshed out than this. There is some fun to be had with the driving thanks to the "H.D.E." and it will offer something to do for a few hours, but this will quickly dissolve into boredom. EA's more recent efforts with Hot Pursuit 2010, Most Wanted 2012 (despite what people say, it's a great game) and even Rivals (amazing first effort from Ghost Games!) is enough to keep you coming back. I'm not surprised EA Black Box was wiped away as even EA stated that they were being overworked. Here's to 2015, and hoping that two years worth of development time can give us the Need for Speed we've all been waiting for.\n\nVERDICT: The police busted me for driving slower than the traffic. 5/10","July 28, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finally grew up to understand what to do in the game, how to get money, etc. When I played it for the first few times I was honestly pretty bored. Once i starded getting into it, I started to complete the game mission by mission, race by race. When I finally got near the end of the game I was deeply sucked into the game, wanting to know more, for the crave of knowledge. (And getting to say I beat the game). They have beautiful graphics if you have a computer like mine you can tune up the graphics, they have one of the biggest selections of cars that I have EVER seen in a car game, They have a great story line, and they have great actors.

And the main cause of it isn't even the challenging gameplay, though that does contribute. No no, it's the glitches. A few corners have horrible hitboxes, if I can call them that, to where you'll slam into an invisible wall during a sharp turn that'll lose you the race. Or perhaps the issue with the turning. On occasion, the left- or right- arrow keys will just decide not to work for a couple seconds, usually conveniently when you're trying to turn. You'll fly into the barrier with no reaction time, which will, again, lose you the race. Sometimes even the AI racers will spin you sideways onto their front bumper and you'll get permanently t-boned - you'll be unable to reverse or accelerate out of it, and the AI doesn't bother steering. Your only choice is to restart or quit entirely. I've had to repeat countless events because of issues like this. Of course, some of this frustration will come from the improved AI (which, let me tell you, is a big step up from previous Need for Speed games). The police units are definitely much smarter, and will attempt to spin you out, prevent you from turning so you run into a wall or spike strip, and even box you in. Quite impressive, but extremely annoying sometimes, expecially when they come in during a race and completely screw you over.\nOkay, that's enough cons. The pros; there is a fantastic variety of roads. Uphill, downhill, winding, long straights, banking turns, the whole shebang. They provide all the tests you would need to perfect your car, whether it be suspension or traction, top speed or acceleration. And once you've fine-tuned your vehicle, you can listen blissfully to the roaring engine down the long highways, or enjoy the view of the sexy beast you just created as you take it through the banked turns. Which brings me to my next point; the graphics. I'll admit the environment is not particularly special (the cliffs kinda look like manure piles; just collages of different shades of brown), but, as you would hope for from a racing game, the cars look fantastic, and quite accurate to their real-life equivalents. I can definitely say I've spent some time simply admiring a car I've just customized, or even one of the AI racers that caught my eye. And that brings up the customization possibilities, which might as well be infinite. Seriously. Every person in the world could play this game and be able to make a ride completely unique to everyone else's. Other than tons of spoilers and rims which can be widened, lengthened, deepened, and more, there are a couple hundred different vinyls that you can alter in size, position, color, angle, etc. to keep you busy, and a huge color panel to choose from as well. In fact, customization is probably where this game excels.\nThe racing is sometimes questionable in terms of the physics, but definitely fun. The story is interesting I suppose, but will definitely get redundant if you wish to play it a second or third time, as I have done in order to get a variety of cars. But, despite its' faults, as you can tell by my gameplay hours, the appealing supercars and high-speed action has this game pulling me back every time.","April 6, 2014","true","84.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kasaru/recommended/17430/","kasaru","Kasaru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kasaru/","1124 products in account","One of my favorite arcade racing games. It has pretty bad graphics even for a 2008 game, it's quite buggy, it has a crappy menu system and poor controller support, and also has unskippable live-action cutscenes that fail to convey anything even resembling a story. However, it has just the right amount of customization, the cars are very fun to drive no matter if it's a Tier 1 or Tier 4 car. The game world is diverse for driving, though again, not in apperance. There's winding country roads, city areas, and long highways where you can take your car all the way to the top of its abilities. 252mph seems to be the speed limit in this game, with a fully upgraded Bugatti Veyron. The police system is just a tad too unforgiving, but it's relatively simple and it is a very, very easy game to learn and quite difficult to master. The game is oftentimes too simple in the beginning no matter what car you choose, but if you choose the wrong car later in the game, you'll have a hard time beating the game. Highly recommended considering its base price on Steam is $10. One playthrough will last almost 20 hours.","July 13, 2015","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finally grew up to understand what to do in the game, how to get money, etc. When I played it for the first few times I was honestly pretty bored. Once i starded getting into it, I started to complete the game mission by mission, race by race. When I finally got near the end of the game I was deeply sucked into the game, wanting to know more, for the crave of knowledge. (And getting to say I beat the game). They have beautiful graphics if you have a computer like mine you can tune up the graphics, they have one of the biggest selections of cars that I have EVER seen in a car game, They have a great story line, and they have great actors. When I got to the credits, I was amazed about how much effort went in to this game. Over all this was a good 9.99 spent.","March 7, 2015","true","47.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game its self is a cross of most wanted and carbon together day hours of most wanted (2005) and the customization of nfs carbon must be based of diffrent enegine then those 2 though as cars physics are alot diffrent then wanted and carbon. game it's self 6/10 ive played better steam version 3/10 if it was patched be hella better. So i recommend the game just not the steam version mark my words steer clear of steam version\n\nEDIT:\nI found a way to stable out fps for steam version bit tricky but you need find a frame limiter limit it to 30 35 40 or 45 fps or the most stable fps you see while playing and the game will run smooth if you can figure out away to patch the steam version that would work to i looked into it but the file for unofficial patch is not around anymore if you can find it though do it.\n\nAs for frame limiter I used radeon pro's frame limit option and limited it at 45 FPS (it isnt flawless but it stops the jitter) for nvidia owners not sure how you will do it but I'm suure google might turn something up if you need to or you may already know how.\n\nUpdate edit (8/10/15): Sometimes the game does not close fully when you exit the game the exe continues to run in background hence why my play time is like 171+ hrs I may at most have 20hrs in the game. So keep that sh*t in mind when you done playing check your task manager after you exit game.

The gameplay is REALLY smoother on the pc than on the PS3, works on my win7 home premium 64 bit. The steering is really nice on my rumblepad reacts instantly, works well on widescreen, got all settings maxed out and still works smooth. Autosculpting is really nice with my rumblepad 2, works a whole lot better than the mouse.\n\nWhat I do not like:\nCops, so many cops.. it's almost like they are doing a parade in the game.\n\nGaming gear used:\nLogitech Rumblepad 2 corded.\n\nBugs:\nHad no startup issues playing the game. Few crashes like pc freezes were a common occurrence it seemed until I bought a different pc. Had one bug at the transporter mission, crashed to windows. If you get this just drive to the race and activate it.\n\nNote:\nIf your videocard is going nuts then try vsync in options, helps to calm it down alot.

However, having gone back to it in a more tolerant mood, I'm now in love with it all over again. The 2 most off putting aspects of the game are the car handling (only to begin with) and the graphics. But once you get used to both of these, its an enjoyable open world racer with a decent sized map, good car choice, better customization than most modern racing games, and really damn fun police chases.\n\nWhen you first play it you may be very put off by the bizarre and immensely unrealistic handling of the 200sx that you start with, it basically feels like its got the worlds tightest suspension set up, and the worlds most grippy tyres. Therefore the car will understeer heavily round all corners before suddenly lurching violently out of control if pushed too hard. But a few tuning adjustments and suspension upgrades later this is greatly reduced, and once you get onto driving the skylines, evo's etc the handling model suddenly stops feeling ridiculous and starts feeling like a good old arcade racer.\n\nThe main downsides are....\n\n-Short and poorly told story (But I like the premise none the less)\n-Empty and fairly lifeless city\n-Dated graphics\n-Car handling takes a lot of getting used to\n-Difficulty fluctuates (Starts way too easy, then gets pretty hard)\n\nThe good parts are.....\n\n-Fairly large and well laid out free roam world\n-Decent car selection\n-Good customization\n-Police chases are a blast\n-Variety in race/activity types\n-Cars sound nice and soundtrack is good\n-AI actually make realistic mistakes which allow for varied and unpredictable races\n\nSo if you want a good old open world need for speed game for the purposes of picking out a nice tuner, pouring large amounts of time and money into making it a badass street racing machine, and then smoking some other racers or playing with the cops, then Undercover is perfect for you.\n\nIf you want modern graphics, realistic driving, atmospheric worlds and memorable plot/characters then this isnt the game for you.","January 1","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is REALLY smoother on the pc than on the PS3, works on my win7 home premium 64 bit. The steering is really nice on my rumblepad reacts instantly, works well on widescreen, got all settings maxed out and still works smooth. Autosculpting is really nice with my rumblepad 2, works a whole lot better than the mouse.\n\nWhat I do not like:\nCops, so many cops.. it's almost like they are doing a parade in the game.\n\nGaming gear used:\nLogitech Rumblepad 2 corded.\n\nBugs:\nHad no startup issues playing the game. Few crashes like pc freezes were a common occurrence it seemed until I bought a different pc. Had one bug at the transporter mission, crashed to windows. If you get this just drive to the race and activate it.\n\nNote:\nIf your videocard is going nuts then try vsync in options, helps to calm it down alot. This happens even when you have a really good graphicscard.\n\nRecommend it?\nYes, the cars sound so good in this game.. I can almost smell the fumes playing it.","May 3, 2014","true","32.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice range of cars, more or less affordable cars, and the same tuning system straight outta ProStreet.\n\n\nHow does it drive?\nWeird, just weird. You can tell it is pretty much ProStreet with open world, but they gave the handling cancer. I mean ProStreet´s handling was like driving Trucks on ice, but this one drives like Trucks on rails. I would rather take ProStreet.\n\n\nSteering wheel support?\nKinda. You can use a Wheel if you really want, at least I did with my Thrustmaster RGT Clutch.\nBut it doesn´t make any difference, since you can´t really steer the car very accurate. My Steering Wheel has 270 degree turning radius and the car already fully turnt at half the way.\n\n\nGraphics?\nMost Wanted with better models. That weird yellow overlay you see on the screenshots up there are worse in game.\n\n\nStory?\nThe cutscenes had Heather Fox, but still I don´t give one m8\n\nThe End?\nYes. Weird game, Weird looks, weird everything. If you liked Underground 1, you might like this. If you prefer all other tuner NFS (except the latest one), then just stick with them, this game ain´t really worth it.\n\npls liek und subscrub ♥♥♥.","March 31","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
