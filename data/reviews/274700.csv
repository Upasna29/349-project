I'm very pleased with the PC port and the updated progs and whatnot compared to the freeware version is well worth the price of entry.\n\nIt's a very tight package, and deceptively simple. It's like a mix of Cave Noire and Desktop Dungeons with Decker aesthetics, and it just tickles that puzzle roguelike feel like no other game does. It has simple and clean graphics, and the ambient noises of the various enemies that come to smash you under their digital heel are a fantastic touch.\n\nEvery enemy has a distinct pattern and way they move, the game opens up when you learn to start exploiting that fact in positioning and managing your resources for the various progs. Also the risk reward mechanic of trying to go for a high point run, but doing so in a way where you aren't swarmed into a situation that you can't handle is fantastic.\n\nThe best part is it can be played in a short amount of time, but if you are like me you'll start wanting another run... And another. The streak mechanic really ties into that addictive itch to see if you can better your best streak of wins, or others for that matter.\n\nIn short, if you are looking for an easy to access puzzling game, with roguelike mechanics, tough as nails decisions, far deeper strategy than you though possible, and a slick hackery sci-fi drizzle of aesthetic on top , than pick it up, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.","January 27, 2015","true","7.0"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","30","34","3","0"

Especially with the additional abilities you unlock after every successful run. In some situations it feels like a puzzle game where you have to figure out how to get out of a situation alive.\nIt's a very hard game with a very nice risk/ reward machanic, but you'll learn how to master situations by planning ahead!","January 27, 2015","true","1.0"," 39 of 55 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","39","55","5","2"

You've raided secure nodes for the best programs. You are now ready for the big scores, the hard data. That's how you get the rep. Are you a slick enough cyber-dude to get the goods and slip out?\n\n868-HACK is a roguelike with tactics and strategy so tightly integrated it feels almost like a puzzle game. Hordes of enemies can be overcome with careful application of movement, abilities, exploitation of enemy behavior and the environment. Enemies and abilities operate in clear and logical fashion making it a lot of fun to analyze seemingly impossible situations for the perfect solution. It's so well done when you come up with the answeres you can almost hear the click as everything snaps into place. So even though the game lends itself to short sessions making it perfect for casual play the play itself is not at all trivial. Every move and choice you make will have consequences, immediate and long term. The game is so cleanly designed and clearly presented that the decision making process is highly intuitive making play fast paced and fun. If you play well you'll complete all eight levels, or sectors in the game's terminology, of a run. A run is what the game calls a dungeon. Surviving a run allows you to keep your previous score as you go into your next run. Continued success on runs means you can string these scores together. Can you string together enough conservative runs before the worst happens to climb up the leaderboards? Or are you going to smash and grab your way to the top? Careful, the bigger the score, the higher the risk. This roguelike isn't of the impenetrably punishing variety. Once you learn the rules the only thing that will punish you is your own greed and arrogance. Or who knows, maybe you are really that good.\n\nThis game is a must for fans of short form puzzle roguelikes like Desktop Dungeons or Road Not Taken. Easily worth the full price and then some for fans of this style of roguelike, and I believe it could even make some converts.","January 30, 2015","true","4.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Some move once, some move once but have stealth and take less hits, one can move through the blocks, one moves twice.  Then getting use to all the different abilities you can use.  There are 8 levels and each level gives you two "hacks". When you use a hack you get any of the energy or credits that are watermarked in the squares up, down, left, right, and the one you are on.  If any of those squares of a box with a number on it you get whatever skill is listed on it. Also whatever the number says is how many enemies spawn in when you "hack" the box.  Hacking the boxes with just numbers and no power ups is how you earn points.\n\nEach Level starts with a handful of enemies. Then once they are dead one will spawn autamatically every so 2-3 moves.  To move from each level there is a green square that takes you to the next level.  If you go to the next level with enemies still alive they will go to the next level with you.\n\nOnce you get all this figured out (which takes only 20 mins of eating your ♥♥♥) then the real puzzel part comes into focus.  You have to think about which moves to make to be able to kill everything and not get hit 3 times.  Even when there is no enemies figuring out the best thing to use your hacks on is tough.  " Should I farm resources?" "should I go for points?" "Can I handle 7 enemies right now?"\n\nI am having a good time with it.

While screenshots may make the game appear to be complex, this lightweight little roguelike/turn-based arcade game operates on a very simple and easy to understand set of rules that make playing it and replaying it a breeze. Seriously, a game of 868-HACK will likely only take you anywhere from 5-10 minutes, but it's a game that really thrives on replaying for better scores or just booting it up for a quick run to the end of its 8 sectors.\n\nTaking place on a 6x6 grid, your main objective in 868-HACK is to simply get to the exit without being damaged three times. Clearing a sector will heal one point of damage you've taken. There are only four enemy types and each operates on a defined set of movement rules. One enemy type gets two moves to your one, another type is only visible when you share the same column or row, one can move through obstacles uninhibited, and the final enemy type takes three attacks to destroy rather than two. These patterns are easy to understand and pick up on, but puzzling your way through each sector without getting pincered by your randomly spawning foes is what makes each playthrough exciting.\n\n"Data Siphoning" (or collecting) helpful programs and the resources to use them is the key to overcoming the overwhelming odds. Some programs can instantly destroy foes, others can push them away, and there's always the helpful Reset program, which is a full heal. As you complete the game, you'll continue unlocking new and fun programs which can randomly spawn on every sector, which again, greatly increases the game's replay value.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with this one. It's simple and fiendishly addicting, capturing the same spirit of "Just one more try" that longer and more involved games like The Binding of Isaac have, but with a much smaller time investment. This one's not leaving my installed folder for quite some time.","April 3, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The games likely wont last longer than 5-20 minutes. This makes it perfect for those who are looking for a quick game. I've only gotten to level 7/8 so far, and that was just pushing myself to see what's down there, unlikely that I would have won that round! So, I can't quite say what the end game looks like, but getting there is definitely a fun and strategic journey!","January 29, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really well-designed resource management and scoring mechanics, and fair random level generation.  It's (almost?) always winnable, but hard.  I'd recommend it for roguelike fans if you're in it for the difficulty and resource management, but not to fans into the genre for grind or hilarious deaths.","June 12, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But what's also interesting is that it's easy to grasp the basic principles.... despite that the game's difficulty is then quite high.  However, some of that difficulty will be entirely your own fault...\n\nAt it's core, this is a turn-based Roguelike where your goal is simple:  make it through 8 sectors (each a single screen in  size) by reaching the glowing green box at the end.  And more importantly, do so while getting your score as high as possible.  There's no point in hacking anything if there's no gain after all, right?\n\nIn your way are exactly four types of enemies, and knowing exactly how each one works, and how to deal with each, is of utmost importance.  Demons, the red ones, are very basic in how they move, just coming straight at you, however, they take 3 hits to kill instead of 2. Viruses, the purple ones, move 2 times for every 1 time that you move. The blue orb things are invisible unless you are in a direct horizontal/vertical line with them; however, the spot they initially spawn on will have a blue box thing around it until they've been destroyed, so you're never surprised by them, the game ALWAYS lets you know they are there somewhere, and the spot where they started.  And finally, the pink angular whatsits can go right through walls; fortunately, you can strike them while they are in a wall so long as there is not another wall between you and them.\n\nYour attack is a bit different than in many turn-based roguelikes.  Instead of adjacent attacks, you strike in a horizontal or vertical line with infinite range.  You do this by simply attempting to move towards any enemy you are in a direct line with (this, however, also means you CANNOT just walk towards them; you will always fire instead).  Every enemy that isnt a Demon takes 2 hits to destroy, and the first hit stuns them for a moment.  This mechanic is very basic on paper, but in practice, you really need to time your movements and your attacks carefully.\n\nBut the real thing that makes the game interesting is the hacking, and the programs. In each sector you can acquire 2 "Data Siphons".  Using these basically sucks stuff out of the tile you're on, and the 4 adjacent to you, be they floors or walls.  For floor tiles, you recieve the resources displayed on the tile (credits or energy, or both).  For walls, if the wall has a large number on it, you gain that many points for draining it.  If the wall has a program listed on it, you permanently gain that program.  However, EVERY wall also summons more enemies when you hack it; this is displayed as a number also.  On score walls it's always equal to the score value.  You need to be very, very careful, and weigh your options; is that anti-virus program worth the danger of the 4 enemies it's going to send at you?  Should you grab that Step program, despite that it's position means you cannot get it without hacking a second wall at the same time?  Is that big tempting 7 point wall worth a go, do you have the programs to deal with it?\n\nUsing your programs well (and making decisions on which to go for) is the key to victory.  The game ends up being like a big (and cruel) puzzle.  Figuring out which programs to use, and in what order, is never easy, and ALL programs are useful in some way... but they all cost credits, resources, or both.  Make a mistake, and you can go down fast; 3 hits and your run is over, though you heal 1 point of HP every time you enter a new sector.  The depth here is huge, and it's what makes the game so good and addictive.  There are numerous programs to unlock, as well.  Each new one brings all sorts of strategic possibilities to the game when you encounter it.\n\nAnd the way the spawning works means that to some degree, you create your own difficulty.  Yes, enemies constantly appear, but aside from the loading of a new sector, they do this slowly.  Other than that... your actions will determine when, and how many, enemies will spawn, based on which walls you hack.  Once you've taken an action, you need to use your programs, basic attacks, the level structure, and even the enemy's own behaviors against them in order to escape certain doom.\n\n\nAll in all, this is an absolutely fantastic game.   Very, very addicting, very very fun, and the nature of it means that as you get better, you can up the challenge by simply going after bigger and bigger scores each time.  And above all else, it has alot of depth.\n\nI've played this absolutely to death on the iPad, and I'm very glad to see the port of it appear on here (and it's a good port, too).  I definitely can recommend this one.","February 4","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
