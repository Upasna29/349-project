If you will try to earn some money by running missions, you will be stuck in a loop of 1-3 of them that will repeat themselves over, and over and over. Without slightest bit of variation.\n\nThe traveling in this game is awful, it is very long, tedious, and will consume vast majority of your gameplay. And on top of that, it doesn't benefit you much to be at this time in front of your screen as speed-ups are rare and sparce, and autipilot tends to use most of them anywa. So most of your experience while trying to play this game will be spend... playing another game, or watching youtube. Or doing any pleasruable activity.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, spend your money elsewhere, this isn't worth the AA pricetag, especially for such small and undedeveloped game. For gods sake, it also becomes unplayable if you have high-dpi display, since fonts are of fixed size, designed to look good at 1024x768 resolution. And there is no way to supersize them.","October 18, 2014","false","293.4"," 297 of 396 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","297","396","8","4"

You are not at all forced/encouraged to buy skill point boosters (no constant flashy in-game ads/tricks to get you to buy stuff at a $ store).  I didn’t know about the credit store until much later incidentally.  I would argue you don’t need it, but this requires more patience.\n+Industry; This is where the slight tweaks from things you might expect from Eve take a little twist.  Resource gathering has two flavors to match your playstyle, one more involved than the other, allowing for different degrees of player focus.  A simple observation, but allows one to choose indy-activities that are not exclusively biased towards afk-play.\n+Combat; Even in PVE you can take on much more difficult spawns if you play the environment and use cover effectively.  This is where the game really shines.  You can fit stable tanks if you want but will greatly limit what you can contend with on the field.\n+/-Market; Typical free-open market sandbox-y MMO thing, starting to become commonplace in all games.  True, critical mass of demand and supply is needed to be effective.  The player base is small, but effective.  Also, player corporations can have in-corp markets, which I will say is a pro and con.  Huge incentive for players to join larger corps, but does so at the reduction of supply on the open markets.  Take this as an opportunity to sculpt your own market niche in the game and exploit it!  Not necessarily an issue of game mechanics, just density.\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are not great.  Not a deal breaker for me given the price range/Free to play status of the game.  I would argue for the price, the development team and the work they put in, I think its good.\n\n{Pre- 3.6 evaluation}\n-Missions/Assignments; they are not so great.  Quite bare-bones, not a lot of variety, sometimes buggy!  That being said, they are the next thing on the dev’s list to rework.\n{Post-3.6}\n...=D\n\nBear in mind, my standards are not your standards.  This is my perspective.  I rarely purchase games, eve had me occupied for years.  By my estimation, so will Perpetuum for similar reasons.","November 1, 2014","true","328.1"," 89 of 104 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","89","104","2","0"

That is of course something, you might find in any other game, but in a "full loot" game, the developers need to keep an very close eye on that.\nLast but not least,if you want to get the best Mechs with the best equipment, you need a lot of EP, which will take a lot of real time.\nAnd even if you take the "shortcut" over an EP booster, it will still take you a very long time to reach that goal.\n\nKeep all of that in mind before you consider to buy Perpetuum - then why the thump up?\n\nI think the game and the developers deserve a shot at this, therefore i supported the game with my purchase and invested a lot of time into it.\nI would really like to see this game go on and evolve into more, something that is enjoyable for new and vet. players, and for PvE and PvP players alike.\n\nBut for that to happen, the developers have still a lot of work to do, sandbox or no sandbox, players expect more from games today.\nSand alone does not make the box more interesting or fun, you also need varying kinds of things to play with in that box too...\n\nIn the end, it's your call.","April 14, 2014","true","35.7"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","59","64","0","0"

I liked it enough to spend $10 on one of the upgrade packs, and I plan on buying the next when I can.\n\nI am writing this review from a casual point of view. I play this game with a relaxed mindset so if you're looking for a hardcore gamer, you are reading the wrong review. Here is what I have noticed in my roughly 180 hours so far.\n\nRATING: 70/100\nPROS:Massive open world. I still haven't visited all the sights of Nia.\nPassive time-based progression. Extension Points (EP) accumulate whether or not you are active. These are used to upgrade your skills, so naturally, the older players will have slight advantages over newer ones.\nHigh levels of build customization and specialization. There are tons of items to choose from to fine-tune to your liking.\nVarying levels of risk and player interaction. You don't have to join a PvP corporation to make a living, but the added risk definetely pays off.\nSmooth user interface. This might just be me, but the Windows-like menus are really good for managing lots of information at once.\nSimple gameplay with complex mechanics. Locking on to targets takes just a few clicks, but there are a lot of things to consider when engaging enemies, like what kind of armor they have, distance of their weapons and yours, and several Electronic/Energy-Warfare tactics.\nAccessible in-depth wiki. Referencing official information does not require alt+tabbing out of the game as the Perpetuum wiki can be accessed with a few clicks while playing, and the information provides a lot of the formulas and intricacies for you, so there is little guesswork involved when optimizing builds.\nCONS:Dwindling playerbase. While I do enjoy not being blown up in PvP-enabled areas, there aren't a whole lot of people online to begin with. I'm not sure what turned off so many players, but there could definitely be a revival if an effort is made. The servers and mechanics are just fine, all is needed is some better recruitment.\nSmall variety in environments. Compared to how many different items there are in the game, some of the islands feel a tad barren, repetitive, or otherwise monotonous. Considering the amount of time it takes to travel across Nia, some refurbishing would be nice on the eyes. I play on medium quality settings, but the game already sacrifices graphics fidelity for performance of its large world.\nI have been making a living by simple mining, PvE assignments, and artifact hunting. I shy away from PvP since I don't like the stress involved but the community tends to be nice. Even the few times I have gotten blown up while on Beta islands, my killers were courteous and offered advice on how not to get caught next time, realizing I wasn't a threat to them only afterwards.\n\nMy rating is subject to change. improving if the developers add more content, rectify some problems, and/or if more players are introduced.","December 21, 2015","true","342.6"," 53 of 56 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","53","56","0","1"

The nanite swarm then infect and control the bodies of sentient robotic lifeforms that inhabit the planet of Nia.\nThe human race is now locked in an on going battle not only against the resistant robotic lifeforms, that are fighting to defend their homeworld, but also against each other in an on-going effort to harvest as much energy as possible.\n\nPerpetuum does take a few minutes to get to grips with, while it uses the good old WASD controls there are menus and HUD elements that you will need to familiarise yourself with before you dive right in. Bit of a steep learning curve but it makes it worth while learning how to play.\n\nThe game doesn’t boast the best graphics but it can be rather enjoyable watching a large mech rain hellfire down upon its enemies. The sound and music in the game is very good, the music especially. The game is an MMO for a reason with players being the driving force behind everything. High tech items can only be produced by players and this requires teamwork. Nothing starts a conflict like wanting complete and total domination over the entire game world.","April 10, 2014","true","72.9"," 94 of 119 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","94","119","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ristleraine/recommended/223410/","Ristleraine","Ristle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ristleraine/","238 products in account","Long time EVE player who took notice over this game due to Steam recommending it after binging hard in New Eden, and reading about how it plays similar to EVE, only with mechs as opposed to space ships. What I found was a playable game, but one that makes EVE the clearer choice for those who can afford the monthly sub.\n\nFirst order of business is that Perptuum is only Early Access as a Steam title. It has existed since late 2010, and as such, will be reviewed fully on the merit of what it has presented to me during my brief playtime, with its four and a half years worth of content.\n\nGood\n+ DEV Zoom seems to mingle with the players quite often, both on the forums, as well as ingame. Most games have the developers stay just out of reach of players, but this game always has this one team member accessible for a good portion of the day by day, which I applaud for a show of passion.\n\n+ Newbie Island is a thing here in Perp. I'm going to list this also as a con later on, since I feel the training section is a bit mishandled, but they place new accounts in a "training simulation" which is basically a confined zone of modest size, where you start with all skills at halfway, and they force you to progress through all manners of content, to allow the player to become familiar with how it works. You can skill up as you wish here, with no harm done to your account once you leave this area, so it allows players a chance to tinker and get a feel of the skill system, as well as how it impacts elements of the gameplay, which I personally feel EVE fails at outside of a cold lockout for new players that join New Eden.\n\n+ The game overhauled its mission system to be far more accessible, which as a new player, I found as a great boon. While EVE would try to sugarcoat their quests with flavor text and other vanity, Perp has reworked their system to be more streamlined, allowing players to focus on their personal interests such as mining / combat, go out into the world and accomplish the goal, and return to a mission terminal in record time to collect their reward.\n\nBad\n\n- Horrible UI. In EVE, you have your toolbar that you can move around as you wish from side to side, yet in Perp, it is always at the top of the screen. You can move the various HUD elements around as you wish, but you cannot resize beyond certain points.\n\n- Unable to change resoulution. Due to some wonky design choices from the dev team, the screensize is either locked to your full resolution, or a screen size befitting 2004. When you go to a larger resolution, it merely pins items spread out, but does not adjust the font sizing on these items, as one of the devs stated in the game that their engine treats the UI as 3D elements or something or the other, and that is why the dev team cannot readily make changes to the endless barrage of players requesting this feature to be overhauled.\n\n- Lack of shortcuts. Again with EVE, you have your toolbar and it lists various keyboard shortcuts for you to utilize to access any element, as well as even having the option to close all screen clutter with CTRL + ALT + W.\n\nPerp? Next to nothing seems to flow the same as you would expect coming from EVE, and your toolbar does not say what any of these hotkeys are. You have to dig deep into the options to find them on your own accord, and it just should not be this way. Information is ammunition, so having it all readily available at your fingertips is somthing that should have readily been copied from EVE's toolbar, not merely left to an options menu. This style of gameplay is the type where more info = better, and taking excess time to click icons manually or assigning things serves to merely drag the experience onward, instead of propelling the player through aspects of the game.\n\n- Training is pretty bad. Compared to EVE's approach of Aura acting as a questline agent to advance you through various elements of training you desire, Perpetuum forces you to advance through all the training before you are allowed into the "real" game. On average, this takes about two hours or so for most players advance through, which is both a blessing and a curse. It is a harsh reminder of just how complex EVE and Perp are in their game systems, but EVE allows players the chance to completely skip the training and take a "feel it out" approach, while Perp does not allow this freedom. Making an alt to play the game differently? Too bad, hope you like getting stuck doing training.\n\n- Overly convoluted gathering system. To gather in EVE, you merely need skill training for the tech, and of course a mining laser / gas harvester. With additional training, you can have mining crystals for certain loadouts to increase your mining yield.\n\nGathering in Perp? Oh boy, you better get ready to yell at how needlessly involved they have crafted it by comparison. First, you need to equip a mining attachment, or a gathering attachment. From there, you need ammo per cycle, and it gets more aggrivating with mining. Gathering has a universal ammo that you can obtain rather cheap, mining is nowhere near as easy on the user.\n\nTo mine, you need your scanner setup with two ammo types. One is a "range finder", the other shows you the density of an area after you've played Marco Polo with the system and wasted enough ammo charges to find the location on the map of where items are set. From here, you need the right mining ammo charges set to mine it. Looking for something low class like Titanium? You need specific Titanium charges to mine it. They can ONLY be used to mine Titanium. This means that if you're not mining for a mission, but rather for yourself, you must waste precious cargo space with various ammo types, which might not be an issue anyways, as you need specific scanner ammos to seek out any mining.\n\nIn EVE terms, this would mean having to equip a scanner with Veldspar locator ammo to find the location of a belt, then using another type of Veldspar scanner ammo to actually be able to lock onto it, then you need to cycle your ammo if you have not done so to equip Veldspar mining ammo, so you can actually mine it. This is very horrible design in my opinion, and does not add depth to the game, only tedium to an already arguably tedious playstyle.\n\n- Launcher is unoptimized garbage. A recent update that overhauled the mission structure was implemented with a 1.6 MB download on Steam for the game, which then led to having to load the Perp launcher and sit through updates. The update was a mere 16.06 MB in size, but it took about 15 minutes for my PC to download it, which I haven't seen done in any MMO since FFXI and its 56kbs speed cap.\n\n- Pop is severely low. Usually sub 50 players listed in chat channels, with over 100ish logging in daily to keep their skill points churning in. I see it as each player holding more meaning to the game overall, but others will see this as a dead game walking.\n\n- P2W. In EVE, all choices are final with your skills, unless CCP nukes a set somehow. In Perp? You can pay real money to reset points and have them to spend on whatever you want. Recent balance changes before I joined severely nerfed many loadouts for PvP and other aspects of gameplay people spent months or more training into. Solution? Just open your wallet if you want to and get SP back to invest into the new meta, or lament having skills wasted by wanton dev decisions and train normally into the new meta. EVE works it so new can compete with old by specialized training, while Perp lets the old stay on top by wallet or ingame ICE (PLEX) use.\n\nAll in all, I found Perp as the offbrand cola for my desire for a namebrand fix. Sam's Cola is not quite the same as Pepsi, nor is Perp really EVE, but I found myself enjoying it despite its many shortcomings, and appreciating it for what it offers. I can easily recommend EVE for those seeking quality, but at the same time, Perp exists as a cheap pay to own option to EVE's fees.","June 20, 2015","true","31.6"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","42","48","0","0"

(bad)\n\n2. The World does seem to be alive, with things going on around you, though when I played there hadn't been that many people on, but I found some nonetheless, and the possibilities for exploration are very, very great. (good)\n\n3.  The Tutorial is very, very well put together, you learn everything you need to, to get started in the game. Though the tutorial check list seems a bit daunting at first, its pretty easy to follow (with the exception of the horrible font size), and at the end of it all you get some free stuff after completing it that helps you out when you finally get to the game world proper (if you skip the tutorial you don't, good incentive, not to mention you'll be completely lost if you aren't already coming from a game like EVE online). (good)\n\n4. One of the bad parts about the game is that after the tutorial (and chosing the faction you want) you aren't really prompted to do anything, you kinda just spawn at the beginners base of said faction and nothing comes up to tell you what to do. The Quests (Assignments) are very repetitive, mostly go to "A" attack "B" get "Item" from "B"'s wreckage deliver "Item" to "C", or go to area "A" scan for "certain mineral/Artifact" locate "mineral/artifact" mine/retrieve "mineral/artifact" and deliver to "B" or some variation there of, the only difference is that the more in good standing you are with the faction you chose at the end of the tutorial increasingly difficult assignments are unlocked for you to complete, but they never stray far from this template. The game feels very grindy for a game with time-based progression, you have to log in once a day to get certain points to level up skills of your choosing, and you need to level up certain skills to be able to use more powerful mechs, so even if you have the money, you can't use the mech till you level up the skills to use it. (bad)\n\n5. The graphics are atrocious for 2014, or even 2011 or 2010 when the game launched beta or alpha. Maybe for 2003 or 2004 they were good, but damn they ungly now. The mechs don't feel like mechs... look kinda flimsy, even the ones you get to try out during the tutorial which take some time to acquire, (not that they are bad in combat, they just don't look it is all). The sounds for the mechs are also bad, too low when they shoudn't be and cut in and out constantly, the "thump, thump" that you would expect a heavy bipedal mech to have as it walks isn't there, the sounds for the weapons are also bad, except for the missle, which I'd say is alright all around. (bad)\n\n6. Combat is in the vein of Mech warrior online, just with longer locking target times, and point and click targeting/firing, and chance based hitting depending on the weapon used, not as exciting as mech warrior online, but still fun, if you manage to get into a battle that'll make you sweat a bit (that probably won't happen early on), may be too many variables to take into consideration for some people though. Mechs of the same class from the 3 different factions balance each other out well. (good)\n\n7. Crafting in the game is also very, very grindy, you must acquire research points by the hundreds by looting "kernels" from wreckage of mechs you destroyed. Only one kernel amounts to one research point, and you get anywhere from atleast 1 (most of the time, rarely none) to 10 kernels from a mech you destroyed (though i only played the beginning and therefore they may drop more kernels the harder the enemies get), and you need from what I saw in the research panel thousands of them, and you need 2 types of kernels for some 3 research trees with atleast 1 different type of kernel required for each tree. Honestly though you can start making money after your first investment in any one of the trees (you can pursue all of the them, choosing one doesn't exclude you from the rest), by building that first item (which requires you to scan, locate and mine for minerals/metal), and selling it on the market, which gets you a good amount of money from what I saw. Making money seems to be very easy in the game, but money doesn't give you everything, because skill trees and research points must be advanced/unlocked/gained first which is good, but the hard grind you have to commit to isn't. (bad)\n\n\nThese aspects are the ones I chose to review the game from, there are a few more but they don't matter as much to someone just starting out in the game, because it takes a lot of grinding to get to those aspects. Time is something someone who plays this game is going to want to have alot of to get anywhere in it. EVE players wouldn't mind maybe, but not all players are are people who've played EVE and thats why I've written this, because most people who reviewed the game don't seem to review it from an unbiased point of view. But don't take my word for it try it out yourselves if you have the money to spare, its great in some aspects and poor in others, I'd give it a no on the recommendation rating, but I dont speak for everyone.","April 29, 2014","false","5.1"," 108 of 172 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","108","172","0","8"

In Eve-online, considering the size of the universe and player community, it is easy for a new player to feel lost. It is hard to make significant impact within the game, where as in Perpetuum you can.\n\nThis game has it's learning curve and earning the in-game experience before your robots can take on veterans.

Definitely a hidden gem that only lacks a bit of investment by those seeking an amazing futuristic scifi sandbox mmo. If you enjoyed EvE you will enjoy Perpetuum. My only issues with the game after 650 hours of play time is the poor UI. If there was a better elevation depiction on the Radar for pvp and also a sort of Tactical overlay like what EvE has I would be completely content giving it a 10/10. Main reasons for the lack of said fixes? No one seems to know about this game :P\n\nI played EvE for over 6 years and got fed up with the subscriptions and lack of pvp mechanics to support small scale combat as well as large scale combat without becoming the "death blob" where any monkey who can listen to an FC call targets and hit F1 can be a pvper. In Perpetuum there are mechanics such as interference and AoE damage when robots explode. 100 man drake fleets would not want to orbit the fc at 500m in Perpetuum because if one or two die in close proximity to the rest of the fleet it would be a beautiful cascade of exploding drakes. I have been on the winning and losing side of those cascades and it gets me every time. PvP in perpetuum is the reason I remain here instead of returning to EvE. Every individual needs to be aware of their strengths/weaknesses/surroundings to avoid being a hindrance to a group let alone being effective.\n\nI also spent my first two years in EvE doing industry. As far as crafting goes in EvE it is usually straight forward until you get to t2/t3 manufacturing. All of the crafting in Perpetuum is like t3 and t2 where you must first unlock what you wish to create by gathering kernals and then spending said kernals. After an item is unlocked (there are two trees, one for personal research and one for corporation research. Having an item unlocked for the corp as well as the individual will give bonuses) you can then prototype it. A prototype is much more expensive than the module/robot you wish to produce. It also requires some additional resources that are gathered from destroyed npc's. Once the protoype is done it can be Reverse Engineered into a CT or Calibration Template. The CT is like the BPC in EvE. There are no BPO's, you must continually prototype and reverse engineer what you wish to produce as your CT's get worn-out. As the CT gets used it becomes less and less efficient also. To get the materials needed to actually do the manufacturing side of things it will require components made of a combination of plants, liquids, and ores from various islands to make a finished product.\n\nI know these are fat blocks of text but every detail is needed for this game. The pvp system far exceeds EvE online and the Crafting system has such a depth to it that eve will never reach simply because the sinks for resources and currency are so high. It requires a very hardcore gamer to truly understand this game and it requires an equally hardcore community to utilize all the picks and shovels in this sandbox.","October 8, 2014","true","376.6"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","27","38","2","1"

The only other game remotely like this is Eve online.  You can't dispute it.  The skill progression here is much better though because you don't have to actively pick what skills you want to level up, you just accrue points every day.\n\nI'm pretty much addicted to this game. I played it in 2012 but stopped due to boredom.  But I'm back several years later because there just aren't too many games like this on the market.  Perp definately has potential.  A few short comings in certain areas, such as the poor graphics and GUI.  The lead dev Zoom has stated that they'd like to do a graphics update but lack of funding is preventing that.  This game has a very small audience but die hard fans.\n\nThe PVP and combat isn't as intense as Eve.  You can't rotate around your opponent so fast that their lasers cant hit you.  But you can use the environment to your advantage.  Faster mechs generally do far better as they can run away if things get hot.  PVP is Perp is full loot.  That means when you die, you lose everything and your opponent gets some of your loot.  PvP isn't completely open however.  There are various islands.  You are relatively safe from PvP for quite some time as by the time you make it to the beta islands, you're pretty powered up.  With this being a time based skill progression game however, that will take some time......unless you purchase the two packs along side the main game.  Those two packs save you 5 1/2 months of time.  I think they're worth $20.\n\nSo the main issue with Perp is the lack of a player base.  The game is mostly player driven.  That means that after the starter islands, you won't find gear or new mechs sold by NPC's, only by players.  So if their aren't any players left, then you pretty much have to craft everything yourself.  I've never found it difficult to find gear though, at least not yet.\n\nThe game has ALOT of grinding and is pretty much P2W unfortunately.  This really can't be disputed.  You can pay real money to buy extension point upgrades that give you more skill points over time than non paying customers.  As this game has full loot pvp on the beta and gamma islands, people that put alot of real money into this game will get ahead faster.  The argument could be said that those that don't wish to pvp can just stay on the alpha islands.  Ok....so about half the content is on the latter islands.  If you want to build colonies and terraform for your guild (corporation) then you need to leave the alpha islands.  You will eventually pvp with other folks that want to ruin your day.  I can say however, that pvp in Perp isn't as sadistic as Eve.  You won't have people camping your mining spot waiting for you to jettison some ore so they can steal it and flag themselves as hostile.\n\nSo there you.  You can mine, treasure hunt, do combat, build modules and mechs for other players, etc etc.  The only thing you can't do in this sandbox MMO is be a trader I suppose becasue most of the game is player driven.  So I suppose you could raise inflation if you wanted to be a jerk.  But this isn't elite dangerous level's of trading where one hub needs supplies more than another hub.  It's all mostly player driven after the starter island.\n\n\nHere is a Let's Play I did.

On each island you're just presented with a landscape plus "frills" which include frankly derpy looking vegetation and buildings which not only serve no purpose but also which aren't even attributed a purpose - they're just there.  Secondly, the graphics are really poorly implemented.  They're not good graphics in the first place and I have a half-decent and modern GPU-processor combo, yet I had appalling framerates.  The worst of it is that this wasn't a product of the engine being really great, or of not having suitable graphical nerfs included in the menu - the framerates for me were low even with all the graphics settings turned right down and, worst of all, seemed to drop off as a result of calculations being made regarding  visual  stuff going on which wasn't being rendered in any way.  It's a really stupid problem - say I'm sat at the edge of an island, near the coast.  Looking 180 degrees in the coastwards direction, framerates are fine.  The other 180 degrees entail a droppng framerate which is worst when looking towards the centre of the island where all the "stuff" is happening  despite the fact that there's a fecking mountain in the way!   This can't be due to anything other than sloppy programming, since the "stuff" going on is always going on, no matter where I'm looking, and is not rendered because of BIG geographical obstacles.  There is also the immersion-breaking issue of walking robots  skating over the ground.   I mean how difficult would it have been to time the animation to the movement speed so that the impression of walking is actually achieved?  The community is good, nice people, very helpful and the idea is not too bad.  It's just poorly implemented.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless it goes F2P, it's certainly not worth £20-odd.","November 8, 2014","false","50.0"," 48 of 83 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","48","83","0","1"

As a rule I do not enjoy PvP, so my reactions are towards the resource and development side of the game.\n\nFirst up, the UI.  Tedious and badly designed and confusing.  It's like someone took Windows 95 and tried to make it into a game.  What I want is an interactive terrain map so I can enjoy the graphics, not a screen full of menus.\n\nComplexity, generally quite good. The development tree is nice and detailed, with a huge range of options. Sadly the variety of resources is somewhat limited and there is no difference in quality.  The game is all about how much you can extract and this has to be done in-game. I would rather have a robot that I could leave mining, like the extractors in SWG, and come back to check up on it and empty its hopper every couple of days.This then makes a bit of competition, and the search for the best minerals becomes much more compelling.\n\nThe surveying is good with migrating resources, which I like.  Unfortunately it is spoilt by the interface, which only allows me to zoom in and out of the map, and does not pan.  Neither can I use my scanned markers as waypoints, which are also fiddly to manage and the type print is so small I have to squint at the screen. Also, the multitude of charges for scanners and mining kit is just annoying.  It would be much better with a single universal charge, far less fiddly. I would like to be able to zip across the tarrain pining away multiple scanners like I did in my landspeeder.\n\nTravel is particularly slow and annoying.  Fortunately I don't need to go anywhere much yet, but if you have a call to meet up with your corp, you could be in for a 45 minute haul to cross the islands to reach them.  I would prefer to have a quick teleport to any terminal where there is a robot stored, which makes much more sense. As it is, I dont show up to most corp missions, because I can't be arsed with the travel time.\n\nWith game missions thankfully there is a nice end of mission teleport, which is  a small blessing that means you don't need to haul back to base everytime you want to log out.\n\nExploration, so far as I can tell, is largely pointless.  There are no points of interest in the game and no rewards for exploring the gameworld.  You might aswell stay on one island until your corp need you or unless you need to find that rare mineral.\n\nCombat is slow, painfully slow, targetting and making sure you have the right ammo and moving all the flipping windows and menus around. Yuk!  I prefer something twitch based with a joystick, then you might get me back into PvP.\n\nThankfully XP is rewarded on a loyalty base, like EVE, so long as you log in each day you get your quota.  No need for a tiresome grind.  I will stick with it for a bit to explore the tech tree, but as soon as someone creates a better surveying terrain interactive interface with a more SWG-like mining method I will move again.\n\nThere is nothing in this game to make me rush home from work to want to play and it is unlikely to ever be a point of conversation with gaming buddies other than a 30 second grumble about how it could be done better.","January 3","false","28.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/balaamsass/recommended/223410/","balaamsass","Balaam's ass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/balaamsass/","452 products in account","tldr; I'm a nub, and so far the game is ^^^ with lots left to learn - but the early game is a sharp-ish learning curve.\n\n--\n\nDisclaimer: At the time of this writing I am 6 hours into the game; this review is written from a very nub perspective.\n\nMy first impression of this game from the trailers was, "This could be what a Mechwarrior/Battletech MMO could have been..."  Well, it turns out, not exactly; while the game view is notably more like Mech Commander than anything else I've played, the rest of the game play is very reminiscent of EVE, complete with things that sound hard to do, until you do them.  Once.  That's all it takes.\n\nThe tutorial is very detailed (and for good reason) but moves quickly as you go step-by-step through learning the interface, which is largely accessible by visible buttons on the UI.  The mech bay view (where you get your missions, store your unused-but-not-sold items, store materials you will eventually sell/use for crafting, research, skillgain, buy/sell, and configure your mechs [called robots in the game, since your pilot is remote rather than within]) is fairly easy to adapt to, and is one of the reasons I mention EVE.  Cargo is nearly identical in terms of access, repairs, movement between bays, and unit configuration, and market access and use it all but the same as I recall it (from about 4 years ago), but skill gains are different, almost opposite.  Where in EVE you would select a skill and a timer would start and count down to completion of study, this game accrues skill points daily at a set rate (which can be increased with ingame functions); when you login you get your allotment of points, then for the next 2 days you gain points again, whether you login or not.  If you don't login after the third day though your skillpoint gain stops, and will begin again when you login next.  Said points are then spent for an immediate gain of a skill on a scale from 1-10, with difficulty/complexity ratings that modify skill gain (again, same as EVE did) to cost more points the more complex the skill is rated.\n\nCombat is fairly straightforward.  The one thing that I do not like is that there seems to be no 'shooting from the hip' at all, ever; you wait until your guns lock on, even if you're at point blank range, then engage them and they fire on a timer, automatically quitting when the primary target is out of range or destroyed.\n\nYou can loot containers while fighting.  You can lock several targets at once, provided they are in range of your gear/skill.  You can reload guns in combat.\n\nThere are non-combat focused missions as well as combat missions, and you can toggle PVP on/off.\n\nIn base areas there are tiles placed to speed movement; very helpful.\n\nThe chat community seems friendly so far, and is knowledgeable and helpful when asked clear questions.\n\nCompleting the tutorial was an area of boredom, until I realized that I actually did need to know 'all this crap.'  DO the tutorials, but don't stick around trying to farm easy loot from drones, or using your materials to gain research, or anything else; you all but full reset once you join the real world via choosing a faction.  I advise that you want to budget ~2 hours for the tutorial.  That's LONG, and don't be in doubt, it can be done much faster, but use this time to learn the game as far as you can, given no true baptism by fire.\n\nThis is a serious game for serious gamers, but can be enjoyed by teens on up to graybeards.  There is some number crunching, and I have yet to PVP, but so far... so good.\n\nBottom line: I reckon I can get a couple hundred hours out of this game in its current state.\n\n8/10 would buy game on sale again.  For the time I expect to put in, paying full price would still be a good deal.\n\nNice job, Avatar Creations!","January 1","true","22.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Through this you eventually grow on your path towards a specific race of robots, each with their strong suits. The green bots favor missiles and shields (basically turning the game into a form of high-stakes "peek-a-boo"), the blue robots are quicker and utilize railgun tech, meanwhile the yellow robots are sturdy armor tankers that enjoy lasers. There are many, many traits that go with the robot, each of which can be skilled up by spending daily-acquired skillpoints. The skills vary from mining efficiency to how fast you can fire a weapon.\nEven in the earlier stages of the game you can find good and sustainable ways for income to your character in the form of hunting mobs/pvp raiding/industry, familiar to the ever-so-referenced EVE Online. You can even start an alien farm. With simple gameplay mechanics it is strangely relaxing to have your robo simply unleash hell on mobs while taking in the well-thought-out alien environment. Plus, if you decide to throw down only 10$bux a month (which is about the price of a chipotle lunch) you get a lot more skillpoints that grow at a continual rate.\n\nPROS:\nSimple gameplay, high ceiling\nPlayer-ran eco\nPlayer-ran territory control (higher levels)\nDoes not take all of your day, can be played in segments\nNew-player friendly community\nCute robots\nMurderous robots\nBizarre art-style\nSurreal OST\nSolo play is very feasible\n\nCONS:\nRequires a thirst for knowledge\nUI can feel a bit strange at times\nEarlier areas are very open, almost lonesomely so\nEnemy AI may need a bit of tweaking\nAlmost too easy to farm at times\n","January 22","true","28.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It's extremely bleak and simple. The gameplay is complex and engrossing and worth playing for but don't expect it to be very pretty. This is a real economy game, everything is made from resources gathered, station markets are independent and almost no products are seeded. Explore, scan, mine, gather, refine, research, build, manufacture, transport, trade, fight. It's all there and done well. A game that can recreate all aspects of a real world and can be played as simply or complex as you desire. Many comparisons to EvE Online are made. As I've spent many years in that game with high level characters I can say similiarities are present but Perpetuum is it's own game with it's own merits and deserves to be recognized as so.\n\nI would vastly prefer Perpetuum would they overhaul the graphics, possibly with the funds received from their Steam launch! lol.. It may be what makes the difference in new player retention as well. Now that the subs fee's are gone it's up to selling boost time.

There are industrial missions as well if you are into harvesting.  The stat grind is endless, so completionists will get their money worth from this game.  The faction leveling is slow, and the starting missions are very easy, but involve running around a lot.  I am hoping that once I get to level 2 missions there is less running around and more faction gain, but it's not that big of deal and typical of most MMOs.  The loot I am getting from NPCs I blow up at the start of the game is vendor trash for the most part, but rarely I get some item I can use which can feel rewarding.\n\nResource gathering is unique, and interesting.  Unlike other MMOs that have nodes everywhere, Perpetuum makes you search for the node by using scanners or giving you a general location via mission updates.  The first scanner you get isn't 100% accurate, so you have to use it a few times to get a bearing on where to head.  When you get close you use a different type of ammo in the scanner to indicate where exactly to dig.  I really like this feature compared with other MMOs.\n\nI haven't played any PVP yet, but the ping I am getting on the US west coast is very low.  Especially now that they have relocated the server and optimized it.  Looking forward to loosing my first mech!\n\nThe online community seems accepting to new players, and I have had all my questions answered without a gang of trolls chasing me around on chat and forums.  From what I have read Perpetuum has been in development for a considerable amount of time, and it really shows in the lack of bugs and quantity of hard core helpful players.

I enjoyed that one but always in the back of my mind was the thought, hmmm I need to make enough money in game to pay for the $15 a month sub and try to advance my character.\nThat was a major turn off for me with EVE, paying for a sub for 6 months to a year before you get enough skill points to be "good."\n\nThen I stumbled upon this little gem.\nOnly $30 total and you own the game, no monthly subscription necessary.  (Edit, base game is now $10 instead of $30)  The same price as a movie ticket for 2 hours.\nIf you do buy the 2 DLC packs for $20 they save you about 5 months of daily logging in and you can get into a much bigger badder robot from day 1.\nI would like to point out that there is an option to spend $10 a month to get a 150% increase in daily skill points if you want to get into something faster.\n\nTo be very simple is it EVE Online with robots.\nLet me state right here and now this is not a FPS, first person shooter.\nIf you think it is like MWO or the old Mechwarrior games it is not.\nControls are your standard WASD you target the enemy then either select weapons one by one or hit space to have them all shoot at the target.\n\nEverything you could do in EVE you can do here.\nSolo play PVE,  Farming, Mining, Crafting even player owned bases.\nThe game also has full PVP with 100% loot on the Beta and Gamma islands.\nRobot death is permanent, if you lose your ride you need to buy or make another one.\nDon't worry if you ever run out of robots you always get the free starter rookie bot the Arke.\n\nThe graphics are a bit outdated but this game has been around for over 6 years.\nThe soundtrack gets old pretty fast but you can mute it and play your own.\n\nThe potential here is huge.\n\nNow for the downsides.\nThis game needs more players.  No getting around it.  It will never be as big as EVE with 20000 players, the game simply won't support it.  The islands are kinda small and even with 10 people on each one during peak times it gets a bit crowded.\nThe entire market is player based, like in EVE, so everything in game is made by a player.\nWIth ony a few hundred total players the markets are pretty bare.  Most of the modules and robots are made and sold inside the big PVP player corps.  The materials needed for the higher tier gear T3 and T4 are locked behind the PVP Beta islands so if you only do PVE good luck getting the best gear.\nSecond, lack of room.\nI know, I know you guys are all scratching your heads saying but you just said there were not enough players.\nThe landscape of Perpetuum is 36 interconnected islands.\nThe islands themselves are pretty small and you can travel from one tip to the other tip in less then an hour real time.\nThis is broken down into 3 factions, lasers, cannons and missiles.  I have not been here long enough to know their names but there you have it.  So each faction has a starting island, an Alpha with no PVP, then there are 3 Alpha 2 islands, also no PVP but tougher PVE robots.  Then there are the beta and finally the gamma islands.  So out of 36 islands you have a total of 3 x 1 + 3 x 2 = 9 PVE islands where the entire community hangs out.\n\nThird and last complaint / suggestion.\nThis game needs more robot types, there are way too few choices, one noob bot, 1 light bot per faction, 1 light EW bot per faction, 1 assualt mech per faction, 1 mech per faction and finally 1 heavy mech per faction.  There are also a handful of industry robots you can have.\nWhat this game desperately needs is more players, then more resources for the developers so it can reach its full potential and be truly great.\n\nI highly recommend this game and for the incredible cheap price, cheaper then even most DLC for a MMO today you get it all.\n\nI never played any PVP.\nIf you want to join a PVP corp you will need a headset, mic  and Teamspeak 3, mandatory requirement for every corp with more then 3 players in it at this time.","December 31, 2015","true","346.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

PvE or PvP is entirely your choice. there are are six core islands that have pvp disabled by default and twelve additional islands where pvp is defaulted as on. In the furthest islands you're able to construct bases with attached facilities to increase production speeds and percentages so you can craft faster and more effecently, start farms and mining facilties to generate income.\n\nPros:\n*Large open world with each island feeling unique in terrain and layout.\n(Supposedly the Gamma/Outer islands are terraformable but I haven't gotten that far yet)\n*Dynamic market ran by players\n*Fairly deep and expansive crafting system, granting you the ability to build any item or bot in game\n*Combat is actually complex, more than just lock target and spam missiles. There is a great deal of planning and reposistioning involved along with specific module timing that can make or break a fight\n\nCons:\n*UI is a bit of a hassle when you first start however you can quickly and easily resize the windows and make the hud shape to your desire.\n*Crafting can get very tedious in the higher tiers as you most contruct blueprints and items of the lower tiers and craft them into increasingly expensive items. This however does become less of an issue if you specialize into crafting and production or have someone in your corporation that is.\n*Kinda long tutorial that goes over every little aspect of the game, however it does award you a handful of ammo, modules, and some higher tier mechs for completing the tutorial. My biggest complaint is that you have to complete the tutorial to recieve these rewards every time you start a new character, which could get annoying.\n*Low population, as of this writing there is fifty players online. In the past two weeks I've seen it stay steadily at a hundred. The small population can be a plus however as that allows for more personal and intense corporation skirmishes in the outer islands when competing for dominance. Overall the somewhat low player count doesn't hurt the game but an increase of players would be nice.\n\n\nOverall, this game is an absolute gem for just $10. If you give it a chance and join a corporation you'll have a grand time making friends and growing in power.\n\n","February 24","true","149.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I have been trying to find a game like eve online for months now. I soon realized i already had it!

Building up your little bots, upgrading to Mechs to rock other pvp players, or just doing combat missions with a friend is a blast. Be warned, the tutorial is slow, but is needed to earn the important mechanics to play the game.

And it surely is.\nI really like the way the user interface is designed, it's very clean and easy to understand, not too fancy but not to dull either, it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do - give you the info you need fast.\n\nThe music is also something I really like, for once I do not have to mute the music, it's a bit psytrance\ambient inspired, and works very well with the game.\n\nThe graphics is good, I really like it, and since it's a MMO it's that kind of style on the graphics, all though in this game I'd say its better then what I expected. Lot's of nice little effects on the different machines.\n\nThe tutorial is great for new players (me included), it goes through everything step-by-step, so when you run through it you get to know everything about the game to get you started.\nThe good part is that you can also skip it if you want to.\n\nOne of the most positive (and surprising) things about this game is that you pay once, nothing more.\n\nThe type of missions you can do range from mining to transport, fighting to exploring, so you can always take on different types of missions.\n\nNow - heres the small negatives:\n(Keep in mind I do not expect this to be 'fixed' in any way, it's just my thoughts)\nEnvironment feels a bit static, by that I mean the foilage and such.\nNo creatures roams the landscape, it's pretty 'dead'.\nBig world, realively few other players (depends on what you do), I mostly do transport, so i do not encounter many others yet.\nNo native linux version (I personally prefer linux games on steam).\n\nBut these small things does not impact the positives for the games.\nYou like MMO's, sandbox scifi games?

It is EvE with robots... its a little bit simpler than EvE, and the tutorial system is very helpful to really give a feel for the game and lead you through all aspects of the game necessary. It is obviously lower budget / update iterations than EvE as its main comparison.\n\nThe biggest difference though is terrain.. there is a lot of terrain which makes the battlefield a lot more dynamic which is an interesting addition.\n\nI have found the community to be very helpful and found a corporation which has fully outfitted and looked out for me. I have spent my EP well and can fit quite a few things out of the gate.. although not terribly well :P\n\nThe biggest minus to this game is that the economy is very immature, in that there is little demand on the market, and little selling due to the low population. Bigger population would be the fix for that, or maybe centralising the market into 1 market to stimulate as a temporary fix.\n\nWith no economy there is no real need to mine/sell/haul except that it is the only realistic way to keep yourself robotted up, but if you are in a corp then they probably have resources to look after all that... so it seems like once you have skills to play a role in PvP / PvE, then you can support the corp and have no real need for your own in game wallet.","June 23, 2015","true","22.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has it all, pvp, pve, crafting, a player controlled market, a very good community feel, and a wonderful look to the graphics. If you have played EVE you will get a feel for how this game works straight away, but being a bittervet is NOT a requirement to enjoy Perpetuum! There is crafting, a deep and complex system I have not even scratched the surface of, and resource gathering is interactive and absorbing. The combat is also something I am only just getting into - I have been focussing so far on gathering - but it feels and looks rewarding and fun. The "levelling" here is aka EVE too, you assign points to "Extensions" to boost various attributes or parts of your robot (did I say you are a consciousness controlling a robot via a miniature wormhole? Very cool premise to this game!), but in this game you accrue Extension Points daily, and assign as you want. This is a pvp sandbox, so combat in certain zones is inevitable if not mandatory, but I am looking forward to it:) This game has a lot of similarities to EVE, but it is not EVE, it is it's only animal and stands apart from its more well known Icelandic relative. The dev team here seem friendly, and the small but dedicated fan base certainly are friendly and helpful. You do not need to buy the upgrades, but it will give you a leg up in terms of EPs, however due to the nature of EP accrual, new players will catch up with veterans soon enough. This is a game where the long view of things is needed, but honestly that is a good thing in this day of "rush to the end game and move on" gaming. I really do urge you to get this game - B2P and worth it even if you miss one of the frequent sales.

While I've never played EVE myself, only with what little info I watched on outdated Youtube videos hoping there would be some new content on it. And actualy not much has changed. Then again that's isn't all that bad. Even though it hasn't change for 1 year since it's release, the game was super-overwhelming for me for the first time and I have yet to join a guild (aka a corporation.) There are factions based on the types on firearms your robots use (ballistics, lasers, and missles,) and there's also a 4th more universal faction that is more centered on the farming and transporting route of the game (I chose that one) but overall you will get to experience it all over time if you get into it from what I heard. As a new player I still am puzzled at how to manufacture my own modules for my robots but I will figure it out over time if I'm lucky, bt I think it's a necessity that you join a guild if you play this game if you want to be serious with it.\n\nI think this game is a recc from me just because if you are tired of those subs from EVE you can come over here.

It has it all, pvp, pve, crafting, a player controlled market, a very good community feel, and a wonderful look to the graphics. If you have played EVE you will get a feel for how this game works straight away, but being a bittervet is NOT a requirement to enjoy Perpetuum! There is crafting, a deep and complex system I have not even scratched the surface of, and resource gathering is interactive and absorbing. The combat is also something I am only just getting into - I have been focussing so far on gathering - but it feels and looks rewarding and fun. The "levelling" here is aka EVE too, you assign points to "Extensions" to boost various attributes or parts of your robot (did I say you are a consciousness controlling a robot via a miniature wormhole? Very cool premise to this game!), but in this game you accrue Extension Points daily, and assign as you want. This is a pvp sandbox, so combat in certain zones is inevitable if not mandatory, but I am looking forward to it:) This game has a lot of similarities to EVE, but it is not EVE, it is it's only animal and stands apart from its more well known Icelandic relative. The dev team here seem friendly, and the small but dedicated fan base certainly are friendly and helpful. You do not need to buy the upgrades, but it will give you a leg up in terms of EPs, however due to the nature of EP accrual, new players will catch up with veterans soon enough. This is a game where the long view of things is needed, but honestly that is a good thing in this day of "rush to the end game and move on" gaming. I really do urge you to get this game - B2P and worth it even if you miss one of the frequent sales. Hope to see you soon on Nia!","December 29, 2015","true","84.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While I've never played EVE myself, only with what little info I watched on outdated Youtube videos hoping there would be some new content on it. And actualy not much has changed. Then again that's isn't all that bad. Even though it hasn't change for 1 year since it's release, the game was super-overwhelming for me for the first time and I have yet to join a guild (aka a corporation.) There are factions based on the types on firearms your robots use (ballistics, lasers, and missles,) and there's also a 4th more universal faction that is more centered on the farming and transporting route of the game (I chose that one) but overall you will get to experience it all over time if you get into it from what I heard. As a new player I still am puzzled at how to manufacture my own modules for my robots but I will figure it out over time if I'm lucky, bt I think it's a necessity that you join a guild if you play this game if you want to be serious with it.\n\nI think this game is a recc from me just because if you are tired of those subs from EVE you can come over here. But really I think this game needs more attention. Those major Youtube vids I find on this game are too old.

I personally experience frequent latency issues and get disconnected a lot, and at the worst possible times. I've lost 3 machines simply due to losing connection during a firefight. yes, death in the game does not greet you with a respawn or 'find your corpse' like WoW. if you die, you lose everything you went out into the field with. not at all a bad thing, in fact I like that! death finally has a meaning in a game!\n\nsomething I don't like is that credits for upgrading extentions requires not effort, but time spent. this means you can do little to progress except wait. storage capacity in the field is extremely low if you're in a combat machine and alone. the selection of robots is also limited but I imagine there is more to come in the future I hope. the learning curve is also somewhat steep but that's only because this game has incredible depth outside of combat, blowing stuff up is only a small part of the game.\n\nwhat I do like is how much equipment there is. even if you don't get to build your own machine or even customize its appearance at all, you can still change the loadout quite a bit. there's a lot of teamwork involved especially if you want to target bigger game, or survive packs of smaller enemies. this game has a bad habit of spawning enemies right as you finish the last of a group and have low health, ultimately forcing you to sprint for your life or die trying since enemies here are VERY unforgiving even after they die. they'll just come back in a few minutes with full agro. it's very challenging indeed. overall this game has great potential so I'll stick with it for the long haul and see how it grows, but right now I'm finding it difficult to find good things to say about it. it feels so empty still, I can't quite put my finger on what bugs me the most but the devs are working hard to turn perpetuum into an amazing game and I want to be there to see it along.\n\nif you like sandbox games, gunfights, mechs, earning money in and out of combat, exploring, and being a part of a community, this game is well worth it.","June 30, 2015","true","231.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So this review comes from someone who did not know the feel of this kind of game.  When buying this game three are some things that you need to know:\n1. This game does not slowly put you into the massive amount of information required to feel confident in doing anything in the game. It has probably the worst tutorial I have ever played. It will require patients to learn this game.\n2. There is no best starting choice and you can eventually do and have everything. Pick the faction that sounds the most fun. They give you temporary super bots at the end of the tutorial. Just pick the coolest one.\n3. This is designed for group play. You need to join player corporation. These will have access to tech that you would have to spend lots of time on your own to get and you will go from feeling like you can't do much to being able to get right into things (combat, harvesting, or w/e)\nWhat I like about this game is that I don't always have the time to do things, but my charicter gains expeirence through time not grinding. The level grind is boring to me. The only "grinding" in this game is for money/items which I am perfectly fine with.","July 1, 2015","true","215.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Price: 30$ may not seem like alot. but it's alot when the reported playerbase is quite small. no one wants to pay 30$ to test the waters and find a dead world.\n\n2. Playerbase: the reported levels of activity have been low. really low.\n\n\nAfter the Winter sale, Perpetuum went through a price restucture. NOT a price drop, a restructure. if you pay 30$ now, you will get the same starting bonuses, premium currency, as would have before. but now the barrier of entry is much lower. want to get into a game as deep as Eve online mechanically, but aren't too sure about it? getting in is a mere 10$ usd, plenty low for me to jump in and check things out.\n\nI'm an old eve player, so there is some bias there. if you've never played eve, then BOY OH BOY LEARNING CURVE OF DEATH.\n\nIf you have played eve, but left due to the pricey subscription, and was annoyed with the skill system, then this game is for you. the user interface is a carbon copy. down to the market system, character profiles, man even character creation looks like pre 2011 eve online.  that may not be for everyone, it's a little more noob friendly than eve, but the nostalgia factor is strong. the gameplay, and combat system is pretty much exxactly eve online.\n\nBut neo! these aren't space ships! how can they be so similar?\n\nyou target enemies the same way.\n\nyou cycle weapons (and reload them), the same way.\n\nyou loot the same sorts of things.\n\nyou use the same module systems, power grids, power management.\n\nthis game is essentially mechwarrior and eve had a secret affair and this is the result. you may hate it for the learning curve and pace of gameplay. or you may absolutely LOVE IT TO DEATH for it's deep, intricate gameplay mechanics.\n\nit's as deep and rewardingly intelligent as EVE online. It's also just as brutal, can be just as tedious, and just as fustrating.\n\nif you left EVE online for good, but reminisce about old friendships, corporate antics, political upheavals, and personal stories, then you NEED to give Perpetuum a chance. it feels just like home, at a fraction of the price.\n\n\nthe only major flaw is the size of the playerbase, and that's both the fault of the gaming community at large, and lack of advertisement by the developers.\n\nfor players who don't even know what EVE online is; this game has an hour long tutorial, and you'll need to absorb every last bit of it. skip it and you WILL have a bad experience. this game is not for casual players, but it can casual be at times if you want it to be. it's a very, VERY deeply crafted system with industrial mechanics, mining, marketing (at a low point atm only because the player base is small), and excellent pvp.\n\n\n\nIf you don't want to risk 10 USD to give the game a try, then watch plenty of videos on starting out on EVE online. it may look totally different, but all the core mechanics and ingame menu's, as well as ship equipment systems are identical. if you don't see yourself playing eve online, then this isn't probably for you. if you're interested in EVE online but balk at the price tag, give this baby a try, and you'll know whether you'll like eve online.\n\n\nFINAL SCORE (scored higher due to personal bias and experience in EVE online):\n\nEve light (as in dirt cheap, seriously. it's practically f2p up in here)\n\n6.5/10 needs players\n\nassuming playerbase doubles or triples, or amount of players a non issue:  9/10 Old eve farts welcome any time.\n\nneeds more mech variety. eve has a countless number of ships. this game only has about 25-30 or so mechs, which tbh really isn't that many considering internal game mechanics. there are 4 factions that split mech's across combat system styles, laser, missile, or firearms. and then those mechs are split into 4 size groups, light, assault, medium, and heavy. that means there are only 1 to 2 mechs per faction and size class, with alternate advanced versions of each.","December 31, 2015","true","125.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I hear many comparisions to EVE online, I didnt play Eve much but from what I do remember its a bit similar. But if a Sci Fi based 3rd person MMO with lots of robots/mechs, technology, crafting, weapons, and all types of modules to customize your robots sounds interesting, then you might want to try it especially while its on sale its only 10 dollars currently.\n\nThere are several different sizes and types of robots/mechs to try out as well as weapons, armor, electronics, engineering, and other modules you can buy and equip even as a new player and more after you leave the starter zone. Some robots are very small and fast hit and run types with long range lasers or missles, and others are big bipedal mechs with big armor and big guns/lasers/missles, they are all fun.\n\nI recently used one of the smaller robots to make a fast moving long range sniper set up, with lasers and extra modules stacked to increase my targeting range for very long range shots, I couldnt believe the range I was getting. On the other hand, I have big mechs with tons of armor and firepower that run up and just destroy everything without even getting their paint scratched. Im looking forward to doing missions and hunting the NPC's past the starter area. There are also many of the lslands that are full PVP as well as some PVE ones past the starting area.\n\nPerpetuum to me is kind of like some of the car games where you have a lot of cars you can customize how you want, only this is with robots that blow things up. search for and mine minerals or plant material, run missons, etc. As I mentioned I got it on its current sale for 10 bucks so its dirt cheap. Im enjoying it so and looking forward to seeing whats past the starter zone. Hope this helps people learn a little bit about the game from a new players point of view.\n\nClam","January 7","true","22.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you like EVE, you should like this game.\n\nWith that said, unlike EVE, there's no interdictors waiting for you after you change maps, so that's a definate plus.  You also get several seconds of immunity during map changes until you move your robot or activate a system.  There's no montlhly fee, but you can get 1.5x skill points per day if you decide it's worth it.  If you don't, as long as you log in to one of your characters once every three days, you still get your points.  Userbase seems small because most players aren't on any of the general chats, and mainly stick to their own corperation chat.  The people that are, though, are generally helpful and accomidating to noobs.   The tutorial is long, but answers most questions new players should have, plus you get some free stuff from doing all of it.  What corp you pick at the start determines your starting location and what bots you get from the tutorial, if you did it.\n\nThere are a few things that might put you off to the game.  Such as it's similar to EVE Online.  Which means that the same targeting system is in as well.  Spend several seconds for a lock, then pray to the RNG gods that your attack hits.  I've had missiles somehow land well behind and to the right of the target, despite both robots standing still on a flat terrain.  The graphics sorely need an update.  Yes, it will run on a toaster, but for people who have bought a video card within the past couple years, the game could look so much better.  Even a few tweaks like having the sun position update more than once every few hours, and have fog roll in and out of an area instead of suddenly on or off would help greatly.","January 8","true","45.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game really shines in large scale PVP warfare.  Even with hundreds of battles under my belt being the Fleet Commander, Ewar Captain, DPS Lead, or cog in the wheel in a pack of mechs I still get goose bumps when we engage in battle.  The combat is heavily dependent on terrain, skill and overall situational awareness.  There is no point, click, and wait.  You are on your toes 100% of the time and mistakes can cost you a fleet.\n\nSmall gang pvp 3 to 5 players is super fun with gorilla style tactics allowing you to move practically undetected through islands to find a target and strike.  Rewards from the mini game of capture the flag on SAP warfare for stations can cover the lose of many, many bots and modules.  The Bold are rewarded.\n\nIndustry in this game is like Crack.  I'm not going to lie, once you get sunk into it with the level headed ness of the system it really is a no brainer and fun to watch those factory lines ping.  You can produce at ANY station, you can gather what you need in the surrounding areas in a complex manner of finding ore fields and extracting them from the ground.  Plants on terrain are harvestable too.  There is NO RANDOM PROCS on industry, it is spreadsheet friendly and the market isn't completely convoluted with who can sell it first.\n\nBest of all No subscription.  You buy it, log in every 3 days you get EP.  I've spent more money on a bad acid trip.  You'll spend hours being immersed in a planet that is utterly amazing.\n\nIs this a FPS?  No.  This is a lock, acquire and shoot type MMO.  It provides a level playing field for older players who feel they can't compete with twitch based gamers.  It's a great game to add to the collection and the community is small enough to join in and be something.  So your not a 1 in 1 Million type customer who thinks his $ is thrown at a developer to be forgotten, your voice on the forums really helps.\n\nContact me in game as Ville if you have any questions.\n\nEdit: 12/10/14 :  I have dropped this game as a recommended game.  The server Lag, the patch and the down right arrogance of the game have called a pitfall of a ♥♥♥♥ storm.  The game is in a state of pitiful decay and its rapidly sinking.  Population is creepy back into the teens in the US timezone(yes I said Teens like 15 ♥♥♥♥ing people, for a mmo)\n\n-The Patch:  Instead of giving the players new content they decided to straight nerf the game by 20%.  Reducing extensions from 50% to 30%.  They did not factor in to the equation the modules accumulator consumptions/NPCing/and industry.  THEY DID NOT GIVE PLAYERS AN EP RESET.  I repeat they dropped a patch that completely changed the entire dynamic of play and did not refund players who had YEARS invested into accounts.  Some became utterly useless over night.  One bot is called an ictus which had its 80% bonus reduced to 30% and completely removed its use in combat pvp.\nThe players have started numerous threads about how terrible the patch is.  Many have moved on to other games and only a handful still hold hope to it.  The developers have stubbed their noses at the very through analysis done by the players as to why this is a terrible patch.  The patch completely shifted pvp style to a guerilla warfare type pvp engagements where DPS style robots can basically not be tackled.  Light ewars use in the game was removed because the accumulator cap is being eaten alive by running 1 module.  Allowing the DPS bots plenty of room to get one or two shots off on them before they are killed.\nNPC farming took a direct hit by 20% (DPS from 50% to 30% bonus)followed by the patch that made the npcs directly agro boaster bots to the combats and never drop agro, even on alpha.  So farming now takes 20% longer.\n-Lag Game crippling lag during PVP that the developers imagine is not there.  There are people in game who have live streamed themselves warp around.  It makes it next to impossible to pvp and its very very frustrating.   And still its being dismissed as "not our problem".\n\nI can't even harvest my expensive plants(noralgis) which I lost 75 Million NIC on those plants because I lag so hard around them it kills the plants because I over harvest them.  I sent a support ticket in October.  It's still pending.\n\n**EDITED*** Lag fixed now.  Servers are stable.  I still play the game.  Added mission patch to give you hours of content.","October 20, 2014","true","183.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The targeting systems, menus and general gameplay are mostly similar.\n\nThis is both Positive and Negative.\n\nThe positive side is that you can quickly familiarise yourself with the basics and flow of the game.\n\nNegative being that it doesn't feel different, and a lot more 'rough' than its comparable partner.\n\nI'll just reel off a few impressions:\n- The tutorial is very informative, which is often overlooked and gives you a great start.\n- Outside of the tutorial the game gives you nothing. Other than here are missions, go.\n- Graphics are pretty basic, and generally not pleasing.\n- Game provides a great time sink aswell easy to dip in and out of - with things not requiring large investments of time, due to the EP system.\n\nOverall, its a fairly solid game - a good F2P alternative for people who are interested in EvE or no longer wish to play subscrition based games.\n\nI will give it a 6.5/10\nDown to the empty player base and the fact that once you finish the tutorial you are given no direction","January 5","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You have to keep a clean LOS or your shots will hit obstructions. There is a sub if you wish to keep accumulating skill points after being away from the game for 3 days. The sub lets you accumulate 50% more skill points daily for 30 days, seems like a great investment and value. Lag is sometimes an issue, you fire when you think you have a clean shot only to watch it blast away an a seemingly inoffensive wall, but they are relocating servers as of June '14 to help with this issue.

It is alot like EvE online in many ways, with the diverse areas of gameplay like PVE missions, fitting, time based progression, industry, trading, mining, warfare, politics, base building, research, PVP, clans etc. The graphical features and game engine are a bit dated but the art is still good and does a good job of making the world feel extra-terrestrial. The music is also unique and fits well with this game. The robots and mechs are pretty cool and have modules in a similar fashion to eve such as lasers,  ballistics, kinematics, magneto-statics, and missiles. The world has been going through a pretty major overhaul over the past year with random missions assignments, roaming mobs, localized combat stations and a lot more I can't name off the top of my head.\n\nIn some way this game is better than EvE for new players, as it has not had over a decade of expansions roll out and such a massive disparity in progression. The biggest problem Perpetuum has is playerbase, right now the game is suffering from a low population, however that means it is a good time to get out there and take advantage the situation.\n\nYou got to look at a game like this as a long term endeavor. It will take years to get high level skills and master multiple modes of play. It does not require constant attention either, so if you are like me and play dozens of games you can get sidetracked and come back after a few weeks and have a ton of skill points to blow.\n\nLastly I would comment on the monetization. The game is B2P and totally playable without a subscription boost, you just need to log in for at least a  few seconds every three days to refresh your skill point generation. The sub system works from subtracting game credits and it works out to less than $10 per month. There is also a Plex type system(ICE) that you can use for the booster or to trade for NIC(credits). Compared to most MMO's your dollars will go alot farther if you choose to spend.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone looking for a game that has some depth and complexity to it and is more tactical than tactile. It is less top heavy than EvE but is modelled after some of the same design aspects. This game is ripe for new players to come in. At its core Perpetuum is a game about robotic gun platforms on a distant alien world some of which are alien(NPC) and some which are controlled remotely by human players(you).","November 26, 2015","true","82.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Whether you like to play industrial non combat character or a beefed up Terminator mech, this game lets you play the way you want. It is a sandbox game with a 100% player driven economy that relies on the players to make their own story and fun. Unfortunately that is also where it stumbles, since the population is nowhere near what you need for a thriving sandbox game. Unlike EVE where a corporation that has 16 members is considered small, in Perpetuum you're talking about one of the bigger corps. Despite this, the game is in a solid shape and is worth recommending.\n\nThe game features a variety of small spider like bots and mechs you can pilot that you can fit different types of modules with, ranging from simple weapons  and armor to electronic warfare and battery rechargers.\n\nSound and music is great, I enjoyed the simple soundtrack and the combat/movement felt impactful and heavy.\n\nGraphics wise, the game isn't spectacular. The textures look terrible, lighting is okayish, the mech variety is nice, but the landscapes all look the same. And when you look at the sharp edges and sudden terraforming walls on the advanced islands, it stabs you in the eye and destroys any sense of world immersion.\n\nHowever, that is not where the game shines - this game is all about multiplayer and PvP. Ganging up and fighting it out with other players! The combat is strategic and requires more awareness than EVE does, because there are obstacles that block your shots and people can hide behind them. You will want to join a corp as soon as possible and do group content, since you not only get more money, but also more fun that way.\n\nDevs are active and update the game regularly, so you don't have to worry about it being abandoned.\n\nThumbs up!","June 25, 2015","true","79.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is a game of Robots instead of ships, and the familiarity will be a bonus to people who have played Eve Online with a few exceptions. For one, skills are no longer time based, but point based. Meaning you don't have to wait around endlessly while a skill is being trained. In the same vein, however, your points are daily. Meaning that you only get a limited number of points per day to which to spend on 'extensions' or skills in Eve.\n\nThe biggest plus for me, at any rate, is the fact there is a PvP flag. Meaning that you can't be killed as you wander the islands randomly. There are probably spots where the PvP is automatically set to PvP, but I can live with that. I don't have to worry about my beginning mech being blown to pieces because a higher skilled player got a bee in their bonnet and decided my little inventory scraps are worth killing over.","June 16, 2015","true","21.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I was selling in the New Virginia and Hershfield areas, just basic ammo and raw materials speficifally targeting the newer players joining the game. Fundamental things everyone always needs and yet nothing was selling. An example for those who would defend against this point.

So now I am just very little lost after being teleported to main game from the tutorial island. I know how to mine and refine end even manufacture, the missions are easy when you take the first ones. The travel mission was a little bit frustrating as it is hard to find the corect path between the travel points, but I liked it more like this as it is not boring just going from one place to another in a straight line.\nI did not yet explore but the surroundings of the terminal I was teleported to and caanot say much of the depth of the game, but after the tutorial my impression of the game is very good. I will continue to play it and hopefully also find a corporation to join :)\n10/10 thumbs up and keep it going !","July 20, 2015","true","23.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

That said, there is a distinctly different feel to Perpetuum, and its a more comfortable one. Destroy npcs, destroy each other, mine, manufacture, research and develop, trade, mission, and so on - theres plenty to do even at an early stage. The controls are tight feeling (none of that perpetual lag feeling some mmos have like a constant, bitter after-taste).  Devs are active and there is almost always one online. Community is small, but growing, and diverse in spite of it's size. Its a pay once, play forever model currently, but no pay to win mechanics either (though a equivalent $10/mo sub will give 50% more passive skill points per day).  I highly recommend giving this one a try, particularly if you have any history with EVE (and enjoyed something in it).","April 26, 2014","true","87.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","10"

(Except you control robots on the ground instead of ships in space :P)\nThe game is complex but not too annoying to learn, economy is fully driven by players in persistent, single-shard world consisting of 12 massive islands. Also available manufacturing on small and large scale, intercorporational politics and big pvp encounters. Combat is way more fun than EVE's 3 dimensional nausea as everything happens on the ground (rules of the combat are clear). Ever changing world that you can shape by terraforming whole islands and building own facilities. Also best game to play while playing other games(for slowpaced miners :)\n\nThe only flaw is rather small community which hopefully will grow now as game has landed on Steam. Also graphically it might not suit everyone as it's rather dated(though gonna be probably updated at some point)\n\nMuch recommended!","April 25, 2014","true","25.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","5"

I'll start with the cons:\n\nCons:\n\nThere were one or two moments which I almost quit the game. This was in the tutorial. So much text to read, and I don't like reading essays, even though you probably should to start to get a grasp for the game. But I buckled down and read the heavy amounts of text, until 1 point where I had read the whole page of text and it didnt not tell me how I should focus a tile. Double clicking wasnt working, and many other things werent either. So I read and reread this large block of text. Nothing/ I got extreemly frustrated and almost quit the game right then and there. Help chat was very good, except for 1 ♥♥♥ who decided to respond to me with read the text.... For the most part help chat is very good.\n\n\nThere is no fast travel or moving all your ♥♥♥♥ from one terminal to another, which isnt the end of the world. But maybe a slight hassle if youre moving bases or you have stuff spread out. I started Industrial so I already had a hauler. But I can see this being very very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for people who dont have a hauler and need to buy one.\n\nPros:\n\nCOMMUNITY! I ahve not gotten into a fairly copmlex game, and had so much people offer help, and talk to each other. Even though there might not be, it feels like 100s or thousands of players are ready to help you. Yesterday I joined a corporation where a guy spend over 2 hrs explaning mechanics to a fellow newbie.\n\nI decided to be a miner, I have no clue why I am having so much fun watching my robot mine and completing mining missions!! But it is really compeling.\n\nVery large crafting system, that take time to unlock.\n\nVery nice and intricate talent tree (extensions).\n\nOverall, I've stopped playing over 5-6 games, and am just hooked on this game, even though I never play sci-fi games.","December 3, 2015","true","46.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Now you most likely want to know why, well I'm going to tell you.\n\nPerpetuum gets referred to as being like "Eve Online" alot. Well there are similarities but It's not quite the same deal. In Perpetuum you get to costomize the fit of your robot or mech and run around the world doing as you please. Literally you can do whatever you want. You are going to be making the most fun for yourself, there's nothing that guides you through areas like a quest line.\n\nSecondly it's a sandbox so having a goal in mind is a good idea although the missions and npc fights are fun. The bread and butter is the pvp which is a high risk/reward system.  There is somewhat of a learning curve but It's not that bad. The amount of freedom and choices you get for customization is enough to keep you interested especially if you like robots and mechs. It's fun experimenting to see what works and doesn't.\n\nNext is the Industrial options. I think everything in this game can be made by the players. It's quite in depth and I had to read into it a little but after getting the hang of it, industry is alot of fun. I'm having fun with industry even though I primarily pvp. Gathering materials and kernels to make items, robots and mechs is the simpliest description of industry I can make.  The Market is player driven. Which also gives players options to "Buy low and sell high" if you're into making NIC that way. NIC is the in game money.\n\nLastly the community is great and willing to help, just make sure you join the general chat as well as the help! chat. I've already learned alot from the community and there's quite a few corps currently recruiting.  If you like games with depth and appear to be "more than meets the eye" this game could be for you. This review has hardly scratched the surface of Perpetuum.\n\n","November 30, 2015","true","45.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordFraggington/recommended/223410/","LordFraggington","LordFraggington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordFraggington/","261 products in account","I'm not the greatest at writing reviews, so I'll start with the basics: Should you play Perpetuum? Yes! Now that we have gotten that out of the way, let's get into "why" you should.\n\nPerpetuum is a very interesting and deep game that you will hopefully spend many hours playing. There is so much that game offers you from mining/harvesting materials to crafting various commodities to running various assignments for different factions to base building to combat... The only true limit is your imagination (and the time and NIC you are willing to invest). Taking the time to plan out and finally outfit the perfect combat robot you have been hoping for, hopping from island to island to make that next big sale, or sneaking around an island full of hostile enemy players hoping to find that next big artifact stash is a lot of fun, especially when you take the time to invest in both your skills and your gear.\n\n"But running missions and gathering materials is boring, and fighting enemies is either too easy or too hard!" Please ask yourself - what is it I really want to do in Perpetuum? Do I want to build large bases in the PvP islands, fight enemy corporations, or maybe even collaborate with other players to corner the market and make a ton of money together? Whatever the answer, you will probably want to join a player corporation that has similar goals. Not only that, but you'll hopefully find a group of interesting and fun people to play with; and don't think you are limited to just talking to your fellow corp members! Not only can you create your own chat channels, but there are global channels like General Chat and Help Chat as well. You are in control of what you want to do in this game.\n\n"But I hear that there is a low player population - what does that mean for me coming into the game?" This is another valid concern; after all, who wants to shell out their hard-earned money for something and not have fun? Steam statistics are only one way of seeing part of the game population online at a given time, and you are able to leave any chat channel except for you corporation's channel and either the terminal or vicinity channel for the island that you are in or on. As such, it will look as though there aren't many people on. At the same time if you are interested in the game, hopefully you will try the game out, find something that interests you and maybe either get your friends to play or find a group of players to hang out with in-game. The population problem is something that needs to be addressed, but we can't address it of you aren't playing with us!\n\n"But what about the community? Are they mean? Salty? Tell me more!" Well, in my time playing the game I've seen General Chat be very quiet for a decent period of time, then someone speak up and everything begins to cascade from there (usually). People are mostly very helpful and pleasant to either speak with or joke around with - always feel free to ask questions! Are people going to respond every time you say hi? Probably not. But the longer you are on the more players you will run into and in turn the more opportunities you will have to talk to people who have similar interests, senses of humor, etc. I lucked out when I joined my first corp, and I hope that you do to!\n\n"The whole daily allocation of extension points (EP) thing turns me off." Okay, I won't argue that this is a more niche game in that sense. A lot of MMOs out there certainly let you level at your own pace and ultimately hit a maximum power level. But if someone has spent the time investing in a particular skillset in Perpetuum, they are doing so because they are interested in it. That also means that they probably aren't good in other areas of the game. You are able to respecialize your character (for an amount of paid-for currency relative to how many skills you want to retrain and the levels of those skills), but you hopefully will start out with an idea of what interests you and only need to make minor alterations or pursue new skill areas moving forward. You can (almost) totally wipe the slate clean if you wish to too (you cannot respecialize your initially spent extension points, so DO choose those wisely!). If you want to gain EP at a faster rate, there is always the option of either buying ICE (basically a 50% EP booster for 30 days that also does not require you to log in every 3 days to receive EP) via the cash shop or via in-game NIC on the market.\n\n"Wait, I have to log in every three days?" Well, yes. Here is why: the log-in system, just like the skill (extension) system is meant to encourage long-term play. It is a good way to encourage community participation and growth, especially since this is not a subscription-based game. Hopefully our logging in every few days will keep us playing, facilitate us meeting new people. keep the in-game market running, cause new player-run events to happen...\n\nI sincerely hope that you come visit Nia and the rest of us Perpetuum players. I don't want to make it sound as though I want to justify the game despite its faults (and let's be honest for a moment, all games have them), but hopefully give you a different insight into what you might expect should you purchase this game. There aren't many games like this out there, and provided that this is the sort of game that might interest you, I really think you might enjoy it!\n\nP.S.: I would like to make a special mention of the Upgrade Kit DLCs, if only because they did give me a headstart, not only with the EP provided but some of the items from the AID devices being able to purchase a couple months of ICE bought with the credits included. If you play the game for a while and want that extra boost, or want to start off strong when you make your first character, check them out!","February 24","true","94.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

I bought it anyways because some of the gameplay looked fun. It honestly does look, and sound, fun. It's just executed so poorly.\n\nThe tutorial takes about an hour, there is way too much to learn at the beginning, It's overwhelming, and that turns off a lot of players, including myself. The UI is bad. It's like playing Tetris, not with your inventory like Diablo, but with all the windows you have to manage. Not 2D tetris, either. 3D Tetris, so you have to know what window is behind what. The fighting is simple and boring, though LOOKS interesting in gameplay videos. You just click on a gun, and that weapon fires. Or, press Space to fire all weapons.\n\nThe animations and textures are one of the more disappointing things about this game. It looks like a game that my Grandma could play on her 5 year old store-bought PC. Unfortunately, it runs like Crysis 2 would, on said store-bought, 5 year-old PC. The animations are poor. Watching a robot walk around makes me cringe, because they don't step... They slide. Their feet might make the motion of stepping, but they just slide across the floor...\n\nThe movement is worse than anything else. You don't FEEL like a robot. You can go from facing right to facing left INSTANTLY. No side-stepping, no turn animation, you just snap to that direction and go. It's horrible! I want to feel like I'm a powerful robot, or a nimble robot, or a big, heavy mining robot. But, no. You just snap directions, and go about your day. No matter what design you have, the robot's movement is poorly animated and feels way to fast to turn directions.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game like a 3/10. It seems like it would be fun, if things were executed a bit differently. A game like HAWKEN got the movement for mechs right. The stomping, the independent movement of the torso, etc... I just think this game needs more work.\n\nI'll never be coming back, to play this game.","October 18, 2014","false","0.8"," 77 of 151 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","77","151","0","6"

The population is lower, which allows for a very different economy that is much more accessible to new players. Many systems are simplified or outright improved, while combat being limited to a 2.5D plane demands an entirely new system of tactics- with the same great taste you know and love. This game's tutorial is also very exhaustive, and won't leave you adrift in an intimidatingly complex world. You will get a taste of all the activities on offer, and equip you to go out into the world and start making your name.\n\nAll that said, this game is still early in development and it is telling at times. Random disconnects and crashes are present but fairly uncommon, but that is honestly the only criticism I can level. If you know EVE, you know this game and you will love it. If you don't know EVE- come and dip your toes into the Epitron. You might leave with a new favorite game.","June 23, 2015","true","52.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/synakulvex/recommended/223410/","synakulvex","Justin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/synakulvex/","33 products in account","I will say this first: If you played EVE Online for at least a few months, there is a much less steep learning curve. Though changes are slot to come out and can be buggy as all hell, they respond to the tickets they get about the bugs with a small patch. Usually within 24 hours. This is a game that has been around for quite some time and could use a asthetic facelift,\n\nThe positive side to things is that if you get in with the right corp, you can get access to Beta Islands (Open PvP with outposts, all but 1 of which a corp can take over and control), and out to the Gamma Islands that have been added back (Open PvP with no outposts other than the ones that players build). Certain materials/plants can only be gathered on Beta or Gamma islands.\n\nThe negative side is that there are only two major corporate alliances. that control all the Beta and Gamma islands. They tend to shoot you first and never question you about your intent on their island. So you've got to be weary of that.\n\nFind out which corporate alliance is which and what they have to offer and how they'll treat you. One is overrun with players who've been playing for so long that they have the best robots and best modules, more NIC than they know what to do with, and several backups of the best robots and best modules all over the islands.\n\nI do like that it's open-ended, though. If you were to ask what the end-game is some would say that it's PvP, some would say that it's getting into a corp with a Beta Outpost, some would say it's getting into a corp with a Gamma Outpost, and others would say that it's whatever you want it to be. Specialize in combat and do PvE and PvP. Mining minerals or harvesting plants can pay very well, depending on the buy orders in various Alpha islands.\n\nI am in a corp that ended up allying with the wrong group. They were demanding, arrogant, and treated our leadership like they were just a figurehead in a dummy corp. It fell apart, but a few months later, it reformed and we have a Beta Outpost and a Gamma Base built. Our people are friendly and offer advice or front you bots/modules/NIC to get you started. We never ask for anything in return other than you being willing to help out new people like you were helped out.\n\nSpeaking of joining a chat channel, that segues into the tutorial. It's very informative but it's a lot of information that you won't really appreciate or fully grasp right out of the gate. That's really not something that can be helped. It would be nice if you could skip the tutorial, because I have more than one account, but I've done it often enough I know where everything is and can speed through it.\n\nYou can see what corporations a character has been part of in the past and for how long, but all they have to do is start a new character on their account and use it to spy. That's probably one of the biggest issues. "All is fair in love and war" but the ease of how a spy can slip a dummy character into a corporation and there be no way to tell, is a bit ridiculous, really. Putting the names of what characters created on that account and what corporation they've been in or are in they've had in the past would cut down on the easy way to set a spy in with another corp. If it's going to be possible to create a spy character then it should at least time some sort of skill to do it.\n\nExtensions (skills) are increased over time with 1 point per minute every 24 hours (1440 minutes in a day = 1440 EP/day).\n\nI've been around since it launched on Steam (about 1.75 years ago) and I still enjoy it. I enjoy mining. It relaxes me. Do I do things on PvP islands? Heck yeah! I spend a good deal of my time on Beta and Gamma islands and I'm not into PvP. I've lost a few bots to other plays and to NPCs. But, it's just a game. So after a few hours break most people have calmed down enough to just accept that it's happened and move on.\n\nThey've recently redone the Alpha 1 and Alpha 2 islands, both in looks and a different way of doing missions (for NIC and sometimes a module or bot upgrade and tokens to purchase the racial "PvP ammo" or Beacons, you'll learn about those if you pay).\n\nThe pathing script needs work because your bot will take the shortest overland route without regard to speed boosts from Accelerator Srips (aka "Highways") and Teleporters. Also, the NPC behavior is in many ways quite boring and predictable but can be very frustrating and evil (in a good way). You get zerged if you don't kill them fast enough or run away (Alpha 1 islands) , you don't aggro the whole group when you kill one (Alpha 2 & Beta Islands), or they do hit and run waves of skirmish tactics (Gamma islands).\n\nSummary:\n\nIs it pefect? No, but they are working on it.\nIs it fun? That depends on what you find fun but I still love it.\nIs it worth the price for 1 account to play it and see if you like it? Yeah. Some people play it for a few days or a few weeks and then just stop playing. Others stick around and get things going themselves.\n\nI would recommend that you at least give it a chance. You won't learn everything on the first day. Be patient and choose who's company you keep carefully.","June 30, 2015","true","542.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yojinko/recommended/223410/","yojinko","Hijal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yojinko/","28 products in account","Purchased the game at a steal during the winter sale for $21 less than it normally would have costed. This is perhaps the best deal I have ever personally seen on steam in terms of value and satisfaction.\n\nI have played EVE Online in the past which is remarkably similar to Perpetuum (for over 8 years) so I will be making cross comparisons in this review between the two games.\n\n----------\nRATING: 90/100\n----------\n\nPROS:\n\n[] A very large open world. While not necessarily as large as the world of EVE-O, Perpetuum does seem to have a lot less transition loading between areas than EVE does. Loading sequences happen between different regions and upon entering terminals only (terminals==stations), whereas in EVE-O there is wait time between hundreds of solar systems that comprise a single region of space. Short version: EVE-O you have to wait anywhere between 5-25 times to transit across an entire region. In Perpetuum that degree of tedious does not seem to exist.\n\n[] Has a time-based progression system in the form of "extension points" (EP) that accumulate provided you log in at least once every 72 hours.  EVE-O has a similar system that uses skillpoints as well.  While there is slightly less flexibility with Perpetuum's EP system versus EVE-O's SP system, it is a godsend to players who hate level-based grinding and may or may not have the time to commit to being online constantly in effort to avoid falling behind others.\n\n[] Complex player-driven market with a versatile selection of equipment and supplies that can all be built by the player from the ground up. EVE-O has this as well though their market is much larger and more developed than Perpetuum's in part to being a older game with a larger player base at current. On the other hand, Perpetuum's market is young enough to where it is currently easier to make a living. Competition on the market is at a minimum in comparison to EVE-O's, and there is still time and room for a person of ambition to make a stake at becoming a production magnate with less effort and risk that would be required in a game like EVE.\n\n[] Varying levels of risk and player interaction does exist in Perpetuum. You have the choice to enter more dangerous regions to take advantage of the rich frontier, or to simply go look for a fight if that is what your aim is. On the other hand, you are not forced into this choice and may play it safe as well. EVE-O has a similar system, but there is one defining difference I have come to notice very quickly: You cannot suicide bomb a player in safe territories. That being said, you can be completely safe while doing your business in Perpetuum, provided you are in the right region, while in EVE-O there is technically no place that is 100% safe outside of being undocked.\n\n[] Community is much more friendly and a lot less cutthroat than the majority of EVE-O's tends to be. Players and corporations in Perpetuum tend to be a great deal more helpful and friendly, whereas in EVE-O the community is so cutthroat and survival driven to a point where players/corporation would appear very self-centered and paranoid to a outsider who is new to these kinds of games and does not understand the nature of the game play.  In the very nature of what EVE is it has weeded out virtually every average/casual gamer that may have existed within the player base over the years, leaving only the most die-hard, obsessive, elitist players behind, some more snobby than others, which is one of the bigger things that personally compelled me to stop playing EVE. This is a large part of why EVE has a infamous reputation for being such a harsh game with a community that can be very cutthroat (PvP/Indy alike). This is bound to happen when you have a game based on the quest for PvP/economic supremacy with at little boundaries as possible. That being said, Perpetuum's community has not yet started to rot into what EVE-O's has become today so it has more appeal over EVE's at current in terms of being a more pleasant social-gaming experience for any kind of game. This could end up changing in time but for now the atmosphere has not yet reached the point where Perpetuum has become just like "Spreadsheets Online: Your Job Away From Your Job"\n\n[] Hands down, the biggest perk fo this game is NO SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED. This is a godsend to me personally.\n\nCONS:\n\n[] The player base is currently smaller than it could be. From what I've learned it used to be larger but had stagnated at some point. This can easily change and I'm pretty sure it most certainly will, but there are times when the game feels kinda quiet, but not ever empty.\n\n[] Design and graphics are a good deal behind modern engines, but not in such a way that overshadows the excellent mechanics and game play. Even still, the graphics are not up to spec and may turn cheek for those who hold the visual experience in high regard over everything else.\n\n[] UI is very similar to EVE-O's and can come off as boxy and old fashioned, especially to younger generations of gamers. While it may boast better control and be far from short of providing all the tools a player needs to play the game, it can be hard to understand for some people.\n\n[] Tutorial needs work. Could be condensed, simplified, and streamlined a great deal more but  at least is not a process that the player is forced into. Not recommended for the highly impatient, easily frustrated, more or less AD/HD gamers. Stick with CoD, this wouldn't be for you.","January 3","true","205.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Havn't had a chance to suss out the community, so we'll talk mechanics. In no particular order.\n\nThe GUI is...functional. It's something I think would benefit from a once over. Little things like displaying the hotkeys in tooltips would go a long way towards its usability.\n\nThe tutorial is just...bad. If I were the devs, this is something I would focus on post-haste. Coming from EVE, nothing was confusing, but it was definitely far from engaging. The first few hours of any game are absolutely vital to getting a player hooked, and I imagine anyone who came in here not knowing what to expect may have gotten turned off pretty quick.\n\nCombat isn't bad, but I think the 'feel' of it could probably use some refinement. As well, the game isn't forthcoming with various hotkeys, which makes it a bit frustrating to rapid-click around until you look them up. If the process of targeting and selection could be streamlined, that'd help the combat portion of the game a great deal.\n\nThe gameplay systems are similar to EVE in a lot of ways. I believe another reviewer described it as being Sam's Cola to EVE's coke, and I'll second that. Still, it's fun in its own right, if you can look past  some of the rough edges. I've spent my time in game so far mining, and that at least is a little more engaging than it is in similar games. It does a lot of things so closely to its inspiration as to be near identical in many. I'd hope as they go forward, the developers try to accentuate the differences in their systems more.\n\nAll in all I'd recommend Perpetuum for someone looking for an open-world, EVE-like fix. Especially with a group I can see how it'd become quite enjoyable. Still, I'd recommend the Devs look into low-level usability concerns, like the UI and tutorial. An EVE-like game is inherently complex, and if they can maange to ease new players into that complexity well, and engage them in the process, they might have a winning combination.","November 29, 2015","true","33.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Main reason I bought it was it reminded me of Eve Online in its base skill set, such as the time driven skill point system, which was the main draw to the game. One thing that I do love is mech games and MMO's and a game that combines both is a major plus.\n\nOk now to list my Pro's and Con's:\n\nPro's:\n+Dedicated player base\n+Similar time skill training\n+FTP with small semi subscription in the form of EP booster\n+-Tutorial, shows a massive amount of information however would be better with voice\n\nCon's:\n-Outdated Graphics needs update\n-+Major Learning Curve\n-Not enough of a diversity with mech types\n-User Interface Outdated, reminds me of Windows 98\n\nNot really a Con, but did some research and I understand why they took it out, is the fact you cannot 'Redo" your character, not even in the first 15 days, However as a X-Eve player I understand this mechanic not being there anymore. The other thing that isnt really a Con would be the fact you are charged to delete a character you dont wish to keep, its a bit annoying to have them not know that they are screwed up and nothing can be done about it.\n\nI gave this a Recommend because there is not a middle ground, and I think while there is still a sale it is worth a try, but be ready for a wall of text for a tutorial, which does give great info but if your running it in 1080p or above it will be in small print which I dont see a way to enlarge.","January 2","true","54.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Я стал искать в интернете, и выяснил, что реально хороших игр про роботов в настояший момент раз два и обчёлся. В конечном итоге я нашел две HAWKEN и Perpetuum. Первая игра мне лично напомнила контр-страйк, только про роботов. Я в неё поиграл немного, меня раздесять убили и надоело. А вот Perpetuum меня как-то сразу захватил. Особенно мне понравилась атмосфера планеты роботов, эти равнины, огромные здания диковенной архитектуры, небо, затянутое тяжелыви серыми тучами... Я люблю такую атмосферу, строгую и величественную, несколько даже гнетущую, я бы сказал. Всякую технику я тоже люблю, и техногенный стиь архитектуры в игре радует мой глаз. Ещё я люблю исследовать новые места, проникая вглубь неизведанных территорий, и возвращаясь оттуда с грузом артефактов. Тут игра малость разочаровала меня - посетив несколько остравов я не заметил принципиальных отличий. Разьве что расса врагов меняется, и их сила, ну и сама карта конечно тоже. Мне весьма не хватает каких-нибудь "сюжетных" локаций, единственных и не повторимых, куда стоило бы переть через всю карту чтоб просто посмотреть, а возможно и раздобыть какой-нибудь интересный трофей. Как в однопользовательских РПГ. В прочем, нечто подобное, думаю, ещё появится.

Considering the work the Dev's put in to develop their own game engine is noteworthy. It does make development cycles slower. Good cheaper alternative to Eve. I consider the small community an opportunity to make a name for one self and impact greater change on the political landscape than one could in more popular mmos.\nMarket system allows for the same gaming and economic expertise to take advantage of low supplied, or high demand bottlenecks in production chains.\nCombat is exciting, using cover, landscape, line-of-sight, or ballistic pathing of projectiles to calculate hits/misses. They just fixed artifacting to make it more intuitive (its super easy now).\nThis mmorpg needs only one thing: MORE PEOPLE that plays it!!!\nAlso the dev's are metalheads: if that isn't a reason to try it out, then I don't know what is. :D\n\n","February 28","true","13.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Sure it sounds cool on features and so on BUT, this will stick to my game library as "The game i played 11 minutes and will never try it again" Perhaps when it's released properly but must be one of the worst Early Access games to date in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, the concept is really cool and i wish the best of luck.

However, in this game, mining is much more of a pain in the ♥♥♥. Instead of just going to a location and mining stuff, you have to play a mini-game.\n\nFor the mini-game, you have to equip and use a geo-locator of sorts, then load it with the specific type of mining locating charge that you want. The charge will find that type of material and that type of material ONLY, no other types, just that one, and it'll only show you the nearest one, and tells you nothing about it, other than in what direction it is away from you. Not a distance, just a direction, and there's a fair bit of error in it too, so you can't fully depend on it. Then, after you find where the deposit is, you have to equip another type of charge to scan the tiles around you to determine which tiles contain how much of the material in your immediate area. So that's two different types of charges you need for mining only ONE type of material. But wait, there's more. In order to mine the material, you need a THIRD type of mining charge for your mining laser, and again, this charge will only mine one specific type of material, no others. So if you're looking for a few different types of materials, you have to have 3 different charges for each one whereever you go, and they're not exactly cheap nor small, they take up quite a bit of cargo space.\n\nAll of this is kind of a nice change of pace from EvE's point and click adventure in mining, but it gets tedious VERY quickly. I'd love to recommend EvE, but that game might be worse...\n","September 11, 2015","false","7.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

I can't recommend it for just a few reasons I will describe.\n\n1.) Lengthy and kind of confusing tutorial. Not that bad but it definitely didn't leave any lasting positive impression\n2.) Uncomfortable UI and control setups. Too much going on everywhere and you have to do too much to perform some actions. This game was marketed as a sandbox rpg not a simulation.\n3.) Persistent world = Sucks for new players. I played a solid 9 hours and barely found any resources because it was all mined. In 9 hours I found maybe two nodes that had 'grown back'. And there are TONS of nodes...\n4.) The community isn't bad but there are a few people out there who just want to destroy your mech.\n5.) Linked to reason 4, if you lose your mech you lose your mech for good and X amount of hours were just wasted.\n6.) I lost my best mech and literally couldn't dredge up a reason to play long eough to make enough to buy another. Uninstalled.\n\nGame has no purpose, not even a faked one, and makes you wonder why you still have it installed when you encounter even one small setback.

There are only two reasons why, after 5 hours, I don't see spending anymore time with it.\n\n1.) it's dead, nobody is playing, i never see any other players\n2.) the idea that terrain constraints burn up "quest" time is annoying... that is, spending a bunch of time just trying to figure out how my little robot dude can navigate the white vs. blue tiles just to get to something my scanners picks up gets a bit silly... although i agree with the idea that different mechs should have different terrain navigation abilities, it just leaves you feeling like i am going back and forth just trying to figure out a path for 20 minutes - nothing fun about it\n\nEven so, I recommend it because it is a very rich game and has so much potential even if it is aging out...","December 30, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

Really small player base, and minimal selection in terms on bots and fits compared to eve. Dont be fooled by the beta tag, this game have years behind.\n\nUPDATE\n\nThey introduced a patch to rebalance all bots to be almost the same (now they have bonuses to all weapons), watering down diversity even more and killing any hopes of creative fitting. Ecm is nerfed and most bots are inmune to webs.\n\nThings you will miss if you play eve:\n- Market (Either make an indy alt or prepare to purchase stuff at 10 times their real price)\n- Tracking. (Theres no such a thing as transversal in this game)\n- Variety of fitting options. (No room to be creative. Active tanking? i have bad news for you deimos and myrm lovers, you cant sustain cap at all. Did i mention one single bot is superior with all four weapon systems? Yes! ♥♥♥♥ you Megathron, my Apoc is a better blaster boat!)\n- Skill based kills (Forget it rifter, you wont get under the guns of that Mega. Theres no tracking/transversal, signature tanking exist... as a chance based roll, that means they will miss you, until they dont)\n- Risk ("High sec" is 100% safe in this game, no ganks, no awoxing)\n- Low sec trafic (Theres no incentive at all to be outside "high sec", that means "low/null sec" is mostly deserted)\n- Evefit (This isn't the games fault but is the worst part, you know you cant live without eft!)\n\nTheres a bunch more stuff missing in that list but you get the idea. Game would be great with proper module selection, balancing, mechanics, and low sec features. Did i mention population in this game is like 100 online on average?

But FAILS miserably\n- Has the overview and window system of EVE Online.\n- Has the same buttons and mechanics of EVE Online. (Interact, Approach, Turrets, Reload, Reload All, etc.)\n- Has the same character progression as EVE Online. (Even skill names)\n- Even the tutorial agent is a male version of EVE Online.\n\nBasically it ATTEMPTS to copy everything in EVE Online, but just fails.... HARD\n\nThe graphics, even for being 5 years old, honestly is on-par with PS2 graphics.... No that is not a miss-type, Playstation Two graphics... This is with everything completely maxed, some PS2 graphics nukes this game.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I can jive to a game with crappy graphics if the game has things that can help overlook the complete lack of any esthetics. This, has nothing that I found.\n\nAll in all, I honestly wish I could get my money back!\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for a mech game I suggest playing these;\n\nRobocraft - By far the best customization in any mech game.

(Free-2-Play)\nM.A.V. - Team and tactics oriented combat, some re-birthed Chromehounds after its death. (20$)\n\nThose are just games I validate, Robocraft I've supported with 100$ just because it is the best that I see on the market, even though it is free-2-play, you don't need to pay anything at all to have amazing fun.\n\nI'm sorry Zoom, but seriously...

Npc AI is horrible. This has lead to economy entirely based on bots and afk miners.\n\nSecond - risk reward in pvp is crazy messed up. There is no reason to live or do anything on pvp islands and it is far more lucrative to bot on the beginner zones.\n\nThird - Development team is completely incapable of putting out content  at all.  the content has been rehashed for the past two years.\n\nForth - Lack of content in general.\n\nFifth - Little to no population. This is directly related to the terrible patches and update speed of the DEV team.\n\n\nThere are may other examples of why not to play or spend your money on this game but to sum things up I will say this.\n\nI have never seen a game with so much potential so easily and completely destroyed by the incompetence of a few DEVs.

However, if we leave the combat aside, what is there to do? Grinding endlessly while waiting for your daily points to spend to get to a higher level. For what? To PVP and possibly lose your mech. This game doesnt have any PVE content next to some stupid robots to grind. Then you can get massive wealth, for what? Owning a bit of the world...

It has the basic feel of a very good browser game.\nThis product will get you invested on the game mechanics and community interaction ONLY, as the controls and graphics are somewhat clunky, rather difficult to master and the sheer volume of information one has to process from the very get-go is starteling which might be offputting to a more casual type of player. So prepare to go through a lengthy tutorial process and a long learning curve.\nBe aware that this isn't 'early access' but a long-established community. Consequently, players might be less understanding of newcomers. On the bright side, there is a well-developed market and team system.\nBasically, you must know that in order to like this game you should be prepared to really invest some time and effort.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellandlife/recommended/223410/","hellandlife","HELLANDLIFE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellandlife/","146 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is strange. It's been around for 3 years at least and to me hasn't changed the slightest. Being an eve player, where expansions occur and things change. The game just seems the same old boring junk it was 3 years ago. I'd like to point out I've logged plenty of hours on the game to try and make it worth it. My experience of games of all caliber is rather large with over 100 games on steam alone. Including alot of "small MMO's" and alot of "Free 2 Play" games that put this to shame.\n\nThe good:\n-It contains a decent player base social wise, however the player population isn't so great.\n-The combat is pretty fun when you actually get to be involved/reach the fight.\n-Corporations are really fun(like guilds).\n\nThe bad:\n-As a new player you are forced to walk a silly distance for 20 minutes at mind numbing pace just to kill 4 things and return for a tiny credit sum.\n-It's a really small map and content amount.\n-Not many massive overalls to the game.\n-Very dated graphics and UI.\n-3 Days only skill credits if you don't log in you get no points. With most skills taking a minimum of 20 days + before you obtain enough credit points to "Buy them/learn/upgrade" them.\n-Unlike other reviews it's not actually that much like EVE. (which I know it's not supposed to be but since everyone compares it, I have to say it's very different apart from the old pre-2005 Eve Ui.)\n-The video for the game is rather missleading, you won't be changing robots often.\n-Nothing to make your robot unique really.\n\n\nOpinion:This game needs a drastic overall with new graphics, a new more intuitive transport system and a much more dynamic robot/item selection so you don't get bored or worse; smash your head upon the keyboard.\n\n----I'd ask for my money back if possible.----\n\nIf you look at the comment's of this review, you find a prime example of an exception to the community.\n\nEdited:04/05/2014 for a more respective approach to the content.","April 24, 2014","false","2.3"," 23 of 62 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","23","62","0","7"
