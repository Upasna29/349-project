Overly flashy, with poor tower synergy, and enemies which are unbalanced against you. While the gems you get to buy upgrades are given rather fairly, it doesn't off set the amount of imbalance this game already has. The levels are split on 3 different difficulties Easy Normal and Hard, winning on Hard will not give you 3 stars on easy.\n\nThe game is made to be grindy in order to frustrate you into buying gems so you can upgrade your defenses. While they got away from the pay to win system from the phone, it is still embedded into the game and cant not be removed with out a overhaul of the game itself. Very limited  tower ideas, and upgrades that get very annoying to look at as they flash every time they attack. If you like fighting an up hill battle, and enjoy the same feeling as someone taking your picture every second then pick this up.","December 21, 2015","false","0.9"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","33","43","0","0"

I only have an hour of playtime and I like it so I'm posting a tentative positive review (subject to change).\n\nElemental combat.  I've never seen that in a tower defense game before.  It's an interesting twist.  And instead of a long line of the same enemy type followed by a line of a different enemy type, as all the other TD games I've played do, this game has mixed groups of different enemy types attacking at the same time.   That means you have to have a variety of traps from the beginning, instead of just a basic type first then add different types later as you get more money from kills.  So far I have not seen anywhere that it tells you what enemies are coming up, which is unforunate since I have had to quickly sell traps in order to buy ones I need for an enemy.\n\nFire, Ice, Earth, and Shadow (no Air element underground, I guess).  Some enemies can be defeated by two different elements and they have defense against their own element (you see a shield icon appear when they pass over it).  For instance, skeletons take more damage from ice traps but less from earth ones.  Ice enemies are defeated by fire traps, obviously.  There's also a money trap which gives you more money and damages a little (it's a shadow trap).\n\nMagic spells.  In addition to traps there are also recharging magic spells, like a rock fall or a time freeze.  These recharge over time or you can pay to get them instantly.\n\nIn between battles you can upgrade your skills.  You can choose what you want to upgrade, the trap damage, trap cost, income from kills, initial gold upon start, magic spells.  Each trap has two aspects you can upgrade.  Obviously in the mobile version they want you to pay real money to upgrade faster.  In the Steam version you don't have that option (and I wouldn't even if I could!) so you might have to grind a little or just play smarter.\n\nGraphics style is okay.  I like it, but you can see screenshots and decide for yourself.\n\nMusic and sound effects are not the best but okay.  So far there's only been one background track during battle.  I hope there are more otherwise it will get repetitive and annoying.\n\nMore later...","February 6","true","5.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Those predecessors were mediocre games with crappy mobile phone UI with no keyboard shortcuts, tedious star grinding and absolutely no new ideas at all. The games weren't awful mind you, just very generic.\n\nThis time around the UI and graphics looks good, great even. It's very stylish, colorful and follows a nice theme. But except for the nice assets you'll very soon realize that it's actually the very same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI all over again, only re-skinned. The mostly uninspired upgrades are identical to previous games and even the achievements are the same. Doesn't bode well but what the heck, as long as the gameplay is decent right?\n\nThe first few minutes had me really worried. The first thing you'll notice is that tower-range has been thrown out the bloody window(!!). Instead there nothing but floor-plates that the creeps walk over and take damage. In my mind, this takes away tons of complexity and leave you with very choice as for what tower should go where. This is especially true since towers can only be mounted on pre-defined locations.\n\nThe second thing that boggled my mind was the damage abstraction. You now have 4 color towers (or elements) where each color beats another color. There's even a small diagram visible at all time for you to look at. It seems convoluted. It also doesn't help strategy that you don't know what waves will come ahead of time.\n\nBut to my surprise it actually works out pretty good. It definitively has a focus on action over strategy. The tower balance feels pretty good and the timing on some waves can make things turn rough and interesting. It's truly a shame they did nothing about UI, progression and upgrades. But all in all the game is an original.\n\nIt's a much, much better game than it's predecessors. It's shorter, not only fewer campaigns but also less grindy. The game is still far from great (I like strategy over click-frenzy), but this time I'm left intrigued with what kind of tower-defense Creobit can come up with next.\n\nI would recommend this game at half price.","April 6","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
