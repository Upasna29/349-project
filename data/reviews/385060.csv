"http://steamcommunity.com/id/humpyXhumpy/recommended/385060/","humpyXhumpy","humpers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/humpyXhumpy/","490 products in account","This game is really a gem. While it is an indie game and mobile port, it really doesn't feel like it. The game interface and core mechanics are very solid and feel complete. The core gameplay is a bit typical, but there is a good balance of well set up senarios, large degrees of player freedom, and reasonable depth. Seeing turnbased gameplay really turns me off, but it manages to be simple enough to be accessable, while complicated and intense enough to be interesting. The art and music is also great in my opinion and very reminicent of 2007 Runescape. The multiplayer is dead, but there is a random senario generator to extend the life of the game past the campaign.\n\nPros\n-Large amount of monsters/spells/stat upgrades\n-Well set up levels/puzzles\n-Variety of level approaches\n-Crafting system\n-Random senario generator\n-Great art\n-No bugs/glitches\nCons\n-Dead Multiplayer\n-Occasional redundant/irelevant "enemy descovered"\n\nWhile I did get this in a bundle, I would recommend buying on sale or full price.","September 29, 2015","true","14.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

The tutorial is very well done and I look forward to the coming quest.\nThe quests are fun and fairly short. You have to put some thinking into solving some of the "puzzles".\nI wish there was a way to save before you use your XP so you can change what you picked (if you assign your XP and then go do a quest and realize what you picked was useless, or you should have picked another summon, etc.., you can't).","August 26, 2015","true","2.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

Sure, it might have relied on voxel-style visuals, but the gameplay is solid so far. It doesn't look like the strategy and tactics will get very deep, but if you're craving a tactical RPG, give it a go!\n\n- I got this as part of a bundle -\n\nEdit - And I've finished the main campaign at about 18 hours.

I was drawn in by the voxel world & the idea of turn based battles revolving around summoning creatures and I was blown away. I loved the different summons I was able to invest in and how I can level up my warlock. The spells are so usefull, I always saved up enough mana to cast one just in case. I had to replay several levels just to try to find some of the hidden gems and I have yet to find them all. If you enjoy turn based tactics and strategy, this is a solid addtion to add, especially for the price.\n\n9/10 A great tactical game with tons of replayability.","October 18, 2015","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can really feel how much love went into this. It is a mix up of different genres, working out together in an absolutly brilliant way. I already had bought the game on iPad and decided to aquire it again on PC. The PC-version is even better, as the controls with mouse an keybord is easier.\n\nThe Game is turn-based and about defeating the opponent's Warlock. Each warlock can cast spells, which either work directy ("fireball") or summon creatures that fight for you. Each creature has it's own characteristics, strengh and weaknesses. There are chests with power-ups to discover, secrets, weapons to use and items to craft. The envoirment ist distructable and can be included in your strategy. You gain items to "level-up" different characteristics, that suit your gameplay best. just awesome !\n\nThe interactive Tutorial explains the concepts very good, there is a single-player campain and online multiplayer. Multiplayer is just so much fun, unfortunatly there aren't many players, as the game is (totally unjustified if you ask me) still not very known.\n\nIt ist so much fun to let your own creativity play in this game. For me the best game of 2015!\n\n\n\nDeutsch:\n\nDieses Spiel ist einfach fantastisch, Man sieht wieviel Liebe der Entwickler da hineingesteckt hat. Es ist ein Misch-Masch zwischen verschiedenen bereits bekannten Konzepten, das einfach funktioniert und viel Spaß macht. Ich hatte mir das Spiel bereits auf dem iPad geholt, und da es mir so gut gefallen hatte, habe ich es mir nochmal erworben. Die PC-Umsetzung ist genauso, wenn nicht noch besser, da die Bedienung mit Mouse und Tastatur einfacher ist.\n\nEs geht im Prinzip darum, den gegnerischen Hexenmeister (Warlock) zu besiegen. Jeder Warlock kann Zaubersprüche wirken, die entweder direkt wirken ("Feuerkugel"), oder Monster heraufbeschwören, die für einen Kämpfen. Jedes Monster hat seine eigenen Fähigkeiten, Stärken und Schwächen. Es gibt Waffen zum Ausrüsten und Gegenstände zum "Craften", Geheimnisse zu entdecken. Die Umgebung ist zerstörbar, was man nutzen kann und man kann seinen Charakter "aufleveln" wie es zu einem passt. Alles wird rundenbasiert ausgespielt.\n\nDas interaktive Tutorial erklärt einem gut die Steurung und Prinzipien, eine Einzelspieler-Kampanie ist vorhanden und auch online-Mulitplayer. Multplayer macht einfach so viel Spaß, nur leider gibt es nicht so viele Gegener, da dass Spiel leider (zu unrecht meiner Meinung nach) unbekannt geblieben ist.\n\nEs macht sehr viel Spaß die eigene Kreativität spielen zu lassen und dieses Spiel zu entdecken. Meiner Meinung nach das beste Spiel 2015","April 10","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am a huge RPG fan and, over the years, I've looked at hundreds (and tried dozens) of turned-based RPGs. The Last Warlock represents hours of research on my part. So far, I consider it the best turn-based RPG-battle game I own and I've been playing the Android version since its release. The depth, attention to detail, ease of use, and enjoyment, make this game a true rose among thorns. This game has my full endorsement. Get it and you'll understand how strategy games are supposed to be written, but be prepared, you have to use your brain and cannot rely on finger dexterity (that's why I love turn-based solutions).","August 24, 2015","true","7.1"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","18","35","0","5"

Me neither.\n\nVisuals style and sounds effects taken from straight from Minecraft. There is sooo much royalty free music from the moment you open the game to the victory sound. It makes the game sound and therefore feel unprofessional, unpolished and just thrown together. The audio can make or break a game. Furthermore, using Minecraft’s visual style makes the game seem even less developed. It’s just pandering. Instead of being creative or trying to create any sort of original style you put yourself in a position where you can’t succeed because people know how to spot knock-offs.\n\nI don’t need to play anymore of this game to know I am not going to enjoy it, at all. In fact I regret even opening this game as now my average achievement score, which I work pretty hard, is lower.\n\nI got this games as a part of a bundle and that is the only reason it’s in my inventory, there is no way I would’ve convinced myself to get this game. So many of its short comings are apparent from just the trailers that are available on the Steam store.\n\nGo play any other top-down, turn-based strategy game, please.","November 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"
