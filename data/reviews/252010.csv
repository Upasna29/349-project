"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WskOsc/recommended/252010/","WskOsc","WskOsc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WskOsc/","1276 products in account","The review blurbs don't lie: This game absolutely feels like it came right out of the late 80's NES but with fine tuned controls. Everything about it screams classic from the NES style color palette that neatly separates foreground from background and makes sure enemies stand out clearly  to the hard as balls platforming and combat, to the sparse checkpoints and lives and unforgiving boss battles that can crush you in an instant if you don't learn their patterns.\n\nGameplay feels like a mix of Strider and Shatterhand with swords and grenades as your primary weapons. A power-up item lets you cast a crescent shaped beam half the length of the screen with your primary attack but fails after you've been hit twice, requiring you to not only master the new attack range to keep enemies at bay but also hone your platforming and dodging skills to maintain your elevated attack power for harder enemies later in the stage.\n\nThe Terminator meets Vexille meets any kind of robo apocalypse storyline is pure '80's cheese and it's glorious, especially when a dude called Rico calls you on what looks like an '80's portable TV while you're riding a bright green rocket powered jetski. There's even a villain that feels like a pure throwback to the infamous Cats from Zero Wing.\n\nDespite all the homage to action games of the late '80's, Oniken manages to be its own beast. It doesn't feel especially unique but it doesn't have to as it's a masterfully crafted experience that's equal parts nostalgia trip and exciting. Even with the harsh difficulty I find myself wanting to see what the next screen will be, what the next villain will be, what's the next enemy the game will throw at me and what will it do.\n\nThe audio feels ripped right from the era too, a masterfully crafted score of synthetic sounding music that perfectly fits the tone and transports you back to a childhood full of bleeps and bloops and incredible ear-pleasure that you're sure your audio chip is having an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to produce.\n\nControls are tight, responsive and the ability to use the dpad or analogue stick makes everything a bit easier (or more authentic depending on how you look at it). Restricting controls to two buttons (attack and jump, with grenade being up+attack) feels like an unnecessary nod to the NES but it's not restricting or annoying. Neither is the game in general - when you die it's almost always your own fault, you own mistake or lack of attention that causes you to fail. That said, enemies are fast and unpredictable (at least the first time you meet them) and you'll get caught off guard by a rushing machine or chucked grenade more than once.\n\nSo do I recommend the game? Absolutely. No other game even comes close to the level of authenticity that Oniken achieves and it's obviously a labour of love from the developers who are very talented. The game isn't perfect though, for all the praise I have to give it the flashing backgrounds in some cutscenes are an epileptics worst nightmare that can't be disabled (except by skipping the whole cutscene).\n\nScore: 9/10 robots stabbed in the faceplate.","February 5, 2014","true","2.6"," 110 of 122 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","110","122","0","8"

Like they are from the (S)NES era.\nThey all lie!\nSome of them really do look like NES games. Some of them look like HD NES games. Some of them claim to play like NES games while looking totally "new-age?". None of them really plays nor feels like old-school retro side-scrollers tho.\nI'm not saying they're bad games. They mostly aren't. But they don't feel nor play like (S)NES games.\n\nOniken, however, plays and feels exactly like a classic NES game!\n\nI was sure that Oniken is another one of those pixelated games that is super hard, claims to be "old-school" but doesn't feel or play like an NES classic and once again poor old Mets would be dissapointed.\nI still gave it a shot and WOW! Just WOW!\nOniken feels just like it came out from the 80's!\n\nUnlike any other false "old-school" games on Steam, Oniken keeps it simple: You have 2 different attacks (one of them being a pick-up), you can jump...and move back and forth. The game is hard tho. Not Ninja Gaiden hard, but hard. Challenging is the key word here.\n\nEasy to get into, hard to master.\n\nThe combat is smooth - Your main weapon is a sword (that looks like a katana) and you can throw grenades as a secondary weapon. Grenades are pick-ups tho and you can run out of them. You can also find secret 1-UPs and some sword power-ups if you get lucky.\n\nAfter each level you get rewarded with a cutscene that has the quality of Ninja Gaiden.\n\nI managed to finish the entire game in 6h...it's possible to speedrun through the game in 15-30 minutes tho. Just like with classic NES games. Their true lengths were about 15-40 minutes but they took hundreds, if not thousands, of tries to finish.\nThere are 6 stages and each stage takes you about 2-5 minutes...That is if you know what to expect and you're familiar with the level layout. The first playthrough will take some time. I especially hate level 4 which took me the longest amount of time to beat.\n\n10/10 - Nails every aspect of being a good NES game!\nIf you're looking for a throwback then this is it. Look no further! Buy Oniken!","July 16, 2015","true","5.7"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","51","55","0","12"

Oniken is a snacksize-loveletter to oldschool gaming. Time flies as you run, jump and slash your way through six worlds of postapocalyptic battlefields, from underground facilities to cyberninja-infested forests. Many challenges await as you conquer one techno-dungeon after another in order to blow up the core and save innocent people from the robotic Deathforce.\n\nJoymasher didn't hold back with the 80ies cheese and present a story heavily influenced by some of the greatest oldschool anime/manga you can imagine - any game that thanks Koichi Ohata in the credits can only mean action all the way and that is pretty much what Oniken delivers.\n\nIt's a throwback to the days of 8bit, equally inspired by NES as well as Master System titles, feeling like a lost game of that long gone era that suddenly appeared again. Obviously this means you spend your time jumping platforms, collecting powerups and slashing away at all kinds of badniks - only interrupting the carnage for massive, screen-filling bossbattles at the end of each stage while rocking out to some very cool chiptunes that remind me of various compositions on the MSX2.\n\nLearning patterns and figuring out proper positioning is key to stopping the evil machines. While nowhere near as polished or deep as titles like Völgarr the Viking, Oniken's simplicity, combined with the high speed of the game and it's great sense of "anime-schlock" set it apart from similar titles on Steam, making it a nice addition to any library that already contains titles like the aforementioned Völgarr, Muri, the original Duken Nukems or the upcoming Metal Slug 3.\n\nFor all the retrofun this game provides, it's not without issues - it lacks a bit of polish in places, there are a bunch of odd hitboxes here and there and simply mashing "attack" often yields much better results than trying to avoid damage. But it is rather fair, replenishing your health upon entering a sub-stage and letting you restart in said sub-levels once you reached them. Stages aren't overly long and dying, while annoying, isn't all that big of a deal - especially since you can just select which level you want to start from in the main menu (if you have unlocked the stage that is).\n\nOverall the difficulty seemed right for this kind of game, the truly godlike players can always try their hands at the new hardcore-mode, which is really a great challenge (finish the game in one session without replenished health between sub-stages and pretty much no deaths). There are also speedrunning-achievements and online-leaderboards - providing enough stuff to do if you beat the main game, turning the run'n'slashing action into a score/timeattack-type of title. There is a Boss Rush mode too, and you get the "Jenny"-bonus stage which was basically a proof of concept that run & gun-gameplay would work in Oniken. And because the Joymasher people are nice people, they have thrown in the soundtrack too - making the Steam version the definite version of Oniken to own, even if you might already have it on Desura or from someplace else.\n\nIn total Oniken is a pretty brilliant package, especially considering the price - while not flawless, it absolutely feels very "retro"  and is all the more impressive considering it was just done in Multimedia Fusion. If you can accept the limitations in gameplay and control as a result of trying to ape classic 8-bit titles, Oniken will provide hours of (sometimes frustrating) oldschool fun for you. An excellent debut by Joymasher here on Steam.","February 5, 2014","true","16.7"," 51 of 62 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","51","62","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/252010/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Sometimes you just want to slash people in half and use no more than a couple buttons to do it. Reminiscent of games like Strider, Ninja Gaiden, and Shatterhand, Oniken is a brutal and brutally difficult 8-bit platformer that isn’t for the meek. Games of its style have been common as of late, but none feel as authentic as Oniken. For better and worse, one could easily mistake Oniken for a lost Nintendo game by Nastume or Tecmo.\n\nCall it indie if you like, but teams of two to three people were commonplace during Nintendo game development. Some did great things within the action-platformer genre, of which Oniken belongs. What we now see as limitations of hardware, they saw as a framework to build within. With 56 colors, a goofy-sounding synth, and four buttons, a few talented designers made games that continue to entertain us many years later. Oniken aspires to be in their company, even if it’s from a different era and on a different platform.\n\nAs an outsider, simplicity and difficulty appear to be the two main design philosophies of Oniken. We’ll talk about the former, before my blood starts boiling at the thought of the game’s bosses. Designed with a gamepad in mind, Oniken centers around one mercenary ninja’s ability to jump and slash dystopian future jerks. Zuku, the game’s protagonist, isn’t as fluid and fun to control as Strider Hiryu, but his sword has a nice reach. You can extend that reach by collecting power-ups. However, you can easily lose these upgrades by taking damage. If it isn’t clear by now, Oniken loves to punish the player for making dumb mistakes.\n\nLuckily, Zuku has a couple of extra tricks up his sleeve. In addition to extending attack reach, Zuku can sacrifice his power-up in order to go into berserk mode, where he deals more damage and takes less. Just as the power-ups render deadly enemies harmless, berserk mode can turn some of the game’s most difficult bosses into a 15-second slashfest. Only the most masochist old-school players will complain about these cheap victories, because even when you do manage to berserk a boss, you likely have died from him many times before - if not during the long trek to his room.\n\nAnd finally, there are grenades. These are used much like items in Castlevania: awkwardly hold up and press attack to throw in an arch. Unlike Castlevania, this is the only item you'll have which is pretty disappointing. You get used to jumping and throwing grenades, but it never feels quite right. This is one of many instances of how Oniken’s earnestness to emulate Nintendo games disservices the overall experience.\n\nOniken packs a lot of variety and creativity in its six levels which contain three areas each. Sometimes you’ll be platforming across conveyor belts with lava beneath while other times you’ll be force feeding grenades to a cybernetic polar bear while jumping spikes on a speeder bike. One area you will find consistency in, however, are Oniken’s tough-as-nails boss fights that demand you to quickly recognize an enemy pattern and stay the hell away from projectiles.\n\nMost of the time, these boss encounters are a fun challenge, but a couple will frustrate in a way that is neither fair nor entertaining. One such boss is a snake that breathes fire down on you if you attack it. Not taking damage is a matter of endurance and luck. This boss is followed by an even more maddening boss: A robot you must fight from a small, moving platform - fall off and it's instant death. Until you recognize the specific attack pattern and necessary approach that a boss demands, Oniken will put you in a world of hurt. Once you run out of lives, you'll have to start the ~15-minute journey to the boss again.\n\nWhile Oniken’s difficulty is decidedly old school, there are many times where I think the developer could have reconsidered its approach. Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden may have contained instant death traps, pits, and cheap aerial enemies, but these were not the things that made those games good. In fact, these are the things that keep many players from returning to them.\n\nOne aspect of tribute that can’t be knocked is the game’s presentation. 8-bit indie games are a dime a dozen these days, but rarely do they sound and look as great as Oniken. Though the backdrops and animation lack some detail displayed in the best Nintendo games, it’s an impressive effort nonetheless.\n\nOniken isn’t quite the magical pairing of nostalgia and great game design that Mega Man 9 was, but it comes close to scratching that same itch that few other games have done since. If you love 8-bit games and hate yourself, dying repeatedly within Oniken’s six merciless levels brings its own form of joy that is rare in games these days.","September 20, 2015","true","15.3"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","34","37","3","0"

The controls are simple, attack, jump, duck, berserk and up + attack to throw a grenade. It is all so nice. The attack distance is good and can be boosted with power ups you find. You can hang from things. This game really goes the extra mile to make you think you're playing something for the original Nintendo, while most other games going for the nostalgia feel don't have actual 8 bit graphics and music. I feel such a buzz playing this game unlike other 'retro-ish' games that miss the mark with modernized graphics and sound.\n\nThe cut scenes are nice to look at, but the real fun of the game is the game play and the enemy variety. You'll see a lot of enemies and tackle them in different ways. For modern gamers the game might be seen as difficult due to the fact if you die, you restart the section of the level. Die at a boss, restart that entire section. You'll get better! Lose all of your lives and you'll have to restart the level.  Each level mainly consists of 3 sections, each with a mini boss of some sort. Since the save file allows you to just jump to a level, if I die on the first section of a level, I just go back to the menu and warp to the level I was on. Kinda makes lives on the first section of each level pointless. You have a hefty health bar like Mega Man, so the game is pretty forgiving. Pits are of course instant death.\n\nThe level variety is a mixed bag. Some levels are just bluntly walk to the right, others make you scale to the top and still others put you in a jet ski with a scrolling screen. There are a few sections that feel open where you're free to make your own path, which feels good. Some levels are needlessly difficult with a lot of action happening, but if your a veteran of old Nintendo games, you should be used to it. If not, then make an angry video about it.\n\nThere isn't that much replayability for the game, there are a few hidden items, one per level, and there are achievements for beating a level without dying. The game saves your high score for each level, but really, once you've beaten the game, there's no reason to come back to it.\n\nAgain, this is an awesome game well worth $10, it is so awesome that I'd buy any other game this studio comes out with. They hit the nail on the head. If you aren't into old school Nintendo games, avoid it.","May 29, 2014","true","2.8"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"

I get the nostalgia aspect, but the odd reality is that I cherish the memory of playing those old school games more than I actually enjoy playing them today. When I do play them, it's an immediate reminder of where games are today and how far along games have come and why products have advanced the way they have. While old school games were considered technically superior in their time, they are considered technically inferior today. In fact, most games of yesteryear made the most of the technology available to them. So designing a technically inferior product today, on purpose, is not that impressive to me.\n\nMany great old school games are classified as abandonware and the ROMs and emulation software can be easily found to play them for whatever gaming system you cherished the most. Find them, play them, and try to enjoy them the same way you did 30 years ago. I've tried, but it's not the same. Reflecting on the memories of playing them gives me more pleasure.\n\nOniken is a good copycat from an era gone by, nothing more, nothing less.","August 27, 2014","true","4.2"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","37","48","0","0"

Like other modern throwback platformers (Meatboy, I Wanna Be The Guy, WHATEVER) Oniken sets out to make you die and try again until you get it right, but unlike those games you aren't dying due to a brilliantly crafted trap or deviously challenging stage design but instead due to an unclear boss attack pattern.  Oniken never makes me say, "Oh ho, I see what I did wrong and I can't wait to try again!" it just makes me say, "ugh."

How authentic can a modern implementation of a classic 8-bit action platformer be? Probably not much more than Oniken.\n\nYou play as Zaku — a ninja mercenary, who helps the resistance in fighting the titular evil military organization (Oniken), that's attempting to control what's left of the post-apocalyptic world. If that doesn't seal the deal for you in itself, then continue reading :).\n\nThis whole game reeks of eighties, not only in terms of visuals and sound, but the overall game design as well, not to mention the story, which is told in short cutscenes between levels. The artists did an amazing job with the visuals: the graphics aren't stylized to look like 8-bit — they are 8-bit, and great at that. The same can be easily said about sound — both music and sound-effects are unmistakably 8-bit and fit the overall game well. The levels in this game have their own different look and feature various gameplay elements and mechanics: there are classic horizontal scrolling segments, vertical scrolling segments, auto-scrolling segments and platforming segments. The boss-fights are epic, with bosses ranging from regular-sized enemy characters to bosses in crafts, mechanisms with turrets, gigantic fire-breathing snakes, etc.\n\nOniken doesn't boast a large arsenal of weapons — you're pretty much limited to using your massive sword (which you can power up) as the main weapon and grenades (which you'll need to pick up) as a sub-weapon, but that's not really a problem, since slicing your way through enemies is the meat of the game. Despite this, you'll have your chance to shoot some enemies via some shooting segments, which also exist in Oniken.\n\nit's true that sometimes Oniken may seem a little bit too authentic for it's own good, with the game being rather challenging, both gameplay- and game-design wise. Think "Ninja Gaiden" on the NES. Some levels throw a crap ton of enemies at you, while other times an additional checkpoint would make all the difference. Still, that doesn't mean Oniken is a bad game, not in the slightest — it just means that you need to persevere. Git Gud or Die Tryin. Are you a man enough to play this game? Then buy it, sadly almost nobody did.\n\nP.S.

I wasn't really sold on Oniken when I picked it up during a holiday Steam sale, being put off by the somewhat stiff controls and punishing difficulty, I didn't see it through past stage 3. However, coming off the high of Odallus prompted me to give Joymasher's debut another shot.\n\nOniken is tough. Sunsoft tough. Players who cut their teeth on games like the NES Batman and Journey to Silius will know what I'm getting at. Fast reflexes do play a part in your success, but memorizing the kinds of things a stage will throw at you and being able to consistently execute are paramount. It will throw you into that good kind of old school difficulty rage fit, that which motivates you to keep trying and not let that cheating-♥♥♥ game get the better of you. Unfortunately it also suffers from "try to get to the boss with enough health and wail on it in hopes that it dies before you do" syndrome, but a lot of the B-list games from the 8-bit era fell into this trap.\n\nAll that said, Oniken is a linear affair, and aside from the somewhat less than well hidden 1UP icons that resemble game mascots who never existed to collect in each stage, it won't exactly put your nipples in a vice grip to give it more than one shot after the end credits roll. Unless you're some kind of masochist and want to try hardcore mode.

However; most retro-styled indie games are only "retro" in terms of visuals/sound and do not capture the enticing gameplay aspects of retro gaming. Retro games were about introducing new challenges to the player and making the most out of the limited hardware available at the time. Since graphical fidelity has progressed well past 8-bit sprites no indie game can capture the latter aspect, but Oniken certainly feels authentically retro because of its focus on platforming-action mechanics, challenging level design and simple but addictive weapons. This puts it well ahead of the curve as most other "retro" indie games have no depth to their game design and feel like performing a series of menial tasks.\n\nOniken borrows a lot of design cues from some of the best action platformers available on the NES such as ninja gaiden, pitting the player against a variety of different bosses, enemies and level hazards which encourage the player to memorise the levels and come up with their own solutions. It further mixes things up with auto-scrolling levels which take the form of either platforming challenges or run-n'-gun style vehicle levels where the player will have to time their shots and jumps right to proceed.\n\nThe quality of the movement system and the simple, responsive controls prevent all of this challenge from feeling tedious/frustrating, along with this the sword and grenade weapons although lacking in variety, feel versatile enough to reliably deal with everything the game throws at you if you are willing to think about how to get past new obstacles.\n\nThe most important part of all of this is that it does feel rewarding to progress, as the cutscenes are a great throwback to the 80's, with badass gruff characters, cheesy-but-likeable villains, insane campy stunts and true-to-NES seizure effects. Although Oniken could not get away with all the gore and swearing that it has if it was to be published on the NES in the 80's, it still feels like a love letter to the action heroes of the era. What feels even more rewarding is completing each level without dying, and then progressing through the levels quickly enough to get the steam achievements. It gives Oniken a lot of replay value and is a case of game achievements actually being done right (as in, it actually feels like you've achieved something in a sense).\n\nOverall, Oniken stands up there with games like Shovel Knight, Satazius, and Cave Story as "retro-styled" indie games that are actually retro in terms of design and comes with all of the glorious challenge and fun that comes with this style of game design actually being executed correctly. One of the best things about retro action games was that you could actually become as badass as the protagonist by playing well, and Oniken captures this aspect perfectly.","February 17","true","7.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","5"

A little less limber, a little more walking apocalypse.  Not as difficult as the old nail biters for us who love them... but also not easy enough to get bored.\n\nI love speedrunning games.  My main game was always Demon's Crest and Gargoyle's Quest 2, both of which I've spent thousands of hours on perfecting in order to get the times I've gotten.  I feel the same pace of action in these games even if its more sword less shooty.  The controls are tight and feel right.  Attacking has some really cool little gimmicks behind it.  Most of you from Symphony of the Night / other Metroidvanias will fondly recall the Jump slash land slash combo.  But more than that, you can cancel your slashes by crouching, so that you can Slash crouch slash slash crouch slash over and over for a really cool trick.  Things like this make games replayable, little skillsets that you can improve at and get better with.\n\nThat said, this game is not flawless.  This game has major issues with difficulty.  Now, most of you might wonder why.  Enemy placement / attacks are good and difficult to get around.  The problem comes from this -\n\n1) Your health - You have too much health.  By simply brute forcing your way through levels and bosses you generally have enough HP to get to the next section.  Enemy attacks are not very damaging in general.  If you just keep moving forward and jumping, you'll likely make it to the next section with 2 bits of HP left only to be fully healed on the next section.  Combine this with the fact that you're likely to find 1 or even 2 health ups per section and you're blazing by pretty healthy.\n\n2) Grenades - Strong enough to kill many problematic enemies in one HP as well as abundant enough to never worry about them.  Some minibosses can be killed by simply spamming your grenades a few times.  I like that they are not easy to land and thus grant a bit of a bonus for your effort, though I would have been more appreciative of a slightly less damaging item.\n\nI realize as someone who's played the unholy hell out of Demon's Crest / Gargoyle's Quest II I am probably biased toward more difficult games.  And don't get me wrong, this game isn't 'Easy'.  If the developers wanted a 'Medium' for difficulty, they're certainly not far from it.\n\nI'll be honest - I expected another 'Retro' game that misses the point of going back to the old days.  You guys did not miss that point.  You captured what was fun in these games by meticulously getting the controls and fighting right.  And for that you do deserve praise.  Keep up the good work and Odallus will be just as good, if not better.\n","February 15, 2014","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Maddening difficulty set on top of a set of simple mechanics and insidious level layouts that will take you more than just a few tries to slash your way through.

The problem is that modern games has shown us that this is bad design. Its very frustrating to get sniped and fall to your death\n- Weird timing on enemy shots. I played a lot of NES and retro games. Enemies have this 1-2-3 timing. Oniken's enemies has an awkward 1-2-2.5 timing that throws me off.\n- Missing startup animations. Its so weird to see your enemies suddenly firing without cheorgraphing their attacks. I understand that they are going for an NES game design, but even old games like Contra will freeze their enemies in "ready animation" for a few milliseconds before firing. Because there is no startup animation, I often find myself off-guard when the enemy attacks.\n\nThat said, even with all the negatives of this game, I will still recommend it to Retro gamers. Since it only takes 2 hours to finish, the game (almost) didn't feel too long to make the faults matter.","December 14, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's got the retro graphics and chiptune soundtrack to prove it.\n\nNot only does it have retro graphics and music, but its also got that insane difficulty popular during the era. It takes quite some time to complete a level if you don't know what your'e doing (like me!). The game's controls are smooth and responsive, allowing for maximum carnage. You also have the choice of using the d-pad or the analog stick, a nice addition.\n\nThe gameplay makes use of some sword and grenade-throwing action, among other goodies, like power-ups. The platforming is alright, but I wouldn't have deemed that the focus of the game anyways, which is clearly the game's action, not its platforming. There were some parts, however, where I died due to the platforming (usually falling into a death trap of some sort). A lot of the game's enemies were really hard, especially the ones with a ranged attack. It was very difficult to get these guys because I had to be right next to them in order to kill.\n\nI haven't played a game like Oniken in a long time. I think the last I played somewhat similar to it would be the original Metroid.

Its lineage is comprised of titles like Shatterhand, Ninja Gaiden and Contra and it mostly successfully emulates the structure and difficulty of those games. The graphics and music are excellent in their 8-Bit style and there are short cut-scenes between levels featuring an art style reminiscent of animes like Fist of the North Star and Berserk. It's quite difficult but not overly and can easily be devoured and conquered by an NES veteran in a couple of sessions. The gameplay, level design and boss battles are unique enough to overcome the limitations of being so derivitive of other games and if you're a member of the choir your soul will burn again.","April 17, 2014","true","4.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However, games today have to have mechanics that can hold your attention. NES sidescrollers are a dime a dozen, so it's no wonder that only a handful of them became popular with gamers. Oniken compares more to those random obscure sidescrollers when it should be more comparable to the memorable ones like Ninja Gaiden.\n\nIn honor of this game's admirable attempt to revive the NES era, I will review it as any magazine from the old days would.\n\n---\n\nControls - 3/5 - Movement in Oniken is extremely fast which often leaves you little time to react to an enemy. Pressing up and attack uses a grenade, but pressing up while in the air halts your forward movement which can lead to accidental deaths when you push up.\n\nGraphics - 4/5 - The cutscenes are decent, but the sprite animations are boring. The main character's run cycle is only about 3 or 4 frames. Backgrounds really capture the spirit of NES era graphics and are well made.\n\nSound - 2/5 - Music is acceptable, but has no melody to it and is easily forgettable. The sound effect you'll be hearing the most is the sword swing. Strangely, most of the other sound effects are barely audible.\n\nReplayability - 2/5 - The game is extremely linear and doesn't offer any deviation from the main path. The only benefit of replaying the game is having an easier time due to prior knowledge of enemy placement and mechanics. Some secrets can be found in destructible walls.\n\n---\n\nI enjoyed the novelty of playing something that felt like an NES game on Steam, but that's about the extent of my enjoyment. Getting it cheap in a bundle is the only way I could recommend it. Paying full price is highly discouraged.","February 9, 2015","false","2.2"," 43 of 84 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","43","84","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/recommended/252010/","goldenagegmr","GAGMR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/","425 products in account","This game is classic Nintendo hard.\n\nIf you like retro games like Ninja Gaiden or Strider then you're in for a treat.\n\n~PROS\n-Solid Retro Style Gameplay\n-Puzzle like platforming\n-Good Soundtrack\n-Level Select Feature\n-Easy to Learn/Hard to Master\n-Leaderboards\n\n~CONS\n-Lack of Full controller support (D-Input Only?)\n-High Difficulty\n-Trial & Error Level Design\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nAll the classic NES type stuff is in this game & you could even play it with a USB NES controller if you have one.  You move left/right.  Jump with one button & attack with the other.  You can crouch under projectiles and attack while crouching or jumping. UP+Attack is to throw a grenade & there's a special pick up that gives you a slightly larger attack radius & if you have at least 2 stacks of it you can use your Berserk power which gives you invincibility & upgrades your attack to god like levels for a few seconds.  Every time you take damage you lose one stack of berserk, so you gotta not get hit to keep it up.\n\nThe game is pretty hard & gets harder as you progress.  It even has that annoying knock back effect when you get hit & yes, I've been knocked back into pitfalls quite a bit.  Classic NES difficulty right there.  It's not as hard as Ninja Gaiden, though. The levels do get easier as you learn your way around them & get used to how the game plays.  Nothing ever really feels like it's unfair.  It's just challenging.\n\nIt plays like any classic NES action platform game similar to Ninja Gaiden or Strider.  Each level has a two or 3 parts to it with bosses at the end of each segment & checkpoints in case you lose a life.  If you lose all your lives it's back to the very beginning of the stage & you get 3 lives per level with a hidden life somewhere in each stage for a total of 4 lives.  Once you beat a stage your lives reset to 3 for the next stage regardless of how many lives you have.\n\nThe downside to all this is you will die a lot the first time you play through it.  The game seems to be based on a trial & error type design.  Once you know your way around a level & how to beat the areas/bosses it gets a lot easier.  Everything is set up so you can easily beat it once you know what you're doing.  A good example is when I first played through Level 2 I died quite a few times & had to start over more than once, but now I can play through it without dying that much.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe level select feature is kind of like Volgarr the Viking (if you've played that game you'll find this game easy by comparison).  Once you beat a stage you can skip it & go to the next stage the next time you play via the level select menu.\n\nThere is also a High Score feature.  Once you beat a level, you get a score.  These don't really matter unless you want them to.  You can always go back & replay levels to try and beat your high score & upload your best toal score to the Leaderboards.  High Scores are based on how much health, lives & upgrades you have at the end of the level as well as how quickly you get through them.\n\nThe game also has some cool cutscenes similar in style to Ninja Gaiden.\n\nOVERALL\n\nOverall, I'm not too far into the game but I've seen enough to recommend it.  It's got all the stuff Retro fans will love so if you like old school games then you should pick this one up especially if it's on a good sale.","August 31, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

In my opinion, it is even better than some of those games I just mentioned! The story is quite cheesy and fun in a goofy sci-fi anime way, but it is written much better compared to Ninja Gaiden's cut-scenes. In other words, you can actually tell that the people who wrote it could speak fluent English!\n\nThe game is divided into 6 missions, plus an extra bonus mission. Each mission takes a certain level of reflexes, timing, and trial and error pattern recognition to succeed. What I really loved was the hardcore mode that unlocks after you beat the game! In hardcore mode, the game is more difficult and you have to play through all the missions on one life! (you can find some extra lives in the levels though)\n\nWithout a doubt, beating the game on hardcore mode will make you feel like a total bada$$! You will look down and notice new strands of chest hair and ripped muscles on your body that you never knew you had before, all thanks to this amazing game! There is also a boss rush mode that is equally fun and addicting. I personally found the snake boss in the tree to be the most annoying because I couldn't figure out a good pattern to beat him, but with enough perseverance, I finally got past him with enough health to finish the challenge.\n\nOverall, this is a great game and I'm sure that if it was released back in the NES golden era, between 1986 - 1992, it would've been a massive hit. Many young gamers today simply don't have the patience to play through a game like this, which is a big shame in my opinion. If they would just try to put some time and effort into finishing it on hardcore mode, they would find it to be one of the most rewarding experiences ever, but unfortunately they are spoiled by the constant checkpoints and hand holding of modern games like Call of Duty and other casual games.\n\nThat's just my two cents, but yeah, I highly recommend this game to anyone who has good taste in games.","March 3","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I have a lot more than the apparent 3 hours put into it, but on Offline Mode. This game genuinely looks and sounds like an 8-bit game and plays like a NES game. On first play through of each level, it feels difficult but never frustrating. Once you've died a couple of times though, you should be able to play back to that point without dying once; it's incredibly fair. Due to being able to choose your level once you've completed the last, the difficulty on normal mode isn't quite NES levels but it makes up for this by having 3 or 4 sections to each level that could be considered individual levels (often with a boss in each section). Controls, particularly with a gamepad (though keyboard is fine for this game), are great altogether. Some levels feel like Ninja Gaiden or Vice: Project Doom, while there are segments that feel more like Shinobi III (the jet ski sections specifically) but with 8-bit graphics. Really an incredible job done on it. Recommended at any price.","April 7","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although the term "Retro" and "Vintage" are often used to describe games these days with only 16 bit color palettes, well this not one of those look alikes, this one is tried and true, no gimmik, no crap, and i honetly wouldnt be able to tell the difference if i was playing on a NES, This game is easy to grasp and actually quite fun to play. The enemies are nice and vary per stage (a few keep popping back up but whats wrong with a few reacurring enemies?) the bosses are nice and there are even a few surprise fights that i wasn't expecting. The level design is smart and intuitive (enemies range and abilities are actually taken into consideration in level design or enemy placement) and the backgrounds are well done and are nice to look at and is accompanied by a soundtrack that fits this game to a 'T'. Controls are simple, easy to learn, but when you die its generally your fault because the controls are very responsive, oh and by the way first run you probably will die. thats a good thing, difficulty is your typical NES brand of hard, but its not overbearing and frustrating, the game seems to know the boundry between difficult and broken very well for i never find myself in a position where i know theres  not chance to win unless i put myself there. in closing i look foward to finishing the game, and probably will continue after i finish this review, Final thought: if your looking at this and wondering if its worth it... it is.","February 13, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is a very VERY well done retro, 8-bit style platformer. The best way for me to describe it is a hybrid of both the original strider with the NES version of Ninja Gaiden. It is very hard, but not cheep, and the controls are precise and flawless. There are six levels with three sub-stages per level, and honestly, I completed the first three levels without any real trouble. It's the later three levels where the challenge really shows. The secret to beating them is, (like most of the platformers of the day) lots of repetition and memorization of patterns. Even the hardest stage, (which in my opinion was stage five) will become easier after enough play, so don't get frustrated and discouraged. Just play, die, and repeat and you will see that the stages gradually become easier and easier until you can beat them. As for the story: it is very CORNY, but in a charming and (I think) intentional way. I loved it.","February 17, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While it's easy to see that it's been influenced by older titles, it also succeeds in taking some of what made the classics great, and then tweaking their formulas to come up with something that feels somehow unique. In addition to having a great story, incredibly precise controls, and a tough but fair difficulty, there's also more to do after completing the game. Easily worth the price of admission if you're a fan of retro games and have the itch to try something that manages to feel like a classic title that just got delayed by...oh...14 years but still holds up in modern times.","February 5, 2014","true","2.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Definitely has the feeling of a NES game, but a good one. I don't know why people are saying it has the "trappings" of one, it seems fairly well designed - though I would've done a few things differently in the way of level design. Despite this, the mechanics are fairly solid and so far nothing feels unfair - its def not a game to run through blindly though. Caution is your friend, and if you're not used to that, or don't enjoy that element - its not that punishing, but I can see why people wouldn't like it. Visuals are great, I love seeing how much can be achieved with so little, and whilst it does commit to the NES style, it is just a style and doesn't follow the restrictions too closely - which can go either way for you. Overall nothing too negative to say about it.

It is a fantastic looking game. It has great look background and sprites. The music is also fantastic and very well done. However the game has a specifically irratating level design that makes the difficulty rather cheap.\n\nThe problem with these nostalgia throw back games is that whilst they are great to look at, they also include all the features that annoyed us during the original generation. Having lives is okay, but having to restart the same cheap difficult level over and over is another thing.\n\nAlso the controls are a little delayed which can make certian sections of the game even more frustrating. When you have to frequently jump you have time you button presses early because the response time is not spot on.\n\nIt is a shame really because this game has a lot of things to like about it. However I don't think the person who created it realizes how much we hated this kind of cheap shots 20+ years ago and still don't today.

If you liked classic NES games like Ninja Gaiden or Contra then you'll enjoy this game.  Unfortunately, I was unable to get this game to work with a corded Xbox 360 controller.  Playing it on a keyboard kinda sucks.  There is also another issue with a particular gameplay mechanic that I have a hard time getting past.  Let me illustrate with a hypothetical.  There is an enemy which is high up and far to the the right, so I want to move right+jump+attack.  Thats a total of 3 buttons(right arrow key+Z+X respectively)  The game has no problem detecting all 3 button presses when jumping to the right, but for some reason when jumping and moving to the left, if you try to attack while holding the left key and jump key, the game will not recognize the attack key.  It seemed like an intermittent problem at first, but after I found out how to recreate it, it became more noticeable and got pretty annoying.","January 20, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Especially the later sections in the game are quite tough but still manageable if you memorize the boss patterns and make use of some simple methods.\n\nEven though many players may not be impressed by the pseudo 8-Bit graphics, I still must stress out the smooth pixel artwork. The devs sure have a good taste of gory Anime shows and rock hard sidescrollers from the golden past. Music, sound effects and even controls all feel like a legit NES game and do their job perfectly. Sweet.\n\nThe only letdown is that it's not really a long game at the end of the day. Sure, the later stages indeed consume a lot of time until you beat them, but theoretically it's possible to see the ending after half an hour if you're really good.\n\nUltimately I can say that Oniken represents a solid Strider/Ninja Gaiden clone with some really nice moments and awesome boss fights. Preferably get it during sales when it's almost free. And beat the game in Hardcore Mode if you've got balls of steel.\n\n7/10","January 22, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also the enemy design needs some work, enemies fire projectiles in a way that you have no way to manuver through them fairly and they can even hit you as soon as you enter the screen!

Also the enemy design needs some work, enemies fire projectiles in a way that you have no way to manuver through them fairly and they can even hit you as soon as you enter the screen!

It's definetley not the Graphics as they are just superb and crafted with the correct amount of love and respect that which it mirrors. The Music although a litte more modern sounding is still fantastically done and it sits within the games setting beautifully. What's my issue with it then? I'd say it just falls short of being a classic because of it's game mechanics and difficulty setting. The mechanics for the most part are ok. But it's in the swinging arch of the sword that I found difficult and cumbersome. Your left feeling unprotected by it's swing especially with overhead enemies and you'll end up putting yourself in bad positions as your not sure if you'll be protected by your frantic slashing! Now I play old school games all the time and I'm well scarred by their difficulty, but this game (for me) just pushes the punishment to much and in ways that you just feel more cheated by your death than you do learned from it. All that said, I do recommend this game to people who love the 8-Bit era, and want a tough challange.

And I definitely recommend it to anybody who was raised on NES games. Let me tell you why.\n\nSTORY\nThe plot is pretty simple, but still good. We assume the role of a cool swordsman called Zaku, a strong and silent type. He reminded me of Guts from Berserk series a bit, well he still has something unique in him anyway. Zaku joins the small resistance group who fight against the powerful military organization "Oniken", who took control over the world during war crisis. So our hero fights against this organization and almost single-handedly defeats it. There will be some simple plot twists, but overall the story is quite straightforward. But anyway the characters are all good, I especially liked the bad guys. Oh yeah, and the cinematic cutscenes are just awesome, just like in the old ninja gaiden games, and even better.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nSome people say it's amazing, but... I dunno, it could be better. The only themes I really enjoyed were the intro cutscene theme and the main menu theme. Still not bad though.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nGameplay is pretty simplistic, our hero can move, jump, duck and slash with his sword. There is only one sub weapon in the game - grenades. Look not that useful in the beginning, but believe me, there will be moments when yyou bless you saved some in your arsenal. Also, there is a sword upgrade in the game, when you aquire one your sword shoots a small projectile slash forward, when you swing it. During the time when you have your sword upgrade tap "Berserk" button to go berserk, become invincible for a short time and inflict some heavy damage. Very helpful during boss fights. And yeah, boss fights are just epic, at least some of them.\nThere will be levels where you will be riding some sort of a bike. Pretty neat and a good change of pace. And there is one bonus level where you will be playing as another character with a different gameplay.\nVERDICT\nOverall I was completely satisfied with everything, well, maybe more sub weapons would be great, like grenades + 4 more sub weapons. Maybe some shotguns or pistols, or even those blade boomerangs ninja foes use. Would be funny if you could catch those and throw them back :P Anyway, Oniken is a great tribute to old NES era side scrollers, it is challenging, it has cool boss fights, it is not that long, only 6+1 levels and it has some extra modes, like boss rush and "Hardcore mode" if you were not satisfied with the difficulty. Definitely get it and beat it! You will not be dissapointed. 9/10","September 3, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It holds its influence on it's sleeve, but for what it's worth this is no Strider; it is very much it's own game with a distinct personality.\n\nThe difficulty is understandably high, with a lovely amount of bosses and enemy variety. The combat and platforming is decidedly stiff but functional, and thankfully the game is built expertly around that. There is a ton of variety spread throughout; everything from vertical levels to speeder bike chases to robot polar bear grenade fights, you'll find there is a lot of fun and balls to the wall insanity to be had. Nothing is impossible and everything has a pattern, just like the oldies. As polished as this game is, you'll find that there will still be the occasional cheap death.\n\nThe later stages are a great test of your abilities, and I made the foolish mistake to come back to them after a hiatus. I now officially suck, and my rustiness means I'll have to devote even more time if I'm ever to see the end.\n\nStill, I've played more than enough to make an opinion, and I can tell you with the amount of content present in such starkly glorious retro quality, Oniken is a beautiful yet flawed homage to the old games of yore, and serves to establish it's own tongue-in-cheek identity that many new age retro titles fail to capture. The price it's asking for and the heart that's been put into its production shows a game that everyone should pay attention to, even if some of us lesser skilled gamers can't get past the final few levels without suffering an ♥♥♥♥♥. Definitely worth a buy.","August 4, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They don't really hold up today that well imo. Same goes for all these retro NES inspired games, it always striked me as lazy when devs rely on nostalgia and outdated game mechanics. However, Oniken is a game that made me question this bias of mine. I was originally drawn to it by the cool 1980's sci fi aesthetic, with references to old movies like Terminator and Aliens. When I started it, I was treated to an awesome cinematic of a postapocalytic world ruled by Cyborges, and a fantastic soundtrack that really got me in the mood. Upon playing it, I died frequently and got frustrated, but I kept coming back for more. That's the power of this game, it get's its claws into you and wont let go. You know, I think the challange is one of the things that keeps the game interesting. Game devs nowadays don't understand that an overly easy game just becomes boring and repetetive after a while. Human beings want to overcome obsticles, it gives them a sense of accomplishment. How can you get that when your game is simple childs play?\n\nAnyways, if there is one gripe I have towards this game............ Actually naw, there's nothing wrong with it that I can think of. Just a really fun and addictive game, with a badass soundtrack and 1980's look and feel. Highly reccomend it!","January 17","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Soundtrack can be sometimes very nice and catchy, but also can be a bit generic in some levels. My biggest complaint would be the checkpoint system, which I find to be a bit brutal, but of course it fits the style and it's problably meant to be like this.\n\nAt the end I would recommend Oniken if you like the genre. 7,5/10","December 24, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many indie games that have a retro aesthetic, but Oniken is one of the few that actually feels 8-Bit, from the color pallette to the music and pixellated cutscenes.\nBeware if you're easily frustrated, Oniken is certainly not an easy game. While it's not as punishing and unfair as many NES era games, (I'm looking at you Ninja Gaiden) there is still plenty of old-school difficulty. You'll definitely have to play stages a few times and memorize enemy placement and attack patterns.\nWhile the mechanics are fairly simplistic, they are solid and responsive; and the game never overstays its welcome.
