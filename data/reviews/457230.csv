And FREE! Beyond this, really well crafted characters. Characters feel larger than life. Material textures show nicely on the Vive. Scene and colors are bright and the environment feels superb. Finely detailed - which shows especially when standing face to face with the characters.\n\nThis is also an excellent introduction to the VR experience. Will definitely share with others! Thanks!","April 9","true","0.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Still, it is recommended because of the emotions that the pretty characters can elicit.","April 13","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Very impressed with the details, sale and effects.  If the game is an actual VR game (when it launches) I'll certainly give it a go after seeing this.","April 27","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's no pointer or anything. All I can do is wave my arms around and flip my flashlight on and off. Not very fun.","May 12","false","0.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
