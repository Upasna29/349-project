The performance is good and I did not notice any major bugs so far. Of course there is still a lot to do for the developers, but you can get an impression of what the final game will be like. Currently you can play the on randomly generated maps in the "endless descend" mode, a campaign mode is scheduled to be released during EA. There is already a variety of traps and hazardous objects that make it quite difficult to get you team out alive. So, if you like the challenge of a tactical/strategical exploration game and can put up with the fact that campaign, skill trees, etc. are still in the making, this game is just right for you, even in EA.","April 8","true","3.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It can be a very fun and engaging already.\n\nIts a hard game and if you like a challenge this may be the game for you.\n\nThe game Focusses more on managment of your ressources than on Combat and is in itself a very unique and innovative gameplay.\nnaturally since it is still in early Access its still very rough around the Edges but the general gameplay is already implemented and quite extensive.\n\nin the end it will depend on the further development but i can certainly recommend giving this a try if you are ready to engage yourself in a beta version of a game.\n\nThe developers definitely show a lot of respect for Feedback and ideas and are engaging with any input coming their way.","April 8","true","7.1"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","5"

You like mold-breaking games that have been developed with a lot of love, then this is the game for you.","May 4","true","1.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
