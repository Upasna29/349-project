It runs fine, and it's essentially exactly what you'd expect.\n\nProgress Disclosure: I finished the first two dozen boards, which is the first three levels. I reviewed it so early because there were no other reviews; its window of new release exposure was closing, and it didn't deserve to miss sales on account of consumer uncertainty.\n\nObservations: The "tutorial" consisted solely of a box of text; it was still sufficient, even having heard and read nothing about the game except the store description before playing.\n\nThe difficulty is fine so far; the first 6 boards averaged under 2 minutes each, and the next 18 took a bit over 4 minutes each.\n\nThe presentation is simple and functional. The art style is essentially all displayed in the marketing screenshots accurately.\n\nThe achievements look to be quite doable, so this game would probably be good for 100%ers. All of them are for simple completion; none can be missed, are timed, or even require perfect input.\n\nThere are no hidden in-game purchases.\n\nAccessibility: The game never has time pressure. The interface requires enough precision to hit boxes of the size in the marketing screenshots without hitting the adjacent ones; it does not require dragging. The interface is fully mouse-driven. (It may support touch screens, but I don't have one.) There are no vital sounds. There is no dialogue written or spoken.\n\nLocked tiles are distinguished from unlocked tiles purely by color; that mechanic is optional, though helpful for remembering which numbers you're confident in. Some tiles are locked in the marketing screenshots, so you can check before purchasing if there's an issue for you.\n\nAs a non-expert, I see no other problems.","November 17, 2015","true","3.0"," 41 of 42 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","41","42","0","5"

Each square has a list of candidate numbers from which you can pick, and the objective is to force each row and each column to contain exactly one of each number.\n\nUnlike sudoku, this puzzle format allows for more interesting thinking right from the beginning, because Cross Set does not necessarily need any of the squares to be fixed (though they can be). This shaves off some of the early "fill in the obvious" steps common to many sudoku puzzles. Unfortunately, limiting the choices by square appears to make the later "finish filling stuff in" phase come earlier. I find the puzzle format fresh enough to hold my interest.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE:\nThe software is very basic. Window size (and Windowed/Fullscreen) are options before the game boots, but there is no volume slider (only a mute button). Oddly, the fixed puzzle squares do not begin locked, even though all of the advertising shows them as locked. Hopefully this is some kind of oversight, as manually locking them just wastes about 10-15 seconds per puzzle.\n\nOVERALL:\nIt's an interesting new puzzle format with 64 puzzles included for $3. I've spent about as much per puzzle for Kakuro and Sudoku books, so I'd say the game is more than worth the price if you're at all interested in logic puzzles.","November 17, 2015","true","1.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

If your answer is yes, this game will interest you for sure!\n\nThe basic principle in Cross Set is similar to Sudoku - all numbers in each row and column must be distinct. But you can't select the right number from all (that would be pretty easy to fill 1,2,3,4,... to grid), there's always a limited selection of numbers for every rectangle. If you are afraid of getting lost in which numbers are set correctly and which not, don't worry because you'll be able to lock the rectangles which are (hopefully) right.\n\nAnd that's all! Combine that with great minimalistic design and good sounds, and get into eight level sets full of number grids. As I usually like to lay on the bed and do crosswords, this is a nice alternative for 3 euros that isn't even much challenging - it just mostly require patience and attention, as you'll be able to make mistakes pretty easily.\n\nAlso, the game has Steam achievements for beating all levels, so this game may also be a magnet for 100% achievement hunters - expect few hours of playtime, depending on your speed and amount of mistakes you make (because mistakes usually lead towards restarting the whole level).\n\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 5","true","6.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Basically it presents a square grid of boxes, each containing a set of digits. Your task is to choose a single digit for each box so that no digit is repeated on a given column or row. Just like in a Sudoku.\n\nUnlike in Sudoku, the grid size is variable up to 9x9 and it is not divided into separately managed squares. Instead, the puzzle is constrained by the digits allowed in each box.\n\nMany of the same techniques as in Sudoku work in Cross Set. You can (almost) always systematically go through the whole grid to find the solution or at least lock in a couple of digits.\n\nDifficulty goes from simple (early levels) to challenging and time consuming (later levels) to nigh impossible (optional bonus levels). There are seven main sets (each with eight puzzles), one ultimate set with just one puzzle (set number 8) and two bonus sets each with eight puzzles.\n\nCuriously the difficulty is jumpy in each set because of the varying size of the grid. A set of eight puzzles always begins with a small grid but the puzzles get bigger until the halfway point of the set (puzzle number 5) where they start small again. I found it convenient to play through four puzzles of increasing size in a row and then take a break after the last, more difficult one.\n\nNo drawing on the screen, kids!\nInterface looks clear and works splendidly. Left-clicking on a box will switch through the chosen digits and right-clicking will lock a digit to its place (or alternatively unlock it). Only three things I would have liked as improvements:\n\nFirst, I would have liked a way to mark a box with a different colour for testing a certain digit (e.g. to find a contradiction elsewhere). Second, sometimes a digit eliminates another in the grid and I would have liked a way to mark these numbers as eliminated so I wouldn't accidentally choose them. This would also aid in finding correct digits.\n\nThe worst oversight is the lack of saving feature within a puzzle. One can get around it by screenshotting before quitting but it's still cumbersome compared to proper save files. Good thing that all but the most challenging puzzles are short and can be done in half an hour at most.\n\nConclusion\nCompleting all the main puzzles (and therefore 100% achievements) was a task of almost 10 hours for me. Some of the puzzles were very challenging but none were unfair.\n\nI also tried a couple of the bonus levels. Admittedly they are meant to offer extra challenge after beating the rest of the game. However, for these puzzles the simple systematic approach doesn't lend many freebies and one would probably need a lot of the so-called advanced techniques to solve them.\n\nRegrettably I finally gave up after beating just a couple of the plus puzzles and none of the double-plus superhuman problems. They will probably always remain there mocking me and my inferior intellect.\n\nThe present price (3 € here) would be good even for half the content. I'd recommend Cross Set especially for fans of casual puzzle games or alternatively as a light snack to play between more hardcore games.","March 16","true","10.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Since the range of numbers in each cell is limited, you can draw some conclusions about which numbers go where and eventually "fix"the grid.\n\nIn fact, the logic is exactly like Sudoku, but not as challenging: because every square can only be part of 2 number sets, not 3 as in actual Sudoko, the logical deductions never get very deep. You can solve every one of the 57 regular levels by checking each row and column for a) digits that appear only once; b) squares that have only one possible digit left; c) consider cycles (if you have two 2-5 squares, they must have the 2 and 5, so they can't appear elsewhere in that row). Cycles can extend to 3, but that's rarely needed; you can also check for cross-row and -columns, but that is also more rarely needed than in Sudoku. The last regular level is 8-1, andit took me 20 minutes. (My overall time includes lots of idling.)\n\nThe problem is in the game's interface, and it only starts that you can either have no sound or you're forced to listen to someone incessantly hammering on the same two keys on their piano. The problem is that a lot of the puzzle solving involves checking which numbers are where, and as you can see from the screenshots, not only are there no visual cues (like, I don't know, colors or shapes with the numbers), the numbers switch places each time you click on a square, so you have to exert a lot of brainpower reading and parsing the numbers on the buttons. Unlike a pencil-and-paper Sudoku, you can't erase any numbers, either. Fix a 4 on the grid, and you'd erase all 4s in the same row and column, but you can't. They don't even dim. If you could, then a control that would e.g. "highlight all 6s that aren't dim" would be really helpful in doing the actual thinking and deducing. As it is, there's a lot of pedestrian checking and very little thinking involved in solving these puzzles. Then you have to repeatedly click a square to select a digit, as if we only had a touch-thumb and no mouse available. Good thing the puzzles aren't that difficult because you can't save your progress. The final straw is that there's no "undo" button either.\n\nRecommended if you enjoy Sudoku of medium difficulty. Personally, I like the hard ones.\n\nCross Set runs fine on my old Windows XP box.","January 8","false","12.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

There is NO WAY to mark that you have eliminated a number as a possibility in a given square. You can only mark that a square is 'locked' to a particular number. This means that you end up having to reexamine the same numbers in the same squares over and over to eliminate possibilites that you already eliminated.

The UI is simplistic and elegant, the controls are straight-forward, but completing this game is anything but. Definately worth the price.","January 22","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidianlily/recommended/415400/","obsidianlily","obsidian.lily","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidianlily/","152 products in account","Quite an enjoyable take on the general number puzzle genre. The music is unobtrusive, the visual design is soothing and friendly, and the puzzles range from simple to devilish. The only (meaningful) improvement I could recommend is a way to remove numbers one has determined are not possible for a row or column. Being a colorfully-minded person, I wouldn't mind options for background imagery or "tile sets" or similar, but not having those options doesn't detract from the game.\n\nAccessibility notes: The color scheme may pose a problem for those who are red/blue colorblind. The control scheme is mouse-only, using two buttons. No reflexes are required.","January 22","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You must find the numbers that fit the cells, following the rules that each row has the numbers 1-9 exactly once, and each column has those numbers exactly once.  Some levels use 1-4, or 1-6, etc, but the concept is the same.\n\nThe mix of levels is good, and took me awhile to casually beat (about 11 hours in total to beat all levels and 100% the achievements).\n\nIn my opinion the asking price of $3 is totally worth it (you spent more than that on your lunch today, admit it).\n\nIf you like Sudoku, this game will scratch a similiar itch.  I fully recommend it.","May 4","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
