Controlling commandos behind enemy lines. Stealth. Tactics. The experience was amazing and I am elated right now to play this game again.\n\nThe game's charm is in figuring out enemy's patterns, observing the environment, planning tactics and then carrying it all out. It is hard, but addicting and rewarding in the end. A simple act of throwing cigarette packs and then knocking out a soldier and tying him up, booby-trapping, throwing a bomb at a group of soldiers or disguising as an officer with a spy is satisfying.\n\nThe game is a little hard to get into at first, but after you really pass the two training levels, you are essentially ready to go.\nVERY USEFUL TO KNOW: CTRL-S and CTRL-L for quicksave and quickload.\n\nIt was also released in 2002 so the game looks rough and doesn't support widescreen natively. To remedy this, you can pick up executables that fix this (https://sites.google.com/site/xbootx/home/commandos2), although very high resolutions might cause graphical glitches. There is also a mod called Destination Paris (http://commandoshq.net/c2dp_dloads.php) that makes the game even more challenging.\n\nCommandos 2 is my favorite game in the whole series and I recommend it to Commandos newcomers; as Behind Enemy Lines and Beyond the Call of Duty are too unforgiving (I haven't played Commandos 3 yet, but it's apparently not as up to par). Alternatively, you can try Desperados if you're more into Wild West or Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood if you're into Middle Ages.","December 1, 2013","true","36.1"," 104 of 106 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","104","106","0","3"

I spent hours playing this game when I was a kid (back in the days when games gave you a real challenge !).\nFrom where i'm sitting I can still see the CD on my shelf, so I already own it but when I saw you could buy it on Steam for 99 cents, here I thought : "Let's buy it, it's cheap, it'll be the occasion to play it again and since it's in my steam library it'll be more convenient than the CD" (I bought a lot of games I already owned that way and I know I'm not the only one).\nHere comes the downfall : it's a pain in the *** to make it run on a W7 64Bits computer.\nFirst, the game just wouldn't launch, opening and exiting immediately, then after some tweaks, new message : "problem checking steam application" and then "comm2.exe not responding".\nI finally got it to work only to find you can't play on a wider resolution than 1024x768.\nI know it's an old game but what's the point in making this game available on Steam if you can't play it on a modern configuration ?\nI wouldn't want them to change the graphics at all but at least they could've make a HD resolution compatibility, that would have justified the buy for me.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game ? Hell yeah !\nDo I recommend you buy it on Steam ? Hell no ! They didn't even bother to check if the game would run properly on a current PC. I work in computers for a living so I know my way around and it still took me 2 hours just to launch the game (and my time playing the game is not updated on my profile, I didn't play it just 6 minutes) !\nMy advice : buy it elsewhere like on Good Old Games, the pack Commandos 2 + 3 only costs 5$ and download a mod allowing 1920x1080 resolution.","December 25, 2013","false","0.2"," 200 of 272 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","200","272","2","1"

Japan,\nconsists of ten regular missions, nine bonus missions (+1 regular mission 'bonus phase'), and two trainings,\nroughly 20-40 hours to beat.\nSo what it is all about? The key idea remains the same:\nplayer has 1-8 (usually 3-5) commandos to control\nplays missions against 10-50 (sometimes 100+) soliders on the map\nbeing outmumbered and outgeared, the player must use silent takedowns without setting off the alarm, at least for most part of the mission.\nenemies have their own sight and hearing areas, most of the time the player approaches from behind, and in places which are isolated from another guards,\nthis usually requires luring the guard out from crawded area, distracting anoter patrolmen or combination of both,\nall settled during the WW2, though with fictional history. One will for instance visit Asia and Pacific as a British commando.\nThe commandos 'specialise' in following areas:\na dirty job guy aka Green Beret, stealth and melee combat expert,\na sniper, one shot one kill, can collect ammo from enemies,\na diver, can swim unnoticed in deep water,\na sapper, demolition expert,\na driver, gunner and tank operator, also handles "exotic" weapons,\na spy, covert ops expert, can dusguise himself as an enemy and chat the guards,\na thief, sneaker but with limited combat abilities,\nNatasha, spy / sniper equivalent (shows up in three missions, where European officer would be too suspicoius),\na dog, another distractor but is cool.Compared to C1, all the commandos have shared set of skills, which includes:\nshoting a gun, machine guns and rifles (except for sniper rifle),\nstunning enemies with fist punch,\ncarrying bodies,\ndriving small cars,\nswimming and (limited) diving,\nusing medpacks,\ndisguise as enemy solider (though only the Spy can do this efficiently),\ndistracting with cigarettes, decoy, etc.\nThe commandos no longer seem to be rookies.\nThis actually makes the game way easier, as a tight cooperation is no longer needed.\nOn the other hand this varied set of skills adds a lot of freedom into the game, and one no longer needs to stick with the Green Beret.\n\nThe game lost its deadly alarms and garrnison patrols, which were almost a signatue feature of the first part (and usually resulted in mission failure).\nThe enemies are far less aggressive and leave a large time margin of error before opening fire.\nMore then enough to get back to safety.\nThey are more susciptable for diversion and there are more ways to distract them.\n\nSo what did the game gained? Why it is still worth anything?\nA lot of freedom.\nA lot of equipment (compared to C1): smoke grenades, gas grenades, bottles of wine, sleeping pills, wire traps, landmines, bazookas, fresh meet (for guard dogs), binolucars.\nGun blazing is now more possible, but stealth actions remain a tactics of choice (plus it is fun with all those toys).\nPossobility to explore and fight inside buildings.\nTen unique missions (+ a couple of bonus), every single one has something which makes it distinctive (including a mission with no killing, whose objective is to steal enemy documents).\nCampaing progress menu, possiblility to replay a particular mission.\nBonus objective, and item collections which unlock bonus missions.\nCommandos 2 introduced amazing (for its time 2001) interaction with the environment including:\ndaytime / night time (only one mission),\nswitch off the lights to hide in shadow,\nfrost (limited time to stay outside buildings, one mission only),\nsearch the shelves and boxes for equipment,\nenter and expore buildings,\nget into the building through the door or windows,\nsniper shot through the window,\nclimb a pole to move unnoticed,\nhide corpses in a pile of thrash,\nhide yourself under the table.\nThe game still offers quick save + load, still used quite frequently.\nWhile it is a war game most of enemies can be stuned and knocked out without killing.\nOn top of that the missions are scored based on time taken, damage, exploration and stealth level, including mentioned nonlethal takedowns.\n\nThe game is almost 15 year old, and offers a maximum resolution of 1024 x 768, but on my 17'' notebook I find the video surprisingly good, mainly due to reasonable amount of details and limited 'graphical pattern reuse'.\nThe music is finally present in the game and sound effect seem also fine, don't distract a lot.\n\nFlaws?\nlow-to-medium difficulty level (even "very hard" difficulty is a mid-game of Commandos 1),\nThe boxed Commandos 2 version featured short cienematics between the missions, which don't run in Steam version,\nI cannot tell if this is a common problem or just a config / codecs issue on my computer,\nWhen scaled to 16:9 display, the graphics gets a bit pixelized.\nDo not play if:\nyou are allergic to old games / hybrids / isometric cameras.\n\nDo play if:\nwell... just play!","May 10, 2015","true","24.5"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","58","63","2","6"

In the aspect of today gaming stand point. This game is brutaly hard and unforgiving for any small errors that you can messed up with.\n\nIt's a ww2 squad-based strategy that treat player like a man. No hand holding. No tutorial (actually it has, but they look more like exams before let you to the real mission). You have to learn how to survive by reading manual and tooltips. If you can't learn to use hotkeys at least. you will ended up pressing quick save and quick load the most.\n\nIf you are new to this series you will die a lot , but at the same time you will see that enemies will leave that small window of oppatunity open for you as a smart guideline to encourage you to try new approch tactics. As for the result , every guard you knockdown , every enemies you have killed , every thievery or sneaks you can pull off will feel so much rewarding.\n\nOne more thing i have to say is this game has exceptional fantastic soundtracks. some may say these tracks sound a little too hype to be in this kind of game that you have to take your time. But they did make you want to come back and kick more nazi's ♥♥♥.\n\nIf you are looking for a classic and a challenging experiance then buy it. this sums up all the meaning of good old classic pc games.","December 2, 2013","true","14.9"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","34","36","0","0"

Different tactical approaches are available via the lots of items that can be found around the map. Needs some brain-work even on the lowest difficulty. The team is well established, every mate has its unique style. Gameplay design is great, there is not much to be desired, most of the things work flawlessly. Save system is very user friendly, as you can save your state whenever and wherever you want. The pre-rendered graphics are still looking good. Resolution can be easily modded without braking the visuals.\n\nBad:\nEasier, sometimes a little bit duller gameplay compared to the previous titles. Some glitches and weird stuff due to the rendering style.\n\nOverall, the second Commandos is not as hardcore as the previous installments of the series, but instead lets you deal with things the way you want. Its presentation and ideas are making it a must have even after many years.\n\nMy Opinion:\nOVERALL: 8.5/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSound: 8/10\nReplay Value: 9/10","November 21, 2014","true","7.4"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","26","26","0","0"

This game is surely the best around. I've played Comandos: Men of Courage countless of times and everytime its like first time. Love the intro's in beginning of each mission, the story telling takes you deeper in history...\nThis game by far is the first in list of my favorite games! Pyro studio surely did made a masterpiece, i only wish that more people have played this and i would like to try it online as i never had an opportunity to play against someone.\n\nKeep aware though, for newbies this game might be too complicated, but for the ww2 type based game lovers it will just take a couple of minutes to find out how to control all the characters given in Comandos. The game can either be played peacefully or aggressively, so sometimes it just depends what mission you are on to. Most likely nearly all missions can be played peacefully (undetected by enemy soldiers) and therefore playing this way can get you very high in ranks.\nI really liked the many ways how to take out Nazi soldiers, you could either hit, tie and gag, or knife from behind, cut throat behind, shoot, hit, burry (trap), make them walk over booby-traps, poison, use throwing knifes, molotov, grenade them or just tie up and drown soldiers in water. The game gives you many possibilities of how to complete certain missions. I've also learned that in most cases ignoring some of the side missions, like defusing water mines can be fatal after completing the main for example.\nBy far the most favorite of all missions were the bonus missions you get for completing secret pictures, this is where you test your commanding abilities and strategy the most.\n\nSo i suggest you try Comandos: Men of Courage, this game will get you addicted fast, but most importantly enjoy the game any way you want.\n\nps. the most fun you can have is tie and gag all soldiers on map, then take a drive in car, truck or tank and run the over  just for the lols. +If you tie Japanese soldier in burma, throw him near crocodile view range and see what happens haha!\n\nGoodluck and Have Fun!","August 26, 2014","true","64.1"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","26","27","2","2"

Well then, Commandos 2 is the answer you would be looking for.\n\nThis game is able to capture that epic feel of being an elite commando, not one, not two, but eight. In a variety of missions all around the world, taking on the Japanese Empire in Asia and the Nazi Forces in Europe. This wide variety of missions are all housed on massive maps, with plenty of ways to tactically go through. As well, each map has bonus content hidden in each one, which unlocks even more maps for the astute players. The level variety, and enemy variety are amazing, with tactics unlimited, as well the music is sublime, unique to each level, and keeps the tone and gravity of the high stakes game of warfightering.\n\nThe commandos themselves are a particularly interesting note to mention in the game. Out of all of them, there is only one American character, which is a nice deviance from the typical video game standard of making every character in WWII an American. The commonwealth is strongly recommended, france has their own few commandos, and even the USSR is represented. All together, the human interaction, and true comradery between these "Men of Courage" brings out their grin worthy character and qualities. Its that feeling that its more than just a game with pixels, that this is high stakes, that the world is there to be saved by you, and you alone.\n\nThis is why the game can be appropriately recommended, because it simply is excellent. It doesnt hold your hand, its not gonna treat you nicely sometimes, but it manages to not matter. You keep pushing, you keep trying, you keep reloading. You need to, do you know why? Because the world is at stake, and you are the only one to save it, now get out there soldier, and kill me some Schutzstaffel.","December 21, 2013","true","54.5"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","30","34","0","4"

Graphics are still looking decent, playability is good, variaty is great, missions even better. Only flaw is that the AI isn't that good, compared to same era game Desperados. Fooling the AI is made too easy and so the game is pretty easy too. Single pack of cigarettes is the key to most situations and when officer is available everything becomes even easier. Comparing to the first installement, this is far more approachable game and the learning curve isn't that steep. There are multiple solutions to most situations, although the cigarette & officer is the way to go in most situations.\n\nThought the game is easy, it also takes considerable time to complete (22 hours for full playthrough on my 4th time). Steam sales has the game costing only 80 cents, so it's worth a try if you like to try it. I already had it on my shelf as a hard copy, but thought this could be fun to play sometimes when the hard copy isn't available.\n\nAlthough the version is 1.2. there are still some annoying things in inventory that one needs to learn before making mistakes, although since the game is easy, most items are not needed at all. Resolution is maxed at 1024x768 so beware if you like widescreen. Not sure if there's a fix for this.\n\nT/S+M1+Q+M1+Shift M1 + shift M1 + M1.

The levels have a more cinematic feel to them, thanks to replacing the short briefings with dialogues, and also adding small arcing plots.\n\nThe general goal of the game remained: sabotage Nazi and Japanese forces, which can mean anything from blowing up a submarine to saving some POWs.\nTo achieve this, you are usually required to get rid of all enemy soldiers on the map – mostly by stealth, but some segments require combat, and in some cases you even need to fend off invading forces. The latter ones don’t really fit into the game though, as they are more of a repetitive memory game that gets pretty boring pretty fast.\n\nThe commandos themselves received an overhaul. Everyone retained their unique abilities, but basic actions like driving, knocking out enemies, and carrying bodies can be done by anyone.\nThis was a double-edged sword. Many situations require team coordination, but this coordination mostly means throwing two packs of cigarettes to the floor and quickly hitting two soldiers on the head. This trick works for the majority of the game, leaving gameplay quite repetitive, especially when you need to do this on more than a hundred enemies.\n\nIf you can live with this repetitive nature, the great map design will more than make up for it, giving you a memorable and quite long game for very little money.","July 24, 2015","true","38.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","13","14","3","0"

In general, it is pretty hard and unforgiving, but with trial and error, you will slowly get better at it.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty decent and intuitive (better read those ingame manuals) and you generally want to keep all your commandos alive to strive in the game. It actually has an option to set up multiple cameras at a time, how anyone can actively keep track of more than 2 cameras at once, I don't know. The game heavily relys on you memorizing at least some hotkeys, because a bunch of the time it requires fast thinking and acting, so if you rely on using the mouse for things like items and weapons too much, you'll find your characters full of lead.\n\nOne of the most notable things about the game is the soundtrack, it is just plain awesome and upbeat.\n\nIt's definitely the best of the series, if you want to try ANY of the Commandos games, you should try this one first.","December 20, 2013","true","6.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Haven't played 3 yet but I can say that 2 is much better than 1. You control a selection of soldiers each with their own personality, abilities and traits. Each level is sort of a sandbox with lots of hidden weapons and utilities you can use to complete your objectives. The objectives are all very clearly defined with lots of maps and pictures in your intelligence folders along with the documentation of each tactic, ability and item in the game simply at the press of a button. I would recommend learning the hotkeys and to quicksave a lot, but make sure you don't do it the second you get shot at, as you might regret that.\n\nThe graphics are holding up very well since most of the levels is 2D with lots of detail. 3D models are small enough to not notice the limited polycount.\n\nThe program itself is clearly dated though as you can only use 4:3 resolutions, and you can only change the in game resolution (every time you hit ESC or watch a cutscene your res will change to the menu resolution for the time, then back again which is a pain with windowed mode since it always resets the position of the window). Check the pc gaming wiki on how to enable window mode (it is a simple cfg tweak, disables mouse scroll sadly). Be careful with the window mode as the game can and will crash 8/10 times you click outside of the game. Other than this it runs fine on W10 x64 without any compatibility issues.\n\nHaven't tested co-op yet but I assume it will work fine through a LAN, as all of these older games do without any problems.\n\n","December 3, 2015","true","5.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I personally played the previous two on a 98 before playing this one. This is a RTS that requires patience and skill. C2 expands on the previous two by adding more abilities, enemies, and mechanics. I especially like the in-game manual that explains everything you need to know. For others, this game won't work at first; for me, it worked straight out of the virtual box on my Windows 7 32-bit. The gameplay is a little bit challenging, but it is mangeable. I would recommend Commandos 2: Destination Paris because it adds in 118 missions amidst its heavy overhaul of mechanics, weapons, and other things! This mod plus the game itself make it a must buy. I also recommend the other games in the series.

You're given a small team of units, each with unique and VERY limited abilities, with which you must infiltrate fairly large areas and complete objectives. Getting spotted with most characters means death/KO due to low health, and since everyone's usually needed for the plan to succeed, that means you restart the stage.\n\nWinning requires first just not moving an inch, watching the enemies patrol the entire map, and figuring out where to start. This can take a while but Commandos 2 at least has a few guys for whom you can decide "screw THIS," set off an alarm, and just MURDER EVERY NAZI AND JAPANESE YOU SEE. But at its core, this is a game about distractions, disguises, traps, & silent kills or KOs. It's The Great Escape, not Saving Private Ryan.","July 13, 2012","true",""," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Gratefully all of the commandos from the first game return, charming as ever, including a few extra faces. This goes way beyond point-and-click stealth - The game requires a lot of patience, careful planning and studying of enemy movements. For 10 missions (not counting bonus ones), there's a huge amount to do - so expect to divulge many hours into this... it's a beast!\n\nThere's a ton of new features and abilities too - including completely revamped graphics and a superb soundtrack, the biggie is that you can now enter (and operate) within buildings - bringing huge levels of new scope to the missions. Each Commando also now has an 'inventory' and can carry / exchange any item (even if they cannot necessarily use them) and there's much more this time around in terms of raiding boxes / cabinets for useful items or pinching them off some guards\n\nThe missions bring with them an exceptional variety too. Amongst the sneak-and-kill we're used to, the first night mission forces you to play without any killing. Another leaves you with just one Commando having to set free the rest of your companions, held captive in several different houses. You also get a number of 'defence' scenarios where you have to place your guys and a handful of friendly soldiers to defend against an attack force. It's varied and brings refreshing new elements to an already formidable game\n\nI have two small gripes though. The first is that, compared to the original, it's not as difficult where you no longer have garrisons. Previously, patrols would start swarming the place if you set off the alarm - here, the consequence is less fatal. That's not to say the guards are any less dangerous, but you can sometimes ragequit a situation with a few well-aimed shots or explosives if you get fed up. The 'rooms' tend not to interact with each other much, so it splits up the levels into smaller easier-to-manage chunks\n\nThe second... Spike the rat (and a castaway with a trumpet). Come on... a specially trained rat that does backflips to distract enemy soldiers? You can get infinite uses, send it through doors and it pretty much distracts nearly any group... Talk about overpowered. It removed a lot of the challenge - not to mention being quite ridiculous\n\nTruth be told though, that's nit-picking. It's an otherwise exceptional title which successfully manages to retain much of what made the first so ground-breaking, whilst valiantly bringing in a cavalcade of new features and dynamics. Superb work","January 4, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I played this about 14 years ago when it first came out and I am amazed that it works flawlessly with today’s hardware and OS. I’m playing it now on Windows 8.1 64-bit on my GTX 970 on a widescreen monitor and it runs like a charm. I need to mention those specifications because I read a few users having problems with those setup. Sure, the graphics are outdated but it’s the same good old Commandos game I enjoyed when I was a kid-hard but rewarding.\n\nThis game is one of the best of its kind. It’s worth every penny.\n\n9/10\n","March 24, 2015","true","6.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

If you like an hard game, this is the best you can find!\n\nThis game is WWII related and you have the control of a squad of commandos made by 8 characters. Each man has unique abilities and weapons (for example, the Sapper is the only man who can use explosives).\nThe game's charm is in figuring out enemy's patterns, you have to observe the environment, planning all the tactics for knock out the enemies and don't alert nobody. The game is full of commands and hard to learn all of them, but when you learn the useful ones (like Q for the fist or A for the main attack of the character, for example) it get's easier. A single error can ruin the whole mission and drop your rating in the end of the level.\nThere are 10 levels + 2 training levels, but you can unlock other 9 bonus missions if you take all the "bonus pages" in any main level and you complete a photo with these parts.\n\nI highly suggest to play this game! During the sales you can take the whole series at 2€ only!\nI don't know if this games works in the newest OS, but in Windows XP works fine!","September 30, 2014","true","38.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

So basicly the plot is about a group of allied commando unit fighting axis in WW2. The mission ranges to sabotaging a submarine pen, blowing a bridge, rescuing VIP in a middle of warzone, and so on. You can also pick up items that can help with the mission, like finding bombs, guns, medkits, and such, thus giving it a bit of a RPG element.\n\nThe gameplay really good, if you ever met with trouble like a soldier that always looking at the entrance to a door that leads to your mission goal, the door is in his line of sight and if you get in his line of sight he will alert the other soldier, you can kill him but the other soldier has his line of sight on the soldier that you need to kill, thus rendering frontal attack useless. So how do you get pass him? The game provide many ways to do it, you can command your commando to disguise as the enemy and get him to provide distraction by talking to the other soldier, and then you command your other unit to attack the soldier that watching the door, or you can throw a cigerattes to distract the soldier out of the other soldier line of sight thus allowing you to attack him, or maybe there's another way to the mission goal and you should look for another way in.\n\nThe music is also really good, there's nothing else that i can say about the music. It's excellent.\n\nGrapich wise it's still good for an old game, though sometimes the background blends with certain object, thus making it hard too click on that object. (The ladder on the top of the tower that located near the fueltanks in mission 3 kinda blends to the background making it hard too click) But nonetheless it's not a really big deal.\n\nThis game is a real recommend for those strategy games fans.\n\n"Herr commandant, It's not our fault that we suddenly get gagged and tied.

The game, while still maintaining the long mission length, somehow manages to be easier than Commandos 1.  There is more leeway for mistakes and as result Commandos 2 is less masochistic than its predecessor. That doesn’t mean this game will be easy on beginners though, in fact the tutorial and first few mission should hurt your ego if you think this game will be a cake walk. The graphic, sound effects and musical score are all very nice and varied. However, the game severely fails when it comes to clarity of objectives and pathetically easy enemy takedown patterns. In some missions the objectives are borderline invisible, so you may have killed all the enemies on the map, but if you can’t find the one specific npc, you will never leave the map. Overall a good entry level and modern commandos game, imo the best of the series regardless of a few negatives.","June 3, 2012","true","45.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

(win 8.1 64bit)\n\nI played the first installment of the series long time ago and somehow it seems superior... I had issues to finish the tutorial, as the game does not show you all the options available to you. If you don't google it, you don't know how to:\n- tie up the enemies (only the big guy can do that)\n- carry the enemies (you need to tie them up first)\n- go up the posts... (use shift)\n\nI finally passed the first tutorial, then on the second one - pure sillyness. Friendly squad pinned down by enemy fire and Nazis running around - everybody is waiting for you to punch all the Nazis unconcious... Just so you know - punching is more silent than knives...\n\nIt's probably an awesome game, but it's very hard to get familiar with it. As far as I remember, the first game was much more user friendly... I miss having all the portraits on the screen and all the available actions clearly presented to me.\n\nMaybe I will give it a try some other time,","March 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I bought this game so that i would have a low requirement game to play on my netbook just to pass some time. the netbook doesnt have the hardware to handle modern games and is mostly used for simple tasks like watching videos online or word processing, spreadsheet, paying bills etc...  When i first installed the game it wouldn't even run I had to go to the microsoft website and download an old plugin for DX8 called "direct play" even after that it still crashed twice before I finally had to restart my system then after restart the game finally decided to run. Then after all that i start the training mission to learn how to play and there is no help dialogue no tooltips nothing!! I spent 20 minutes just figuring out how to control my players and shoot enemy soldiers or use items, that is when the inventory menus don't glitch and prevent you from picking up items or randomly open info sheets about the items when im just trying to pick them up before I get shot. This game could be fun but with the horrible controls and interface it is almost unplayable and certainly not enjoyable.

Doesn't look very demanding.\nSo then I install, it asks to install some stupid **** for windows. I'm thinking, this should only take a second. It asks to restart. An hour later it finaly hits 100%, the problem is that it stays that way. "Working on features 100%" it says.  I wait, it hangs, I wait, it hangs.. I say **** this. From there took me about an hour of hard resets and troule shooting before I decided to do a system restore. Lost all my downloads, and work files since last night. Conclusion: I spent about 3 agitating, annoying, angry hours of my life due to this game and didn't even get to play it. This game is not meant for the Windows 8.1. I didn't get any work done either. Not to mention the hours I will spend downloading all those games again and doing the work I lost. **** you game! so so much!\n\nThat's my .79 cents.","January 20, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Actually I played Commandos 2 on PS2 a lot, and I'm surprised when this game appeared on Steam Sale. The previous series are suck, trust me, after playing Commandos 2 you will say the exact same thing.\n\nCommandos 2 is a strategy game where you command 2 or more commandos (the team) to infiltrate enemy base or sneak behind enemy lines to ruin their plan. The game took place on WWII that means you'll face the infamous nazis and japanese. To score a mission you'll need to play the game flawlessly, and that means avoid being detected at all times especially on Hard level.\n\nYou can knock an enemy unsonscious, tie them up, and throm them over the water or you can just stab them with Green Berret's knife to kill them silently. Don't wander around too much and make sure don't run like a crazy person because enemies will notice. You can also command Spy or Natasha to sneak pass the enemy ranks to steal some information, items or even you can just kill them with your commandos.\n\nOverall, this is a great game. The graphics? Well, not much to say, it's not that great but I think this game has a great gameplay that you won't regret buying it. Haven't try the Commandos 3 yet but I heard the fans rather dissapointed and prefer the Commandos 2 over it.","June 27, 2014","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actually I played Commandos 2 on PS2 a lot, and I'm surprised when this game appeared on Steam Sale. The previous series are suck, trust me, after playing Commandos 2 you will say the exact same thing.\n\nCommandos 2 is a strategy game where you command 2 or more commandos (the team) to infiltrate enemy base or sneak behind enemy lines to ruin their plan. The game took place on WWII that means you'll face the infamous nazis and japanese. To score a mission you'll need to play the game flawlessly, and that means avoid being detected at all times especially on Hard level.\n\nYou can knock an enemy unsonscious, tie them up, and throm them over the water or you can just stab them with Green Berret's knife to kill them silently. Don't wander around too much and make sure don't run like a crazy person because enemies will notice. You can also command Spy or Natasha to sneak pass the enemy ranks to steal some information, items or even you can just kill them with your commandos.\n\nOverall, this is a great game. The graphics? Well, not much to say, it's not that great but I think this game has a great gameplay that you won't regret buying it. Haven't try the Commandos 3 yet but I heard the fans rather dissapointed and prefer the Commandos 2 over it.","June 27, 2014","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I personally think it has aged well, with its artstyle the low resolution doesn't hurt eyes too much, the soundtrack is amazing (my personal favorite), gameplay is basically perfect. Things I would give for a good new Commandos release...\n\nBasically there are 2 training missions, 10 lengthy regular missions and 10 bonus missions that require you to gather collectibles to unlock. Every mission features a selection of commandos with different abilities (though let's be honest, some are way more powerful than others, but even the most "useless" ones have their moments). As I mentioned the missions are lengthy, complex, varied, taking you to Europe and Asia. There are multiple approaches possible for every mission - it's essentially whatever you're gonna think up, the levels aren't linear at all. There are 3 difficulty levels, easiest one lets you revive fallen commandos with medkit. Harder skill levels make you unable to do so and also add other difficulties (e.g. rifle rate of fire is much slower) and place new enemies.\n\nAnyway it's a great game that has plenty of replayability (I completed it tens of times). It also has working multiplayer, so if you have a friend willing to play with you - go for it. Everything gets goofier, possibly harder, but infinitely more fun. Just remember to get some voice chat because ingame one is bad.","September 14, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
