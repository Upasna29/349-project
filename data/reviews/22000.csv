Even those who don't understand physics or the construction process will get a handle on this because the ability to connect the balls together is so intuitive.

The game runs from very simple to absolutely difficult, and near the end you'll find yourself restarting levels many times in order to successfully finish them.  There are some special achievement like building a bridge with only so many balls that add more complexities to the game that I really enjoyed.

Strong recommendation.\n\nIf you just play through the game you wont be getting very many achievement from this game as most of them are tied to the games OCD flags which are a more challenging way of beating all the levels in the game.

The graphics looks really cute, even though, minimalistic, the sound, the sound is a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece, the very best original soundtrack I've heard in my life, every track if filled up with emotions, the author of these (Kyle Gabler) did a great job.\n\nThe physics of this game is yet another thing. This is  A THING. As you're supposed to build in this game, the main role physics does play. It is just plain immaculate, you won't get disappointed. Yeah, for kids who haven't studied it yet it might be pretty difficult, but if you got some knowledge in that, you can beat it. But, again, you'll have to think.\n\nThe  whole story looks pretty simple at first: balls sucked by a pipe, wow. But the deeper you dig in the game, the greater the actual plot is, it is full of allegories, metaphors and what not.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/22000/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nWorld of Goo is an Indie-Physics-Puzzle Game developed in 2008 by 2D BOY. World of Goo is one of those quaint games that you would probably prefer to play on a mobile or smaller electronic device (with touch screen capabilities); in World of Goo you create bizarre contraptions with Goo to get to the end of the level.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You progress through the game being guided by "Signs" (or the "sign painter". But I always thought the signs were the side painter), you'll want to read every single sign in the game because they are quite humorous. The game is broken down into Five chapters, and each chapter would usually have 10-12 levels within the chapter.\n\nGame Play: Being a puzzle game, you need to spend a fair amount of time thinking, and once you get into the farther difficult levels, at times you'll need to restart the whole level because of one mistake. There is a requirement of how many "Goo Balls" you need to save at the end of each level to pass. So that means you can't use all your Goo on construction, you need to be as minimalistic as possible in your building.\nThe game starts out very easily and simple, but quickly gets complex and difficult. To construct, you click and drag a Goo Ball to a certain location near the starting structure to "add" to that structure. Generally after using that Goo you cannot reuse it... but some Goo has special properties that lets you reuse them, or have other special effects.\n\nAchievements: World of Goo has 8 Steam Achievements, all of which are pretty rough to obtain. (They went with Quality, not quantity) I only have 2 of those achievements at this time, most of them require perfect scores on each level... Getting all of the achievements will require a great deal of determination.\n\nPrice: World of Goo is priced at $9.99, I spent 6 hours playing through the game once. So for me that's not a fair price.... However, I picked up the game on a 90% off sale, so I've actually gotten my monies worth, and then some.\n\nConclusion: I recommend this game to people who enjoy puzzle and/or indie games, World of Goo was a very fun play through, and it only took one afternoon to get through it, so it's a nice quaint little play through. Depending on how good you are at puzzle games World of Goo does get pretty tough at times.","May 25, 2015","true","6.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/recommended/22000/","gamehoard","Jeremy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/","173 products in account","To hear the full review, listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]\n\nGameplay\n\nWorld of Goo is a 2D physics-based puzzler with gameplay that revolves around building structures out of "goo balls" in order to reach a pipe at the end of stage. While this is a relatively simple set up for a puzzle game, the way in which the developers build upon it and create puzzle is ingenious. There are constantly new elements being introduced, from goo balls that can be detached or float, to environmental obstacles that may interact differently with different types of goo.\n\nGoing along with this, the challenges vary greatly. While the end goal is always the same, the level design means that different levels require totally different strategies. One level may require you to build the tallest tower you can while another may require you to build a small mobile structure while avoiding saws or fire. Another may have you selectively sacrifice some of your goo. This combination of different elements and challenges means that the game never once gets stale or boring. Each level feels wholly unique and the steady progression of difficulty and complexity is finely tuned. I found myself playing World of Goo for much longer sessions than I set out to. One important aspect of this is "time bugs" which allow you to go back in time by just a single goo ball placement. This means that you don't have to restart a whole level every time your structure fails and keeps the game from ever getting frustrating.\n\nGraphics\n\nWorld of Goo is a real joy to look at. The game a sort of off-kilter cute but twisted look that is not unlike something in a Tim Burton film. It's a unique aesthetic that I personally enjoyed.\n\nMore importantly, the visuals inform the gameplay in important ways. All gooballs and obstacles look very distinct and little details give you clues about your environment, like leaves blowing around giving you an idea of the wind speed and its effect on your structure. The result is a game that is very easy to understand and interpret, allowing you to simply focus on the task at hand.\n\nSound Design\n\nIn a word: excellent. The game features a variety of different tracks with some pretty great orchestral scores. I found that this music really set the tone of each level and left me feeling surprisingly exhilarated for as methodical as the gameplay actually is.\n\nThe sound effects are also great, with many sounds that are simultaneously cute, funny, and gross.\n\nStory\n\nThe story of World of Goo is very vague and centers around the world-dominating World of Goo Corporation which harvest gooballs to make a variety of products. While it's never clear exactly what is going on, the story goes through themes of oppression, environmentalism, vanity, rebellion, etc. in an effective way. It exists more to evoke a certain emotion than tell a compelling narrative and, when combined with the music and visuals, is very effective in that.\n\nOverall\n\nEvery aspect of World of Goo works and, more importantly, they all work perfectly together. It's a near perfect example of an indie game and there is good reason for it to be considered a classic. If for some reason you haven't played World of Goo, I whole-heartedly recommend it.","May 9","true","8.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It shines very brightly, and is a must-play for any indie game enthusiast (I have many many hours in this game, just not on Steam).\n\nEssentially, the goal is to build architecturally-sound structures to bridge gaps. Its like a wild version of Bridge Simulator. The building mechanics are really fun, but arguably the best part of this game is the artwork and definately the storyline.  While the story is quite abstract, but absolutely emotionally engaging.\n\nThe only negative I can really mention is that the game can feel a bit dated, at this point. I loaded it up this year and all the charm is still there, but the graphics and controls have not aged all that well. Regardless, its a classic.","March 18","true","0.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","13","14","3","0"

My attention was focused on this game the whole time.\n\nIt's one of those games where it seems extremely simple at first, but then the complexities and depth of it gradually shine through. The puzzles are neat, and I never had to use any skips until the last part (and I normally sucka t puzzles) but they don't feel easy, they feel satisfying regardless.\n\nThe visuals are nice, and they're crisp and good looking, and most importantly they do NOT resort to trying to look like pixel art. However, the game does run at a low resolution and there is no way to change it.\n\nThe soundtrack... Well, let's just say it's one of the best soundtracks in an Indie game ever produced. It is well performed, it is entirely originally composed, and it doesn't resort to sounding like chiptune or 16-bit stuff to try and manipulate nostalgic nerves. One of the best parts of the game for certain, and even better is that all of the soundtrack (the full versions, not the shortened versions in the game) can be found right on Youtube. Very memorable soundtrack, I can say that about very very few games.\n\nBuy it? YES!

Either way telling the story through painted signs is kind of dumb. I think a narrator would have fit the game better.\n\nThe art design is lame to me, but some people might enjoy its jaggedness because it fits the story.\n\nThe game physics were very well developed for such a small development team.\n\nThe majority of the puzzles were challenging and manageable, but there were a few puzzles that were so hard that I honestly couldn't see anyone getting through them without using a YouTube guide.\n\nNo replay value whatsoever unless you're an achievement hunter.\n\nThe World of Goo corporation tower game isn't very enjoyable, it's really just a boring mini-game.\n\nI would recommend getting this game if it's on sale for $5 or less.\n\nThe game automatically adjusts to a 800 X 600 screen resolution. If you decide to run it full screen , you have to manually override the config.txt file (There's a guide on the World of Goo steam page).\n\nOverall it's a 7.5/10\n","June 17, 2014","true","9.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

World of Goo features great puzzles, unique gameplay, creative level design, cool graphics, and outstanding music. What's not to like???

Very few games I've played have an atmosphere anywhere near as immersive as it. I never thought I would get immersed in a simple physics puzzle game, but I did. The art style is interesting, quirky, and somewhat dark. I played the game years ago on PC, but I picked it up again recently simply because I had the soundtrack stuck in my head. Kyle Gabler has composed an amazing set of songs for this game. In my opinion, it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a game. On the gameplay front, World of Goo is a solid physics puzzle game that treads the fine line between too easy and too frustrating.

It uses 4:3 ratio and probably 1024x768 res.\n\nThere are few levels per world (12 in the first one) and there are 5 worlds. There is also a world, where you are supposed to build as highest tower of goo as possible with a limited supply of goo. You get more goo by completing regular levels. You can see other people trying in the last world ( you can see their tower's height in there ).\n\nThere are profiles in this game (up to 3).

Just when you think that you might have done 2 or 3 similar levels, the game introduces a new mechanic through a new type of Goo Ball or some other challenge that keeps it refreshing and interesting.\n\nAbsolutely fabulous. One of those games where you'll find yourself racing back to thinking "Hang on.. what if instead of that, I try this instead...." - the satisfaction is immense.\n\nThe OCDs are well done as well.

The physics of the goo balls can be tricky to manage, but that just adds to the fun.\n\nThis requires a mouse or touch device to operate. I managed to get it to work very well with a mouse, but I imagine it would also work well if you have some sort of tablet that can play this game.\n\nThe look and feel of this game is great. Making use of 2D graphics, but it definitely does not feel "flat".\n\nThe soundtrack to this game is almost too good. Dramatic when it needs to be, more subtle when that is required. Amazing stuff.\n\nThis game has leaderboards, so if you want an extra challenge you can try and beat them.\n\nI found no bugs while playing, but there was an easy to use .config file that I needed to edit to get a custom screen resolution. If you find this issue, just look into the game forums, the instructions make perfect sense.\n\nWorth a play if you like drag and drop puzzle or 2d sandbox type games.","May 24, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The normal missions consist of stacking the gooballs in various shapes (such as bridges and towers) to reach your goal.\n\nHowever, for completionists world of goo's novelty begins to rot very quickly. With every level, included is an OCD, which is the game's way of saying EXTRA GOAL. This usually consists of saving more gooballs or doing something extra. The OCD system is ridiculous. It is so difficult, it isn't even funny. This is one of the times where you're actually happy to skip past 100% and get on with the game because it is so unforgiving.\n\nIn short, world of goo is a fun casual game that is plagued by complex and ridiculous puzzles for the attentive and curious ones.

The only dissatisfaction about this game is that there is no story, each chapter in this game gives a weird and little about the story. You go from watching ballons carry goo to the clouds, watch the world turn 3D (it doesnt really turn 3D its still 2D) and the world literally covered in the end with goo.\nWorld of Goo is a puzzle game which you must use a certain amount of goo given to you. However, not every goo is the same for example, green goo allows you to take it out again and put it somewhere else compared to black goo which is stuck forever.\nIf your the type of person to get 100% on this game well good luck cause every level has an extremly hard OCD to beat. It might either be to use a certain amount of goo, how many moves you must do or the most terrifying thing in any video game, TIME TRIALS. There is an interesting thing in the game where if you make a wrong move, a time bug will appear on your screen, in my opinion is perfect for any new gamers however they wont appear until you 1st stick goo together. 1 last thing is if you cant beat a level, you can literally skip it but theres 2 ways if you wanna get it back, beat the level that you skipped or beat the chapter to get 3 skip buttons.\nI give this game 7/10 because the story isnt good but the gameplay is great yet hard. I recommend this game to hardcore gamers. This game is not meant for new gamers.","May 21, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The concept is extremely simple, you drag goo balls to create structures that must reach the exit pipe. But if you think it's repetitive and that it takes pretty much the same in each level, you're wrong. The game will surprise you. Levels differ a lot and each of them brings something fresh. In general very innovative and smart game, brilliant in its simplicity.

On my Windows 8 multiple monitor setup the game had no options to select which monitor and caused all displays to blank for several tens of seconds during start. There appeared to be no way to shut the game down, or else the shutdown took several minutes and I gave up waiting.  A clear display showing the progress of launch and shutdown is required. My processor is an Intel i7 with an nVidia GEFORCE 710M, memory of 3.6 Gigabytes and the game did not exhaust any of the PC resources (memory, disk bus traffic, network, processor and graphics all Ok). Mouse sensitivity and acceleration (I set mine to none) were all correct.

It's got a lot of puzzle variety and a pretty good amount of content. But it's so bare bones in certain areas that I was absolutely convinced it was a poorly done mobile port until somebody corrected me.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Dispite being a PC game first, it has no options menu of any kind, you can't correct the resolution, change the graphics (though I doubt you would need to) or even do something as simple as change the game volume. Distinguishing between the balls must be hell if you're colorblind, a menu option for that would have been really helpful for a lot of people. It does not lock the mouse to one screen if you have multiple monitors, but still requires that you move your mouse to the edge of the screen in order to pan the camera. It has no keyboard controls, even though it could have direly used some, such as the ablity to pan the camera with the arrow keys which would have delt with the mouse not locking issue, and a key for undo which would remove the need to click those stupid bugs (or more often, accidentally click one when you're trying to do a quick action).\n\nDid I like it? I kept playing through the problems and beat it, so yeah I must have liked it dispite its problems. At the same time, would I recommend it? no, especially not at the normal $10 price tag. I found the missing features made it feel very unpolished and at the price point there are a lot of better games.

The lack of video and sound control is an obvious inconvenience, but the flaws in gameplay are more worrisome. It's far too easy to accidentally place or drop a goo and far too hard to grab goos of a specific color in more complex puzzles. Fixing these shortcomings with keyboard commands (eg.

No zoom, mouse to edges to move camera, and inconsistent connections (but that last one is probably just me being bad). These simple things, at least the first two problems, make the game an unnecessary struggle. It just seems lazy that they left the controls so poor. It also seems to have problem with multi-monitors (or maybe monitor resolution) but that can be fixed by modifying the config file’s resolution settings in the install location. I enjoyed it well enough on mobile so if you really want to play it you should get the mobile version rather than this version.\n\nControls Cont:\nIf you are just reading this with no other context these problems may not seem that bad to you so I'll try to give you some insight. Some levels are just too zoomed in. You only get to see a small part of the screen at a time which means you have to move around and sometimes place goo at the same time. If you could move the camera with the keyboard then this might not be so bad but to move the camera you have to move your mouse to the edge of the screen. This means you can no longer place goo (unless the goo you are placing happen to also be on the edge of the screen you are scrolling with).","December 17, 2015","false","1.8"," 4 of 20 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","4","20","0","0"

Unfortunately, it suffers from a difficulty curve based only on how time consuming and frustrating certain levels are.  Most of the challenges rely on either counter-intuitive presentation (e.g. requiring the player to fling goo balls into an area that claims to be dangerous but isn't) or making the player guess what the physics will decide to do next.  The interface is mostly just dragging goo balls where you want them, but many of the levels require dragging specific goo balls quickly, which is often impossible to do because of the game not selecting the right one if there's any overlap.  This issue is then made worse by only certain goo balls being removable after placing them (which the player has to figure out themselves) as well as by the only way of reversing a move being to click on the little bugs that pop up for no explained or intuitive reason twice.  Not once, twice.  If you only click on one reversal bug, the game almost always reverts back to the most inconvenient possible situation.\n\nThe two biggest things I took away from this game was a deep sense of boredom and the feeling that the makers don't understand how an object's center of gravity works.  Even the constantly moving goo balls do not explain those bizarre weight mechanics work","June 26, 2014","false","5.2"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","7","27","0","0"

I'm guessing there's probably a way to edit the config files, but it reeks of laziness and honestly looks like ♥♥♥♥ on a 1080p display. Do they even make monitors with a 800x600 native resolution any more? I also couldn't find an option for a windowed mode, which while not ideal, would have at least let me view it without stretching every thing. If I had wanted to run games at smaller resolutions than my monitor natively supports, I would have stuck with an integrated GPU instead of dropping $300 on a video card.\n\nI guess it's worth the .99 I paid for it, but I'd be furious if I payed full price for what seems like a half-♥♥♥ PC port.

I personally got bored with it.\n\nPros: There is a lot of variety that the game offers. You will have to face each challenge the game hands out to you in a unique way. Your goal is to get all your blobs safely to the end of the level. The problem is as you use your blobs, some need to be sacrificed in order to save the rest. It all happens in real time. So if you have built a tower and begins to fall over, you have to quickly do something to save it. It can be challenging, especially if you want to reach the OCD award for completing a level. Which the award is given if you saved (almost) all blobs at the end of the level.\n\nCons: I got bored of it. Even though it has much to offer, it still felt kinda slow . Rather than asking the player what their knowledge of gaming is. It takes you by the hand and shows you every step of the way of how to finish the levels. It feels like a fancy iphone app that got ported to the PC.\n\nI got this game in a Humble Bundle. I wouldn't spend money on it anyways.

There's very little I can say about it that's bad, mostly just that I didn't really personally enjoy it.\nThat being said, the one negative aspect this game does have is that there is a good degree of tedium involved. Some levels are painfully slow or repetitive, but not too many in the end. The level design is diverse, almost to the degree of being too much so as some ideas don't feel fully developed before the game ends. The graphics and music are wonderful and the story and humor present are pretty good too. This game mostly just fails for me on a gameplay level, as there's a bit of a luck factor involved in the harder levels, and no real difficulty curve to speak of. The level I found to be the most challenging (and one that put me off from playing for several days) was about at the halfway point of the game. There's also one World 1 level severely out of place, as well. And since you're required to beat every level to finish the game (well, you *could* skip them but where's the fun in that?) I could see that level being a real roadblock to many first-time players. There's also some metagame about bulding the tallest tower you can but there's not really any point to it. Like I said though, I can't say this is a bad game, just one I don't personally enjoy very much.","April 12, 2014","false","5.1"," 7 of 28 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","7","28","0","0"

Not a good recipe for a puzzle game.\n\nSimple game with great visuals, a fun soundtrack, and a solid premise. However, I do not recommend this game because of the physics. It is a physics puzzle game, but with zero control over what the free gooballs do and with unpredictable goo placement, it is needlessly difficult to build a cohesive tower without it toppling over. The puzzle should be in deciphering how to build a structure to get to the end pipe, not endlessly working the goos over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over because you can't get them to drop where you need them. Example: the Tower of Goo level should be a fun introduction on how to build tall towers; the solution is extremely obvious. Instead, you need to spend all your time retrying because the goos all run up one side of the tower and pull it down, or you can't get the goo to span the right previously placed gooballs. If I know where to put it to add integrity, and I simply can't because the game won't let me, I'm not solving a puzzle I'm rolling the dice. Even following a freaking youtube tutorial where someone beat the level, I couldn't replicate the solution. Does that sound like a puzzle to anyone else?\n\nI'm no stranger to difficult games, but at least with many of those you know what you're doing wrong. This isn't intellectually stimulating or challenging, it's just tedious.","June 26, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 24 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","5","24","0","2"

I first picked it up in a Humble Bundle, messed with it  through the first chapter a bit and put it down for nearly two years.  Now for me, that's actually a pretty quick turn around on completing a game.  As is testament on my Backloggery, I still have Nintendo games that I've had since childhood that need beating.\n\nAs we were heading into the Holiday seasons, work is slowing down so I browsed my Steam list and decided on Goo.  No solid reason really, perhaps I was thinking back to the quirky and pleasant music, the sharp graphics, or interesting physics engine.  Perhaps it just because my work computer could handle it.  Whatever the reason,  I actually stuck it out and finished the game.\n\nThe game is not perfect by any means, I wouldn't even put it on a top ten list, but it is fun enough to enjoy as a casual title.  The most frustrating thing is picking up the wrong goo, or misplacing a goo when time is of the essence or you're looking to complete an OCD.  Very Frustrating.\n\nThe story is on the light side and trying to describe it might be futile, but it did involve Goo genocie (goonocide?) and a big evil corporation.   The ending where they find another planet with Goo's was suppose to be part of extra levels that were going to be released in the European version, but was canned since the developer felt it would of been too rushed.\n\nOverall, worth the play.  God speed to any accomplishing the OCDs.","April 22, 2014","true","35.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I highly doubt this review will be of any use to anyone, since the metascore and price of the game make it very hard to not give it a try. I got it on sale, $2.50. I'll start by letting you know that I blindly purchased this game with my only knowledge of it being the image, the name, the price, and the fact that way too many of my steam friends already owned it, so you, by reading a review of it, are already having a different experience than I am.\n\nThere are blobs of goo that have little funny faces and attributes based on their color and shape. There are basic black goos for most of the game that follow a satirical, unnecessary, but amazingly additive storyline. The game is brilliantly hilarious in a very, very subtle way that you will never follow if you take it too seriously or never read any of the wooden signs.\n\nGameplay! The actual gameplay is awesome, which feels like an awkward word for a game where you stack goos to make towers and bridges, but I seriously don't want to downplay how much I enjoyed playing this game. I played through even when it got exhaustively difficult, I still had some incentive to push through, and it was all worth it in the end. Extraordinarily entertaining, even at the end with those devilish red fiends. Really the artwork and the satire are what make me want to replay it.\n\nIf you've somehow avoided this game until now, find a way to play it.\n\nOverall: 9.8/10 (There was like one level that I wish I could have skipped because it was challenging but boring.)","April 24, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it for $0.99 in the Summer sale however I would pay full price for this game. I was suprised by the difficulty of the game as it forces you to use your brain however is never too challenging (I skipped 2 levels in the game and then completed them later). The way that the "story" is told is through the cutscenes in a beautiful art style, also some witty lines are thrown in there by the "sign painter" to keep you interested. The gameplay never gets old in fact it probably gets more interesting as you progress as the game throws new a exotic goo balls your direction.\n\nPros:\n- Art Style\n- Difficulty\n- Cutscenes\n- Gameplay progression\n- Witty one liners\n\nCons:\n- Some levels are difficult to evaluate\n- A little too short\n- Can't change resolution\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game it is a must play.","July 1, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Play World of Goo.\nSure, the challenges will get more difficult as you progress, but the feeling of achievement for completing these kinds of puzzles always falls somewhere between succesfully dressing yourself in the morning and remembering to turn off the oven before bed.\n\nMundane... but worth the $1 I paid for it.

I enjoyed the earlier parts of the game when it was easy, but later on, the game gets painfully hard. The puzzles end up more as exercises in frustration, even after beating a puzzle the feeling is more of shame at having put three hours into a stupid map where you have to wait until a piece bobs right where you need it to be, and where one wrong move means erasing the last half hour of work. The number of music tracks are too few given the amount of time you spend playing the game--I ended up muting the audio completely rather than hear the same repetitive accordian melody. The visual design and physics themselves are strong, but the implementation of the physics makes them the centerpiece when they should just be something to help along the gameplay.

The goal is to get a set amount of goo balls into the vacuum at the end of the stage, but once they're applied to your structure they can't be vacuumed up, only the extras can. This requires you to only building the most precise and direct structures possible. The game has a very quirky look, a catchy soundtrack, and every level is original and keeps you guessing.

This would be fine if the gameplay was altered to make up for this issue, but it isn't and therefore, I can't recommend this on PC, but perhaps on any touchscreen device.","April 10, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theshinybadger/recommended/22000/","theshinybadger","TheShinyBadger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theshinybadger/","856 products in account","World of Goo is deceptive in how simple and casual it is in the beginning. Using sticky balls of goo, and later other materials, you will build bridges, towers, and other structures in order to complete each level.\n\nWhat the game does best, however, is consistent innovation in both puzzles and atmosphere. The world is trapped somewhere between cartoonish, dark absurdism and a very light, humorous satire. You will be using goo to aid in a product launch, to judge in a beauty contest, and to destroy the Internet (it makes sense in context). As simple as the story is, it makes the most of the small parts it has.\n\nGameplay wise, World of Goo is difficult, but never unfair. A few of the later levels took half an hour or more of trial and error, but almost always this was due to ignoring a vital detail, taking too many risks, or simply failing to build a stable structure. Completing a mission, however, never fails to bring a sense of accomplishment, and often zooms out to see the proud structure now standing (or, humorously, the structure collapsing right after the level is complete).\n\nI don't play a lot of puzzle games. Often times I become too frustrated to really enjoy myself. World of Goo, however, was too appealing for me to give up on, even as the later levels did their best to send my balloon-supported bridge into the bottomless pit after five minutes of making it PERFECT.","March 5, 2013","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can't change the resolution or window size. There's also no options to switch to full screen mode. The game window itself is about 900 pixels wide. A bit small for an average screen of 1920px wide.\n\nThe small window makes scrolling very difficult. Scrolling requires you to move the mouse pointer to the edge and won't scroll if the mouse moves outside the window.\n\nThere are also no options to balance the sound and music, or turn it off entirely.\n\nAlthough the game play itself is amazing, the PC version is not worth buying.

This requires you to only building the most precise and direct structures possible. The game has a very quirky look, a catchy soundtrack, and every level is original and keeps you guessing.

Here is my new, more serious review for this game:\n\nAs Yoda would say: World of Goo, an interesting Indie game, it is.\n\nIt's a medioacare puzzle game that involves building with goo balls, nothing more to say. What you see in the game screenshots is what you get. Basically what you do is build towers and things using these little goo ball guys. The annoying thing about this game is its physics engine, it's too darn realistic, every damn thing I build eventually (but not all the time) ends up crashing down, it gets relentless.\n\nThe game doesn't really have a story. A story is there, but it's just hard to notice it.  You'll be too busy fixing your falling buildings and such.\n\nWhat I like about this game is its variety of building materials, with each one having different effects. The Ivy Balls unfortunatley don't stick as much as I thought they did.\n\nThis game has basic game mechanics and some frustrating things in it, but those things can be tolerable.\n\nThe only thing that bugs me about this game is the WoG Corp 300 goo-ball limit, it makes me nuts. And also the OCD side-missions are somewhat demanding, so it might take you a while to finish a level in a certain amout of moves/gooballs/time before you start ripping out your hair.\n\nThis game is ok, but I wouldn't say it's a Steam (or PC in general) classic.\n\n\n6.8/10","November 24, 2012","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paperbackjacket/recommended/22000/","paperbackjacket","Ryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paperbackjacket/","339 products in account","World of Goo is a pretty awesome game. It offers fun puzzles that aren't difficult to learn, but are incredibly difficult to master. I've been working at this game for quite some time; it got a lot easier once I realised that there were video walkthroughs for each level online (duh). But my favorite part, by far, is the music. Simply put, the soundtrack for this game, a one-off by 2D Boy made years ago doesn't haven any reason it should be good. But it IS. I only wish Steam would release it as a DLC so I could download it!\n\nI do have some gripes; the puzzles can get a little repetitive, and I often found I was making the same basic structures over and over again with just a few added new flairs. By the end of the game, most of the puzzles were transparent, though the developers did do a good job of making the final puzzles of each section a little more challenging. Also, I found the resolution to be quite bothersome; the game is locked to full screen at, like, 800x600 resolution. On my 1080p monitor, that looked terrible. Yes, I'm aware you can change it by editing the config document, but my point is that there wasn't any built-in graphics interface. Oh well.\n\nOverall, I think I can recommend this game. Didn't encounter any bugs over the almost fifteen hours it took for me to beat it. Nice, tidy programming. Very accessible, and challenging for those that want to collect the achievements -- but not TOO challenging. It's a solid buy, especially if you can pick it up on sale.","May 8, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

World of Goo is almost instantly addictive for players of all skill levels, with simple controls and play mechanics that are easily grasped.\n\nClick and drag the adorable goo balls into position to construct towers, bridges, and other structures to reach your goal. You only have a limited number of goo balls, and since some of them need to exit the level safely, you'll have to avoid hasty decisions and start planning ahead. You must carefully consider where to place the next goo ball--and (when later goo balls with different abilities are introduced) WHICH goo ball to place. It may take a few tries (and retries...and maybe even MORE retries), but you'll feel a sense of accomplishment once you've nailed the goal. Even after you've beaten the level, you can replay it again later to see if you can figure out method of achieving the goal with less moves and faster times (the "OCD" goals in the menu beckon you to try this).\n\nThe art style is clean and colorful. All of the characters and interactive elements are distinctive on the screen, so you can easily focus on the task at hand. The sound effects are simple and cute, and the musical soundtrack is very well done. A large number of levels and a progressively increasing challenge means that you'll be coming back for more for a very long time.\n\nThis highly enjoyable game will put your logic skills to the test and bring a smile to your face. I highly recommend it!","June 14, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No graphics/resolution settings either, so for example, in my monitor it looked quite blurry but i had to stick with it until i changed via changing the config file. Couldn't put it on widowed or anything either, I think a settings menu is a must for a game, but in this one it does not even exist. The menu contains just chapters, credits, and exit button.\n\nThe gameplay is fun for the first 40 minutes or so but then it becomes quite repetitive and tedious because of a few things: Striking for OCD sounds and can be quite fun, but every time you re-try a level, if there was a cutscene, you have to watch it because they are unskippabe and play every time you replay the level. The lack of a retry level button after all the goo has gone inside the sewer thing is also a miss, going to the map/watching intro/do things/fail ocd/watch outro/if there was one, watch cutscene/repeat becomes annoying after a few tries. Maybe a count of non-used gooballs would solve the tediousness, since you can retry level anytime before the gooballs go inse the sucker thing, but yeah that's kind of missed.\nSign man has humour on point tho.\n\nIt can be a "fun between games" game, but 9,99 seems a little excessive for what this game offers, so i advise you to get it on sale if you really want it.","June 18, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The goal is not to use up all the blobs available to you, though, because the extras must traverse your bridge to an exit point on each map. You must rescue a certain number to proceed. The maps eventually develop interesting environmental hazards, starting with spikes and gaps and continuing until entire screens rotate. Of course, it starts introducing things like balloons or reusable goo balls to help you overcome such difficulties. It's full of odd little bits of humor and quirky style.","December 3, 2010","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storyline shouldn't be passed up either since it adds a nice little spin on the take of the game. Lastly, the soundtrack is one of the best out there. The music fits perfectly with the mood of the game and really gives the game its life.

I got it for $0.99 in the Summer sale however I would pay full price for this game. I was suprised by the difficulty of the game as it forces you to use your brain however is never too challenging (I skipped 2 levels in the game and then completed them later). The way that the "story" is told is through the cutscenes in a beautiful art style, also some witty lines are thrown in there by the "sign painter" to keep you interested. The gameplay never gets old in fact it probably gets more interesting as you progress as the game throws new a exotic goo balls your direction.\n\nPros:\n- Art Style\n- Difficulty\n- Cutscenes\n- Gameplay progression\n- Witty one liners\n\nCons:\n- Some levels are difficult to evaluate\n- A little too short\n- Can't change resolution\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game it is a must play.","July 1, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Play World of Goo.\nSure, the challenges will get more difficult as you progress, but the feeling of achievement for completing these kinds of puzzles always falls somewhere between succesfully dressing yourself in the morning and remembering to turn off the oven before bed.\n\nMundane... but worth the $1 I paid for it.

Some might take some time to figure out, but you won´t ever feel desperate and you will have some skips if needed. Good thing is also that there is some kind of replayability with possibility to perfect every level and use collected goo-balls to compete against other players in terms of building the highest "tower".\n\nThe icing on the cake is music - completely stunning for an indie game.\n\nBeautiful experience!

Sound fun? Well it is. Actually, this is one of the most addictive games I've ever had the priviledge of playing. For many reasons. First, the animation is pretty laid back. It is a game that definitely does not take itself too seriously. Second, the soundtrack is really good. And not just the music, which has a whole Kayamari feel to it, but the popping sounds that the goo balls make when you pull them apart, and the little 'yippee' they shout when you do something with them. Yes, these little goo balls are actually pretty cute.\n\nI highly recommend this game.

Sound fun? Well it is. Actually, this is one of the most addictive games I've ever had the priviledge of playing. For many reasons. First, the animation is pretty laid back. It is a game that definitely does not take itself too seriously. Second, the soundtrack is really good. And not just the music, which has a whole Kayamari feel to it, but the popping sounds that the goo balls make when you pull them apart, and the little 'yippee' they shout when you do something with them. Yes, these little goo balls are actually pretty cute.\n\nI highly recommend this game. Not only is it a great game but it is Linux compatible, which is where the future of gaming is, but I expect the studio is going to come out with some other awesome titles in the future.","December 22, 2013","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I did. Because that´s exactly how I felt after completing World of Goo.\n\nVisuals of the game are charming, physics is unique and story, although simple, is the most meaningful one I´ve seen in a long time - and is also presented in an original, refreshing way.\n\nGameplay is wise, with puzzles ranging from medium to hard difficulty. Some might take some time to figure out, but you won´t ever feel desperate and you will have some skips if needed. Good thing is also that there is some kind of replayability with possibility to perfect every level and use collected goo-balls to compete against other players in terms of building the highest "tower".\n\nThe icing on the cake is music - completely stunning for an indie game.\n\nBeautiful experience!

I was advised against this game by a well-meaning and generally intelligent friend who found it too challenging. For me, it hits just about the right balance between mindless platforming fun and challenging brain-tease. Special credit for the narrative layout and for the sounds; they are aptly quirky.","June 26, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
