There is very little point to choosing a class as you can easily get the starting skills/gear of one class with minimal playing early in the game. The skill trees fall into 3 catagories: offense/defense/make money; there is no unique skill to be seen for skill development besides the ability to see what ores an asteroid will give you before you mine it, flying bigger ships, and I'll even count driving in reverse at an acceptable rate. It's true that there is some playstyle choices to be made here as to whether you focus on combat or money earning, but at the end of the day you'll still need combat skills in order to defend yourself, so there's no incentive to go for one specialization over another besides "I wonder if I can" (yes, you can, does it make any difference in the core gameplay? no.).\n\nWhile character customization is flat, ship customization is concave. Choose from 1 of 4 weapon types, make sure you skill up the ones you want so you can use them, then find the 1 or 2 ship frames with decent stats that allow you to use them. From there attach passive items to fit your playstyle, and get the biggest shield you can. The stats from ship to ship are woefully similar, 95% of the time you're going to care about only 1 thing: does the ship support the weapons I wanna use? Armor, hull plating, cargo space, manueverability etc are for the large part similar providing it's a ship in the same class. It's not so much "design your own ship" as it is "find the one with the right weapon slots and put stickers on it".\n\nThe quests are the largest downfall for me here. Most of your time is going to be spent in autopilot taking object from station "A" to station "B", then report back to "A", or "go blow up this one bad guy and come back". There are a few exceptions, the fleet combat story missions are particularly noteworthy, and there is a cute quest about "hacking" which relies on actual programming knowledge to get through (non-required so no real penalties for failing, but refreshing to see a "click through" quest break the 4th wall in subtle way like this).\n\nThe hopeful part is this: There are ways to improve customization using what is already in the game. Expanded skill trees, class-skills (even if passives like aforementioned mining skill), unique story options are all tools that could be used to diversify character development. Ship customization can be expanded upon with additional content. There are already a few interactive bits of ship design with modules like the EMP, more active and less passive options would make it feel much more unique. More and far more diversified ship frames will open up design space and has potential to actually allow players to make meaningful choices about the paths they will take in the game.\n\nSome of these fixes are already or will be made available through modding.\n\nBut I can't in good faith recommend a game that needs mods to deliver on its promise. So, "No", for now.","April 4, 2015","false","12.2"," 254 of 296 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","254","296","5","4"

Spaceships, free exploration, trading, mining, missions, and an optional story. If you liked Privateer and always wanted a 2d version of Privateer, that's almost exactly what this game is. And that might be enough for some people.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is lacking polish in many respects. There are plenty of weapons, but aren't enough ships, engines, and shields to really create the kind of ship that will work well in the game. I think that the devs figured players would create these assets using mods, but the only mods out so far are cheaty ones. The economy is a bit off -- ships are a bit too cheap for what they are. There's no ties between resources being available and stations having more products or anything like that.\n\nPiloting needs some work. Colliding with NPCs is far too easy (in fact, it's the only maneuver some NPCs know). Most player ships can't turn fast enough or move their weapons fast enough to target NPCs without themselves striking NPCs.\n\nXP and leveling needs some work. Right now, the only way to level up quickly and easily is to shoot things. You can't level up easily by trading, hacking, or mining, except at the most basic levels. That might be because there are ways to break the system at later points in the game, but that just means that the system is weak and needs polish.\n\nThere are distinct periods of boredom in between being able to do things in game. You finish the first couple of missions at level 3 or 4. You can't take on the next storyline mission until Level 10, and can't upgrade ships until Level 15. To get to level 15, you need to clear approximately two low-level systems of pirates. That's a lot of pew pew pew. And it's only reasonable to gain that XP by going pew pew pew, even if you classed as a miner or trader.\n\nI don't know right now if the game will age well and develop a following and some decent mods that will fix these problems. I haven't looked too closely at modding yet. There's a ton of promise here, but unless you're really grabbed by the story, there's very little good reason to play the game past the initial few hours.","August 4, 2015","false","9.5"," 159 of 173 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","159","173","4","2"

Great engine, decent multiplayer netcode, lots of potential, and super easy to mod, but a SEVERE lack of content (almost as if the developer expected modders to  complete the game for them), and a completely asnine multiplayer mode that makes playing past level 10 pointless BY DESIGN.  I was so excited after the first hour I set up a dedicated server and began pimping it to my gaming community.  By the second day playing it I'd done literally everything there is in the game.

I feel obligated to weigh in on this game. It has the potential to be great, and I love the art style and mimalistic UI, but it doesn't have enough rich content yet. If you read no further, wishlist this title and check on it from time to time. I don't think my "no" will stick forever.\n\nFor those of you with longer attention spans, I'll expound a bit. VoidExpanse is the type of game I'm really wanting to sink my teeth into, but can't. Similiar titles in the genre include things like Spaz and Drox Operative (definitely check both of those out for similiar (but different) experiences. VoidExpanse gives you a nice-looking sandbox to play in, but doesn't give you all the toys necessary to have a good time. The skeleton is all here, but the experience feels empty a few hours in.\n\nThere simply isn't enough breadth/depth to what you can do to (or with) your character. The classes and ship options are fairly one-dimensional, and the quests are still pretty rinse and repeat. I'd love to see more dynamic quests involving attacks on space stations, some kind of hacking interface/skill tree, true smuggling runs, more interaction (even the ability to join) with the pirate faction, etc. The game just doesn't do interesting things with it's own universe yet.\n\nI love this game for what it is, and for the price point I'm still happy with my purchase, I'm just hoping that they take this brilliant foundation and build something atop it. I know there are countless ideas floating around the community - let's hope some of them see the light of day.","April 6, 2015","false","15.9"," 104 of 129 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","104","129","4","1"

Most of the playtime is used mostly travelling between space station. The content is lacking massively and the quest is excruciating painful to play and boring.\n\nI don't see the point of randomly generated world where there is barely anything you can do in it. You can destroy a pirate station but it doesn't effect anything in the game world, like making it safer and such. The faction doesn't grow or decrease in size with your interaction. You can't help your faction to setup new station nor they can be destroyed. Faction NPC do nothing but sit in station and just give a scripted quest (just ONE quest then they are useless forever). The astroid is static and doesnt move or dissapear when you mine. NPC pirates randomly added into the world but just stay there or chasing an npc freighter and then return to their spawn point and stay there indefinately.\n\nTrading is badly simulated as there is NO production station and NO demand station. Just the station price just change randomly change without making any sense. If you go to the capital system with 3 station you can make 200k+ just by trading between those station. There is no point to travel to the fringe station where you expect the demand is higher, but its not, everything is same price with the station you were on. Its just pointless RNG. (~_~)\n\nThis "Meaningful trading system involving trade routes and supply/demand simulation" is a lie. sad face. I was really looking forward for this.\n\nIn short, the world is dead, cold and pointless, with very few interaction. Nothing much to do but to follow the boring fetch quest. Great tech demo, but very far from a complete game like space ranger or SPAZ.\n\nI like the combat tho.","April 8, 2015","false","9.5"," 77 of 96 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","77","96","0","8"

After almost finishing it I was able to hand over a big list of bugs.\nAfter that they changed the storyline quite a bit and I have been trying to hold off finishing the game until they do the Steam release.\nIn the meantime the devs asked the help of the community to test the mac/linux version, the Steam version and to help out ironing kinks in the dedicated server.\n\nHaving been Greenlit on Steam they still took their time to make sure that when the game is available on Steam, that it delivers quality.\nInstead of putting the game on there the devs asked for feedback on if the game was ready, most of the answers were no and reasons were given. A few weeks later a patch came out with the additions that people said were necessary to get it on Steam.\n\nIf people read this review I want them to understand that if they buy this game, that they not only buy an awesome game but that they are funding a game developing team that really creates games that have value.

After taking a good look at the skill trees I decided that I actually wanted most if not all of them so throughout my playtime I have been carefully managing what I invest in next. The game can be a little grindy, especially if you've *chosen* to grind as I have, but it's always felt rewarding. Getting that next skill, being able to buy and then use that shiny new hull or weapon or ship upgrade is satisfying.\n\nA lot of zones unfortunately feel a little empty. Filled to the brim with pirates and aliens and in some cases more asteroids than you can mine in half a day, yes, but still empty as from a certain standpoint they're essentially just waypoints to your next stop. Hopefully in the (near) future we'll have more interactivity with these places if the game evolves to a point where we can actually claim and populate them. Extended main storylines to send you to more places would be great, too. All the same, if you're in need of exp or loot to sell it's easy to just pick a zone whose agression level is close to yours and have at it.\n\nStorywise it's pretty solid. You'll have access to a few missions to raise your rep with three of the factions before you actually join any of them. The main quest for the two I've seen are pretty short but well written and the difficulty in terms of how aggressive the zones you'll be visiting is pretty steep so your first playthrough with a new character will feel a lot longer as you level and gear up. There are also missions you can do for the commander at any station you visit. They're selected randomly from a preset list and it's totally up to you if you want to accept them or not. I found that fact to be irritating as I was only really interested in bounty and mining missions, thankfully loudent2 published a mod that allows you access to the whole list so you can just pick the one you want. Much more convenient and a must if you ever get frustrated at the random factor.\n\nThere are a lot of items and upgrades to choose from at the beginning, which is awesome, but as you get into the higher levels (I was 146 at the time of writing this... yes I was lazy and copy/pasted my three day old forum post. Deal with it :P) you'll find yourself invariably with the same set of gear as most people; primarily speaking a dark matter generator, a dimensional fuel tank, and either a Hammer or a Death Bringer hull. And lasers. Lots of love for the lasers :).\n\nThis is where modding really adds more life to it all. Last week I wanted a (much) shorter range laser that did more damage, I made one. It uses way too much energy imo but I made it, I use it, and so do a few other people now that it's on the Workshop. Then I wanted a rapid fire ballistic weapon that shoots fireballs, made that too. It's a little OP for anything under aggression level 70 or so but it's fun all the same. Got tired of shields, made new armor plating. So my modding skills are amateurish at best but more importantly I'm having a good time doing it, even learned a thing or two about XML along the way. Taking that into consideration, there are a lot of other people writing fantastic mods for the game and publishing them fairly regularly, it's been just over two weeks and there are 50 items in the Workshop already (albeit some of them are translations and don't really affect the core gameplay but I imagine they took a LOT of work and it's quite appreciated to a lot of players). It feels like there's always some cool new user made content to check out and maybe take for a spin. Maybe even share a few of your own ;).\n\nAll in all it's a great game. Simple yet very well written, looks fantastic, controls are solid, great support and frequent updates. It has a lot to offer both in terms of content and expandability and it's a lot of fun, right to the point where I started playing one morning and actually forgot to eat anything until mid afternoon. Definitely worth the pricepoint.\n\nCan I click yes twice?","April 18, 2015","true","166.0"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","44","50","0","0"

It has a lot of potential, but it should really be an early access title.\n\nIt's definitely playable now, but pretty much everything needs either more work or more content. Load times for save games and new systems are pretty long. Combat is really repetitive (and you'll get used to it because it's the only sane way to level up). There are few options for ship and weapon, there are quite a few but generally only one at any given tier so it's "oh I can afford the next ship/gun up I better swap them out." Modders are adding content faster than the devs, but the devs set up modding so that once you use a save file with any mod it permenantly needs that mod to load, there is no removing it if say you don't like it or it completely breaks the game. Back up your save files.\n\nI was a die hard fan of the Escape Velocity games when I was younger and I really wanted a worthy successor to them in this game, but although many of the same elements are there pretty much all the things the EV series did right this title fails at. There's no real feeling of exploration because the procedurally generated systems are all identical other than color scheme and number/strength of bad guys. The storyline missions are uninspired and linear. And there aren't enough options in ships and outfits to make it feel like an inhabited capitalistic universe.\n\nI have hopes that enough of the rough patches will get ironed out as further patches come out that I feel like my money was well spent, but I'm not going to keep playing it while they fix it, and I can't recommend that you do either.","April 13, 2015","false","32.8"," 67 of 87 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","67","87","3","3"

No.. no I don't think it does) turning on my favorite tunes, (driving along in my automobile, my baby beside me at the wheel.. stole a kiss at the turn of a mile) and kicking back enjoying the sites... (ok the only sites will be a vast sea of darkness with an occasional tiny white speck...)\n\nAlthough my thinking as a child was quite flawed, who hasn't wanted to gallivant through space, snapping necks and Cashing checks, like Brennan Huff and Dale Dobeck?  The answer is nobody, because this type of fantasy is what makes young children tick, it's what makes them climb out of bed at 7:45 in the morning, put on their best school uniform and rush out the door, heading towards a class room ugh 6 or 7 hours of boredom.   WHY!!!  So that one day they can grow up to be the first man to discover an Alien race, and then nail it!!!!\n\nWell that escalated quickly, lets try to forget what I wrote... oh what?  you can't forget it..  That's fine, lets put it in a box, lock it and throw away the key..  here goes my review for VoidExpanse.\n\nI have to say that personally I loved VoidExpanse, a open world space exploration sandbox game.  If you want to be a billionaire miner...  dust off that monocle, if you want to be a pirate hunter, than arg matey, have at it.  If you want to fight off the hostile aliens Independence day style, get that cigar out and be ready to smoke it...   You have so many options available to, you can mold and shift the game to suit your desires or ambitions.  The only limitations will be the ones in your mind.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game is a top down shooter, you can move your ship using the W,A,S,D, or you can use the arrows keys, nothing too uncommon with that.  ProTip - use Spacebar to bring your ship to a complete stop, very useful for trying to pull in containers, mine asteroids  or port with the various space stations.  The combat is a combination of frustration and exhilaration, you'll be frustrated as the limitations of the game's combat system and the gliding nature of your ship, it can take quite a bit of getting used to before you master.   The exhilaration will come when you finally master combat, blowing up every enemy pirate ship or base you come across.\n\nThe rest of the game play is pretty straight forward, mine asteroids for ores, loot containers from ships you've destroyed or that have been destroyed by others.   Questing, experience, and levels, you can acquire quests while docked in a space station, numerous quest exist, delivery, rescue, destroy, etc etc etc.  These quest will grant you experience, although quests aren't the only way to get experience, you'll get it from just about every action in the game, from mining ore, to fighting ships, you even get experience for selling certain ores.   The experience is used to level up, each level will grant you points, which you can use on skills..  Skills are the life blood of your character, they allow you to shape and alter how you'll play the game.\n\nMany different skill combinations exist, it's best to thoroughly inspect and decide what skills best fit your play style, loads of different combinations exist, will you be a smooth talker who gets his way with non violence, or will you decide to let your lasers, missiles or chain guns do the talking for you, the possibilities are endless.  Going right along with skill customization will be your ship, you can outfit your ship with numerous different parts, want to travel further without having to return for fuel... buy yourself a new fuel tank, want to mine more ore before having to return to port and sell... get  yourself a bigger hull.  Feeling tired of getting picked on and assaulted by pirate ships.. upgrade those weapon systems and wreck pirates.  So many combinations of ship parts exist, from your lowly civilian parts to high tech military grade items.  What kind of ship will you build?\n\nPro's\n\nHuge galaxy to explore\nLots of customization options\nlimitless ways to play the game\nhours upon hours of gameplay\n\nCon's\nGame is kind of empty (although this is outer space)\nCombat is kind of frustrating\n\n\nRecommendation\n\nI'd highly recommend this game, it's loads of fun, a great big universe to explore, many quest to complete, and so many different ship and skill combinations to try out.   I'd suggest buying it now, why wait, you have a very large universe to explore..","March 28","true","10.3"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","30","38","4","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/324260/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","VoidExpanse is a top down open world space sandbox game. You play as someone from the Far Colonies who flees from a farm world on a civilian spacecraft, but who that character really is, is up to you. The plot of the game relies on the fact that the Far Colonies are abandoned, after a hostile alien race is discovered. Therefore, it is up to you to fight this threat, if you choose to do so that is. One thing that surprised was the fact that even though this is a simple, yet good looking 2D game, ti has a very detailed video options menu and separate audio sliders, which is a big plus in my book.\n\nIntro:Before being thrown into the procedurally generated universe of VoidExpanse you’re able to create your own character. The game offers a good variety of options such as, hairstyles, accessories and other facial characteristics to customize your character portrait You also have the option to choose one of 9 different classes such as Prospector, Trader, Rogue and Adventurer, each one having their own unique starting bonuses and preassigned skills.\n\nUpon entering the game, if you go on the Character tab you can see your character experience points and skills. Here, you can also access the following categories: piloting, combat, social, industry and engeneering. Each one of these categories has its own unique skill tree which is also affected by the profession you choose during your character creation. That said, I’d recommend you to take your time and examine these and determine which kind of role you want to play. You can be a pirate, a trader, a miner, how you embrance this open universe is entirely up to you. Different skills will have very different applications, some will allow you to persuade certain characters and avoid conflict, others will improve your piloting and mining skills, while others are just required in order to use better gear.\n\nRight next to Character tab, you also have the System Map which is very easy to navigate. It allows you to see the various planets on your current system, asteroids, enemies, space stations as well as jumpgates. It also allows you to set your own navigation points which you can use as destinations for your autopilot. Beware though, your autopilot isn’t smarth enough to avoid pirates and other dangers so make sure you’re actually paying attention to the game while you’re taking advantage of this very helpful feature.\n\nNext up, if you go on the Star System Map, you can see different systems connected by jumpgates and also see each factions territory. If you go to the Factions tab you can see what kind of relations each faction has with one another. There are a total of 6 different factions, including the neutral faction. Each one of these systems has their own characteristics and some might have special events such as gas clouds or debris from past conflicts. Here you can also see each system tech and danger level. The higher the tech level of a system, the better items you can find there and the danger level of a system will affect how difficult are the enemies there.\n\nOf course, as with any space sandbox game, you also have your lovely inventory. Here you can check what items you currently have and see what different modules you have equiped. Still, the only items that you can equip outside a space station are consumables, such as mines and repair kits. Modules such as an engine, generator and shield require you to be inside a space station. It is also on the inventory window that you can check your cargo, this is where you’ll hold various types of goods such as ores and food.\n\nOnce you enter a space station you’ll be able to refuel, repair and check various sections of the station. On the hangar you can change your ship parts and on the shop you can buy and sell items. The type of items that are for sale on the shop vary depending on the type of station you’re in. If you’re on a military station you’ll get access to more military gear and if you’re in an outpost you’ll get access to more ships. However, the type of items you’ll find in these shops also depends on the Tech level of the system. Finally, you can also go to the station decks. Here you’ll find people from various factions and their reactions towards you will depend on your reputation with that faction. Most importantly, you can take missions and talk with them. You can ask them about the various different factions, about events and locations, thus gaining some background information on the events that are taking place or that previously took place.\n\nIf you pick up a quest you can check it on your Journal. Here you can also see failed and completed quests. Any progress made within a certain quest will also be shown here as well as the dialogue and story behind it.\n\nGameplay:The overall gameplay is really fun. You move your ship with W, A, S, D, Q and E and you aim with your mouse. Combat is in real time and hip movement and maneuverability is really important here, because weapons on ships have an arc of fire and so, you should try to keep yourself out of the enemy range. This allows for some sort of agile combat that requires you to keep both your ship moving and your weapons aimed towards the opponent at the same time.\n\nFlying around on your spaceship and fighting enemies requires you to keep an eye on some key things. Your ship has several meters such as energy, shield and structure, as well as fuel which is pretty self-explanatory. The shield bar obviously represents what percentage of shield you currently have on your ship, if this reaches 0 you’ll start taking structural damage and if you manage to not get hit during a certain time, your shield will eventually recharge. The energy meter on the other hand acts as if it is your stamina bar. Firing weapons and mining, for example, uses energy so you can’t just spam your weapons and have to time your shots correctly. That said, you’re also required to be at a full stop when mining, and the same goes for when you’re looting a container dropped by an enemy.\n\nCombat and movement aside, the game pretty much plays as you want to play it. You can attack friendly vessels, you can hunt down pirates or any other faction or you can just make your fortune by mining asteroids and selling the ore at a nearby space station. You can help characters and join a faction and help them achieve their ultimate goal, or you can just ignore everyone and just do your own thing.\n\nVerdict:Open sandbox world, choose how to play your own game. e.g. be a pacifist or a soldier\nNice looking visuals with 3D effects\nTons of ship customization\nMod support\nFun combat\nChill music\nDead multiplayer\nI HIGHLY recommend this game to fans of spacefaring, space sandbox and space sims. If you enjoyed games like SPAZ or Space Rangers I’m sure you’ll have a great time with VoidExpanse!","March 20","true","5.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

The level of different options available right from the start would qualify it as a sort of open world or sandbox style even, on a fringe sort of level, but nonetheless it certainly would qualify as such.\n\n\nPros\nI've had a lot of fun leveling up.  The skills seem very worthwhile to get, and it's hard to decide on what I would like to work on next.  Level requirements of future upgrades can help in determining the order I want to go in though.\n\nI love the way the star systems are put together.  The combat is fairly easy so far, which I like.  Once I got some levels up, and better customized my ships.  Took time to get used to the ships too, but I am now able to use them fairly well, out of what I've tried thusfar.\n\nI enjoy the graphics and the music is nice as well.  I find it relaxing, and it doesn't get on my nerves like some games can tend to do after playing a while.\n\nExploration has been a good thing too.  I'm still unsure how to progress, and which quests are more important for moving the story along.  They do seem to have symbols next to them in the journal.  Some of the "filler" quests are obvious, but they are good for the money and experience as well.\n\n\nCons\nI would like a little bit more variety as far as weapons and ship selection.  Maybe more can come about in the future?  There might be more I haven't seen yet as well.\n\nI think there are not enough types of quests.  You start to see the same "filler" ones appear again and again as you visit various star systems and base planets.\n\nI wish I were able to keep track of where things were in my storage areas in different star systems.  It's something I've had a difficult time retracing, especially in a medium to large sized system.\n\nI have seen a couple of small grammatical errors already, but they aren't too glaring, or anything so bad I cannot easily interpret what is being said, so I will sort of give a pass in that case.\nDoesn't destroy the flow of the game, and I know I make my own from time to time, so not a huge deal.  I did notice a couple though.\n\nI'd definitely rather have several saves to utilize, and not a single one that autosaves often.  I like going back and trying different things, so having a single save per game is sort of a killjoy for me, personally.\n\n\nEarly gameplay, and Other Thoughts\nSo, I started my first game as a prospector, and got a few missions at the base it starts you at.  I destroyed a ship and got some crates, and I was pretty happy about that!  I venture a little further out, and I see several red marks on my radar, so I figure I would investigate.  Not Smart! I was toasted pretty quickly, so I lost some stuff, which was a letdown, but I had it on normal, as I wanted to get used to the basics of the game, so not a huge deal...  Just had to pay some money to get my ship back in working order, and off I went again on a different mission.\n\nLuckily, this one was a straight shot with nothing in the way, and I finished it with no problems.  Level up!  Picked my traits, then while choosing what I wanted to level, I noticed I had some nice skills in my tree for mining...  So of course, the idea popped in my head, and I got a little tool in the shop to mine stuff from the asteroids, and started doing that.  Was getting decent experience from going out and back again, but I didn't  have much cargo room.  Still the experience plus the profit was a nice little side job to work on getting better parts, and so that became my focus for a little bit.  I'm glad there are different options like this for somebody to do based on where they are strong or weak after starting attributes.\n\nA little over ten hours in now, and I've had a lot of fun leveling up so far, and the selection of various skills has really augmented my gameplay experience.  Some are pretty important, and others are more related to ones playstyle.  I don't sense a hard cap for level, but maybe there is at some point.  So far it's not very tough to level.\n\nI wish there were more variety in what you can buy, and the variety of random filler quests could use a little bit extra quests, instead of running into many similar quests that you quickly begin to recognize.  I've run into the same ones many times, and I'd like to see more down the road.\n\nDespite having more cons than pros, the strength of the pros, and also the fact that I grouped some of the pros into multiple parts gives them an edge.  I am really enjoying this game!  I will probably continue on as neutral, and see where that takes me.  Maybe that has something to do with why I cannot figure out how to move along with the story.\n\nAnyway, so far I highly recommend the game.  I enjoy the RPG system, and the other elements work well in conjunction with the overall gameplay experience.\n\n** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.

I played about 18+ hours prior to this review.\n\nThis game contains a bit more of the RPG than some, but it's presentation is extremely basic...a dialog screen that list who at a given location you may talk to.   Interaction is fairly straightforward after that.\n\nThere exists a very large skill web to populate, but not a great deal of content to use to level up...so its the same 4-5 quests (kill the pirate, get some ore, deliver a message, rescue some stranded civies, or buy and deliver some goods) over and over, or mining ore for cash and xp.  The music is repetitive, the AI voice (computer on your ship) becomes anoying fairly quickly, and the main quest requires digging through a good bit of text (repeated by a large number of "characters") to comprehend and follow.   There are a number of factions, and I've focused on one thus far (order).\n\nThe route planning is attrocious, and given the dependance on autopiloting built into the game, the route planner has gotten me killed MANY times, mostly due to the fact it can't seem to go around an asteroid, so that the most boring parts of the game require your attention.  Ultimately, this along with the repetitive nature of the other elements makes this a "not recommended" game.\n\nIf you're looking for a similar game, done much better, go play Rebel Galaxy.","March 25","false","18.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

VoidExpanse is one of those games that sounds very simple, and even looks very simple. So, you start up a new game, and start mucking about, and then realize what feels like half an hour later that you've somehow lost several hours. The skill trees, the different ship hulls that actually FEEL like different ships, instead of just looking like them, and the fun of the combat... I'll be blunt: This game isn't a shiny polished AAA title. It has some quirks, particularly in the dialogue. However, VoidExpanse gets it right where it actually counts: It's fun to play, and the developers have a love for the game and community that shows in their continuing efforts to constantly improve and even expand the game. Lurler and co at Atomic Torch have built not just an excellent 2D space sandbox, they've built a devoted community, and the beginning of a reputation as a stand-up group of talented developers that actually care about their fans.\nPutting the developer and community aside, though, let me explain the game, since that's what's actually being reviewed. Firstly, you won't play the same exact game twice, even if the main story(ies) don't radically change. VoidExpanse is a 2D space sandbox kind of game in the vein of Space Rangers, Solar Winds, or (to a lesser degree) S.P.A.Z. You start off customizing you character portrait with a number of options (which can be expanded via workshop), pick a trade/class which will allot your starting skills, and then start off in a low-tech backwater space base. The game has a pretty low learning curve, and piloting your ship will become natural very quickly.\nThere are two primary things that will determine your playstyle:\n1) your skills, which will establish everything from what kinds of ship hulls you can pilot, how well you can pilot them, what kinds of weapons you can use, how well you can use those weapons, the types of trade and dialogue options available, what types of equipment you can use, and how efficient everything from mining lasers to fuel are.\n2) your ship hull, which will determine cargo capacity, speed, maneuvering, and types of weapon mounts.\nYou can spend your time just following the main story, and only doing odd jobs, trading, or mining as needed to upgrade your equipment as needed, or you can bum about as a space miner and make your fortune hunting rare ores to sell to the highest bidder. You can establish trade routes, become a bounty hunter... it's up to you. Granted, the actual variety of missions can be limited, but there are a few standout side missions that are truly unique.\nIf you like the idea of a 2D space sandbox, they don't get much better than this. It has some flaws, but it delivers a solid and engaging experience, and is just loads of fun to play.\nOh yeah... and you can play online. Just saying.\n8/10","April 29, 2015","true","4.8"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

It's more remenicent of 2d top down naval battles, where each of your weapons have their own arcs and you have a radar you can use to fight things off screen with guided weaponry, and you're sliding along space trying to avoid getting shot up too hard. It's ok.\n\nMy only gripe is that it's easy to get in over your head, and dying isn't the end, and the game is very grindy.\n\nSee, the game constantly autosaves, and you aren't allowed to make your own saves. The game is effectively ironman, so if you die then you die. You get deducted a small amount of money and are respawned inside the nearest friendly station.\n\nThis may sound like a good thing, except for your super expensive investiture of a ship being completely gone for good as well as its contents. You have to buy up the (thankfully free) civilian junk and start from scratch. It's a lot like EVE in this way.\n\nWhich has the major downside of runing into the grind wall that the game seems to be.  You get such a small trickle of money for the effort that you put into the game that it often is faster to just start a new galaxy and start from scratch rather than grind from a civ ship back up to where you died.\n\nThere's also a few interesting mods on the workshop, most are russian with (mostly) english translation.","February 8","true","19.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The factions themselves are written from an unlettered perspective in all honesty, but whatever, it's a game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/324260/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1509 products in account","Introduction:\nVoidExpanse is a Top-Down, Open World Space RPG with a branching story line. With the ability to define how big your universe may grow, this game can take you quite some time to fully explore. As an added bonus, since the universe is procedurally generated, you will never experience the same universe twice in a row.\n\nThe game has a beautiful backdrop which can make each system look and feel somewhat unique. The character portraits being randomized for non-key NPCs also add a refreshing new feel to each replay of the game. The ships have enough detail and varietie for this style of art to make them visually appealing as well. The sounds are fairly standard, but they work fine for this game.\n\nGameplay:\nThere are many different character options to choose from at the start of the game. You customize your character portrait as well as your starting Class. Starting Classes just give you a head start down their related Skill Trees, however as you play, it is completely feasible that you could max out every Skill Tree.\n\nSkill trees are the games way of locking you out of content that would otherwise make you too powerful to start with. Luckily, early on it is easy to gain levels so you can quickly unlock better ships and weapons that you may need to progress. This system does have a bit of a drawback though. When playing through one of the factions, I was told I had to destroy enemy space stations using a custom missile that I was issued. This is where a major issue occurred for me. Since this was my second play through, I had opted to play as a miner/trader who operated a freighter. My freighter was only a middle tier ship that had medium pulse lasers. My ship wasn’t designed to fight and didn’t even have a bay that could support a missile let alone a level 3 one. It was simply equipped to defend against a single attacker or a few lower class attackers while making its escape. I had almost maxed out my energy weapons, Industry (mining), Social (trade skills) and my Piloting (to enhance cargo space and speed) skills. This meant I had not focused anything on the other weapon types or heavier hulls. I had bought myself a very heavy beam only Death Bringer ship for making runs into the Alien space and the heavy pulse weapons for it… but didn’t have the skills to fly it yet, was still working on that. At this point I knew I was either screwed or I was in for one heavy grind. I needed to be able to get enough skill points to unlock level 3 Missiles, heavier hulls and the money to buy the ship and everything I needed to equip it properly. I had to do tedious filler missions given by the random stations while doing mining runs to raise the experience and money required. Days later, I finally had my heavy ship loaded to the teeth with everything including my missile. This made blowing up those Alien space stations even more satisfying because of the effort I had to put in to it.\n\nAs mentioned, there are plenty of customization options for this game. There are quite a few different ships to choose from, each with its own loadout slots and statistics. It would be nice if there were a few omni-slot ships that let you customize it exactly how you want, but using the ones already in game works. There is an even wider assortment of weapons to choose from plus the critical ship systems and subsystems that can also be customized. The numbers of configurations you can make are almost limitless. This, along with the aforementioned procedural generation of the selectable size universe helps to make each replay unique. One feature I like is the fact that your character isn’t a miracle worker. If you find yourself a better weapon floating in the debris of the ship you just vaporized, you can’t just slap it on to your ship and fly off merrily on your way. You have to get to a space station and dock with it in order to adjust critical components of your ship. Really the only thing your pilot can do while out and about is to reload the consumable things such as hull repair or shield energy. This is a rather good decision on the Developers part as it adds realism to the game. It actually makes it a little more exciting to know that if you don’t survive the trip back to the nearest space station, your new found prize will be lost when you explode.\n\nWhy might you want to replay the game? Well after the introductory area, there are three factions all looking to take you in as a recruit. Once you determine which faction you want to join you can seek out their recruitment officer. The recruitment officer of course doesn’t let just anyone join, you must prove yourself worthy of their cause. This is where the story lines diverge. Once you are in a faction you will have to stick with that choice until the end of the game. The end mission will be changed to suit the faction you are a member of, be it to blow the aliens out of their part of the galaxy, find a way back home, or finding a way to pacify alien hostility.\n\nUnfortunately, once you finish the starting area and do all the efforts required to join a faction, when you are really ready to get going, the game hits the home stretch and ends shortly after. This game relies on the fact you have to do the generic missions, hunt enemy (or if you are a jerk, friendly ships) and mine in order to gain experience and money. This works great early on but becomes a very heavy and barely rewarding grind in the later portion of the game. The deeper into the Alien territories you go, the heavier their resistance becomes. You will quickly find yourself swarmed with ships at a far higher level than you. Another issue I had is if you take a jump gate then look at your map too long, you will find a swarm of pirates zoning in behind you and almost killing you before you can move. Death is also unforgiving and what it takes from you is based on what difficulty setting you took at the beginning of the game when generating your universe.\n\nAnother thing that pads out gameplay is travel time. Often you will find the mission provider and the mission system are separated by a vast distance. You then need to fly there with the assistance of Jump gates to link systems together… but unfortunately there is not usually a direct route. You will have to pass through each system that separates you and your destination dealing with any hostiles that may decide to attack you. You also need to watch your fuel levels or you will find yourself having to limp home at a low speed.\n\nOverall, there is plenty to do in VoidExpanse. It is a fun enough game that you might find yourself replaying it just to see how the story ends for each of the factions.\n\nPro:\nHighly customizable ships, equipment, and weapons\nProcedurally Generated Universe so it is different each time you play\nMultiple Factions helps enhance replayability\nPlay it how you want for the most part. Be a trader, a miner, a bounty hunter, a pirate or any combination of the above Cons:\nMust do introductory level each time you do a fresh restart\nA lot of grinding is required to survive late game\nRepetitive filler quests used solely to help you level up and gain money. You find the same few quest types no matter where you go. Kill this pirate, rescue this crew, or deliver this cargo\nA lot of flying around between systems to get from point A to B then back to A again. Very time consuming and gets old. Would be nice if you could just radio in that you finished the mission rather than flying half way across the galaxy again just to turn it in\nAble to spend skill points in such a way it can mess you over later in the game. It’s fixable but you will need to grind to do it","March 27","true","24.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The games it was inspired by, like Space Rangers and SPAZ, feel a lot more like a stair step of progress - whereas this game feels more like one giant leap.\n\nIt's an enjoyable leap, but mostly one that's probably only going to appeal to fans of the genre who are just looking for a fresh coat of paint on ideas that are not particularly fresh. That said this is also only for playing single player. This game in many ways seems to have been designed with multiplayer in mind, so if you're into that it may be that it significantly expands the horizons of the game.","April 30","true","65.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you liked Space Pirates and Zombies you would probably really enjoy this game. For a while there was an issue with seeds being a bit random to the point where trying to get outside the tutorial zone could be frustrating depending on the levels of the zones that spawned around it. But when I mentioned this in the Steam forms it took less then a day for the devs to make some suggestions as to how they could fix this issue and within 3 days of the post they patched the game fully fixing that issue by making it so areas near the starting zone can not be mid level zones.\n\nIt is nice to see dev's that actually care about the quality of their game and actually work on making the game better even after release that are not just bug fixes. The advanced controls are a bit hard to learn and I find myself switching between advanced and simple controls.  But all in all it's a game you can progress purely fighting or purely mining and selling and even purely just buying from one post and selling to another, the skill trees while mostly just % buff passives do actually make you feel like your makning progress and becoming better as you gain levels and has a fair share of starting sill set ups to start with. The part upgrades feel like there is both purely upgrades and also side grades (for example some generaters may generate power faster but store less power, and then sheilds there is shields that abosrb 100% damage but absorb less before breaking, some that absorb 50% damage but absorb a lot more, and in that same slot you might just install armor instead that constantly uses power unlike shields that only use power when recharging but reduces the damage you take.\n\nIf you liked SPAZ this game has many similarities but does not feel like a clone either, at $15 I would say its worth it but not a must buy but if its ever on sale then it would easily make it be a must buy.","July 2, 2015","true","17.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's actually pretty good, in a happily retro fashion. Theres a small amount of NPC interaction, quite a bit of upgrading space ships and equipment, and the possibility of being fairly successful via trading or mining if you really want to. I went for what certinaly feels like the majority of the game, shooting stuff. User interface is simple, combat can be swift and brutal, and you can certainly tailor your ship and tactics to playstyle. I've seen some complaints that the character advancement doesn't make much difference. It does, but not a lot. By the time you finish the game one way or another, I suspect that you'll be using gameplay skills 30%, equipment 50% and character skills 20%.\n\nStill, a good game if you fancy swooping around shooting aliens.

From some of my earliest video game memories playing Star Control till recently with S.P.A.Z. this game follows a familiar combat formula.  But that's not a bad thing in any way.  Strafe, steer, and blast your way through your enemies with a bunch of changeable loadouts, ships, and different classes of 'hulls'  (the skeleton for the ship you'll use).  What makes this game great is the sandbox element.  It doesn't tell you what to do, but it does have branching quests.  Of course you're free to completely ignore them and just while away the hours mining asteroids if you so chooose.  Go to war with one of the factions in the game, or try to eliminate the alien menace that dominates a large chunk of the galaxy.  Ultimately it's up to you.\n\nIf there's one big complaint about the game it's that it feels a little empty.  You hit a wall around your late 30s where the experience points seem to take a lot longer and the upgrades are much further apart then you'd like.  With some of them being only say, a 3% to your cruising speed, leveling feels pretty underwhelming after a while.  Thankfully you get experience for doing pretty much anything in this game.  Also combatting the emptiness is the modding community which already has full game overhauls, rebalanced skill trees, new hulls, new weapons, new quests, and more.  I'd like to see even more modding for this game personally, as more content can only improve an already great game.\n\nIf you like this style of game, it's well worth the purchase price.","July 12, 2015","true","51.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

This is what I was looking for! Open sandbox space sim where you choose your own path! Oh man I don't even know where to start, so I'll give a summary of my playthrough so far:\n\nI fired it up, set it to normal and rand-gen'd some bloke to play as (ended up with a guy with a pink mohawk and a hawaiian shirt. The absurdity has grown on me a bit). And I hit it right off. The interface and controls weren't too intuitive, but not too cryptic either. I had it pretty well figured out in under 5 minutes, and started working for the tutorial guy. And he taught me asteriod mining and mission running and trading and some basic combat and and then gave me a run down of what's going on in the sector then it was a pat on the butt and off you go. That's it. You get to kick it into high drive within.. 30 minutes? Of the game start.\n\nAnd the depth of the game is great. There's 5 factions, only one of which I know well, one I have a good idea of, and one that's a mystery to me, one's pirates and the last one is the EVIL ALIENS (TM). You level up and allocate your XP points to your skills, which go all the way from asteriod mining up to PEW PEW BANG and everything inbetween. And I mean everything. There's some really weird skills in there.\n\nCombat can leap between fairly routine to very surprising, depending on how high you keep your guard up. I was doing pretty damn well off the start beating up pirates and mining rocks, so I got pretty full of myself and headed into a fairly dangerous system to rack up some XP.\n\nHa ha they beat my ♥♥♥ like a drum. I needed a bigger ship.\n\nNow, ship size isn't terribly noticable. I suppose because they'd have to zoom the screen out a lot to make a difference. It's basically just better hull, and better weapon placement. Which is a huge thing in combat. It's not so much the size of your gun, but whether or not you can bring it to bear! Some turrets point forwards, to the sides, out the back, etc! And also you have to match them up to their type of weapon. Energy/Kinetic/Missile/Mine. So, each ship has its own style of combat.\n\nShip equipment is fairly straightforward. You want bigger and better, but you need to carefully manage how much fuel and power your fuel tank and reactor can provide. The thing I like is the fact you don't need to strip old ships for parts. No, your hull is literally just another equipment slot. You just swap it out and bang, new hull same equipment.\n\nVery enjoyable and challanging at times. It's going to see hundreds of hours from me.","August 26, 2015","true","22.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","2"

I love this game so far its alot of fun and has alot of key elements that I have been looking for as far as unique and vast amounts of equipments and ships, alot of systems. Your skill points as some have said done seem to do anything but for me I wait till I have 40+ points to spend which is 3-4 levels and I will tell you there is a huge difference in the skills so you can notice improvement. Great game, fun, good music, alot of places to explore, tons of choices in ships and equipment, skills. Go mine, how about be a fighter or a trader? why not?","August 3, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Seems a little simplistic and the controls take a bit of getting used to. I crashed quite a bit until I got the hang of it down and I still am not very good at shooting down ships without a lot of misses but I have been really addicted to this game since I started playing it.\n\nYour a space ship captain and you fly around different sectors completing jobs, mining materials, and fighting bad guys to make money and upgrade your ship. There is a story line but to be honest I really haven't been paying much attention to it as I've been more focused on getting new ships and the best equipment for them. I've almost gotten the heavy cruisers, which is the heaviest ship in the game unlocked and I'm excited for it.\n\nI've found that mining is the easiest and safest way to make money and is almost always necessary as fuel to fly costs money so you can't just go from station to station without either fighting or mining to keep at least enough money to fuel your ship. Fuel is expensive so I recommend upgrading your mining equipment quickly so you can get the best materials so you an offset costs quickly so you have more money for upgrades.\n\nI definitely want to note that the developer is very active with this game. I happen to have started playing the day they released a patch that broke the game. I was stuck in the starting system and couldn't complete the tutorial to leave. They had the issue resolved in less than a day so while it wasn't the best experience, at least they are active and pay attention when issues arise.\n\nI haven't played multiplayer and probably won't as I'm more into the single player experience so I have no recommendations on how that works out but I bet it would be a pretty good time.\n\nI definitely recommend this game if you are interested in a game where you are given a ship and almost free reign to make your fortune and get the most powerful equipment you can.\n\nOnly negative I can think of that I ran into other than the update issue is that sometimes you have to end up with issues because the game is so intense in regards to fuel. I ran into a few times where I got stranded because a few systems in a row didn't have any place to refuel. Recommend you keep some power cells handy just in case. Some people may also find some issues with the slow pace of mining as well. Each instance takes about 5 seconds and you are just sitting there. Doesn't seem like much but when you only get 60 pieces every time you mine, it can get tedius to fill a ship with a big cargo hold.... this is especially prevailent when you are going for a specific ore for a mission and are only getting 2 to 4 each time and you need 350 to complete the mission.\n\nDefinitely a great game though and I recommend it for anyone that likes space ship games. Definitely not X2 as far as economy goes but its still a great game.\n","March 3","true","22.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've been looking for this kind of experience for a while, and have been disappointed by titles like the X series, Elite Dangerous, EVE Online, and others.   Void Expanse offers a much faster paced game experience that can be enjoyed by people who don't have hundreds of hours to spend making boring delivery runs.\n\nWhat really makes this game shine though is an active development team.  I played the original version over a year ago, and just recently got back into it.  There's been major improvements to add new content, fix minor issues, and whatnot.  The developers weren't satisfied with making a pretty good game, so they made it a great game.  I'm confident that they'll stick with Void Expanse and make it an awesome game.

I'm so tired of seeing Medieval Action-RPG games. It's about time a space Action-RPG game is made that I can enjoy. I've searched for space games and I kept coming across nothing but RTS space games. Void Expanse is very similar to Drox Operative but it is so much better, IMO. I can choose what I want to do, whether it is mining for a little while to get cash, or deciding to test my new ship, weapons, devices, etc., or do co-op missions with friends. It is very fun and keeps me occupied for hours. If I choose, I can host my own dedicated server and have friends join in on the fun. Single player characters can be used in Multiplayer games as well. So a Single player character can be built up and continue to be built up in Multiplayer, back and forth. Very fun game!

For a open world game like this, you would want there to be a lot to explore and stuff to find. VoidExpanse does that, with the open world freedom that this game delivers it really gives you a lot of freedom to explore.\n\nGameplayThis game seems to have all the right elements that a open world, RPG game should reallly have. Massive areas to explore at your own free will, there is no limitation or blocked off sections to limit the open world experience of this game. There is so much to explore, the amount of quests there are in this game is sure to keep you playing for hours upon hours. There is a extensive and impressive upgrading system in this game, which also ties in with the huge amount of researching that can also help you along whilst you play this game. The fighting in this game is pretty basic, with simple mechanics that you will have gained, weapons, armour, and sheilds. The sheilds and some of the weapons use a yellow energy bar, weapons such as lazers will require you to use energy to shoot. The bigger and more powerful lazers in the game will require more energy, and therefore you may have to wait for your energy to recharge after battling a few enemies. On the other hand, you can use weapons such as missiles and guns which use there own supply of ammo. Although I found that you would run out of ammo for missiles rather quickly, and would have to dock at a nearby station in order to restock your rockets. There does seem to be a multiplayer mode built into the game, although it seems that you can't bring your ship from single player into other servers to play multiplayer. This isn't much of a problem, as playign the game single player doesn't really limit or change much when you have a couple of others helping you in multiplayer servers. At first this game doesn't really seem to be a grind, you are happily just accepting quests, completeing more and leveling up as you play along. But it does seem that after a while of playing this game, it just becomes more of a grind to level up to gain skill points that you want. The missions do start to get boring, as they seem to repeat themselves with recon missions and exploring astroids and such.\n\nThe overworld itself looks very space like, with all of these galaxies that you can see in the background as you drive your ship throughout the world. The background images are quite dull and some of them really nicely constrast with the dark background. Each area you visit doesn't feel the same as before, there is a rather nice variety of different colours and backgrounds throughout the game. The graphics of each of the ships that you can get are rather nice looking, some of them have a nice light at the back of the ship which sort of glows behind you slightly as you fly around space.\n\nPro+ Open world\n+ Different types of weapons\n+ Single player & Multiplayer story mode\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Trading cards & achievements\n\nCons- After a while it begins more of a grind\n- The missions get a little samey after a while\n- Can't transfer single player ship to multiplayer\n\nResult / Final thoughtsFor what VoidExpanse is asking for, this game is definitely worth it for space and RPG fans. It's really fun and enjoyable to play, with tons of content and some simplistic fighting mechanics.

Bugs with graphics - any time I look at a sun it kills the main app loop and fps is something like 1 or 2 frames per second.\n\nI think there are some content issues as well - the space does not look alive.

Basically you are put in charge of a single ship of which can be minorly upgraded through various slots of boosters/weapons/otherwise.  There are a good deal of ships, all specializing in some area so it becomes a game of deciding what your play style is and attempting to find the right weapons/ships/addons to facilitate that.\n\nI'd started off a few times as an Adventurer, and found my focus exceedingly split between all the different avenues one can pursue.  Eventually I settled upon Prospector and that I feel gave me a solid base to build from (As it nearly maxes out the Mining Tree).  It doesn't though, seem to matter what class you pick as it throws you down the same funnel as everyone else - and nobody seems to comment or the game adjust itself for your choice outside of the points spent on builds.\n\nFactions are seemingly a big deal,  but having given a cursery look at what was to offer nothing really struck me as a place that is beneficial for someone who just wants to shoot lasers at rocks and collect things.  (There is no, straight up miners guild or anything - and of course you start out with almost maxed stats in that so in there isn't much further progression outside of spending into survivability)\n\nThere are quiet a few space stations somewhat randomly laid out dependent upon your specific world seed.  Within these places you can gather quests which fall under the basic structures "Go get this" "Go kill this" "Make sure this doesn't get killed" "Talk to this person" "Deliver this" They don't seem to particularly care who you are as it just appears randomly when you ask the station commander (Sorta wish there was a job board instead)\n\nOutside of that, there is a story that you are trying to progress, and the day to day dealings of being within a space sand box . Of which, there are limited resources and enemies in certain areas, so in, you could go on a mission in faction controlled sections and wipe out every last dirty space pirate you come across.\n\nI do find myself wishing there was the ability to do more with friendly NPC's (As basically you can only ask them the usual questions or attempt to buy fuel off them if you happen to be low).\n\nMy limited experience with multiplayer has left me a little skepitcal on that front.  As you start out as a new player in every game you enter (No carrying a ship and progress over from place to place) You are basically at the mercy of a star system that very well might be almost completely devoid of enemies or I imagine ore to mine (As stated before, things can be limited).  The place I was in, I was hard pressed to find anyone in any of the faction sections, and the non-faction sections of space were basically slim pickings.\n\nAlso, it should be known that if someone takes their game offline you lose that character and whatever progress/stuff you've accumilated. So in, seemingly less reason to tread in those waters but to hang out with friends and futz around.\n\nI've still been enjoying my time with the game so far - and while I'm not sure if they have loftier plans for the games future, though from what I've been able to gleam, they seem intent upon adding more (How much, only they, and I imagine the funds gotten from selling the game will decide).","April 8, 2015","true","35.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The combat is more or less just a "point-and-click" fight where you just have to attack your enemies until they are destroyed; it's not boring, but it may be able to be improved. The AI can also be improved as well (for example, I witnessed an AI trading frigate crashing into the back of a space station for a solid 10 minutes because it couldn't pathfind its way around it). It's integration of Workshop is of course a big plus as well.\n\nThe game's not perfect, but it's definitely worth the $15 asking price.

This is a very well done top down space arpg/sandbox game.

The combat is fast and brutal. Once shields go down, it doesn't take much time to blow up an enemy(or to be blown up). The movement is much more like a real vessel moving in space than Drox Operative or Space Rangers- directional thrust provides rotation and braking. You can choose to use the mouse instead of the keyboard for directional control, but you still have to use keyboard input to move, unlike Drox Operative and Space Rangers where movement can be controlled by mouse clicks.\n\n\nThis is an excellent game with no glaring flaws or weaknesses in gameplay for anyone who llikes space games and arpgs.","April 2, 2015","true","39.8"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","11","22","0","0"

Clearly I must like it.\n\nYou have a good reason to like it too. This game reminds me of EVE Online only in an arcade format. There is a single player mode and a multiplayer mode.\n\nIn this game you are a space adventurer struggling to deal with the aftermath of a disasterous war where your part of space is cut of after the Federation (no relation to Star Trek) destroys a stargate leading back to the heart of intersteller civilization, surrounded by a scant number of merchants, fellow stranded space adventurers, and aliens and pirates who want to kill you.\n\nThis is a sandbox game. Yes you are given quests to do to earn currency, but you get to do what you want. You buy better ships for combat, exploration and mining, making sure you got the best weapons and devices snapped on. You loot destroyed enemies, or you get looted if they destroy you. There are three play modes, the first one (I'm familiar with) is you respawn after you die but you lose your loot. The last one is permadeath where you really do need balls of iron, because when you die, you die.\n\nYou get to play in a faction, each one has advantages. There are six if memory serves. The single player mode stores a galaxy you can set the size of with a slider. I haven't tried multiplayer only because I just got the game. When I play multiplayer, I'll update my review.  Even if I hate multiplayer it won't change my recommendation because the single player mode is worth the money paid alone, with or without the discount.\n\nThe ships you get to play range from small fighters to large warships but they cost money and, if you are an EVE Online player like me, you really need to fly only what you can afford to lose. While the hulls are limited to what you can slap on for hardpoints, there is room for some customization at the device part and some hardpoints allow either a beam or a ballistic weapon.\n\nYou get to customize your character you play, gender, hairstyle, skin color, eye type, nose type, mouth type, accessory...it's limited but I'm sure the devs will add more choices...yes, that was a hint.\n\nThere's a class and skill tree where you can tailor your character's development as the character earns levels. You get to choose a class, miner, combat, etc, with some of the basic skill points aready filled on, and then as you level you earn skill points where you can allocate to parts of the skill tree, like efficiency in energy usage for firing weapons and shield operation, or tracking weapon turret time. If you played EVE Online this is going to be familar to you.\n\nThe ships move similarly like EVE Online's propulsion physics, meaning there's no Newtonian mechanics here. You coast to a stop after you end propulsion, of which there are two, RCS thrusters and main engine. In this game you move directionally using the W A S and D key and laterally using Q and E. Ships use a form of fuel which is converted to energy that is then used to power weapons, defense systems, gadgets and so on.\n\nThe game may crash in singleplayer mode from time to time but because it autosaves when you go from system to system, or dock, it's not a big inconvienence.\n\nRecommendation? This is a beautifully visual game where every control and menu makes sense being where they should be. It does not require a killer graphics card and even old laptops can play it with the tweaking of the graphics controls. Buy it. It's a fun space romp in a desolate galaxy where anything can happen.","April 5","true","46.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

After that it becomes brutally hard (in an unbalanced manner, not in a hard-but-fun Dark Souls manner), and as some have noted the mid/end-game is lacking in content. In mid to end-game your RPG skills/ship progression comes to a crawl as difficulty ramps up very suddenly (too suddenly IMHO) while remaining repetitive (combat becomes harder but there's not anything really 'new' to it - compare this to S.P.A.Z. which introduces a whole new combat dynamic (the zombies) mid-game, which keeps things fresh.) Combat at level 5 feels much like combat when you're level 40, it's just much harder. So after a while the game starts to feel like a real grind.\n\nThis game is like a cross between a prettier S.P.A.Z. and a more action-oriented Space Rangers 2, albeit in a 'light' form. It feels superior to S.P.A.Z.  for the first 10-20 hours because the basic combat mechanics work very well - I love using mines, and it's fun to find just the right weapon combo amongst a pretty good selection of weapons. However VoidExpanse runs out of steam at about level 35-40. Some of the quests are interesting but a most of them get very grindy/cliche/repetitive fast. Still, production values are higher than with SPAZ or Space Rangers 2, and combat is a lot of fun, at least for a while. If the developers put in more mid to end-game content, more high-end ship components, and did more balancing in mid/late game, and added more features like the ability to hire henchman (sometimes you're given a henchman, but it'd be great to hire and manage them at will) then this game would be AWESOME! As it is, like I said it's fun for the first 20 hours, so for $15 I got my money's worth and I give it a thumbs up.","April 5, 2015","true","28.1"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","20","41","0","0"

It needs about 5x as much content as the current selection (5x as much mission types, module and ship types, random stuff happening, etc) to be a real classic. Still, the basics are all good, combat is fun, mining and trading is profitable, there is some danger in dying, so definitely a good start. Devs seem to be working on it with full steam, so that is also good.\n\n\n+- It seems to have a more strict "storyline", with some "story missions", and the universe seem to be very static unlike Drox or SR. It is somewhat similar to SPAZ in this regard.\n+- Visuals are okay, but nothing stellar. Personally I like this, but some people might want a prettier game.\n\n+ Some missions can be solved multiple ways, which I liked very much. Fight, negotiate, or just betray the questgiver all count.\n+ Mining is somewhat entertaining and can be profitable unlike most space games.\n+ A good selection of weapons, like mines, guided and unguided missiles, pulse and beam lasers, plasma, machine gun, gauss gun, etc.\n+ Fight is also fun, if you like realtime dogfights with active aiming and such.\n\nNegatives:\n- Ships are less free to change around. Ships come with weapon hardpoints, like 2 missile and 1 laser slot, witch you cannot change. You cannot install multiple shields on a ship or anything like that like in Drox.\n- There aren't much random mission types, just mine stuff (always the same type and amount!), kill pirates, escort stuff.\n- There aren't any random events (or at least I didn't found). No "treasure maps" or ambushes or such.\n- The game world seems to be a bit empty, despite having asteroids, wrecks, pirates and such - they just wander around aimlessly, instead of actively building an empire or something, like in Drox or SR. Maybe adding radio messages and such, showing what each NPC is doing, would solve this.","April 4, 2015","true","6.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

This game is a mishmash of so many great sci-fi titles I'm just going to hilight a few of the ones they took the best qualities from. First there's the combat which for oldschool guys will remind you of a modernized Starcontrol 2 melee battle right away with its newtonian physics and fast paced action. Then in 2002 there was this great little SHUMP called Starscape which I beleive to be the true spiritual successor to this title. Look it up on Steam and watch the trailer to know what I mean. It was a blend of the classic arcade game Sinistar that threw a touch of Wing Commander Privateer's exploration, commerce and ship upgrades into the mix. Now add in expansive multiplayer that can support up to 10,000 people per server, RPG dialogue, factions, character creation, player classes, and FTL's hypnotic space opera music score on top of all of that and you've got Void Expanse. You can focus on combat, mining, salvage, exploration, you name it. The learning curve is easy to pick up, controls extremely crisp and the multiplayer features allow for PvE and FFA PvP servers. There's even full steamworks and modding support.\n\nAll in all despite the occasional crash/bug, this game is a total package and steal for the modest price tag.","April 9, 2015","true","70.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

I've only run into 2 technical problems, a pathfinding bug which is very minor, and the occasional crash (irregular, sometimes it crashes at launch, other times I can play 4-8 hours without a problem).\n\nGame uses an Asteroids (for those who remember that game) style physics system, which means that when you head in a direction, you continue to drift. You will stop eventually, but not quickly enough to warrant changing this description. Personally, I've never been fond of this style, but that is a matter of preference and hopefully a moder will give us a choice on it.\n\nThere are several tiers of ships and weapons, and there is a decent amount of customization. Ship selection isn't vast, but it is enough to have a comfortable amount of choice, and its highly moddable with ship hull mods being the most common at this point (yt-1300, and star trek mods already out). Weapon selection could also use a little more expansion as well, but again, its enough to give a decent amount of choice.\n\nThere are multiple campaign routes to take, one for each faction except neutral. Optional quests are sparse, but cover the basics, trading, mining, escort, courier, and bounty (mod available to allow the player to choose which they take).\n\nGame could definitely be fleshed out more, and a lot of things are underway, but in its current condition, it is worth the asking price. It doesn't blow me away, but neither do I regret buying it.\n\nGame does not support gamepads, or any other control method besides mouse and keyboard at this time.\n\nAlso, since this is an issue to some people, you will have to make an account for the game. Doing so consists of giving a username that is not already taken, and nothing more. This is done to make multiplayer run smoothly, but multiplayer is purely optional, creating a username, however, is not. No personal information is requested.","April 6, 2015","true","21.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

So I just started mining with the idea of getting a freighter someday, but after a few astroids it was boring and repetetive. And because you need skills for almost everything you can buy the money i made was almost worthless.\n\nSo i made another character and wanted to become a pirate. After killing a few merchants with my newly aquired canon, decided to join "The Order", because killing merchants was boring and repetetive aswell.\n\nAfter doing a few missions i was tasked to free the systems occupied by the evil alien race with the objective being "free a system connected to the system containing the "central hive". I liberated 3 systems and got bored because I needed to  do the same thing over and over again without any real challanges.\n\nSo i decided getting a better ship and after a lot of grinding (A LOT OF GRINDING) I was level 45, unlocked heavy cruisers and bought one of the biggest ships in the game and it felt like it was no different then my civ cruiser i got at the start...\n\nI stopped playing after that, at this moment the game lacks alot. It has an amazingly fun concept and I personally hope the game will lean more towards Sid Meier's Pirates in the end. At the moment the isn't worth it, but I think it's gonna improve a lot in the upcoming months","April 6, 2015","true","0.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Of course, money is needed to get better equipement to proceed with the quests. Travelling is boring, too. It is also needed and there is little fun in it and not much of a way to speed it up (well, the autopilot helps but it's stupid).

I'm still experiencing a lot cases where the game crashes on start, and occasionally during gameplay.\n\nThe combat system is OK, but there's few quests and the ones that exists are the tired old 'fetch me X number of Ys', kill this enemy, rescue this NPC.  Some of the faction quests actually involve dialog, and those are OK, but too few and too shallow. There's very little plot in this game.\n\nThe backgrounds, planets and ships and space stations are definitely beautiful, there's no lack of pretty graphics.\n\nIssues with the Gameplay:\n\nAutopilot will run into stationary objects like space junk and asteroids.  It's bad enough that it plots courses through groups of enemy ships, but it's a space game. Even if you're only allowed to move in a 2D plane the autopilot could go under or over those obsticles, or just plot a course around.\n\nSWARMS of PIRATES EVERYWHERE.  There's just too freakin' many.  Tone it down, especially in space controlled by other factions.\n\nI've had the game for 2 days, and I've already got all the best equipment in the whole game.  It appears that the rest of the game will just be an annoying grindfest and the tenuous plot isn't enough to make me want to finish.\n\nAlso a recommendation, just one jumpgate per system.  That gate should be able to send you to the other connected systems. So when you get a fetch quest you don't get blown up while the autopilot crashes you into asteroids while a dozen pirates rain fire on your ship. Then you can reward curious players that take the time to explore a system by hiding interesting things in it (and no, the alien relics that are only good for science points don't count. Interesting stuff, more stories, easter eggs, etc.)\n\nAnd more plot...some of the faction quests were nice, but there needs to be more!","April 25, 2015","false","36.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

It is definitly fun for levels 1-25 but after that, it will get repetetive as you move towards the bigger ships.

Either way,  turning the ship around quickly is important and when things get more difficult your skill (not the skill of your character) of piloting your craft will make a big difference.\nThe fact that the combat is realtime and dependent upon your piloting skill can make the game more frustrating than for example Drox operative which is turn based and the combat is similar to SPAZ.\n\nI am 7.5 hours into my second campaign, my character is level 32 and I am enjoying the game immensely by just farming pirates. I have read some of the negative reviews and I agree that the game probably needs more content but otherwise it is perfect for me. I did encounter two crashes so far which is very annoying.\n\nPros:\n- Open world "feels" open\n-RPG skills work for unlocking weapons/ships and make your character more effective. I would have been happy with just\nthe "RPG" system of upgrading my ship so the added bonus of having a skill tree is awesome\n- Combat is fun, I enjoy ploughing through  hordes of pirates/aliens\n- The different weapon systems and energy/kinetic weapons work well... seems balanced/make sense\n- Ship customization is fun, there are a lot of combination to try. The hull is just another equipment slot so you can\neasily swap ships if you want to change from your combat vessel to your mining vessel with more cargo space.\n- Hunting pirates, mining, trading is easy to do.. all you need to do is find pirates, asteroids and space stations and you are off.\n- Mods, I can't wait for the game to be out longer and having more mods to install :)\n- Price, great value for $15\n\nCons:\n- Needs more content, under extras on the main menu there is an "upcoming" button which lists all the things the dev is planning so I think we are good... also the mods will help\n- Difficulty can  be frustrating sometimes","April 7, 2015","true","47.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeysama/recommended/324260/","monkeysama","Monkeysama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeysama/","25 products in account","VoidExpanse is an arcade version of Escape Velocity.  It's a much shallower world, with a larger focus on action.  Pirates/hostiles aren't an anomaly, they’re scattered across every map like koopas and goombas, they’ll jump into any fight even when they’re horribly outmatched.\n\nThey have added XP for pilot leveling, and a skill tree to specialize your pilot, which is a nice improvement. Staying true to the more arcade feel, these rewards come fast and furious.  I’ve put in 5 hours (5 learning hours, so plenty of time reading tool tips and trying to figure things out) and am already level 35.\n\nThe ship upgrade process is also streamlined.  The hull is just one more slotted upgrade (although it does change which weapon slots are available), and there’s no weight attribute to balance things out.  So you never need to decide how to optimize one ship, while saving for another, you just grab an upgrade for whichever slot you can.  Not a lot of decisions to make, you just get the next level of your radar/fuel tank/grappler, and if you happen to switch out hulls, they stay with you.  Like the pilot leveling, these upgrades come fast.  You never really reach the limits of your ship, and set a goal for a better ship, you’re just constantly upgrading everything before you hit the limit.  I don’t know that I need a new generator, but one’s offered, so you upgrade it. You don’t really have any sense of accomplishment.\n\nThe factions are also very simplified.  There seem to be 6 total, and you're basically chosing between 2.  Pirates; Aliens that are trying to wipe out humanity; people that worship said aliens; neutrals; and then the two choices: Freedom or Order.  So far, it seems like progression of these quest lines are pretty much on rails.  Helping Order doesn’t seem to make Freedom like me any less.\n\nThere’s a nice dialog system in game, where you can ask anyone about any topic you like.  While the system’s nice, it doesn’t seem to be very fleshed out.  Most everyone just repeats the tutorial for most options, and there doesn’t seem to be much of a reward for being thorough or going deep.\n\nQuests are fairly simplified, too.  There are bounty missions to kill one particular pirate in the system you’re in (and he’s marked on the radar).  You can do rescue missions to a piece of debris in your system.  Then there are escort missions and package deliveries, which go to different systems, but there’s no concept of time, so you can just pick up as many as you want and drop them off when you happen to get to the system. There’s a cargo quest I’ve been offered a couple times, but they warn you you need a lot of space (unspecified) so I’ve declined it.  The last generic quest I’ve been offered is a mining contract, which is always for the same amount of the same mineral.   Much like the dialog system, it seems like the quests really need to be fleshed out.\n\nIn true arcade form, death is only a minor inconvenience.  Your body’s cloned (the cost is equivalent to about 1 quest reward) and your ship, it turns out, is fully insured. You lose your non-quest inventory, and that’s it.\n\nThe ship to ship fighting has some interesting mechanics, different weapons having different tracking speeds, being able to assign different weapons to different firing groups.  I think it suffers for the camera being way too close.  If a ship comes in from the top of your screen, it’s already within range of your weapons, and is only ~8 ship lengths away. If things were zoomed out, so you could play with the edge of your weapons range, it opens up a lot more tactical dogfighting.\n\nTo sum up, it’s Arcade Escape Velocity, for all the positives and negatives that “Arcade” brings with it. I’d appreciate a bit more depth at a more deliberate pace, but VoidExpanse really leans towards the arcade feel.  Hopefully they expand on the dialog tree and quest options as time goes on.  And maybe at later levels you’ll actually know you want/need an upgrade before you’ve already obtained it.\n\nLast note: I’m playing on a 5k iMac and even after lowering the video options it gets choppy in cruise mode.  It also requires a monoframework package install, and I’ve had a few freezes.\n\nHolding out hope for improvements, but as is I can't recommend this game.","April 4, 2015","false","6.8"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","2"

It has very beautiful graphics (the shading is really great), it has good controls, it has lots of roguelike stuff and also some kind of cyoa storyline.\n\nBeing 2D, it is easy to get started and get into the game. The multiplayer works fine (but not perfect). At this time of writing it mostly is a single player experience with everyone sharing the same space. You can't trade with someone or do missions together. You could of course help eachother out by helping with fights, but there is no shared loot or something. I believe though, that when you are in the same star system, everyone in your "party" gets your XP as well.\nMaybe the future will bring more multiplayer options.\n","April 6, 2015","true","9.3"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","2"

No luck.\n\nWhy should I have to be an IT expert to get multiplayer to work in the first place? I cannot recommend this game. Why can I get any other game to work multiplayer but not VoidExpanse?

The ballistics weapons are unusable and you need the skillpoints put into mining/tech to make up for the insanely sloppy controls. The biggest game design flaw is that they made the game unplaable then only slightly better by unlocking aiming technology over time. AND You CAN'T RESPEC. Just frustrating and stupid.\n\nThere is no proper controller support in what is effectively a top-down shooter. And throw in some crashes to desktop and saving glitches/bugs...\n\nTotal fail - no idea how this game is getting positive reviews.\n\nHopefully the devs will take some of the negative feedback seriously and make the gameplay tighter out of the box instead of penalizing players for not specing the right way.","April 5, 2015","false","5.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","9","21","2","3"
