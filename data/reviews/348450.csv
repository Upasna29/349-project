The developer is obviously  interested in modeling because the island is impressive in that regard, but the gameplay is severely lacking. it feels more like flying through an empty multiplayer map in dev mode than actually playing a game. there didn't seem to be any sound aside from a couple of music tracks. The game is basically an unfinished benchmark program. Only play if the graphics alone are of great interest to you. the translation issues are the least of problems here.","February 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 200 of 236 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","200","236","4","4"

I can't say the same for almost everything else.  The grammar on the notes and dialogue, for example, sound like it came straight out of Google Translate.  There are also times where sound effects just didn't register, like when an object fell near my character.  Colored text can be found plastered on doors telling you that they are locked, just to name another example. Chickens also have the inherent ability to walk through solid objects.  All of these things serve to break the immersion, which is a real shame considering how beautiful the environment looks.  In order for this game to be really worth $10, I think it needs further attention in areas other than the visuals.  "Amnesia" was able to maintain an eerie atmosphere without physically labeling locked doors, why can't "Lex Mortis"?  At present, this feels more like a broken walking simulator...nice to look at, but everything else about it just pulls me right back to reality (which is not something you want to happen when trying to play a scary game).  I can't recommend this game at present, not until the developer addresses these issues.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63BIs37cs5Q\n\n","February 10, 2015","false","2.2"," 149 of 188 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","149","188","0","10"

You try to find your father at your birthplace, the island Berdwood, which is located in Northern Europe. Soon you will discover that there are no living people on the whole island.\nThe graphics are pretty good, at least during the daytime. Due to poor lightning effects it is barely possible to see anything at night and the game is mostly played at night. There is also no flashlight or anything else which you could use to light your way somehow. The options does not include a way to increase the gamma settings.\nThere is not much music, probably 2 songs which repeat over and over again. Also the music does mostly not fit to the scenery.\nLex Mortis does not have footsteps sounds and a lot of other important sounds, which should be standard in a game, are missing. It is sometimes also not possible to understand what the protagonist says because the music is too loud and the voice is too silent.\nThe game itself is poorly translated. The subtitle includes lots of grammatical errors.\nA good horror atmosphere is also not included, actually it is completely repetetive. You go to point A, get the information that you need something, so you go to point B and after that you go back to point A. While you are searching, you have to try to avoid to be discovered by some monsters. The behavior of them is weird. Besides of their strange movement, they often find you behind the cover which should normally not happen.\nThe game is a big disappointment and not worth your time and especially not 6€. If you search for a good open world first person exploration game you should take a look at Dear Esther or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.\n\nSounds 2/10\nGraphics 6/10\nGameplay 2/10\nAtmosphere 3/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","July 26, 2015","false","1.1"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","38","44","5","1"

But after that point several stuff made me really dislike the game.\n- Everything is scripted. Very poorly scripted. Need fuel for the car? Well, no matter if you know where the fuel is, if you don't enter the car first, so the game can tell you that you require fuel, you won't get fuel. Same with notes.\n- Multiple times it's the same with the objective: You go to point A, get told you require a object, go to point B, go back to point A. Worst case (Coatown) nothing happens worthwhile, and literally is a time waste, just to artificially extend the gametime.\n- Pacing of the game is extremely forced. The moment you reach a "key"-destination (aka night points) your character becomes immensely slow, so slow that it's actually annoying than terrifying.\n- "Open-World". Yes, you can explore the entire game. But (especially villages) you just see houses, over houses - and you can't enter any of them, except the ones YOU MUST enter. Or the "sight-seeing" points (like Train Station) are almost nothing, worst case just a poorly modelled "house".\n- Enemy behavior is weird. Besides of cringe-worthy movement, they sometimes (often) find you behind cover.\n- Bugs. Quite honestly, Lex Mortis should've been put into Early-Access, not released. When the game was released it took 2-3 hours until you could actually enter the game (game was broken). Besides of some settings not saving at all, game crashing when you close it and other weird interactions in the game.\n- With the latest update (1.1) you can skip the intro. You can skip the text part, but you're still forced to watch the sequence afterwards and the character still talking about the text part - even when you get the control.\n- "Save Game" option, when hitting escape to get into the menu is 2015-most useless feature. It does literally nothing.\n- Before some updates, when you closed the game, or died (because alien-creatures catched you) you had to re-do everything, including watching the intro, this was another artificial cause of increasing the game time (total clear time was 2~ hours).\n\nOverall the game was a disappointment. It had just its graphic talking, gameplay-wise, story-wise AND exploration-wise it was terrible, besides of the poorly scripted stuff.","February 15, 2015","false","4.8"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","24","35","0","1"

Sure it looks good, but what's the point when there's no good gameplay.

That's not even the worst part of the game there's NO FLASHLIGHT REALLY WHY??? What's the point of a good looking game if you can't see anything when it's dark and when I say ''dark'' I meant pitch back, and the fact that you can't turn off the very annoying music.

Game runs on CryEngine so of course it looks somehow good. Sadly developer abused the reflection effect on the objects to the point that everything looks like its wet/shiny. No matter if inside or outside of houses. It looks weird and I'm sure it eats those few FPSs.\nOther than that design of the terrain that player needs to explore its not bad (CryEngine vegetation always looks great).\nThe real problem with the design decision is the simple fact that game is too dark. Its pitch black at night and light sources in houses dont really cast any light on the surrounding. And the player have no torch/light source of any kind.\nDue to this it gets really uncomfortable and almost unplayable and it's a shame because I was actually getting into the games atmosphere/mystery.\nI dont know if the developer is still working on this project but I would not buy it.","January 24","false","0.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

It succeeds in transitioning between "run around and find things" mode to "crawl through this spooky house" mode. The game has a fun back-and-forth between the serene exterior of the island and the threatening "horror" parts.\n\nThere were several aspects that ultimately led me to NOT recommend this game.\n-The lighting is TERRIBLE. Most of the time I was literally stumbling around in the dark.\n- The "open world" aspect is a lie. Yes, you can basically wander around the island forever, but there is NOTHING to be gained from it. There are empty villages with unfinished-looking houses that are either totally empty or are impossible to enter anyway. Most locations you can't access anyway until the "story" lets you.\n- Laughable English voice acting, although the dev did their best.\n- The "creatures", which resemble a bunch of Mothman cosplayers, hardly represented a threat to me as the player.\n- The dev didn't seem to care about sound design in the non-horror exploratory parts. The soundtrack was uninspired.\n- As for the "horror" aspect, besides a few cheap jump scares I really did not feel a sense of dread at all.\n\nThe ONE part that I truly enjoyed was where the main character is lost in this amazingly dense forest. It was the most accurate representation of a forest in a game I had ever seen.","July 7, 2015","false","3.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

One big selling point for me was the open world concept, along with the graphics, and this game does look nicee(but...) . Weeks went by before I actually sat down and played the game after purchasing it. In that time I read the reviews on steam, and watched some videos and braced myself for the worst. For the first hour or so I was actually really enjoying myself. I didn't mind the grammar errors, or the voice acting, knowing that it was one person that made the game, i'm very forgiving in that part. As time went on though the things that were wrong with this game managed to totally ruin the experience then on, and the enjoyment of the first hour was a faded mamory. This game gets buried under the weight of its own glaring failures, and is not enjoyable in any way for the rest of the game. Too be honest im kind of baffled to see so many positive reviews for this game. Did these reviewers actually play this game?\n\nI normally write pros and cons in reviews, LM has more problems than i care to remember, but ill try my best here\n\nPros:\n\nGraphics: The game looks nice\n\nSoundtrack: Its good, not great, at times it really lays on the atmosphere, especally in the beginning. I was pretty jumpy in the first house.\n\nThe Cons:\n\n- No flashlight. this is unnacceptable. imagine playing alien isolation or outlast without any source of light, youd prolly scream.\n- You cant run 75% percent of the time. the only time you can run is when your in the open area back tracking, and yeah, thats a problem in itself...backtracking.\n- No incentive to go exploring other areas.\n- driving physics are broken , i mean broken asbroken can be, the worst you will come across on the entire planet.\n- The story takes a nose dive into awfulness towards the end.\n- Theres literally only  2 times in the game were you have to sneak around a monster, im not kidding, wish i was. and it was like 1 small hallway for each.\n- everything in the game looks like it has anal lube all over it.\n- The map sucks\n- Grammar, im forgiving of this, but by the end i found myself laughing out of my chair.\n- did i mention running? yeah in any building your in it slows you down to a snails pace, even when your around a monster. Hell there was a glitch in the 1 monster area where there was like super glue on the floor and it was slowing you down for no reason , other than it was a glitch.\n- This game should still be on early access and not an official release, its reckless. Steam needs some kind of quality control when it comes to this. Im sorry but this is unnacceptable.\n- boats are so slow you can prolly swim just as fast.\n- the ending was so bad i was lost for words with my jaw dropped , and proceeding to laugh uncontrollably.\n- NO Flashlight, yup its that annoying\n\n\n. This game does not feel finished, plain and simple. There is massive potential for lex mortis to be a very good, even a great game, and for it to contribute something new to the first person survival horror genre. but this premature release kind of squandered that opportunity.\n\nIt's really a waste to see the dev put so much work into this game, only to cut it short and release it in its current state. If any of you are like me and you want to play this, I know this review won't stop you, i'm the same way, but don't be surprised if I told you so.","February 27, 2015","false","4.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

The one positive thing is the game is gorgeous in its own right graphically wise but is completely ruined by the fact that it has terrible terrible pop in issues with the trees, grass, foliage, buildings which needs to be addressed.  Many of the objects within building are overwhelmingly shiny for no apparent reason.  The English is really bad which I could forgive since they are an Indie developer in which there first language is not English but it is overlapped by the negatives within the game.  The monsters are mediocre at best and the jump scares is something you would see with a first time game maker utilizing only props from the engine.  Animals within the game disappear through rocks and I think the audio atmosphere of the game needs some work.

Being a slightly backward and childlike individual, he also likes to run at ridiculous speeds when he is out in the sunshine, and crawl about at snail-like speeds when indoors after dark (my guess is he scares easy).  He also doesn't speak - correction: MUMBLE - very good English, in spite of the fact that it appears to be his first language.  Well, I'm assuming it's his first language, because most people don't tend to talk to themselves in a SECOND language they're only semi-fluent in...DO THEY?!\n\nThis game has soooooo much potential, and I would have so much hope for it if only the words "Early Access" appeared on the Store page.  But alas...it would appear to be allegedly "finished", and updates are seemingly few and far between, so not much is liable to change between now and the end of Eternity.  For the time being, I'll officially declare it my "Number One Tech Demo of 2015", and maybe check it out again in several months in the hope that it evolves into a fully-fledged "game".  So near, yet so far...near to WHAT, exactly, I don't quite know, but I'd sure love to play it once the devs sort their ♥♥♥♥ out...\n\nVerdict: 6.5/10.","July 18, 2015","true","0.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","8","15","7","0"

It has a tremendous amount of potential but it still is too dark! I have updated drivers etc... just to make sure it wasnt my computer but though I can play every other game on STEAM I still cannot see at night in this game. This basically destroys the game. Then, I was stoked when I saw it had been updated and was supposed to be lighter but unfortunately it is still too dark to do anything at night. I literally am standing in total darkness with a few lamps that do nothing to help the situation but look like white squares on my black screen. I still hold out hope for this game-I would give it an 8/10 for graphics as the day time scenery is truly amazing and 5/10 for current gameplay issues. It is mostly a walking type game from what I can tell so far.  PLEASE  FIX!
