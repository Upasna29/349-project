Likewise, I think cute and gross share a similar line.\n\nThink I'm crazy? That's fine, I do too.\n\nBut here's an example for you: let's say your hypothetical toddler is playing in spaghetti - what's your initial reaction? You'll probably grab a camera and post it all over Facebook. "Mondays, amiright?"\n\nGreat caption.\n\nA respectable 12 likes.\n\nBut if you come home and there's a strange baby in your house covered in food garbage, grinning a big ♥♥♥♥ eating grin - what's your initial reaction? You'll probably call the police.\n\nBut is either scenario objectively grosser than the other? I think not! It's all about framing. That's why I'm coining a new term: grossdorable – the act of toeing the line between gross and adorable with the combined nimbility of the girls Chinese Olympic Gymnastic team.\n\nThat was a tortured metaphor.\n\nI'm going to make a mildly controversial statement, brace yourself appropriately.\n\nThis is the most fun I've had with a point n' click adventure in YEARS.\n\nI know, I know. Scandalous. But it's true; Bulb Boy is an absolute blast. It's intuitive, it's charming, it's creepy, it's gross, it's FUNNY... and you know, it's weirdly varied, content-wise, for a point n' click. It approaches game design in a minimalist way... but it's chockablock with unique gameplay. It's full of great pop/gaming culture references but it never feels forced or overdone. It tells a cute story, compelling story full of likable little characters despite having zero spoken dialogue.\n\nI think this cute little game is an absolute necessity for fans of point n' clicks and Halloweeny titles alike, with its grossdorable (there it is!) Adventure Time-y animation and Edmund McMillen poopy-smeared tones.\n\nYou play as Bulb Boy, a human light bulb. He lives in a ridiculous light bulb shaped home with his lantern grandpa and his weird flying dog thingy. It's all really cute and strange and the game absolutely relishes in the absurdity, never addressing the unusual setting and characters. "What, this isn't weird! It's just an typical light-bulb family living their typical life."\n\nFine Bulb Boy, I'll play along.\n\nThings are all hunky dory per the usual until bedtime, when the lights go out and sinister things... happen. Bulb Boy must then confront fears and foes alike using his greatest asset - his big bright brain. The game is set up into levels of a sort. You'll generally be confined to a single room or area at a time with a series of pickupables, interactables, and obstacles. Clear an area, move on to the next. This keeps things simple, which I really appreciate. You won't find yourself picking up some mundane object, carry it with you for two hours, then finally use it in some asinine, unexpected way. There's no pixel hunting, and virtually no mental gymnastics - which is shocking considering the bizarre... everything about this game. And if you do end up getting stuck there's a handy little hint prompt you can click on at any time.\n\nGameplay is mostly typical of the point n' click variety: pick up objects, use and/or combine when appropriate, rinse and repeat. But nearly every "level" had a weird gameplay twist to keep things fresh and interesting. In one early encounter I had to move a series of items to create a little path for an insect. And sometimes when you equip an item you end up using that item in real-time! Oh, oh, and there's even some button mashing from time to time, and fail states and brutal deaths and all sorts of things that keep Bulb Boy all bright and shiny!\n\nThere isn't much more I can say without spoiling Bulb Boy. It's... surprising just how good this is. There's adorable flashback framing puzzles, genuine spooks and gross imagery, hilarious sight gags that require absolutely no dialogue... except for the strange Simmish Bulb Boy and Grandbulb blurt out occasionally. I smiled from beginning to end playing this, and I only found myself frustrated in, unironically, a sort of water level. That aside, this is something everyone should check out - yes, yes, I know I said earlier fans of Edmund McMillen and point n' clicks and Halloween and blah blah BLAH. But I think, generally speaking, if you're a gamer (casual or hardcore or somewhere in between) you'll have an amazing time with Bulb Boy. This was made with a great deal of love and care and you can honestly just tell by looking at the screenshots.\n\nThis will be a Halloween tradition in my home same as candy, bad horror movies, and Costume Quest.","October 29, 2015","true","4.1"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","50","61","9","5"

(Skip to the last paragraph for a more detailed synopsis)\n\n\nAlthough the game is extremely short (IMO) it is still very intense and although there some plot holes,  you never get to know where the dark matter comes from, what it really is, and why it goes after Bulb Boy's family  they are easy to look over as the gameplay itself is unique and refreshing.\n\nPros:   Decent graphics\nNew and exciting gameplay\nUnique art and character design\nThe developers have a great sense of humor\nThey don't try to hard to make the game funny\nThe horror isn't completely destroyed because of the humor  I died because I held in my poop for too long, now that's scary\nThe enemies aren't recycled copies of each other\nThe platforming levels are nontheless great both in execution and design\nAlthough the story is vague, the message is extremely evident\nOption to help you throughout the game if you ever get stuck at a puzzle\nPuzzles are fun to complete\nMothdog <3\nThe old guy lives\nSoundtrack is different but appropriate at most times\nAppropriate and enjoyable fillers (flashbacks)\nUnique game as a whole\n\nCons:\nThe game can span between 2-3 hours\nThe ending can prove to be bittersweet, I still craved more\nThe price may not be worth it to some people\n\nThese 3 cons may be huge to some people but look at it this way. You can see it clearly if you check out their social media that this was more than a project to the developers. This was truly a manifested passion and was worked very hard on over the span of a year. If I had the choice of buying a game just like this, but from a major company who had it for less $$$, I would still buy it from Bulbware. I personally think it's important to help the community in anyway you can and this is one of those ways. On top of that, from buying this you get a brand new experience. Every other first party game are so predictable nowadays. With Bulb Boy, you don't really know what else is gonna happen next. I'm glad I just didn't buy another FPS or run of the mill hack and slash.\n\nIf you want to break from your regular deviation of gaming right now, I would DEFINITELY recommend this game!\nOverall I give this game a 7.5, but if I could go back in time and had the choice of stopping myself from buying it, I would instead push my past self to buy it. Even though I kinda swivle around the cons as if they aren't a huge deal, they are still significant. If you don't have the same community values as me, you probably wouldn't appreciate this whole creation as much as me. However to each person to their own.\n\nThis ends the review, hope it was helpful!","November 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"

The game is very well thought out and introduces very cool mechanics for each level. I loved stealth section or swapping between two characters to reach the goal. This type of gameplay must require a strong collaboration between coder and animator -good job guys and this really shows! Aside from technical point of view which is great the game is also tells a very cool little story of bulbs family. All characters are full of charm and humor. The gibbrish sounds totally works well here and you don't need a text dialogs to understand what is really going on. Also the cast of bad guys shows the twisted taste of the creators. Very quirky and fresh almost japanese type of horror feeling I must say. The artstyle is also very cool and corresponding well with the light and shadow mechanic. I loved all little easter eggs here and there and it's shows attention to details of the creators. The music layer complement the mood very well. As for the puzzles I never had a stagnation moment throught out the game which is good. Modern streamlining process remove the frustration of the p'n'c pitfalls. All puzzles are logical and make sense of course in this crazy world as this. All in all the whole package is completely joy to experience. The look of the game , the movement, the mood everything glue perfect in this game. So do yourself a favour and buy this gem! I'm sure it will be among cult classic p'n'c games soon!\n\nThanks again for the creators for bringing this game alive!!","November 1, 2015","true","5.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

One night your bulb house is overrun by evil and it takes your grandpa, so it's up to you to save your grandpa and get rid of the evil entity.\n\nBulb Boy is a point and click adventure game and it's very charming. I absolutely love the art style and it's insanely adorable, but creepy at the same time. It's  definitely fun just to look around and see the environment and not to mention the gruesome enemy design.\n\nGameplay reminds me of classic point and click adventure games, where if you made a mistake you would die and have to restart, but not to worry as bulb boy is very forgiving of death. You get a save as soon as you're done with a section or a puzzle.\n\nThe game in itself is really short. It took me 2 hours to finish the entire game and it's this games biggest weakness. Since I'm a veteran of the genre that might be why I was so quick with the game and maybe some you might take longer to finish, but after that playthrough you could do a second one to collect achievements.\n\nThe puzzles range from pretty simple to I have to think about it for a moment. What I like about the game is that the puzzles aren't cryptic and are pretty simple to solve. But without a doubt there are some tough puzzles, but nothing impossible.\n\nThe soundtrack is also really great. It settles the mood perfectly, even though the last acts music I felt was out of place, it was still a great soundtrack.\n\nThe game ran perfectly from start to finish and I didn't encounter any bugs at all the entire time I was playing.\n\nIn the end Bulb Boy is a fantastic point and click adventure game. The art style is amazing and the puzzles are simple enough, that everyone can solve them. The only downside to this game is the length of the game, but it tailors on what play style you have. It might take some people longer to finish than others, but expect 3 hours of gameplay.\n\nIf you want a good game for Halloween, but don't want a jumpscare fest Bulb Boy is a must play.\n\nFinal Rating:\n8/10 - Check it out\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 30, 2015","true","3.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/390290/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Bulb Boy is a horror/point and click game. Bulb Boy's house is invaded by a monstrosity corrupting everything. The aim is to save his family while surviving the encounters, which are actually quite dynamic for a point'n'click. It is possible to die, but the checkpoints are very frequent so no real loss or frustration. What I found amazing was the diversity in the scenes and interactions. Everything plays differently, and it is very refreshing. Sadly, this also means that the game is quite short (2-3h).\n\nThere are some flashback sequences that are less tense and play more like a traditional point'n'click, and are a way to understand where some of the monsters come from. However I did not find them as interesting as the rest of the game, and with the relaxed music accompanying them, they took me out of the atmosphere. The games starts easy and the difficulty ramps up nicely, but I felt like the beginning of the game had more punch and the momentum is gradually lost.\n\nInteractions are simple and easy, movements are smooth for the most part. There is a neat little idea that Bulb Boy can take his head off and either roll it on the floor, or fix it in another receptacle. This creates a lot of variety in the potential interactions that the game can offer. I just regret that some early puzzles can be solved randomly without actually knowing what is the objective yet, but this is a fairly minor concern.\n\nOh, and yeah, this game is very creepy and gross. Not just the monsters, Bulb Boy himself. If you want a cool and original horror game that controls nicely, its flaws are minor and should not get in your way. I already want more of that stuff from the dev team Bulbware!","October 31, 2015","true","6.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The puzzles are simplistic but all have a certain charm to them and still give that satisfaction when you work out what it is you need to do. The story is told through sounds more than words and it just all falls together and works. There are plenty of film, video game, comic references scattered through out the game. the humour is dark in places and also twisted in a sick kind of hilariously funny kind of way if you are inclined to the "Lenore"(Roman Dirge) type of humour.\n\nBulb boy is an excellent character and the world he inhabits has headless chicken that peek the ground with the stub of their necks and Explosive Diarrhoea that comes back to haunt you complete with Opera/Kabuki mask.\n\nWhat's not to love?\n\nGameplay is changed up by your head being placed on different bodies, keeps things interesting.\n","November 19, 2015","true","2.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I will totally recommend this game to anyone! If you haven't played it's a god damn shame. It totally reminded me of Machinarium with its creative art style and gameplay. Obviously, the art of the game it's totally different, but it's so adorable to see the design! I was a such an idiot for deleting my save game first time playing this. So I put it off for a hold for a week. It didn't really take 6 hours to complete, I would say around 2 hours probably.\n\nIt was a fun journey. It's about some creature (darkness) which is taking over your house and it's your job to defeat it. Your grandpa and dog have been taking in the progress, so you have to save them too. It's a story most people would understand, but there's no further information giving what the darkness really is or where it comes from or where it's\ngoing next. For those people who are wondering if this is horror. I wouldn't say it's horror, but it's just creepy. The game is SO gross it's CUTE and that's mainly to do with a brilliant art design of this game.\n\nIt was fun to see how much effort was put into this game. I first realised it was a Kickstarter project once the game was finished. And I have seen many bad ways to use Kickstarter projects, but this one was definitely used right. I would have loved if the game was a bit longer, but I think with a small bunch of people and a budget you can't really complain. Speaking of budget, the game is at a fair price as well and I don't feel like I've been ripped like many of the other games I own. I have always loved point and click games, and they always seem to amaze me, just because it's so different from other mainstream material.\n\nConclusion, it's an adorable game with something we all can relate to; happy, sad, disgust, angry and fear. And it makes you realise that you can express all these feelings without ever saying a »word«. I would love to »dive« into the world again with a different perspective or different objective. Expand the universe is another option. I want more! Which is one of best thing any developer to hear!\n\nPS. The game has a lot of easter eggs!","April 26","true","6.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's both Unsettling and Adorable and the visuals are cute and creepy when they need to be. The music isn't impressive but fits very well, the sound design on the other-hand is fantastic.

And speaking of atmosphere, this game has tons of it, the cartoony style strangely fits the macabre scenery and the glow in the dark effect and light sources from the boy's head and the cursor gives this game loads of style.\nThe puzzles are simple enough, you won't need a walkthrough and you'll probably finish it in one sitting.\n\nI also thought it was cool how characters and how they act and move are introduced organically, you find these traits through subtle visual cues that are implemented into the game and reintroduced later (the dog can fly, the grandpa falls asleep when walking and the boy detaches his head) This is a form of storytelling that most games and film totally botch.\nThough there's hardly a story, it works well. Your house and family are in trouble....save them. You get all this from just action and reaction, there's no dialogue and the only text in this game is the title and credits, just a neat design choice.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant experience. The game was fun and adorable, though it has a 'horror' theme, its not a particularly scary game.  You won't be scared and it won't even leave you feeling creeped out by the end. It's just a short point and click adventure that's satisfying and memorable.\n\nThere are two bugs i found but they don't detract from the game (spoilers) In the kitchen, when i picked up the knife and looked at the cookbook again, the camera panned right and i got locked onto a still image of the cookbook.\nIn the Monster, after eating the ear sausage, if you go back to the ear and click it, you can click where the sausage was before and then get immobilized.","October 29, 2015","true","1.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Bulb Boy is very distinct for its visual, characters and surreal settings. The main character, Bulb Boy, is cute and charming and seems to be innocent yet manacing at the same time. In this point 'n click adventure, you will help Bulb Boy to solve various bizarre puzzles and defeat creepy monsters in order to save his grandpa. Many puzzles are intuitive and creative but there are some that need you to look around aimlessly for interactable objects. Story and settings are quite interesting with several unexpected elements and events that make you surprised and want more. It would be better, however, if the game is satisfyingly long enough for my gaming appetite.","February 18","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I got it on sale for $8 and I'm kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at how short it was. The graphics are beautiful, puzzles are fun, atmosphere is unique and gruesome. It's a perfect game but at the current price...eh...this, at it's most expensive should be in the $5 range. I would suggest it to people that want a 2 hour game for $10 bucks, but other than that I wouldn't suggest it.","March 3","false","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I beat it in an hour. The game did not hold my attention as to the puzzles not being difficult enough. Or the story being longer somehow. I would not be opposed to a RPG styled in this way. Way to short and not nearly difficult enough.","February 21","false","2.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

It was kind of cute, but it really felt more like a good browser game you would have found on Newgrounds a decade ago; the "Flash animation" style is a long dead one, I'm afraid. Also the puzzels were very easy.\nI don't want any developer of this game to be discouraged, however. I feel they have a lot of potential as game designers, but I don't think this style is the way to go. It's too cartoony to be scary, and too gross to be charming (at least in my opinion).","November 1, 2015","false","1.8"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","21","4","19","2","0"

It's evident drugs were involved the creative process of this game, and very much so in deciding that button mashing the mouse button was a good idea. In terms of user interface design, worst design in video game history. Did this game even get tested with people outside of the developers? The curvature of the mouse is way different than the flatness of keyboard in terms of button mashing and the strain on the hand. I'm not sure if the developers ever played point and click adventures that required button mashing (like Walking Dead), but it's always the keyboard that gets used when the game requires the player to hit a button in quick succession. The mouse wasn't designed for button mashing in terms of controls. Respect and understand the craft before you try to profit off of it.","October 31, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 32 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","4","32","2","0"

But I wished I had known this would be mainly a game about poop before buying it. There are such things as giant poop / giant snotty monsters, and this was a bit too 3yo-ish for me. I am not that much into poo.\nVery short game. Nice puzzles. Go for the humour and the light effects, stay away if you're not that much into poo.","November 12, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
