I had an hour before I had to leave for work, so I thought I'd give it a go. Over an hour later, I casually looked at the clock and grabbed my coat and RAN out the door, racing in traffic to get to work on time before I was late. Barely made it with a few seconds to spare. I'm normally a guy who shows up early just because better safe than sorry.\n\nSo I would say this game is pretty spot on. Think of a group of raiders, in any game you could play. World of Warcraft, Ever Quest, Final Fantasy Online - just to name a few. Then, take that group, and think of them as real people (we all know that you picture some guy playing a chick character just to stare at pixel booty all day) - Not to say they aren't, but the perception of most people is to look at who they are, and assume everyone else is a robot or just some random nobody.\n\nThis game is full of comedy - Everything from "Killalot talks about his political views" to a person "Afking in the middle of combat to check his email" - And will remind you of what really happens. I love when I tell a tank to take over agro, and the tank (who is better geared and more able to do so) cannot pull agro off the first tank. I love when a mage just happens for wander into creature range and gets attacked wildly. I love when the healers forget to heal because they think a tank is good, and start to dps, letting the poor tank die because the fight required a focused heal at specific times. Just like in real MMOs.\n\nThis game is easily one of the more addictive games, and as my first day playing, it has already caused me to come close to being late to work AND caused me to rush home just to try to see how far I can make it after the fact.","December 12, 2014","true","13.1"," 72 of 85 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","72","85","2","0"

It's been interesting to get into the mindset of a kind of manegement position for these "raids" rather than being able to control anybody's actions directly. This game has so far been full of funny moments (when a healer alt tabs right before finishing a big heal is great).\n\nI have a couple of critisisms though.\n\nSwitching tanks mid-fight seems so difficult as to not even be worth the effort. One of my warriors has one extra piece of gear over my secondary tank and that seems to be enough for him to take aggro on every creature even if he isn't attacking it.\n\nOnly being able to make one command in a turn can get really brutal when things go wrong (if more than one player decides to switch roles, for example). It would be nice to be able to do more in a given turn even if it was only sometimes.\n\nI'd like to see more flavor in the combat log, more classes, more raid abilaties, more everything I guess. I'm excited to see if this game continues to grow after release.\n\nThis game is more than worth the price of entry and I will be spending a lot more time with it in the future.","December 12, 2014","true","3.2"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","1"

Generally, the game consists of managing a sitcom-version of a guild raiding party in an indirect fashion with breaks in between; additional characters or other amusing features that one think to find in a game about managing a guild are absent.\n\nFurther, the game is quickly over -- there seems to be only 7-8 raids -- and some of the mechanics really need some work, particularly infighting over loot. This can make the game frustrating and the game itself seems to have relatively little replayability; which is odd given that the overall concept of the game, if developed, could provide for a fascinating guild management game.\n\nThe problem with that is that the game not developed sufficiently; it is, as stated, feature light.\n\nWith that said, it's five dollars and I had trouble not liking it. For that price you get what you might expect. I would tepidly recommend the game and hope the developer fleshes out the features of it.\n\nPros:\n-Interesting concept.\n-Nostalgia.\n-Humor is good.\n-Good framework for a game; seems easily developed.\n\nCons:\n-Relatively thin in gameplay depth; feature light.\n-Sometimes frustrating.\n-Sometimes boring in some fights; cannot manage one's own character.\n-The UI is really very ugly.","December 14, 2014","true","13.3"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bimble/recommended/330620/","bimble","Bimble","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bimble/","1043 products in account","Fun game for the price.  Battles require thought after the early dungeons are out of the way, and keeping everyone happy about loot is a bit of a challenge.  Your raid's strength grows noticeably over time, and some of the character actions can be amusingly nostalgic if you've ever raided in an MMO (like someone going link dead, or a mage deciding to tank).  MMO experience can help you get a handle on strategy quickly, but I don't think it's a requirement to enjoy the game.\n\nThe character quirks don't impact the gameplay too much, so luck isn't a huge factor.  Fights boil down to managing the raid strategy (like DPS, healing, and tanking priorities) and figuring out boss patterns.  I'm impressed by how well the game simulates the raid management experience ("WHY DID YOU DRINK THAT POTION INSTEAD OF HEALING THE TANK?!?") without getting bogged down in micromanagement.  Fights can drag on at times, but hey, they're raids.  They do that.\n\nIt would be great if characters had more personality, or if raid groups could be bigger, or if character abilities were more varied.  For the price, though, those aren't complaints - just wishes for a DLC/sequel someday.","December 12, 2014","true","4.4"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

(10/9 - 11/13) That I have been talking with the maker(s?) of this game discussing the issues I'm having getting it to run, and finally we got it working with the new "debugging-" patch they added to the games betas list.\nLet that sink in for a moment, these people love their game so much, and are so willing to get it to work for those that purchase it, that even a single person like myself is worth that much time and effort.\nNow, once I've actually played the game a bit, I'll be reviewing it properly, but whether the game itself is good or bad now is now irrelivant to me; fun is subjective and will change from person to person, but dev(s) willing to put this much effort into fixing a game for you, that's the kind of work that deserves to be paid for.\n\n\nOriginal Review: I don't want to give it a negative review because the developer has been nice so far; but the game simply won't run, even on different video cards.

It is, however, not. The game is so poorly put together that it hurts to play. The whole experience begs to be excused by the fact that it's a "joke game", But the joke stops being funny after the first fight, then there is only frustration left. If I got paid 10$ every hour for playing this, I would say no in a heartbeat. If it was free, I would feel robbed. Paying for it? I will regret it forever. Give it a miss, folks.\n\nThe whole premise of leading a guild is also flawed. This game only focuses on the annoying parts of leading a guild. There is no feeling of achievement after completing a raid, just a list of items to distribute, none of which have any appearance or or quality indication on them. At the end of a raid, all you get is some numbers that you give to a member of the raid, and all the others get mad, which removes the want for more gear. There is no reason to wish for progression because the reward is just more grief.\n\nBesides getting the feel of the position of raid leader completely wrong, the game is also relentlessly boring. There is no automization whatsoever, like there would be in a good raid group. If a raid is easy, the raid leader does nothing. here, no matter how easy the boss/trash you're at is, you still have to command every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turn, which means you just sit there for 10 minutes clicking the same 2 buttons after you know you've allready won. Even turning up the combat speed to "ludicrous" it is still slow as balls, every turn taking way longer than it should. It all adds up to being incredibly boring.\n\nIf the game nailed the essence of leading a raid, the responsibility, the challenge, the strategic overview needed, and the amazing feeling of accomplishment after finally downing a boss, this would have been a really interesting experience. As it stands though, it's all just annoying.\n\nTL;DR: It's boring and lame and it sucks. do not buy","December 13, 2014","false","1.1"," 63 of 121 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","63","121","0","6"

My "thing" was to take a bunch of ragtag newbs, start them at the bottom, and see how far they could get if organized properly. I was quite successful and built several "uber" guilds this way.\n\nThis game doesn't quite capture that experience. The main things it is shorn of are cameraderie and discipline, which also happen to be the key human elements to making a successful guild.\n\nIn this game, every person who doesn't get a drop that they could potentially use gets upset about it every time. In my guilds, anyone who behaved that way got shown the door, swiftly and unceremoniously.\n\nIn this game, no matter what you do, some of your raiders wander off and do stupid things with surprising frequency. In my guilds, anyone who proved to be a loose cannon - you guessed it - got shown the door.\n\nThe rules were that on raid time I expected soldiers, and people could be as loose as they pleased outside of raids, but while the group was together everyone had to have the utmost respect for everyone else's time.\n\nIn this game I couldn't show anybody the door, because the roster of available players was so limited, and all those players came with the same flaws, so replacing someone doesn't help.\n\nNor could you give specific advice to any players to make them better.\n\nNor can you make a long term plan for individual players' development (a key reason why I was successful as a GM) so they didn't freak out when a usable drop went to someone else.\n\nIn this game, nobody is ever happy to see a drop go to someone else; at best, they are neutral. In the real thing, good players are very happy to watch the guild as a whole improve even if their own character doesn't see new pixels every raid.\n\nIn this game, your numbers go up but your raiders don't actually get better at raiding. In the real deal, the more people practice the faster and sharper they get.\n\nThere are a lot of other facets of GMing that this game doesn't bother to capture at all, but are important factors in the real thing. Players taking extended breaks then coming back. Dealing with groups of friends whose primary loyalty is to each other so they become a package deal. Husband/wife pairs and the impact of marital dynamics on the group. The child prodigies who despite being much younger than other players are so talented that you can't pass them up as raiders. There are a wide variety of player archetypes but only a tiny few are represented in this game, and even then they do not differ that much from each other. The game makes feeble attempts at modeling some of this but it's really half-hearted and not at all realistic.\n\nAs a MMO guild/raid leader, player availability was often the biggest challenge - who out of our key players can't make this raid? How do I substitute/adapt to those players missing? Do I need to find another player of the same class to replace a needed character ability, even if I'm taking a chance on someone new, or can I substitute with other classes from among more trusted players? If our best isn't available, do I aim for a lesser raid to bring others up to speed?\n\nThe absence of that factor is important, because it impacts other decisions. Do I stack my main tank first or distribute more evenly? Do I give the best loot to the best players, or the ones who show up most often, or the ones I expect to be around for the longest period of time, or just to the people who play the best on that particular raid? Each priority creates a different incentive to players, and players in turn react in a wide variety of ways to each type of incentive.\n\n\nSo... let me wrap this up. What this game is, is a good *prototype* of a guild management game. It's a prototype that needs to be developed by people with experience managing guilds, needs to have a much much deeper and more varied pool of players to work with, needs models of player development (including self-development), needs models of "real life" impact on player availability and guild dynamics, and other elements that, without which, you aren't really getting a good simulation of the real thing.\n\nThis game should give you a few hours of enjoyment as you figure it out and before you realize how sharp the limitations are. If that's enough for your few bucks, go for it.\n\nIn the end I cannot recommend the game as I think it fails its main mission of simulating what it is like to run a raiding guild. Wish rather than an explicit thumbs down I could give it a thumb kind of wagging to the side hoping to go up but lacking the willpower.\n","March 28, 2015","false","36.3"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","10","18","3","3"

I have enjoyed every hour I've spent on this game.\n\nThe developer is great about listening to the community, fixing bugs as they're found in a timely manner.\n\nI STRONGLY RECOMMEND not reading a guide before playing, since a major part of the gameplay is figuring out each boss' mechanics on your own.\n\nEssentially, IAW is a puzzle with multiple solutions. Which raiders you recruit, your group's class spread, balancing loot distribution, everything plays a part in your success, and there isn't a single 'right' answer. Do you take two rogues for higher damage, but knowing morale might suffer from loot disputes? Do you take two wizards, knowing they'll deal high damage, but have trouble swapping targets? Do you take a bard for the buffs or replace them with a different class?\n\nI've played through the game with a lot of different spreads. Once with three warriors, once with only one, sometimes I take a bard, sometimes I don't. Once I took two druids, even. It's all about figuring out how the group will interact and doing what you can to keep things balanced.\n\nPlus the humor is great. It's amusing even if you don't get the references, but is pretty great if you do.\n\nSo microwave a burrito, turn on voice chat and grab the rum: It's time to go raiding.","April 28","true","223.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Places you in charge of distributing loot, recruiting new members, and leading your guild through progressively harder fights that will cause you to wipe if you don't adapt your strategy,\n\n- You will appreciate how the game is presented and the references shown if you happen to play MMOs (especially World of Warcraft).\n\n- The price tag. At $4.99 you can't really go wrong. You can purchase the game merely for nostalgia purposes and still feel satisfied.\n\nCons:\n\n- The classes that characters are presented in It's A Wipe feel somewhat restricted and specialized. While this makes the game easier to play and manage it can make playing the game seem too simple (If you're a Rogue you can only single target damage. If you're a Mage you can only AoE damage, ect.)\n\n-  While the overview for each guild mates' personality and needs is a nice feature, the social interaction amoung guild mates is lacking.There is no interpersonal aspect between the guild master and his guild mates other then some reoccuring flavor text that happens during the raid itself. The social part of managing a guild is just as important, if not more important, then the raiding itself. Having a relationship and knowing each guildie is something that simply can not be done through the automated skip sequences shown in game.\n\nOverall the game for me personally has been a great return on my purchase. Its a wonderful time passer as it doesn't require you to stare at the screen. You can do other things while it plays in the background without fear of messing up too bad (for the most part). I would love to see a more fleshed out game (with a more fleshed out price tag to compensate) that had more complexity. The game has very strong potential as a starting point for a much more involved adventure/manager/socialsim game.\n\nTl;dr\n\nThe game is priced appropriately for the content it contains. Although features may seem lacking and it can be repetitive at times, it is a must have purchase for anyone who has Raided in MMOs and wants a light hearted, nostalgic strategy game to play on the side.","December 30, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So while there is a little fun to be had it quickly becomes a little tedious and repetitive.\n\nAnother issue is that the combat is very basic. Imagine Final Fantasy Style turn based gameplay but gameplay you only control via orders. Now while this sort of replicated being a raid leader the simplicty of the combat coupled with that fact you dont actually have a character yourself you are almost a guild manager watching over another players shoulder means that it kind of falls a little flat.\n\nThe low rez graphics do not help. I am sure the hand drawn artwork could have been scanned into the game at higher rez.\n\nThere is def some potential here and its not awful for the price by any means but I feel a few tweaks could make this a fantastic little management style game.\n\nFor a video look at the first 15 minutes of the game please check out my video below.\n\nhttp://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/literal-first-play/141217_its-wipe-literal-first-play","December 16, 2014","false","9.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Before you dismiss this simply because it's a negative review - take note of the hours played on positive reviews. 2 hours here. 4 hours there. I personally want more out of the games I play, hence the downvote.\n\nThe primary draw of this game - the campy feeling that you're raiding with MMO players - is disappointingly shallow as far as content/depth/replayability. Seeing one of your healers AFK because of a "Bathroom emergency caused by too many Hot Pockets" is amusing the first time you see it, but not the third time it happens in the same raid. I progressed quickly from "Haha! That is SO World of Warcraft!" to "Ah, that one again." The game does well capturing the annoying and tedious aspects of raid/guild management (attention-starved guildies, loot jealousy) - so well that dealing with these issues feels like  the actual chores that they are and not much else. With the charming "MMO personality" aspect exhausted almost immediately, I was left with only a game of a game that quickly became boring.\n\nFights are slow, the loot system is underwhelming, and the mechanics can at once feel sparse and clunky - there is apparently no taunt ability for tanks, so the best way for your main tank to drop threat seems to be spending your entire turn switching him to a DPS spec, then back to tank, then when you want your pimrary tank to regain threat, you put your off-tank to DPS, then your off-tank to tank. If it sounds tedious or clumsy, that's because it is.\n\nIt's not so much that it isn't worth $5, it's that there are many other games that deserve your money more than this one.","January 4, 2015","false","2.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Most raiders are happy if bosses are downed and loot is gained, the amount of moral never goes up due to actually finishing a raid in this game while not getting loot drops moral a significant amount while gaining loot gives barely anything to compensate for the amount lost. an example is 3 of the same type in a group  3 of the same item drop one for each of them but as i have to give each one the loot the first person has a moral boost of +2 the other 2 get negative moral if they need the item as well  ( one of my guys got -14 moral due to this ) then you give the next one their item they get +2 the first person does not change and the third gets another -2 finally when given his item he gets a +2  so in the end im left with negative moral on  a person when all 3 should have gotten a +2.  in my case I had one with -12. To the makers of this game please code things a bit better I do not know if you actually have raided for a long period of time or just decided to mock up a game that mimics raiding, It is done well but the moral part is a big bad one to have in there as you do.\n\n\nTLDR the moral is crap downing raids and getting loot should be huge bonus  to off set moral loss to no loot.","February 5, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The glory days of raiding have passed, and though you can still find it if you look, I believe most people have noticed the time and money-sink that they usually turn into. Sometimes I do miss those days, I spent 7 years in World of Warcraft, so it’s hard not to look back fondly… There were some great PvP moments that make me wish I had been youtubing back then, but overall the stress of not getting that drop you “need” detracts a lot from the pure joy of the game. This is what makes It’s A Wipe so ingenious… You still get to enjoy the feeling of an MMO-raid, but you aren’t going to rip your hair out if something for your class doesn’t drop this week. Herding around your team of 10 to try and defeat a raid boss is harder than it sounds, because even though you’re supposed to be in control, this simulates a real life raid by having people go AFK to check their emails… Sometimes missing a heal when it’s most critical. Obviously the humor is there, the concept is interesting… But there are some fundamental flaws, let’s get into that while we look at It’s A Wipe.\n\nThere are nine dungeons in this game, which all offer their own challenges, and will require different strategies to beat. If you’re used to managing a raid, setting up primary tanks and target order shouldn’t be a problem. The real strategy comes once the fight starts, since you’ll need to realize when to change gears before it’s too late. Did the mob get an early crit? Spam heals before he drops the tank! Is AoE damage overpowering your casters? Maybe it’s time to retreat and bring an extra druid. The recruiting system has potential, but could use some work. Currently the only skill I’ve seen is Battle Rez, and the only perks Alchemy and Herbalism (both serving the same function). It could get quite interesting to have a few more in the mix, or even just a couple guys with no skills having upgraded gear available. As it stands though, sorta bare-bones. There are a variety of items in the shop, but you’ll honestly only be buying the potions unless you don’t feel bad about embezzling guild money into a sweet mount or companion pet, which isn’t visible.\n\nBesides fighting the bosses, and people derping away in combat, you will be forced to worry about the morale of your guild. You know that rogue that you dragged through three dungeons? Well, he’s upset about the one drop he didn’t get, so he’s decided to leave the guild. I know, I know… It was you that geared him up. I’m sure you’ll have no problem gearing up another one right? Riiiight? Well, yes I do. Even the players who say they don’t care about loot under the personality tab secretly care deep down. Some days you will need to while away some hours chatting with your guild members, listening to their problems, and boosting their morale… This will upset guild members who “demand attention” under the personality tab, though. The entire game presents an intricate balance that I find quite intriguing, and quite difficult… Even on the “normal” setting. But then, when was a raid (or guild management) ever supposed to be easy?\n\nOn the downside, there is very little actual gameplay to speak of. It’s a great game for when I don’t want to really “play” a video game… But don’t feel like vegging out on Netflix either. You set up the roles for the guild, and unless something goes terribly you’ll usually just be clicking “Stick With The Plan”. The humor isn’t engaging enough to hold me during EVERY round of combat, so sometimes people will change roles or switch rows without my noticing… Easily leading to a wipe if not corrected. The art style, while nice-looking, is not animated in any way, nor are any upgrades reflected on the character model aside from increasing their stats. It’s an interesting game that lacks a few key fundamentals during execution. The raids are well-designed though, and switching up classes between playthroughs offers some nice replayability. It can certainly scratch that itch I didn’t remember I had, but there is lots of room for improvement, and while it won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, the price is low enough that I’d say it’s worth giving it a chance.\n\nSummary: A MMO guild-management strategy game with plenty of potential.\n\nFinal Score: 6/10 for raid designs and replayability. 8/10 with more perks/abilites.","December 14, 2014","true","3.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Finnmark/recommended/330620/","Finnmark","Redhotviking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Finnmark/","205 products in account","Feels like it was finished to quickly; a good idea just not exectued as well as it should have been.\nWorth the money? yes and no, if you like to micro manage things then sure but you could also just get the game Adventure manager and get basically everything this game has to offer but with better ways to make the characters train and improve with level and gear. With chances of death and so on.\n\nThis game is about as mentioned running a guild in a EQ or WOW like world; you need tanks 2 of em, you need clerics that are single target healers 2 of em, 2 rogues because melee dps is quick and steady, 1 wizard for single target nukes, 1 mage for minor aoe dmg for those fights where it actually helps to make their healers target something beside themselves; (note I have not seen any real other reason to have a Mage than this healer interruption like effect) and 1 druid for the buff spells they have and their tiny aoe heal and 1 bard (bard is a light dps melee fighter that can give mana, hp, accuracy, damage to melee or spells randomly each round)\n\nI played it on RP mode which is hard setting (mainly because I am an roleplayer) and I managed to deal with a few raids. The annoying thing is the various personalities and how things are put up, you have those that do not like loot; but they still suffer moral damage for not getting loot but only gain 1 morality for getting it. This makes you forced to chat with them, and this makes you unable to raid.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I think it is lacking somethings to be a finished product.\n-note what follows is suggestions to fix the game with some information about the game-\n\nThere should be phases to each day\nPhase 1 , 2 , 3\nPhase one: The GM (You) speaks to a team member, send team members out to train proffessions like alchemy, herbalist ect up\nPhase Two: The Raid it self\nPhase Three:  As Phase 1.\n\nThis would let you control better the various personalities of the guild and not hope to recruit Hard core raiders that are loot hungry because those are the personalities you want in the game.\n\nAlso making guildies train various proffessions would make better for ensuring potions in the raid, perhaps had a blacksmith and enchanter skill as well for more effects and so on, but so far I have only seen herbalisem and Alchemy.\n\nSecond\nLoot list: after killing a boss there are no loot list of what you are getting, you get 1 and 1 item delivered to divide out among characters and it makes it harder to keep some personalities happy. If you got a weapon rogues and warriors can use, a shield only warriors can use a plate warriors can use, then it would be better if you knew all 3 items before starting to hand it out. As you hand out various items the others that do not get something, or get passed over for loot more than once get more unhappy.\n\nI know this game is about maintaing a guild for laughs and giggles while fighting hard bosses (which isnt that hard if you have ever raided in a mmo since you know what you need)\n\nThe fights are also meh, I would like more Final fantasy like control over the various classes for this game to be good.\nInstead you must each turn choose what they should do which is 70% of the time: Stick to the plan aka they do what they are meant to do; tanks tank, dps dps and healers heal. Thats really hard! oh my gawd thats stressful.\nthe other 30% is mainly change roles or rows. The NPC in your guild might suddenly DPS mage decide he wants to tank, or healers wants to DPS. so then you change their roles again and swoosh they suddenly do their job again, the other times is they wander forward or backward and you must change their rows. Now Hug the boss and dont stand in the fire are also ways to move your people out of boss attacks and so on, but is not really that much of an challange.\n\nNo in all fairness the game was not done well, it could have been so much better.\nWith a Final fantasy Fight - Ability - Item option with each character, the GM commands between turns to make them move, change roles ect. More Options to gear up characters with skills like blacksmthing, phases during the day before raiding.... there are ton of options to make this game fun. As it is now? A mess of mediocer mess that is a shadow of what it could have been.","December 28, 2014","false","1.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

But not a four dollar chuckle.  Refunded.\n\nTaking the night off gives everyone a point of morale.  I would think if you had seriously dedicated players this would cause a morale drop.\n\nTalking to one person for the night increases morale for that one person, but decreases more morale when you add up the penalties for all other characters.  And I didn't recruit any drama queens either, based on character descriptions.\n\nLots of useless raid commands you will never use, that are there just as a joke.\n\nSwitch Tank command doesn't seem to do anything when I use it.  If it takes time or a dice roll, there is no indication.  Just nothing happens, and the tank who I wanted to switch out is mowed down.\n\nAfter 20 minutes, obviously long-term strategy is to take 2 each of warriors, clerics, druids, wizards, thieves.  You can then alternate drops and hopefully keep people happy.  Take a nights off when you have to, to give +1 morale to everyone.\n\nGame is too boring to continue playing.  What little enjoyment can be had from this game, is eclipsed by the enjoyment that can be had by playing a better game.\n\n","December 26, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I remember during my MMORPG days (long behind me) watching the chat while frustrated people waited for the cleric or tank to return from picking up fast food, or the absolute rage that would occur when someone with a terrible connection went link dead in the middle of a boss fight. This game tries to simulate that, but it does so poorly. For example, when Healzaur's cat walks across the keyboard, they miss a turn. When Sir Killzalot runs out to get a burrito, he misses a turn. When MagicMan goes link dead, he misses a turn. That's it, that's all that happens, when it would be easy to have each event do something differently. Cat walks across keyboard? Hit/Heal/Attack wrong monster/player. Leaving for a burrito? Takes longer than a few minutes, that should be a few turns right there. Goes link dead? Leaves the raid indefinitely, but dosn't take any damage. That's the raiding I remember, but sadly this game dosn't even take it that far.\n\nThe social aspects are also lacking. When Burninator and Sing-a-long discuss politics, it should have an effect on their morale, but it does nothing. It's just pointless flavor text that reminds me it could do something, but doesn't, especially given the odd morale system in this game. The fact that your guildies are selfish arses when it comes to handing out loot is a plus, but will sometimes leave you scratching when your head when taking something for guild funds does nothing for player morale, but giving an item to a player its best suited for causes a drop in morale across the board. Then there are the times when people are feeling neglected, even when you just spent the whole night talking to them, and everyone else is getting upset you won't talk to them, like you're the only conversationalist on the planet or something.\n\nAgain, I'm not someone who cares about graphics, and the game is worth about what is being asked for it, but if your looking to recapture that sense of leading a guild to disaster because raiders and responsibility rarely mix, you sadly won't find it here.","January 15, 2015","false","13.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I didnt use any type of bad words or offense. Instead of talking to me to try to solve the issue, they have just permanently banned me with the comment: "idiocy". I am really surprised about how its possible these type of  people are managing a game and a support forum with such actions, without worrying about their users and game bugs.\n\nIm sorry but now I am going to develop the same game in pure HTML5 for free for all, with a lot more features. Next time they will think two times before abusing its power with a non sense ban for a customer who just wanted to know a way to fix an issue.\n\nBy the way, about the game, I really like it and the idea behind it and I think it would be worth it if there were real support with clever people which really helps its users. The game concept is good, and however the graphics are a bit clunky or poor, they feel nice for what it is, a game made from an independant game studio. The Menu however is one of the worst part of the game and you feel totally lost once you begin the game. The musik is also horrible and repetitive and I ended up disabling it and listening to my own. The characters balance is good, however it needs some tweaks for some classes and bosses. The overall impression is that its a good game and a good idea, but it still needs a lot of improvements and a lot to be added to the final game. I would really recommend it if there wasnt such type of non sense support and developers who bans you after submitting an issue.","December 31, 2014","false","15.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","2"
