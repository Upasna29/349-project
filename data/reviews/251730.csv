It’s bigger and better than Grimrock 1 in every regard while staying true to the  feel and gameplay concept of its predecessor.\n\nNot surprisingly Grimrock 2 is still a dungeon crawler in the spirit of games like Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder. You move your party of four characters through the gameworld using a grid based movement system,  solve puzzles and kill monsters in real-time combat along the way.\n\nSo what did change since Grimrock 1? Quite a lot.\n\nInstead of a single, linear dungeon you now have a semi-open world with beautiful outdoor locations and lots of different dungeons to explore. And you can explore them in almost any order, so if you get stuck on a puzzle you don’t have to check out a walkthrough guide to proceed, instead you can go somewhere else and come back later with new ideas or hints in your backpack. One other advantage of it is the games' increased replayability – in Grimrock 1 you maybe missed a few secret areas while fighting your way through the dungeon, in Grimrock 2 you can finish the game without ever seeing a good part of the gameworld.\n\nCombat is much more challenging now, enemies move and react faster. Their AI was improved as well so many of the cheap tactics that you could use in Grimrock 1 don’t work anymore.  Single, slow monsters can still be defeated quite easily using the ‘strafe and run’ tactic, but there are more than enough challenging fights with multiple and/or fast enemies.\n\nThe UI and some of the gameplay mechanics were overhauled as well. The skill system is more versatile and makes more sense now, alchemy is more useful as there is a larger variety of more powerful and interesting potions available, there are new weapon types like firearms and many other detail changes.\n\nAnd of course there is much more content – the game is easily twice as long as the first game, there are more different dungeon types, beautifully crafted outdoor locations,  more different weapons, more different enemies, more puzzles, more everything.\n\nIf you are interested at all in the genre this is a must-buy. It doesn’t get any better than this…until Legend of Grimrock 3 comes out.","October 15, 2014","true","131.1"," 697 of 723 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","697","723","4","19"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NikoKun/recommended/251730/","NikoKun","NikoKun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NikoKun/","279 products in account","Legend of Grimrock 2 is a perfect sequel! Stands beautifully on it's own, and expands on all the greatness of the first. Best of all, instead of exploring a single dark multi-level dungeon, now you get a whole island to explore! Each area filled with it's own dungeons, and each dungeon filled with challenging puzzles and secrets. I dare say that there is almost a Skyrim level of content here, as far as exploration and secrets go. And they've even fixed the some of the silly issues/exploits that sometimes made the first game too easy. Once in a rare while I even got the feeling that the game was trolling me a little, in a fun way tho.\n\nFor those that don't know, Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawler, in the style of those old 90s D&D PC games like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld; Except with beautiful modern graphics, and all the benefits of modern game-play mechanics (there's even a day/night cycle on the island). Movement is sorta grid-based like those old games, but movement and combat happen in real time, not paused-turn-based. This creates an interesting hybrid of old school movement-rules, mixed with real-time stat-based cool-down-turn combat. If an enemy is too strong to face head-on, you can kite them around and try to dodge their attacks, but you also have to stop long enough to land your own attacks. You level your character's stats and skills just like any other stat-leveling RPG, and thankfully Grimrock's stat-system is easy to understand, and works exactly how you expect. Just like the first Grimrock, stat management is satisfying and fun, if that's your thing.\n\nLegend of Grimrock 2 does quite a few things better than 1. Not only are the locations, puzzles, and monsters more varied.. They've also GREATLY improved the monsters' AI, to the point where it's DOWN RIGHT SCARY how intelligent they can be. They did this to make monsters more challenging, because in the first game once you learned how to kite around one monster, you could pretty much do the exact same thing to every other monster in the game, to the point where stats would become less important because you could just manually dodge around everything.\nLoG2 "solves" that problem, by making the AI more clever, varied, and unpredictable. Try to kite around the wrong monster, and he might see it coming and have a counter attack ready for you, or they might ambush you with a special ability you've never seen before, or sometimes even just start running away, so you have to chase to get your experience points. Now it's a perfect balance of needing to have good character-stats, a good strategy, and needing to know/learn each monster's behaviors. Kiting around monsters is still an important aspect to combat, but it's no longer an easy-win strategy, by any means.\nThere's also a few non-standard enemies, who's AI seems to be on a whole separate level from the rest.. That's where it starts to get freaky.. I wont spoil anything, but the way these things behave sometimes, at least in comparison to the other monsters, you'll swear they're really alive!\n\nGrimrock 1 took place entirely inside a multi-level dungeon. It was huge, and each few levels had their own theme for the walls, and sometimes their own set of monsters. It was great at the time, and enough to keep you exploring, but if LoG2 only offered us that again, I think it would have gotten old/dull fast. Luckily LoG2 gives us waay more to explore, the whole island of Nex! With outside locations as well as underground ones, forests, beaches, swamps, even the occasional castle and underwater area, and I'm not even listing them all. Oh, and the outdoor areas, while allowing you more freedom to explore and things to look at, still have a great dungeon-layout feel. The locations and visuals never get dull.\n\nBottom line, Legend of Grimrock 2 is a great game, that deserves way more recognition. It's every bit as good as a big-budget mainstream title, and is WELL worth your money! It will keep you solving puzzles, fighting monsters, and exploring for at least 20 hours, more if you're hunting secrets, and it manages to stay fun and addictive the whole time. And like Grimrock 1, The puzzles and riddles, while challenging and sometimes quite elaborate, give a great sense of accomplishment when solved, and reward the player with cool loot or new areas.\nIf you like this type of game or the general genre, certainly give this one a shot, it wont disappoint. If you're new to the genre, both LoG games are a great place to start. ;)\nAnd if you liked the first one, what the heck are you waiting for?!","October 16, 2014","true","44.4"," 182 of 189 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","182","189","3","1"

Fixing all of the first game's minor woes (like the skill system, now completely reworked to be much more flexible and less exacting), it brilliantly survived the transformation from a straight dungeon crawler into a more open-world type of design, going for broader rather than deeper dungeons in a rich (and sometimes genuinely surprising) variety of environments while still keeping everything tight and focused: exploring an island where everything is related to everything else, hidden paths tie it all together and nothing is quite accidental.\n\nWith the addition of multi-level maps to really amp up the complexity of puzzles and more varied enemy types to spice up the fighting, Legend of Grimrock 2 is more than just a worthy successor to the brilliant first game; it's an expansion on everything the first game promised and delivered. A huge, beautiful, clever and fantastically polished RPG experience and easily one of the best games I've ever played.","October 21, 2014","true","32.2"," 143 of 149 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","143","149","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poetisland/recommended/251730/","poetisland","PoetIsland","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poetisland/","482 products in account","Best Dungeon Crawl Ever\nAlmost Human has surpassed not only the original but every grid-based dungeon crawler I've encountered. My friends would lament the passing of the grid-based dungeon crawls and fondly remember "Dungeon Master", "Eye of the Beholder", "Wizardry", "The Bards Tale".  Few will review this game and not re-count how amazing those games were to those who remember them. I think this game doesn’t just build upon the classics it surpasses their accomplishments. It’s the finest grid dungeon crawler ever made.\n\nI loved the original Grimrock, having myself given up on the style years ago, it was like meeting an old friend from high-school. It was stylish and fresh, but like many a first outing, you spent your entire time delving to the deepest level of the dungeon only to find the game itself lacked depth. The fighting tactics were simple “square-dancing” and the magic system was a little sparse. It was an adventure but from a gameplay standpoint it lived in the shadow of former classics. It was wonderfully atmospheric and playfully told but not as grandiose or sprawling as the later Bard's Tales or Eye of the Beholder sequels.\n\nThis game does away with the limitations of scope imposed by the original and improves upon the gameplay fundamentals of what made this game great in the first place. The fighting, monster design, artwork and music have all been significantly improved upon.  It's significantly more open and the artwork on display during outdoor sequences is beautifully rendered.  Music and sound design sets the tone appropriately and is wonderfully epic in tense moments. In a lesser game the grandiose pretentions would seem bombastic but the effort you have to put into defeating the game makes it feel like your genuinely overcoming huge obstacles.\n\nCharacter generation is more interesting but still simple enough to avoid being paralyzed by the tyranny of choice.  Puzzles and secrets are everywhere. You'll start tripping over hints and clues as soon as the game hits its stride. Many puzzles are straightforward once you understand what is being asked of you but Grimrock is coy about showing you the way. Normally this would be a recipe for some very impenetrable and time-consuming exercise in guessing what the developer intended for you to do;  In Grimrock the puzzles reward observation and careful guesswork but not baseless guessing.\n\nAfter the simple fundamental tutorial puzzles are concluded, Grimrock avoids puzzle designs I’d seen in past games including the original. There is no laborious map-breaking teleporter maze puzzle. It seems grid based dungeons  ALWAYS have a teleporter maze puzzle and I’ve seen many that are needlessly miserable. Grimrock II consistently finds new ways of creating puzzles with switches and pressure plates with less reuse of puzzles veterans will have seen many times before.\n\nFighting is more fluid generally and many fights are more memorable and unexpected.  You still have to abuse the grid system to succeed in fights but it's made less easy by how many encounters are staged. Enemy types behave very differently and many need specialized tactics to defeat efficiently. The introduction is still gentle, the middle is tense, and the end-game is full of surprises. Combat was rarely tedious except for backtracking which except for those trying to wring every secret from the game isn't too excesive.\n\nIt’s an amazing game. I’m looking forward to the next installment already but for right now I’m happy to have experienced a great game.","November 2, 2014","true","96.4"," 128 of 130 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","128","130","0","6"

Improves on the first game in every way. Incredibly challenging. Lets us go outside!\n\nRead the full, and lengthy, review below!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiiNXd8J8JE\n\nIs it Adventure Worthy?\nLegend of Grimrock 2 is an old school grid-based dungeon crawling role playing game wherein players take control of a party of four prisoners that survive a shipwreck and wash up on the mysterious Isle of Nex. They soon find out, however, that they are not alone and to make it off the island alive they have to overcome the challenges devised by the ominous mastermind of the island.\n\nAfter playing around 10 hours (and counting) of Legend of Grimrock 2 I can tell you without the shadow of a doubt that the game has managed to take everything that I loved from the first Legend of Grimrock and somehow make it better. Almost Human Games have given us extra flexibility and variety when creating and setting up our party with new races, classes, abilities and perks, an expansive and open world to explore and survive in with a full day and night cycle, new multi-tiered zones ranging from tropical shorelines to rat-infested mines, lush jungles, to creepy graveyards, overgrown ruins to long forgotten tombs, ancient temples to poisonous swamps and then the freedom to move between them all at will and with ease. The game's engine handles the great outdoors wonderfully, too, and it all looks much better than I thought possible for a game of this type. There are now more secrets, puzzles, riddles and items than ever before and then, most importantly, the same great, addictive and thoroughly challenging old school style of gameplay and combat. Progression through the main plot of the game is done in a non-linear fashion that rewards players that take their time, explore and immerse themselves fully.\n\nGrimrock 2 also features a built-in Dungeon Editor that seems a lot of fun. I've only briefly tested it but in the 15 minutes I spent using it I was able to create an actual dungeon I could walk around in. I plan on sinking some time into making my own content for the game once I've completed it.\n\nWell, Is it?\nAll of that said and after playing an unhealthy amount of the game over the past couple of days I can say with much surity that Legend of Grimrock 2 is well worth your time and definitely worthy of a grand adventure! This game will appeal to long-time fans of the series, and now almost extinct genre, and newcomers alike. Although, it must be said, both of the aforementioned groups will still find themselves struggling with some of the enemies, challenges, puzzles and riddles presented to them during their time on the Isle of Nex.\n\nCheck my likes and dislikes below!\n\nLegend of Grimrock 2 was developed and published by Almost Human Games and is the sequel to 2012's Legend of Grimrock. If you don't own and haven't played the original yet I recommend buying the Legend of Grimrock Bundle and playing the first game before the second, it is also a great experience and will let help you hit the ground running in Legend of Grimrock 2.\n\nLikes / Dislikes\nHere's my quick(ish) list of Grimrock 2 likes and dislikes. I didn't include everything in here, but hey, should still be enough to get you informed.\n\nLikes:\nNew Party Creation System - Grimrock 1 had four races, three classes and only a handful of abilities to choose from. Legend of Grimrock 2 has a total of five races, eight classes and a large number of abilities, traits and more. You get to create a much more varied and fun-to-play party.\n\nFreedom - After a brief introduction area you are thrown into a incredibly (for this type of game) large open world to explore at your own pace. This game is as open world and free as a first person dungeon crawler and grid based game can be and it works great. Is one particularly challenging puzzle or fight getting you down? No problem! Just leave it for later and try something else in the mean time. You get to go where you want, do what you want, fight what you want and loot what you want when you want.\n\nThe Great Outdoors - While playing through the first Legend of Grimrock I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like, and look like, if we could actually exit the dungeon and see the great outdoors... Wish granted! As I said above in Legend of Grimrock 2 we get to explore tropical shorelines, lush jungles, creepy graveyards, overgrown ruins, , ancient temples, poisonous swamps, long forgotten tombs, dungeons and mines, the beds of rivers with actual water in them (yes, underwater exploration is now a thing... see below.) and much more.\n\nMore Depth - The level design in Legend of Grimrock 2 has been improved upon greatly and levels can now be multi-tiered both indoors and outdoors. Why is this important? It all just looks that much better and feels that much more expansive when exploring. Makes for great, and confusing, puzzles!\n\nDay / Night Cycle - You thought walking around a dungeon or mine was scary in the dark? Try a cemetary, or a poisonous swamp or even the bed of a river you just accidentally fell into... Night time in Legend of Grimrock 2 is great and terrifying all at the same time.\n\nSecrets - There's always something more to find out there, trust me. With the game now being as open world as it is there are just so many more opportunities for hidden caches of treasure or secret areas than ever before and it truly is satisfying uncovering all the no doubt long-lost secrets.\n\nThe Challenge - Legend of Grimrock 2 is not easy. Even on the easiest difficulty setting the game can be brutal at times and I personally think it is for the better. Whether you're being teleported into a room full of face-eating zombies or whether like five swarms of killer wasps are spawning on top of you... It is always an exhilirating and ultimately rewarding experience to try escape with your party, and sanity, in tact.\n\nA Better Map - In a game with as many secrets, hidden areas, puzzles and riddles as this it really, really helps to be able to put your thoughts down somewhere before losing them and the updated map is really great for that. The new visual style of it and the fact that you can have the all of the sprawling open world visible in one place is also kinda great.\n\nThe Sound - The Legend of Grimrock 2 sound and soundtrack is just absolutely brilliant. I honestly don't understand how they do it. I recommend playing the game with a headset turned up nice and loud. Also, the main theme.... Chills! Every time I listen to it.... CHILLS!\n\nThe Dungeon Editor / Custom Dungeons - SO GOOD! Even a map-making newbie like myself can actually throw something relatively decent together in no time at all and then, conveniently, share it on the Steam Workshop!Dislikes:\nThe Island Master - He's a real jerk. Play the game, you'll understand.\n\nWater - Wait, what, you're scared of water? HAHA! No, really, trust me on this one I'm not even joking around. The water on the Isle of Nex is the bane of anyone playing this game's existence. Unfortunately, however, as adventurers it is our sworn duty to explore everywhere... Even under the water... the dark, murky water... I'll continue to update the likes and dislike section as I play through the game and learn more about it. Thanks for reading and rating, I hope you all have as much fun as I am playing Legend of Grimrock 2!\n\nHAPPY THAT! :D","October 15, 2014","true","45.1"," 174 of 212 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","174","212","2","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kean865/recommended/251730/","kean865","Riiakhan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kean865/","252 products in account","I really wish there was a Neutral or Mixed option for whether or not to recommend a game here on Steam so while I might have "not recommended it" my stance on it is actually mixed.\n\nYou can read the good stuff about LoG2 from other reviewers, I just want to vent what I personally disliked about the game.\n\n\n\nOpen world\nThe atmosphere of loneliness, isolation and claustrophobia from the first game is pretty much gone. The feeling of you being in an alienating machine which lives all around you, trying to kill you is gone. There is just something terrifying about the prospect of running out of food deep underground in a dungeon you can't get out of. About having to continuously push forward deeper down into a world unknown to you in the vague prospect of being allowed out. Because of the open world and outside environment the atmosphere is completely lost.\n\nIt doesn't help that the world feels like a themepark either or that the square design looks awful when it comes to how trees, plants rocks and especially water is designed to act as barriers. The locations like graveyard, crystal caves and the swamp don't feel natural at all. Out of nowhere you leave the regular forest area and BOOM! Now you're in a swamp and the area looks completely different. It comes across as cartoonish. There is no feeling of loneliness because there's stuff all around you. There is no feeling of isolation or claustrophobia because you can at any point just leave a dungeon. (except for a few select instances when you have to battla a boss or solve a puzzle)\n\nFinally, the idea of allowing players to choose where to go might sound good on paper but in practice it makes the game overwhelming at times (in a bad way). You might get something that is crucial to use later on at a puzzle to get to a power gem which is vital to completing the game but because the game doesn't tell you that you might deem it irrelavent because you've combed the area you found it in and you decided you want to have more space in your inventory for stuff that is actually useful. So you throw it out and then later on you come across that puzzle and would you look at that? You can't solve it. Because the piece that would have helped made sense of this puzzle is somewhere in a dungeon but you can't remember where.\n\nDon't get me wrong. This^ doesn't happen all the time, there is only a select few moments where things like this can happen, but it made me very uncomfortable to go 'anywhere' because I was afraid I wouldn't be doing the puzzles and ♥♥♥♥ in the right order.\n\n\n\nPuzzle Design\nSo the puzzles... In the first game, a puzzle was pretty straightforward when it was presented to you. You're in a small'ish room where all you need to solve the puzzle are at for the most part. In the sequel, the puzzles are a mess. Sometimes you can't solve a puzzle you stumble onto until way later when you've solved other puzzles. Or you might come across a puzzle where you have to have X to finish it, a crucial plot-important puzzle that is. So what if you don't have X? What if you didn't pick it up? What if you've used all of X up? Then there are puzzles where you need to comb the entire ♥♥♥♥ing area for a button or something that is connected to it but because the game gives you no hints you tediously check every damn wall for that damn button.\n\nSee that's the thing. In the first game, secret buttons for the most part where for bonus-rooms of loot. In the second game there are times where they are crucial to your advancement in the plot and you end up feeling obligated to check every damn wall you can in order to find a button and that tediousness adds up after a while until I reached the point where every time I entered a dungeon where I had to comb walls my enjoyment dropped.\n\n\n\nBroken Feet\nSo, we can break limbs in this one. For the most part it is a nice addition to the game, except the feet. See, if you break your feet (which you will do a lot because of having to go down fall doors and pits) your characters max weight drops until you heal the character with a potion. So what do you think will happen when you accidentally (or have to jump down because that is the way to advance the game) go down a hole and end up having to face enemies? That's right, you're stuck because on of your characters broke their feet and they are now overencumbered and you ran out of potions for the character because of all the other times you had to heal his/her ♥♥♥♥ing feet because of those ♥♥♥♥ing trapdoors. Best craft yet another potion to heal their feet!\n\n\n\nCrate/Sack Screen\nAll right, so remember how in the first game when you open a sack or crate then it opens to the side of your inventory screen so that you can have a full view of what you're carrying, what you got equipped and what is in the additional space of the crate/sack? Remember that neat little design that allowed you full view of all of your character? Yeah. The crate/sack screen now opens 'over' you equipment screen.\n\n\n\nPuzzle Difficulty\nThe game becomes too damn nonsensical at a certain point. It is not that the difficulty of the puzzles increase, it is that you don't get any hint as to what you are supposed to do a lot of the time when it comes to puzzles and without a stepping stone you're pretty much forced to look up a tip or how to do the entire puzzle because it just doesn't make any damn sense to you. You will come across puzzles that, unless you are the developers, you won't have any idea how to do them. It's like a friend of yours telling you an inside joke the two of you never had and then she laughs, sees you aren't laughing and then remembers that it was an inside joke she had with another friend. Now if you were to think, and I mean 'really' think about what she said and think about what her friends are and what they were doing and think back on stories they've told then maybe you'd eventually piece together what the inside joke was about.\n\nQuestion is, is the joke still funny? It isn't for me. I sat at one of those tedious ♥♥♥ puzzles, refusing to look it up and was damn determined to figure it out myself and when I finally did it wasn't an "Aha!" moment, it was "...So that is how it works huh? Fun... I can finally ♥♥♥♥ing move on..." Had I been given a teensy little tip at each of those convoluted puzzles then maybe it would have been more fun because you'd at least have a freaking stepping stone, but without them you'll resort to looking it up online. There was only 2 times I had this problem in the first game, but in this one you'll start getting them more and more frequently once you reach the later stages of the game.\n\n\n\nNow, with those things said, the world is still fun. The combat (while clumsy) is still fun. Most of the puzzles are fun. There is more variety in locations (even if they come across as cartoonishly designed sometimes).

There's no handholding, and I don't mean that in the "so hardcore it craps 8 shades of bits", but in the "you're in this situation, deal with it".\n\nYou won't always have the tools to deal with the challenges. Sometimes you'll have to remember that one spot in the game world where there's something you can do or deal with. Sometimes a puzzle solution might not be apparent or you might not even have the in-game knowledge to solve it. It's a game that requires your attention, that frequently puts you in a "Are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me?" situation, but that's ultimately rewarding when you do figure out what was going on.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are probably the best part of the game and are quite self-aware. They are laid out so that the play with what previous puzzles have taught you, which means sometimes they iterate on an approach, or break a misconception you may have had, but never do they feel like they are repeating themselves.\n\nCompared to Grimrock 1, the skills are more streamlined, the classes more interesting and the openess and scope of the game makes the first game seem almost like a demo. If you like RPGs, puzzle-solving and exploration, Grimrock 2 will deliver nicely on every front.","October 19, 2014","true","29.4"," 76 of 83 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","76","83","0","0"

The wargs will jump around you with great agility, not giving you any time to try and flank them yourself. The little blue fishmen guys will nimbly dodge your attacks and attack-jump toward you. The giant frogs will snatch your weapons from your hands, leaving you severely weakened until you manage to defeat them and get your items back. Every enemy type requires careful thinking and different tactics to defeat, and the challenge feels great!\n\nAs was the case with the first game, in Grimrock 2 there are also loads of secrets, rewarding a perceptive dungeon explorer with great loot.\n\nThere are new classes (the farmer being the most amusing for sure), a new PC race, loads of new items and weapons (firearms, too!!!), new monsters (and some nasty traps and surprises!), and huge new levels.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go play this amazing gem of a game.","October 24, 2014","true","17.3"," 52 of 55 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","52","55","0","1"

It was one of my favourite games of 2012. If it had flaws, it was the lack of variety in combat and environment.\n\nLegend of Grimrock 2 fixes all those flaws, and is immediately a much better game for it. The only thing it loses is its gradual "descent" into the depths of the dungeon. Here the world is laid out across a much wider area, although there is both depth and height to most dungeons now. The outdoor areas are the most noticeable change when you first start, and they add much needed life to the game. Some of the sights you'll encounter are impressive, not something I was expecting from a grid-based crawler, but the game can be often beautiful. Indoors the engine now deals with height within the same dungeon level, so ladders lead up and down onto platforms, and coupled with quite a few different mechanics leads to a lot more variety in the kind of puzzles that are possible. I didn't find the puzzles to be quite as challenging as Grimrock 1, some of which relied heavily on very tight timing, and in the sequel clues tend to be spread across the map rather than being just around the next corner. A lot of hints are very opaque at first, but gradual dawning realisation will occur much later in the game as you start to piece it together. Personally I really enjoyed this, and being able to make notes on the map is pretty much essential to keep track of them.\n\nCombat is a vast improvement as well. There's much less reliance on dancing around enemies to stay out of harm's way, facing-off is far more feasible this time (on normal difficulty at least!) due to better character balance, progression, and smarter use of character traits. Of course, there are always exceptions, and the developers are clearly having fun keeping the player on their toes with new enemy types. This is not a turn-based game, but it should be manageable.\n\nIt took me a little over 40 hours to beat the game, although I've been quite thorough. I know others who did it in half that time. Even after beating the game, there's one major secret that I've yet to conquer, a way of ending the story more satisfactorily. I'm sure it will keep me busy a while longer. This is easily a contender for my favourite game of 2014.","November 23, 2014","true","44.2"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","50","52","0","0"

(Expand the Review for a summary)\n\nPros\n- Mod Support\n- Level Editor\n- Secret Chests and Rooms\n- "Untold" Story\n- Great Soundtrack\n- Guns GUNS GUNS!\n- Outside Environments\n- Multiple Difficulty Options\n- Very Good Character Customization\n- Nicely Laid Out Puzzles\n- VERY HIGH REPLAY VALUE\n\nCons\n- Some Puzzles, though nicely laid out, lack thought or "Obvious" completion paths\n- Atrocious Anti-Aliasing\n\nJust wow. It is not very often that a sequel to a game that I thought was "meh" comes around blows me way the ♥♥♥♥ away. This is one of them. I have been having an absolute blast playing this game, closet comparison I think I can make for Grimrock is Wizardry (mainly 8.)  One of the things that I really liked about the first Grimrock game was the replay value and Level Editor that was added, and my god did Grimrock 2 deliver in those areas too! The level editor is fleshed out in a pretty serious manner, mods have already been developed for the game. The way the story is told, outside of the opening cutscene is pretty much through things you discover for yourself, letters in the world, things you see, the closest comparison I can make is to Dark Souls where the lore is indirectly fed to you, I like the setup, and it adds to the mystery of the Island. One of the new things they added was outside areas, which was one of the best editions this game could have made, for one, it allows for some serious modding potential, (Eye of the Beholder anyone?), the other thing is it just expands more on the world itself allowing you to be a bit more immersed. Another thing that was added was a Day and Night Cycle, it is also very well done and definetly adds to the atmosphere in a few areas (The Cemetery.) Next, I would like to give a big shout out to the guns. There are guns in this game! They added Guns! I really shouldn't have to go on any farther on that subject, although mechanically speaking they can be weak, they jam, and bullets are hard to come by. Its a matter of choice though, some people seem to really like them. Lastly on game mechanics themselves I would like to talk about the Puzzles. I found most of the puzzles to be intuitive and fun but there were a few that just stuck out because they were so basic or because they were so complex. The example the comes to mind at the moment is the Gate in the Cemetary, I had no clue what to do and eventually gave up and looked it up. I would have never had a single clue if I had not done that, although there was probably a note or something somewhere. One more thing, the Anti-Aliasing in this game is terrible, SweetFX can fix it, and I am sure if you have a 780ti, 970/980, or a 290x you could downsample to make it much better, but that is something I notice, and I am sure many others do too.\n\nBottom line though, this game is bonkers, I was stoked about it when I got it and I am still having fun with it. Great game, maybe even my favorite game of the year.","December 21, 2014","true","31.7"," 59 of 66 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","59","66","2","1"

As good as GR1 was in a throwback to the good-ol-days, GR2 takes the next step, improves on nearly every aspect, and provides a much deeper, thoughtful, and dynamic world.\n\nThe amount of character variation is incredible; between the combination of race/class/and ultimately how you decide to build each person.  There's no "right" or required group, and it seems as if a variety of class/build combinations would be successful and more imporatantly, fun.\n\nThe combat system is strategic and challenging; combining just the right amount of pacing, real-time action, and strategic positioning. Weapons have depth with special abilities, often making equipping a difficult choice of round-to-round stats vs the benefits of the special attack. Characters have enough room to create any of the iconic traditional roles, or any combination between.\n\nThe puzzels are integrated into the terrain and narrative so well that they seem to just melt into the environment, in a very Myst-style fashion. Their locations and solutions are often overlapping with other adjacent (or non-adjacent) areas in that you can recieve clues to puzzels you have yet to encounter and encounter puzzels you have no solutions for; the name of the game is flexibility and patience. The game rarely asks you to be instaneous and in that you should appriciate the same from the game. Not everything is to be solved on the spot.\n\nOverall, a powerful RPG/adventure game that really gets its all right within the system its defined for itself. Often times I find myself questioning whatever game I'm playing could've done better, with GR2, I am only ever amazing about all the things it gets right. Difficult enough to be a challenge but not so much it gets frustrating.

With secrets abound, hidden alcoves, and a mysterious story with more depth than it appears to have, Grimrock 2 keeps much of what was good about the first game of the series.\n\nHowever, Grimrock 2 improves the game in several ways. First of all, the game takes place in the over and underworld of the Isle of Nex, a land with varied terrain and many foes. The overworld segments are interesting, holding shortcuts to dungeons, their own secrets, buried treasure, and several puzzles. The overworlds also have respawning foes and food supplies, allowing the beleaguered adventurer to get their resources back and grind if truly necessary. The main goal of the game centers around collecting various items from the world, and thanks to the overworld is very freeform-- besides a fairly linear intro area, you are free to go wherever you please. However, some areas are gated by their difficulty, so progression still exists.\n\nDungeons are entertaining as always, with a mix of combat-heavy areas, boss battles (another new feature, and one that's quite well-executed), exploration challenges, and difficult puzzles. Traps and ambushes are still common, as with Grimrock 1, but they felt less frustrating, perhaps because there was typically at least one place to run to if things got difficult.\n\nGraphically, the options are good enough to make the game very pretty, or ugly enough to run on computers without high-tier GPUs. On middling settings, the game ran very smoothly on a Surface Pro 3 in every case, and the game ran smoothly in less intense areas when on higher settings on the same device.\n\nAs far as negatives, there were a couple things that I noticed. The food system makes a return from Grimrock 1, and while it remains as unintrusive as always, it's definitely nothing more than a way to put weight in the party's packs. While there were one or two times where I took breaks from dungeoneering to secure more food, it was never a huge concern because of the overworld. As long as you're progressing at a good pace through the game, the food mechanics only show up when you forget to do the inventory dance every half-hour of gameplay or so.\n\nAlso somewhat disappointing was the spell system, which felt like it had some wasted potential. While there was one unique spell per spell tree, some elements are outright better than others, and spells range from uncreative (a multi-rune ranged bolt and single-rune damage spell of every element, as well as element-resistance shields for each element) to somewhat interesting but already done (the utility spells in Air and Water trees), with one notable exception: the Force Field spell, which creates a block on a tile of choice that no projectiles or foes can enter, attack from, or exit. I would have appreciated the following:\n-A utility spell for Earth (Air and Water have one, and Fire's is replaced with a unique damaging spell)\n-An Underwater breathing/Underwater action spell (Typically, underwater action is impossible, and time underwater is limited)\n-A transmutation spell, to make junk more useful\n-The arrow enchanting spells from Grimrock 1, or a similar sort of spell\n-Some sort of knockback or pushback spell (maybe make that the Earth utility, with damage?)\n-A "Detect Secrets" spell, but perhaps with a high cost or skill requirement and very short duration. Something to highlight secret buttons, basically, even if it just used a sound indicator to show if one was close.\n-Something unique to the Wizard class so that it isn't hilariously useless\n-More unique, varied spells that I didn't think of\n\nThe casting system was improved from Grimrock 1 in terms of useability, as it's now much faster to cast well, but the lack of spells really was disappointing.\n\nThird, due to the freeform progression, it's possible to barely scrape by in a difficult area and then return to an easy one, kicking yourself for not going there first. Your mileage may vary on this one-- it's pretty fun to just blast through areas, after all. Also, inventory management can become cumbersome-- in the late game especially. However, as everything is in real time, this could be considered part of the challenge.\n\nFinally, some of the required puzzles felt somewhat esoteric. However, I've never been good at those sorts of things, and many would consider brain-bending puzzles to be a pro, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nOverall worth the purchase. And I'm not even including the custom dungeons, which have full scripting and great potential! Seriously consider buying this game.\n\nOf course, caveat: This game is very casual-unfriendly. If you don't find at least some of the secrets, you're gonna be in trouble. Also, those with poor eyesight won't appreciate small, difficult-to-find secret buttons.","December 4, 2015","true","22.5"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","40","43","0","2"

Instead of just focusing on one giant dungeon, there are many outside areas to explore, that have their own dungeons connected to them. After you finish the initial area, you have the freedom to pick just about any area to go through at your own pace.\n\nIt also adds quite a few new elements, such as multi-leveled areas, dangerous water you can't really fight in and drown fast, ladders, chests, and digging once you get a shovel. Quite a lot of new enemies are introduced, nearly every enemy is new, only some old ones return.\n\nThere's a new skill concerning firearms, alchemy got streamlined as you no longer need bottles to make potions, and spellcasting also got more simplified. Skills like Light Weapons & Heavy Weapons no longer have a random chance to perform a special move, however, many weapons have a new charge function to perform a special ability, as long as your skill is high enough to use it. Skills in general got a nice overhaul for the most part. I'm kind of sad they removed the Hand-to-Hand/Unarmed skill, guess it was too overpowered. Any class has access to any skill, meaning even a melee warrior could use fire magic with a wand if you so desired. There is new classes as well as some changes to old ones, specifically alchemists are super useful now, not needing bottles, and ingredients in their inventory even duplicate after so many steps, as long as you have at least one of that ingredient.\n\nAlso there are bosses, quite a few of them, something the first game didn't have, except for the final boss.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to collect 16 Power Gems found in exterior areas, as well as dungeons to craft Elemental Essences at 4 shrines found throughout the land, each requiring 4 gems to craft, to unlock the final dungeon, solve it, beat the crap out of whatever is waiting for you at the end, and escape the island you shipwrecked on.\n\nOptionally, there are 4 extra power gems you can use at the 5th hidden shrine and craft the 5th optional essence to access the real final boss, and the true ending.\n\nThis game is definitely more open ended and longer than the first, and a bit harder, since the game throws quite a lot at you at times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Karnikins/recommended/251730/","Karnikins","Ignacio Badtanman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Karnikins/","257 products in account","Legend of Grimrock 2 is one of those games that improves upon the prequel in (almost!) every way, and I can't do anything but whole-heartedly recommend it -- Even for people who haven't played the first. As it stands right now, there are several problems, but I'll address what I liked about the game first.\n\nThe combat is just as fun as the first game, though now with arguably more strategy involved as most enemies are keen to your side-stepping ways and will have methods to counter them. Most enemies can now be countered by simply walking backward, as they lack lunging attacks save for a few smarter enemies, but at least that involves knowing the area and not simply moving into a 4x4 grid and keeping combat in that small, controlled area. Some enemies can still be conquered with that strategy, but they are few and far between.\n\nThe puzzles are less obtuse in MOST cases, as well, which was a problem that I had with Grimrock 1 for sure. Most hints will make sense if you consider them for long enough, and very seldom will you find a dungeon without some kind of hint... Even if it's just a one-word sign stating the 'name' of the puzzle. Thanks to the new open-world nature of Grimrock 2, you will also have time to consider a puzzle that you might be stuck on while exploring an area you haven't yet cleared! Gone are the days of walking around a singular puzzle room because it blocks your progress forward, scratching your head in frustration and eventually just googling the answer.\n\nSpeaking of the open world, that is a big step forward from Grimrock 1 and definitely one in the right direction. You'll have a choice of anywhere from two to four places to explore at once, meaning your progress isn't locked in a specific direction and you're not always just 'heading down' in a dungeon. There are dungeons, of course, but they're smaller in size than Grimrock 1's mystical mountain fortress. They're not always contained, however -- You might find the solution to a puzzle in one area within a completely different area, for instance, or at least a hint to its completion. That's well-done, most of the time!\n\nI had to use google for a total of four out of what must have been over fifty or sixty puzzles, and as soon as I looked it up (except for exactly two things), I was left smacking my forehead and going 'why didn't I think of that?'. The other two were simply things that weren't stated very well, or clearly enough, and both unfortunately blocked progress into significant parts of the game. Still, though! That hardly ruined my experience.\n\nNow, for the bad... My complaints are few, but they are important. First of all, several aspects of combat could use a re-work. Firearms, a new method of combat, are woefully underpowered for a simple reason: They can jam as well as miss, while other ranged weapons can only miss, and their damage is a fixed value with all Firearm weaponry while both Throwing and Missile weapons scale with Strength and Dexterity respectively. If you run an Alchemist and know the formulas for the permanent stat increasing formulas, you'll be looking at a Minotaur adding 50 damage to his Thrown Weapons or a Lizardman adding 40 damage to his Missile Weapons by endgame, compared to anyone adding... 0 damage to their Firearms. Add in the fact that Missile and Throwing weapons can be re-collected after combat where Firearms ammo is decidedly scarce and cannot... Well. They're basically useless.\n\nAdditionally, enemy difficulty is up from the first game in a way that I don't technically agree with. On top of enemies having honestly absurd amounts of health in comparison, making some fights with non-boss enemies feel like a slog (I'm looking at you, crabs), there is a certain enemy that literally cannot be damaged by anything except one Water spell or a singular weapon that you find in a later area of the game... Usually after you've found and ran your face into that enemy and gone 'wtf?'. The enemy is infrequent and doesn't hurt very much even on Hard difficulty, but it can box you into a corner and then you're basically left to swing at it for 0 until you die and reload. I can't agree with that kind of design philosophy. Needing to invest 2 skill points into a certain magic tree or rush to the Cemetery to find the item to damage them with seems like lazy design, to me.\n\nDespite its flaws, I would call this game nearly perfect -- If I had to rate it on a scale, definitely in the 8.5/10 - 9/10 range. I recommend it at any price.","October 20, 2014","true","52.1"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","40","44","0","0"

In every direction you turn there is new adventure, secrets, puzzles, things to explore. In that sense it actually reminds of Skyrim in its scope, although fundamentally different in style. Grimrock's world is really immersive. I especially loved the dark ambient soundtracks for each location (which are in same fashion as i.e. Stalker games), which set the mood. The visuals are fantastic and convincing, you really feel that you are deep underground in a deadly dungeon filled with secrets, traps, and places buried by time and dust.\n\nGameplay is great. The story is mysterious and fun. Combat is varied enough, and the puzzles are all fantasticly made. All of them are logical and can be figured out by careful attention to detail and hints. Some are easy, some are difficult, and a few are very difficult, but very fun to solve. Best part: no bugs and no broken puzzles. This game has what I greatly miss in modern games: that feeling of excitement when you finally solve a level and unlock another one, and can't wait to see what's inside.\n\nFor me this is the game of the year. I would suggest it to players who like mystery, adventure, immersive worlds, puzzle solving, and exploration, but I think it is so oustanding in all aspects that I simply think that everyone should try it.","November 15, 2014","true","58.2"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","36","38","0","4"

The latter brings a failing new to Grimrock. Some of the puzzles and their clues span the game world and can require quite a bit of backtracking if you missed some clue along the way, or didn't bother writing it down.\n\nBut these incidents are few and far between compared to all the goodness this game has to offer. New dangerous-looking enemies make it harder to dance around the less-than-up-to-it AI of the first game. I won't spoil it for you, but some enemies were just genious.

Unfortunately there also comes the only real negative of the game: puzzles that refer to real world things. Really hard to solve those if you are trying to think in game lore.

The visuals and art direction of this game mold an extremely impressive aesthetic appeal, taking advantage of current generation technology and bringing new life into the classic tile based RPG genre.\n\nThe difficulty Legend of Grimrock presents is just right, not consisting of too much gauntlet difficulty while not being too easy. Legend of Grimrock 2 also features and impressive soundtrack and the audio is of high quality. The level design is non-linear and effective, making a fascinating world of many paths to explore.\n\nAs a massive fan of games like Stonekeep and Wizardry, this game delivers an enjoyable experience for hardcore tile based-RPG players while being accessible to new players of the genre at the same time. Being a game of such nature it requires an in-depth party creation, stats, items, spells and good level design to keep interesting, of which Grimrock 2 delivers superbly.\n\nThis is a gift to players who are nostalgic of the 90's era RPGs who want something of the same except current, and to new players who are willing to invest some time into a different kind of RPG experience.\n\nLegend of Grimrock 2 is a revival done right and gives me hope of the future of indie games, this is trully an extremely high quality product with a lot of love and care put into making it.

It is atmospheric, fun, and challenging - providing enough modern influence to keep me interested while also staying true to staples of the dungeon crawl genre of old.\n\nNarrative\nThe story is simple enough: you control four prisoners who have shipwrecked on a mysterious island called Grimrock. Here, you must wield powerful weapons and utilize ancient tools in order to progress through the island.  Throughout your journey you are haunted by strange, cryptic letters left by an even stranger magician who openly taunts you to challenge him in his massive castle once you become strong enough.\n\nGameplay\nAt first, since I was unfamiliar to the concepts of the genre, I found the combat strange, confusing and even awkward. But I quickly adapted and the gamplay became second nature soon enough. The heart of the game, however, is the puzzles. They are oftentimes relatively complex logical puzzles, a few of which border the lines of non-sequitor, but for the most part are very satisfying to complete. The dungeons are a blast to explore and there are enough modern tweaks to the system that elimate most uncessary hardships (fast-travel, saving without needing save points). If you want an added challenge, you can choose to disable all in game maps which forces you to draw your own on paper.\n\nSensory\nIt was clear that my computer was not up to snuff to run this game to its full potential. However, I enjoyed even the minimalist graphical settings and felt completely absorbed into the dark, gritty world. In fact, I found it more and more difficult to play as I progressed in the game due to the feeling of paranoia and solipsism. The deeper dungeons left me exhausted from stress. From a technical point of view, the sound effects are fantastic: swords swing with a satisfying crunch when you score hits, and monsters are terrifyingly ferocious. The musical score is subdued and only provides a backdrop, which is perfectly appropriate for this game (the title menu music is amazing, by the way).\n\nConlusion\nIf you are looking for a rpg with a focus on extraordinary gameplay, this would be a fantastic journey for you. The story is open-ended enough for the player to fill in the lines , which I think allows the focus to stay on the gameplay. You will be bewildered, frustrated and ultimately extremely satisfied should you brave the mysterious island of Grimrock...","January 6","true","40.6"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"

Yes, there is fighting and an RPG element to it, but the puzzles are how you get through the game.  Some of the puzzles are as easy as stepping on a pressure plate, others are as complex as hitting levers in a specific order even though the trap doors open and close below you as you are moving.\n\nSo believe me when I tell you that you will have to step away occasionally out of sheer frustration.  The developers do indeed give you clues as to how to complete most of the puzzles, but they are vague and definitely subject to interpretation.  That said, when you figure out a particularly difficult puzzle, it will be one of the more rewarding experiences in your gaming life.\n\nAnother aspect of this is the secrets in the game.  Some of them are just hidden buttons in walls that open up secret passages to treasure.  Others are teleport patterns that lead to artifacts.  If you are like me, you love discovery, so you will spend WAY more time than is necessary checking the walls for buttons and trying different patterns on pressure plates just in case.\n\nIn short, this game is awesome!","November 26, 2014","true","31.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wotdlois/recommended/251730/","wotdlois","wotdlois","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wotdlois/","152 products in account","I'll start this review with saying, that I loved the first LOG and once I completed it, I went straight to google and queried "games like LOG" and "LOG 2 release date", knowing full well, there wasn’t a chance it was being developed yet,  but just hoping it was, as the experience was fantastic.  Well I got my wish!  At current I have around 14hrs into the 2nd installment and have not been disappointed.\n\nIf you are reading these reviews to get an idea of gameplay, I can say the grid based movement system can be odd or awkward at first, if you have never experienced it but you really feel like you’re playing an old school dungeon crawler or a tile based board game and sink right into it after a handful of minutes.  Don’t get this confused with turn based or real time pause type games like wasteland 2 or dragon age.  This is real time with you being limited in movement to linear paths only. You move as you would with any other game using w a s and d in a linear fashion on an invisible grid.  You can rotate within a grid square using q and r or rotate by dragging and pulling your mouse.  You are also able to look around with the mouse within your FOV up, down and side to side.  You are probably wondering why even utilize this and not just use free roam?  The grid based system has a direct influence on combat, as you can only engage an enemy that is in a tile(s) directly in front of you - ranged weapon, firearms or magic can be cast/fired beyond 1 square. You cannot move diagonally.  This makes combat difficult and tricky when multiple enemies are engaged with you.  Back yourself into a corner and hope you have enough health potions to duke it out before your entire party gets wiped out.\n\nThis is a good spot to describe the party system.  It’s a four party group stacked 2 x 2.  The front two, typically are your tanks, damage dealer type heroes with the back being your spell casters and ranged weapon guys.  This is pretty standard but important to understand how that works within the grid system.  When facing directly in front of an enemy, the front two take the brunt of the damage while allowing your back row to cast and fire.  Let an enemy flank your party and the back row now becomes the focus of the full force of an attack.  This can be very troublesome as they typically don’t have the protection or armor the front row has.\n\nAttacking can be confusing for a new player as you don’t actually click on the enemy to attack, like you would in a standard first person hacker.  As long as the party is facing the block with an enemy in it, you simply click the item/weapon in your hand to perform the attack (in party box lower right hand corner).  To cast a spell you first need to find the scroll, have the required skills/traits to cast it and finally to use, right click the hand and select the correct glyphs to perform the spell.  You have to memorize these and perform them every time you cast a spell.  There is no hot key for spells.  Spells with multiple glyphs need to be drawn, by holding and dragging the mouse across the designated glyphs.  This stumped me for a while as I was simply clicking them which are fine for single glyph spells but useless for more complex spells.\n\nThe world is full of secret chests and loot so keep an eye out for button like stones on walls.  In fact whenever I go through a new area I always look left and right at every wall surface to find hidden wall buttons.  Get used to doing this. Getting through the game will be considerably harder if you are not finding the secret items.  All secret chests need lock picks to open!  You find these in the world so search every last block.  This is not like path of exile or another action RPG where they dump items on you.  These lock picks are few and far between, in some cases you will have to make a decision which chest you want to open.  In these circumstances I simply save it and test each one out for its contents (CONTENTS ARE NOT RANDOM) when you decide which chest has the most useful loot go to it, loot it and save it.  Another great aspect of the secret chests is that some are buried around the world, so you may be given a treasure map and tasked with digging up areas looking for it.\n\nSo now to my favorite part of this game - the puzzles!  This game has the best combination of RPG elements and adventure game puzzles.  If you like complicated puzzles that you would often find in classic point and click adventure games, you will love these.  They really make you stop and think, all while testing your sanity.  They can be downright frustrating for some and near impossible for others, who don’t have the constitution or mental makeup for them.  All, however, are very logical when the solution presents itself, from either trial and error, or simply when you fold and look it up online.  Solving some of these will make you feel like a genius! And your efforts will be rewarded with a shimmering melody and a rare item or clue.\n\nWithout giving away any spoilers I would like to touch on the story and level layouts.  Each unique area you access consist of outdoor open environments, coupled with a labyrinth of dungeons beneath.  This differs significantly from the original where you were confined to the claustrophobic dark of the tunnels.  This offers a nice respite from the stress of dungeon crawling IMHO.  Its always a breath of fresh air, literally, when you make it out to the bright summer sun after spending hours, laboring in the rat infested deep.  You are able to back track to previous levels in case you want to open a locked chest or forgot to do something important.  I cant speak for the entire game, but at least to where i am, 14hrs in, i was able to go as far back to the opening beach. There is a running theme through the levels/areas, in regards to story quest items.  You are not simply leveling and grinding for the sake of leveling.  You collect story unique items which will most likely be used in some synergistic fashion at the climactic ending.  I am no where near this but seeing how the levels have progressed thus far, it would be a logical deduction.\n\nThere are many game options at the start of a new game all of which allow you to scale the difficulty.  Easy Normal and hard are the difficulty levels.  In my opinion Normal can be difficult for new players or if your party is not balanced correctly so choose wisely.  You also have the option of disabling the map function which forces you to draw your own maps on grid paper which is lots of fun tbh.  It forces you to slow down and take note of things around you, as opposed to running through the dungeon in which case you can become quickly disoriented and lost.  You will never really become lost but they are useful when running from an enemy(s) so you can keep your orientation so not to back yourself into a corner which as explained earlier can be game ending.  Another option is to allow quick save anywhere in the game (f5).  This in my opinion is too easy to spam so I choose the option to save at save crystals which are sparingly spread across the levels.  One final option is to only be allowed 1 save per crystal.  This is extreme and to be used with caution.  You can do a lot before you come across another save crystal so dying before you reach it can be disastrous and for some a game ender all together.\n\nI can't recommend this game any higher.  Pick it up and you will have hours upon hours of fun.  I am sitting at work writing this review because I can’t wait to get home to play it!","March 18, 2015","true","19.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"

Graphics are very nice actually for todays standards, sound is ok. If you played the first LoG and liked it, you will love this one, it's improved in every way. If not, it may be worth your time if you like this kind of gameplay. You will be exploring multiple areas over and under the surface, while fending off monsters and trying to solve puzzles for treasures and story items. The puzzles are quite challenging at times, especially for optional rewards. I must admit, I had to consult the community a few times, but it is entirely possible to solve everything by yourself if you put your mind and some time to it. Some puzzle hints are quite cryptic, but with some thought and trial/error everything can be solved. The fighting is fun, you have multiple classes to choose from and nicely designed equipment that makes you want to have them all! There is a new race as well, so you could create an obese Rat farmer who gains experience by eating food and extra boni from cheese slices (lol), or an insectoid alchemist who fires giant cannonballs and grows mushrooms in her pockets (disgusting). Besides melee and ranged fighting, you have magic based on a rune system. But if you dont like that extra micromanagment, just make a party of 4 Berserkers and smash everything to a pulp. You can even change the character portraits with your own custom pictures, so visually you can have your dream party of Pokémon or whatever you fancy.\nI got almost 40 h of gameplay out of this 20€ purchase, so it was well worth the money. I am actually more content with LoG2 than I was with Shadow of Mordor. It is a lot of fun and I recommend it to every RPG/Puzzle fan. For me personally, this is game of the year so far.","October 19, 2014","true","37.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/recommended/251730/","Aizawaa","crowbAr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/","342 products in account","I love and hate this game. It improved everything compared to the first game, which I love, but also made the bad things even worse.\n\nTL;DR: 8/10. Recommend it to patient people, has minor flaws which can be annoying. Could easily be 9/10 without those.\n\nThe Good:\n- very good level design, kinda like dark souls. Different regions with different themes connected to each other from different paths with shortcuts and secrets everywhere. Also you can choose where to go first and where later. This also creates a dynamic difficulty level because you can do the easy regions first or harder region and stomp the easy region afterwards which is a nice thing in my opinion especially for speedrunners.\n\n- I like that there is no music except in bossfights. It helps the atmossphere alot. In most games music is just overused.\n\n- great enemy variety visually as well as mechanicly. Almost every enemy has a unqiue element to it, for example one can attack everywhere, one can jump sidewards, one can charge you and stuff like that.\n\n- a lot of exploration which gets rewarded and is satisfying\n\n- good puzzles\n\n- clear objective what to do despite being so open\n\n- great graphics and good performance\n\n- huge value and replayabilty. Integrated dungeon creator and workshop support!\n\n\nThe Bad:\n- some weird puzzles where I NEVER EVER would have find out how to do it. In LoG 1 every puzzle (I coudlnt figure out all of them) made sense even when I looked how to solve it it made sense afterwards but in LoG 2 there are 3-5 puzzles which are stupid even if 1 of them is simple.\n\n- overpowered status effects. Enemys can randomly give you status effect which are WAY too strong and annoying as hell. Also if you accidently fall off a small ledge 2-3 party members can break their legs randomly and your party is slowed and everyone gets overloaded and stuff. Also status effects dont go away except poison, but that takes very long to go away and in early game it will kill you if you have full health\n\n- weird balance of loot. I found so many Heavy Weapons which were all very good, but I found very few light weapons. I used 2 swords which you find very early and my character kept using that until almost the end. For my Mage I only found 2 staffs and 1 orb or something which were useful. For my firearms guy I found like 2-3 guns but there were almost identical in terms of dps and the canon I couldnt use because it was waay too heavy. If I had skilled my 2 front guys with Heavy weapons this game would be alot easier.\n\n- Castle Nex was kinda unspectacular even the boss fight at the end. In LoG 1 the last boss was very surprising for me and also had a nice way to kill him. But the last boss fight in LoG 2 was still good.\n\n- the game had no real magical moments like in LoG 1. I dont remember exactly what they were but I remember there were moments in LoG 1 which were just very awesome, small moments, but good ones. Also LoG 1 had Toorum, the Island guy in LoG 2 is very boring and like a wannabe Gman.","October 27, 2014","true","22.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

I have sunk quite a few hours into it so far, but not completed it, so these are my impressions. I am assuming you are familiar with the original Grimrock's game mechanics.\n\nShipwrecked and shackled, your four prisoner party washes up in a locked cage on the beach of a mysterious island. After you break free and fight and puzzle your way through the initial enclosed area the game sprawls out before you. Unlike the original game which was linear, you can pretty much go where you want. But tread carefully, as some sections are a lot more difficult than others depending on your skills, equipment and spell knowledge. The world of Grimrock 2 is tightly designed with little wasted space and there is always something close by to be slaughtering, solving or salvaging. There is something about it that is reminiscent of the Zelda games.\n\nThe default party has a decent mix of skills, with two melee damage dealers, a wizard, and a ranged firearm user. Yes, Grimrock 2 has boomsticks. Skills are not exclusive to any class now, and can be customized as you see fit. So if you want to add some fire magic to your barbarian Minotaur, you can do that, though clearly their casting efficacy is not going to be up to a pure wizard/battlemage's build, and generalizing your skills could lead to a weak party. There are numerous additions to classes over the last game, including an interesting looking "farmer" class that levels up by eating rather than killing.\n\nSomehow I managed to play through the last Grimrock with the automap disabled, but in Grimrock 2 the area is so much larger and more open that it would be difficult to explore properly without making notes. The automap feature fills in detail as you navigate the world and allows annotation with multiple symbols that can be set as markers for those locked chests, doors and unsolved puzzles you need to return to. It is very easy to pan and zoom around the map.\n\nThe atmosphere is spot on whether you are navigating the woodland by day, listening to the birdsong, or moving in the marshes with everything shrouded in a thick green fog, toadstools silhouetted in the distance. I was surprised to see that there is a day night cycle and enjoyed emerging from a dank dungeon into a glorious sanguine dusk. If you find adventuring by night too inconvenient you can sleep through it, though you will burn through your food stocks quicker doing this.\n\nCombat has been refined with enemies needing different tactics to beat effectively. Some will require more thought than just circle strafing and hitting, with them capable of setting counter-attacks if you try this or plain leaping over you and attacking from a different side. Magic casting has been polished with you dragging a gesture over the symbols rather than selecting them individually. This makes casting a little slicker and more fun to use. Melee has been improved with the addition of a power attack. If the weapons skill requirements are met, the power attack can be used and unleashed at the expense of a large hit to your energy pool.\n\nGrimrock 2 is a joy to play. It is fun to explore the game world, solve puzzles, and slaughter monsters, gradually becoming more and more powerful. The game is a clear recommend to anyone that enjoyed the first game in the series and the old dungeon crawler classics. Perhaps the grid-based movement is a little antiquated for some, an acquired taste, but it is a taste you should strive to acquire.","October 16, 2014","true","44.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

As the setting of the game is in the mythical island of Nex you as a player arent limited to delving in the dark, mossy dungeons of its precedessor but can instead explore and experience the great outdoors with such groundbreaking features as day and night cycle, diving underwater(no skuba included, at least so far) and fighting against the plant life in all of its ferocious forms (long live the industrial revolution).\n\nAfter 14 hours of gameplay i havent run into any bugs or other bad experiences that would negatively impact the game and my biggest gripe so far might be that some of the puzzles arent immediately solvable after finding them. Combat is much better, albeit in the same style as the original, as the monsters arent so easily danced around anymore and you often find yourself forced to use your enviroment as a tactical tool to manage the encounters. And as both spellcasting and the skill system have received some tuning your characters arent forced to specialize into a single role anymore. Now it seems like you can have that greataxe-wielding insectoid berserker who likes to wear heavy armor while slinging fireballs around.\n\nOverall its a good game so get it if you enjoy this kind of thing, and if not hey, why not try it.","October 25, 2014","true","17.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I'd write summary at the start for tl;dr guys. If you like dungeon crawler you have to play this game. If you like Legend of Grimrock 1 you have to buy this game. If you like whatever what is like might & magic  or any RPG and you don't mind it's a grid system rpg you're gonna love it. If you are a Hardcore dungeon crawling player, you'll see big potential in this game and maybe you'll notice some small cons but they're not important for the whole game. 9/10\n\nPros:\n- It's like expansion of LoG1 in everything\n- Beautiful scenery\n- Great combat system\n- Perfectly balanced combat system (on nomral - every combas wasn't too much hard neither too much easy)\n- Gameplay time\n- Workshop so you can play the community maps\n- Hardcore Challenges (Single use crystal, iron man, old school player - no map, or all of these)\n- Graphics (same as the LoG1 BUT it doesn't mean the design is same)\n- Level Design is really good\n- Ending(s) (in my opinion atleast)\n- Treeskill with traits (I like the idea how they did that)\n- Day/Night cycle\n\nOk enough of pros. It's just a great game now some negatives\n\nCons: (it's gonna be details)\n- I'd say ppl with firearms will be a littlebit pi**ed because sometimes they'll run of ammo. But when it will happen you have already prepared second type of attacts instead of firearms (throwing,missile or light weapons).\n- Just a few usable spells "fireburst,fireball,meteorfall,light and some protection spells" but the others are almost useless or they dont have higher level of them. So if someone starts max earth magic he's gonna have a hard time.\n- There are only sh*tty maps in workshop for now (sorry guys but you spent just a few hours for making your whole map/mod, that's ridiculous and you can't finish a good map in that time). But it's only question of time. The game is still pretty new.\n- I don't know if there's something like afterstory (I mean after second ending) there could be something like last huge dungeon for crawling through it'd be amazing (I feel there's nothing like that)\n\nOk It takes me so long to write some cons. Why it's not 10/10 is just these things (especially the 'spells' part). As I said it's improving of LoG1 in everything. Everything what they can improve they did. Actaully I wonder if they think about LoG3. I have some suggestion for another sequel - like Cities, some NPCs quests (whole quest system ofc), dynamic weather. More sceneries It'd be great aswell. But anyway LoG2 is one of the best Dungeon Crawling RPG what you can buy right now!","November 1, 2014","true","373.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

If you like dungeon crawlers on a grid, like (and I'm going back to the 80's here) Bard's Tale, Wizardry, Dragon Wars (Amiga 500), Heroes of Might & Magic Series, etc, you should try this game.\n\nThe one adjustment to get used to is combat is in real-time, so it is not turn-based like many games in this genre.  You'll need to get good at moving your party to a dead-end to prevent being attacked on multiple sides or become quick with the WASD keys to keep moving so you don't get hit much.\n\nGoing back to why I think this game is better than the original Legend of Grimrock: I like that this game had environments that took place on the surface.  You explore forests, deserts, even underwater at times.  This was a fun change from the first game where you are underground traveling floor to floor deeper into your prison/dungeon.  It also means you will frequently revisit areas and as time goes by some of the monsters will respawn giving you an opportunity to pickup some extra xp and food.  This helps make food an easier resource to obtain unlike the first game where I was stressing about running out more frequently.\n\nInventory management was easier for a loot hoarder like me because there is an area called the Hub which you can revisit.  There are no creatures there, just a small chamber where you can drop off the extra things you may wish to save for later.\n\nI hope there is eventually a Legend of Grimrock 3 as I really enjoy the series and look forward to whatever else the developer may come up with to keep the series fresh and entertaining.","March 16","true","109.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

I thought even if LG2 would be the same like LG1, it would be (imo) a great game.\n\nBut what they have done is such an amazing polished game. Here my favorites improvements:\n\n1. New Skillsystem which is imo much better than LG1, because you have more freedom and could try some different ways of leveling.\n2. The new class: Alchemie. I love this one. To have with him much more herbs aka potions is such a great thing.\n3. New monsters, and more than one bossfight (first in the first 2 hours of the game, second will be the final boss...maybe there are even more ^^)\n3. No more empty flasks (maybe some others don't like this decision but i like it)\n4. Spells, you don't have to take all the scrolls with you or use other sides in the internet.

And i don't know why but i have the feeling that the fights (so far 7h in the game) are much more different between two monster arts. I use much more movement or all ways of making damage as in LG1.\n9. New Map + and the new signs to make notes --> Great idea. Obverall the map is so much better.\n10. Digging.

After I already like the first part (my review here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/alQamar/recommended/207170/ )\n\nThe second one superseeded my expectations and I really hope that the devs will make a third one, even more shiny and polished as this one.\n\nI have to say that this game was a lot of fun and the puzzles are really really challenging, some were even too absurd to be figured out without the understanding of hints or things you even may have forgotten over time in the game.\nYoutube was especially "RPGDivision" was a great help here. He helped me many times when I already gave up solving the puzzle my own. Given I spent nearly 70 hours on normal difficulty you can imagine what kind of a work it was, to solve them.\n\n\n\nThis game has still drawbacks and I have to start with them first:\n-> Earth magic is near to useless, spells are weak and it takes much skillpoints to get them, on top of that many monsters are resistent to poision or at least not as often vulnerable as to fire or other magic schools.\n\n-> the music is much better as in the first part, and often I even had goosebumps and felt fear. But even though every level has an own "soundtrack" it becomes repetitive. It would be a great addition if the music would be tense or dynamic regarding the situation.\n\n-> The final fight against the Island master is horrific. I've slain the dragon quite easy but then all the new diversity brought into the game how you can skill characters is rendered useless if you want to defeat the Island Master. It is all about HP, DMG and best elemental resistance at the end. It is a must to have strong built party, with certain equipment and spells etc to stand this last fight.\n\nIt find it very very sad that this final boss is actually so hard to be defeated, if you have not chosen an "ideal" party. During the game you can compensate any lacks but speed or exploiting monsters, but this boss will tear you apart if you are not properly equipped and skilled, so the diversity is simply not useful at the end.\n\n-> All Ingridients, except blooddrop cap (healing) and crystal flower (skillpoints) are very plenty so on normal difficulty I was too savy using them.\n\nOn the positive account I see:\n-> a great well thought story\n-> very very challenging puzzles\n-> very good diversity in graphics, character building (with limitations) and monsters\n-> much better music\n-> great levels and landscape and lovely details\n-> an intro and end scenes makes more rich, what you missed in Grimrock 1.\n-> it is good that there are enough keys to unlock quite all gold caches and chests, but you need to be careful to find them all\n-> because of the higher environmental and graphical diversity "secrets" are much more hard to find as in Grimrock 1\n-> Workshop (Modding) support\n\nI hope for Grimrock 3 very much and Grimrock 2, because of the few but major lacks deserves a 8/10 and a "definitely worth a buy" tag!\n\nPlease like the review if you enjoyed the game as did and when you think this review is essential.

Designed with nostalgia in mind, but also sleek and shiny with modern graphics and great sound design. Better than the first game in every way, and worth it if you're even remotely interested in this kind of game. Play the first game before this one to help you ease into the mechanics and appreciate the improvements.\n\nThe challenge level is steep but fair, and difficult enemies can be taken down through tactics and manuvering rather than brute force. There are tons of secrets to find and an overall sense of mystery and wonder in every dungeon and area. Atmosphere is thick and the sound really makes the world feel alive, and threats ahead can be anticipated with keen ears. Overall the presentation makes for a immersive experience coupled with solid gameplay and combat.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly logical and can be figured out with a little thought and experimentation, though a few are so unclear that guesswork is almost neccessary. I'll fully admit I had to consult a guide for a few spots, and while some solutions made me feel stupid, a few just made me go "really?". It's much more satisfying to work through the puzzles yourself, but some of the nastier ones can get frustrating enough to encourage cheating.\n\nA few minor balance issues made me rethink my initial party and start over after a while, but I'm terrible for that in any game like this. Almost any party combination can work, but some weapons are simply found more often and in better quality than others. Consulting a guide or a friend before setting out with your party can help a lot, especially since a few of the classes don't necessarily work the way you might expect them to.\n\nBeing out in a bright, open world makes the grid-based movement seem a bit strange, where it mostly made sense in the confined halls of the first game. It's not just there for nostalgia though - the movement system and the logic that governs it is central to the combat and puzzle-solving systems and removing it would have required a complete overhaul in design. The game wouldn't work otherwise.\n\nThe more open-ended design makes for a lot more exploration, but it can be overwhelming. Puzzles that need keys or information from elsewhere to solve don't always indicate that clearly, and if you leave the game for too long and come back to it, you'll likely be hopelessly lost. The progression path isn't clear, but that could be said to just be part of the game's philosophy. Here's an island full of monsters and traps and secrets, good luck.\n\nNostalgic, polished, immersive, and challenging enough to deter some players, this is almost everything you could possibly want in a dungeon crawl and one of the only modern examples of the genre. Worth the purchase, and then some.\n\n","November 12, 2014","true","49.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This series is the new king of dungeon crawlers with hours and hours of content to traverse through.\n\nSimilar to its predecessor, the story of LoG 2 is a bit on the lacking side, but is every bit made up for by the gameplay, character design, and intensive replay value.  By controlling a party of up to four, choosing from multiple races and classes, you can pick and choose the level of balance (or imbalance) you can have with your team members.  Between having a Human Battlemage, or a Ratling Alchemist, a Minotar Barbarian, or possibly an Insectoid Farmer (yes, farmer) if you like the trolling side, you can set up your party how you wish.\n\nA single playthrough of this game will easily take beyond 25 hours of gameplay, and that is if you are cruising through not looking for secrets and treasures.  There are puzzles galore, and many are extremely DIFFICULT puzzles that will challenge the most intellectual minds.  Most of these puzzles you will have never seen in any other video game, and some especially new in style to the LoG series.\n\nBeyond the extensive puzzle-solving, quick reflexes and a little bit of finger dexterity is needed in this game to survive, especially if you enjoy playing on all of the hardest difficulty settings the game offers you at the start like I have.  LoG 2 offers three difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard), Ironman mode, which allows saving only at health crystals, and Single-use Health Crystals mode, where you are only able to use the crystals once.  On top of all that, they brought back Old-School Mode back, which takes away your trusty map, leaving you in the dust with nothing but your compass (if you find one) and pencils and graph paper.\n\nThe layout of the game is fantastic, as it starts you on the shore of a beach, and the environment takes you into swamps, dens, lairs, catacombs, pyramids, jungles, etc...there is a wide array of refreshing map tiles that will keep you entertained, if not perhaps somewhat confused and lost.  Keep your eyes open, though, and look for levers, hidden buttons and switches, and traps everywhere.\n\nThis game can be very taxing on the mind and body, but does wonders for the soul.  If you like dungeon crawlers, this is the BEST in the genre, and is worth the money.\n\nI rate this game a 9.6 out of 10.","November 19, 2014","true","100.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It didn`t cater to challenge the titans of the genre and I never expected it to, so I had a blast. I counted on Legend of Grimrock 2 to be of the same caliber, maybe a bit longer, maybe a bit more fancy looking.\n\nI counted wrong.\n\nShortly into my first game (on normal difficulty) there was this plant-boss. It could not be just danced around mindlessly. I certainly couldn`t just tank it with my four-human party. Already on the first level I had to learn to play this game not as the next easy-money follow-up, but as a new game. I was really caught off guard, but I still had no idea what was waiting up ahead. Next, I went through a phase of irritation as the game was wrong. Certainly you have been challenged as well, but when were you actually proven to be the one wrong? I wasn`t wrong, of course, at least not for a long time. Then I realized I was. The irritating game gas fun. A lot of fun.\n\nNow, for a breakdown of the goods and the bads of this game. Let`s do the bads first.\n\nBAD:\n\nHow do I put this gently? The game has (almost) no story. There. Put. Not gently. There are no NPCs to interact with and the story, told through a few scrolls and wall-writings, is thin, very thin.\n\nThen there are the new mechanic of injury to bodyparts. Now this is one unnecessary annoyance added to the game that really is nothing other than a new condition (poison, disease, etc), that can hit any of your party members almost anytime throughout the game. Oh, there are plenty of ways to avoid it and cure it but FOCL, THIS is not fun, nor does it add to the experience. (Okay, I can see it have an impact on ironman and the number of potions available, but at least for me, this is a direct drawback.)\n\nThe game is surprisingly hard even on normal mode. For me, this was overcomeable. However, if you do have a lot of trouble with the Viper-Roots, and the things beyond, there is no shame in starting over on Easy. You should ENJOY the game, not SUFFER through.\n\nThe game is extremely puzzle oriented. Even on the main…uh…”story”. (I know what I said about story above, thank you!) Yep, puzzles are heavily a part of the main “story”-line. So much so that you may end up stuck on puzzles, unable to progress the game. As a former AD&D DM I do not quite like this approach. Puzzles (mostly) are for side-quests and bonus objectives, not for progressing the game. At the very least, answers or hints should be present for completing the main “story” line puzzles.\n\nGOOD:\n\nThe graphics are great. The outdoors are great. The underwaters are great. The beaches and forests are great and so on. Music and sound effects are also very good. Nice balance and composition. Take Medusa (or is it Gorgon) as an example. The scream that accompanies her petrifying attack is frightening enough to create a chill (thrill, even) without having the real Medusa in the living-room also cry out…. (I`m gonna be in a lotta trouble for this if she ever creates a Steam account….)\n\nThe game is actually quite non-linear. And it works pretty well. It may be limited a bit by your play style, but really, this is a feature that is rather impressive in this genre of games.\n\nThe game has a fantastic old-time grid-based game atmosphere. In LoG 1 you were meant to dodge and dance around your enemy to be able to overcome them. A great way to evolve the mechanics from the old-time grid-based games where this was often an exploit. In Log 2, the monsters have evolved to counter (partly) this strategy forcing YOU to evolve also. This also probably means LoG 2 isn`t the best starting point for newcomers to grid-based RPGs.\n\nI above claimed the puzzle-heavyness of this game to be a bad thing. I still mean that within the boundries set above. But after having consolidated myself with the fact that this game IS puzzle-heavy and that puzzles ARE a part of the main “story”-line, I learned to appreciate them. The designers of the puzzles of Legend of Grimrock 2 are geniuses. The depths of some of the puzzles are amazing. I mean, it`s one thing to appreciate the puzzle itself, but if you look at the process it must have been to PLAN these puzzles, your jaw should drop. If it doesn`t, well, if you can`t see it, just open your mouth and sit still until drool comes out and know that this is the right thing to do.\n\nThere are some epic battles in this game, ones that really make you feel you`ve accomplished something when you overcome them. There are also some (nice? Hehe, lol) surprises that may or may not be avoided, depending on how well you explore.\n\nThe game most certainly has a replayable value. I`ve done three runs (132 hours) so far and I may do another one, on easy, to breeze through. I love the game and there are some race/class combinations I still want to try.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nIs it the best game I`ve played? Is it the best grid-based RPG I`ve played?\n\nNo and no.\n\nBut the competition isn`t really fair. I`m a long-time fan of the Might & Magic series and I really doubt that any game will ever topple Might & Magic III - The Isle of Terra from my throne. The Might & Magic series has a long-running story that (imho) is really good. These are complicated games in vast worlds. So any one (or two) new games (in an old genre) can hardly ever compete with that for me. (NOTE that Might & Magix X is not included in my praise. I do not currently recommend that game.)\n\nHowever, Legend of Grimrock has at the very least made me make the comparison. Had LoG had the same depth of story, it would have had the last element (pun intended) to challenge the best grid-based RPGs of old.\n\nIt will still go down in history as one of the obelisks of the genre.\n\nIn my humble opinion, it is an 7/10, compared to ALL the grid-based games I`ve played (this includes the MMs, the Eye of the Beholder series, Lands of Lore, Ultima Underworld, Elder Scrolls, etc). Lack of story is the main reason it does not quite reach the top, but the annoyance of bodypart injuries also pull down a bit. All in all puzzle-design is so good it actually gives a plus to the game, even though I think there are too many puzzles in the main storyline. Non-linearity, nostalgia, atmosphere and replayability are also all good factors. The skill system is a bit simple and could certainly be improved, but it works and does not lower the quality of the game.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game (and LoG 1). It`s a lot of game for the money. It is truly well designed. If you take it for what it is, you will have many hours of fun gameplay to look forward to.\n","December 18, 2015","true","152.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

A few new elements, some new functions with alchemy and optional use of guns. They've made it work both in dungeons and outside which is really cool. The square-walking fighting system has been enhanced a bit so that it isn't just enough to sidestep and hit over and over anymore. Some monsters will jump behind you, some will hit to the side if you sidestep them to their sword-arm side. Little things like that. Still, the main objective remains the same: don't ever get surrounded.\n\nOnly negative point at all is that a few of the puzzles sometimes seem a bit too far out, so to speak. And they can be a bit annoying more than clever but it's very rare. Usually, you can work the solution out from clues and all together the balance between too difficult and difficult enough is accurately struck.\n\nThe game ending seems to lead to the next game in the series and so it can feel a bit unfinished, perhaps. The final boss fight comes a bit out of nowhere, it feels, but it's actually a good boss fight. It's tough, sure, but it's not just about learning all the mechanics from replaying it 100 times, it's actually just about fighting well. So all in all, a very nice game. Into RPG? Buy it, simple as that.","June 3, 2015","true","34.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Curiousity and dedication are highly rewarded, which makes you feel awesome when you solve a really hard puzzle all on your own! Good game that keeps you interested. I will say that the free roaming aspect makes the game a little tough because you have to choose based on no prior knowledge to the map in the main quest.

Grimrock 1 was a really good modernization of the dungeon crawler that I didn't realize I had been missing. Grimrock 2 is possibly the best game I've played this year, which is drawing to a close at the time of writing.\n\nThe game is gorgeous. A lot of fans of the first were put off by the game being even partly outdoors, but there are a lot of touches that disguise the grid-based nature of the game, like uneven sands and the like. I never looked at the game and thought 'Now this here doesn't look good.'\n\nGameplay is much improved from the first. Gone are the days of circle-strafing around every enemy and cheesing the game. Most enemies function in unique ways and require different tactics to approach... I mean, some of them can be circle-strafed, but it's not a reliable tactic for all of them this time, which I appreciate. But I digress, the biggest improvement comes from game feel in a lot of regards. A major boon that you didn't even know you wanted is that each party member has dual weapon slots ala Diablo 2, so you can switch between gear on the fly without having to pull up a menu every time.\n\nAdditionally, character selection has variety now. Gone are the 3 classes to go with your 4 party members, as there are a whopping 8 classes to choose from, ranging from nearly essential to wonderfully bizarre. Variety is the spice of life and, honestly, Grimrock 1 was sorely lacking in this regard.\n\ntl;dr Grimrock 1 was good, Grimrock 2 is one of the better games I've ever played.

Come out of the dungeon and adventure outdoors in deep forests, shoreline caves, and other beautifully detailed areas.\n\nWeapon and weapon skills redesigned. Weapon skills are now Light, Heavy, Missile, Thrown, and Firearms, so melee characters are less restricted by skill choice.

Classes and races grant bonuses that can be built upon with skill and trait choices.\n\nSmarter enemies for tougher, more engaging combat.

I can attest to that, it's true.  Legend of Grimrock was basically an Eye of the Beholder clone, even down to its puzzles and annoying spiders, i.e. a dungeon that started out rather bland and simple, but got progressively more difficult and challenging, as well as varied, as you descended towards the boss fight.  Eye of the Beholder II had expanded on that formula by allowing you to experience a greater variety of locations, monsters and puzzles.  Legend of Grimrock does the same - it's basically the same game with a large and expansive outdoor hub, multiple dungeons and buildings to explore, the ability to have multiple floors in a single level, a broader selection of monsters and even more mind bending puzzles.  There are changes to the game as well: a new race and some new classes have been added, the leveling system has been tweaked to be less all or nothing, skill branches are less deep, weapons and armor have been categorized into broad proficiencies, alchemy has been added and magic has been reworked.

I bought bouth games on a whim during a sale, because I like old school PC stuff, love RPG's, and remember seeing Notch (yes creator of Minecraft Notch) rave about these on twitter, and saw a video done by LGR.\n\nNow I can be slow with old school RPG's, I tend to lose interest after a couple days and it takes several spaced out sessions for me to get around to completing them, while I player other games in between. Not these, I was hooked, I had to find the secrets, I had to get farther, I had to finish these games.\n\nThe title music for both games were some of my favorite tracks, ever. I went into Legend of Grimrock 2 wondering if they could even compete with the first games title track, and they matched, if not surpassed it.\n\nThe controls are tight, the biggest problem with classic PC games is getting used to the incredibly dated controls from a  era where jump being "J" made sense, and if you were to watch a video Grimrock looks like its a clunky mess like those classics, but its not the case, the controls are perfectly conducive to the intended gameplay.\n\nIf you enjoy RPG's at all, then do not hesitate and buy both of these games, they are worth any price and you will not be disapointed.

The only things you can complain about are the parts they DIDN'T change, the game still suffers from some poor balance choices in places, including some that carried over from the original(Earth Magic is STILL absolutely useless).\n\nOn the other hand, I'd feel somewhat less annoyed at starting over in LoG2 due to a poor party than I would in LoG1, because the game feels like less of an outright struggle to get through. Not that there aren't still challenges, but all of the challenges are FUN this time around.\n\nThere are also only respawning monsters in the overworld areas, which makes the game, frankly put, a whole lot less annoying.","December 29, 2015","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then do not think further, Grimrock 2 is 1000% way better, buy it and enjoy.\n\nFor those who do not know Grimrock: oldschool orthogonal RPG, traditional dungeon crawling, puzzles and enigmas, all with beautiful graphics. Imagine Skyrim without the free movements or the open world or the missions or the dialogues or... well OK don't, it doesn't sound so great said like that... both games are different but great!\n\nDo you remember Lands of Lore, Eye of the Beholder and such oldies? Well compared to Grimrock 1 who stayed very classic and a bit too repetitive (only one dungeon), Grimrock 2 is now much closer to Lands of Lore than ever. The world is huge, the items and dungeons too, the puzzles are still very hard and the difficulty sometimes crazy... so I am really looking forward to the third one, with I hope villages, dialogues, shops and more...\n\nI spent more than 70 hours in the game, and I have not found every secret or object.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/251730/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","The sequel to the critically acclaimed Legend of Grimrock brings back the old formula of grid-based dungeoneering with a party of four. This time around you are on an island and the game's levels are split between the overworld and subterranean areas filled with a variety of monsters and treasure. There are also night-day cycles which will effect your visibility and also certain puzzles. Most of the storyline revolves around you finding power gems and you will need to get every single one if you want to get the secret ending which means A LOT of exploring. The new classes add a little flair to the game but most are weaker than the ones used in Grimrock 1 (especially the farmer which is a joke class at best). I didn't care for the injury system which mostly serves as a means to force the player to either backtrack to a save crystal or waste healing potions as some of the injuries can make a character completely useless or cripple the party's speed. Also a couple of the puzzles were downright cryptic with hints like "over and over and under" when it really meant "go in a circular loop around one part of the bridge, then the other part, then back and forth." Were people really supposed to be able to figure this out on their own? (besides through trial and error?). Also the optional secret boss was a huge unexpected difficulty spike although I manged to figure out a way to cheese him. Other than that, Grimrock 2 is a pretty solid sequel and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first game.","June 27, 2015","true","26.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I really recommended to buy it, if you liked the first one or any old school dungeon crawler that it doesn't rely heavy on action or arcade rpg. It seems that we are going the same way like LG1 - the main story is beeing transformed in a tutorial, compared with those custom fan made stories you see on nexus or workshop; now that's a good thing and better than a "new game plus" option. However, there are some stupid developer choices that we could had gone without :\n1. NO MORE UNARMED COMBAT - c'mon that was great in LG1\n2. Many classes but not so many combat styles level up perks - no light weapon + shield, no heavy weapon + lw/dagger/throwing weapon ( yet you carry and parry easy with a tower shield table for 4 type), no 2 daggers sneaky assassin combat (in the end when you max out dual and play with 2 swords and I felt like a diablo 3 dual wielding barbarian); these kid of styles  don't benefit from anything.\n3. No elemental dmg  added by your mage on arrows - to be honest I was expecting your mage ( depending on his class of magic) to arcane boost any type of weapons ( not just arrows like in LG1) and recharge fire swords etc.\n4. Not so convincing magic - I barely kill something with a shower of 6 fireballs ( the most powerful spell in the game, that eats my mana pool like no tomorrow), feels like an AK-47 with gum balls instead of bullets.\n5. Main story doesn't have enough elemental foes, booring diversity\n6. Battlemage feels clunky, since we don't have a "remember my last spell" hand slot, using magic and a weapon in the same time is too complicated, where combat LG2 easy is harder that combat LG1 hard\n7. Not everybody has the patience for clueless easter item hunt ( praise the walkthrough)\n\nSo 8-9 out of 10 for this one","July 9, 2015","true","61.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Just as always.\n\nScore out of 10:Graphics: 9.2, again pretty good graphics for such genre. Designer and artists did their job - game is pleasant to watch.\nGame engine: 9.9, engine is one of the best in genre so far. Almost bug free. Modding tools / Workshop integration are included. Not ten for small details that require polish. Especially in sense of controls - it is real-time action game, but you are restricted to discrete movement steps. Long story short - you cannot cancel your move order after button press. Thats not the end, but you should play to know how not-so-obvious sometimes game is.\nGame mechanics: 9.0, its not ten, because game itself is just an example of what you can do with the engine, and if you are not Modder you will never learn whole potential. I can call LoG2 campaign (Story mod) without Skirmish\Free roam\Challenges stuff from Devs. And guess what? There just so much (not used)pottential to be exploited (Workshop items FTW) that I cannot grade it with shiny Ten. Engine allows far more fun things than was used in main campaign. Different ammo type for same weapons, spells, potions and so on, game content is not full. And it is not 9.5 just because the only game type (story mod) is not balanced enough. Just open Guides section and check any party creation guide to learn how silly are humanZ (race) and wizZardZ (class), and how small is the number of optimal strategies. 9.1 score not achieved because game has no option on start (like Ironman and Old-School map) that champion dies when his starvation counter reaches the end.\nGame addiction: 10.0, finally ten! Perfect. Started to play immediately on Hard - was punished for that (heavily), but didn't give up. Thats a sort of addiction! Seriously, this game is so awesome that I lost decent part of my sleep-time.\nGameplay: 9.1, again, almost perfect. It could be next-to-AWESOME if the Game used its potential on full scale. And to be a really AWESOME LoG2 needs some more mechanics. I understand, that quests and NPC are not the LoG way, but somehow game misses non-combat and non-puzzle elements. Something you may want to do in between. This may be a rival parties of NPC adventurers, for example. First making through the hard puzzle-filled maze, and then later standing somewhere on higher ground and watching NPC dying to the monsters. Or even pulling a lever to trigger some trap on them. So much fun could be added if you can see the world through the eye of oppenent.\nTOTAL: 9.5 First of all, buy this game. Secondly, well, you can play it if you feel like this.\nI'm pretty happy that old-forgotten genre is back. M&MX and LoG are definetely most well known titles here, but I saw many other early access or upcoming or even already released First-person RPGs.\nI just wish for Wizardry 8 modern remake. And Meridian 59. May be for latter more, but steam is full of free-mmo's so there is no selling point for now.\n\nLegend of Grimrock 2 is perfect example of how sequel should look like. It is also a perfect successor to the genre itself. It is punishing but nevertheless entertaining experience.\n\nBest regards,\nHypnotoad the Lizardmen farmer with Canon.","March 15","true","62.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, these games were held back by clunky/unintuitive interfaces and skill systems, or did not run smoothly despite decent computer specs. Legend of Grimrock 2, on the other hand, is old-school nostalgia done RIGHT. Easily my most-loved game of 2014 (unless something crazy happens in December), Legend of Grimrock 2 is one of the most immersive, challenging and rewarding games I have played.\n\nGameplay feels very crisp and intuitive. It’s an amazing feeling, to tentatively stick your head out from behind a dark corner, wondering whether that giant Rat-man dressed as a pirate is going to one-shot your squishy party members with his enormous hand cannon. It’s an amazing feeling, to finally put together a bunch of vague clues scribbled on parchment paper, locating a hidden treasure chest containing epic phat loots – and distributing this loot amongst my fully customized party of 4, each with their own distinct fighting styles and weapon/magic inclinations.\n\nThere’s a good balance between combat, puzzle solving and exploration in Legend of Grimrock 2, and for me most of the puzzles were difficult, but that’s what made playing this game feel so rewarding. I often found myself saying “I’ll just explore one more area before I quit!” – and that didn’t work out too well. The developers did a fantastic job with level and sound design -- exploring the Laboratory for the first time actually made me very frightened. It’s a game that totally gets you in the zone and allows your imagination to run wild, and I appreciate that.\n\nMy thoughts comparing Legend of Grimrock 1 & 2: The first game was a fun, linear dungeon crawler with a rather repetitive environment. Legend of Grimrock 2 is a much larger epic adventure across many different (but always beautiful) environments, both indoors and outdoors. The combat in both games aren’t the strongest selling point – in fact, it feels rather cheesy to constantly “run in circles” around monsters on hard difficulty (as facing them directly would be too dangerous). That said, both games are very high quality in terms of puzzles, atmosphere and exploration, but if you’re on a gaming budget and can only purchase one game at the moment, you may want to play Legend of Grimrock 1 if you prefer a more linear, focused adventure. There was quite a bit of "wandering-around-lost" downtime for me in Legend of Grimrock 2 compared to Legend of Grimrock 1, but it didn’t bother me that much. However, I can understand that if you have limited time to play, you may be looking for an adventuring experience that feels more cohesive – in that case, buy the first game.\n\nI’m pretty close to completing Legend of Grimrock 2 and I’m a little sad. I’ll stress again what I said at the beginning -- Legend of Grimrock 2 is old-school nostalgia done RIGHT.","November 21, 2014","true","47.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I'm currently 14 hours in, and I'm having a blast.  If you've never played the first, you owe it to yourself to do so if you are a classic RPG fan.  I don't even mean RPGs with this style of grid-based movement, I mean RPGs like Morrowind or Baldur's Gate.\n\nI never got into the oldschool games like Eye of the Beholder because they were too abusive, and I didn't have the patience back then.  Grimrock respects you and lets you have some breathers after those tough and costly battles.  Grimrock also handles its hunger system well, because you will never die from starvation, you just lose you ability to self heal.\n\nMy only real nit-pick right now is that the puzzles have been a bit on the easy side.  Grimrock 1 had some of the best puzzles I've seen in a game, where they made you feel smart for figuring out the vague hints they gave you (like the Checkered Room).  Grimrock 2 just hasn't had those kind of puzzles yet.  Maybe I need to get in further, but even if I never get what I'm looking for, I don't mind.

The legend of Grimrock II has done it again for me. The game already feels "bigger" as you explore, not just a dungeon like in the previous one, but the island of Nex, which is filled with a multitude of dungeons.\n\nIf you liked the first game, you will definetely love this one! I clearly recommand this game, which puts even more place to the "exploration" part with outside areas, and more dungeons, as well as a lot of secrets to find.\n\nIn term of content, the game already puts the bar higher than its predecessor, giving old items from grimrock, but also a lot of brand new items, which would probably remind of old school games from the 80's-90's, like notably a wodden staff, or also a sling. There are brand new monsters, as well as some from the previous game (According to the website, 44 monsters with 12 from the previous game), and the game feels fresh due to this.\nAlso, the biggest change in the game is its beauty, as you travel outside, you get to see some marvelous areas, which is better than the 3 area types we see in mount grimrock.\n\nIn term of gameplay and difficulty, the game proposes 7 classes and 5 races (1 being new), which is more than its predecessor. The skill system is different though, proposing less perk levels (5 for each) but only 1 skill point per level. Also there is now a "local damage" system, which can prevent you from using a weapon slot, or make you slower, prevent your health or energy to come back up, ect, ect... And most notably for the adventurers who want the hardest challenges, they can set life crystals to be usable only once, and/ or to be the only way to save the game.\n\nIn any case, I would say this game simply blows, and, being much more complete than its predecessor, should have an even longer life thanks to the dungeon editor, and the creativity of the community.","October 15, 2014","true","122.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

I love it very much.  Not everyone will love it, but it's not the sort of game that cares about those folks.  It's a reasonably challenging game with some of the most respectable riddles of any RPG I've ever played.  The combat is great, definitely more polished over the first game and strikes a nice balance between rewarding strategy, improvisation, and speed.  The world is nicely fleshed out with lots of attention to detail.  The designs are not extravagent or particularly novel, but they're not meant to be.  This is a classic fantasy game in many respects.\n\nBut the core of why I love Legend of Grimrock is really how much it respects the intelligence of the player.  It expects you to use your brain, and it rewards you for paying attention.  It has some flaws with minor mechanics - but nothing that will plague your game experience.

There’s a big Dark Souls inspiration to its intricate world, filled with secrets and understated lore.

In this game it works extremely well.\n\nThe level design is fantastic, and so it the general feel of the game. The only aspect in this game which might be slight inferior to its prequel is the puzzles.

The original game was already really good, especially for an indie title. The sequel though simply blows it's predecessor out of the water with all the additions. The core game is basically the same as the original, but levels now have many more options to them. Water, ladders and multi-story areas combined with a new non-linear level design philosophy created a beautiful game. More environments, more monsters, more puzzles, everything that people loved about the original Grimrock is there and moreso. That includes difficulty too; but thanks to the newfound openness you can simply go somewhere else if something is too difficult. I can happily say I only got really stuck two times in a thirty hour long game with breaks between areas. It's really amazing how they've changed so little and yet made the game so much better.

Grimrock is a fantastic revival, updating the format with a new-school look and filling the dungeons with enough monsters to cover every possible phobia that human beings have. Creepy spiders? Got them. Horrible zombie monsters? Got those too. Starving to death in a dungeon because the puzzle for a solution eludes you? That's you. It turns out you are the monster who ate all the cakes and now have no more cakes. Way to go, Chompy McFoodie.\n\nLegend of Grimrock II is largely the same thing, but massively improved and even more difficult than the first game. I get the feeling the developers didn't have a good direction to take the Grimrock series, so they went the BIGGER AND BETTERER route. This is not a bad thing at all - the first Grimrock left me vaguely unsatisfied after I reached the bottom, because I realized all we were doing was running around narrow corridors in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mountain. Well, Grimrock II is for picky-picky pants who thought along the same lines, because this time you get to GO OUTSIDE AND GET KILLED BY HORRIBLE MONSTERS. Seriously - the game has you start out fighting for your life on the beach with scraps and rocks, and every fight feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ do-or-die frantic clawing at each others' throats. The game is able to keep this crazy amount of tension going with each and every new area - fights become intense and terrifying with every new monster because it has this little quirk or trick up its sleeve that it's going to use to ♥♥♥♥ your party over and kill you dead.\n\nIt works out a lot of the quirks from the first game's puzzles - mostly. The puzzles are difficult, but not too brain bending - they don't quite reach the Portal sweet spot, but they come close and solving them made me feel like a champion. There's still a couple that require moon logic and sent me towards a walkthrough guide.\n\nThe plot is a bunch of accented nothing. The first game's story had a bunch of information on the world, but not a whole bunch as to why the King sent four poor suckers into a mountain cave to find out what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. The second game doesn't have much more than that. It has lots of beautiful details about the world that the game exists in, but there's not much else to it other than "Gotta get the ♥♥♥♥ off of this crazy death island full of crazy death monsters, gotta go!"\n\nI can't really say much more about this game other than it's a bigger and better sequel and you don't need to play the first game to understand it. I will say that whenever people talk ♥♥♥♥ about beating hard bosses in Dark Souls or Bloodborne, I'll talk about the time I got jumped by cobras and crazy undead Medusa archers just to get a longsword that I didn't even end up wanting to keep.","May 24, 2015","true","48.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Very few - the party still consists of only four characters (six as in EoB would be nice), and there are no shortcuts for the primary attacks (instead of F1-F6 keys as in EoB, the weapons must be clicked with RMB). Otherwise, it is perfect IMHO.","October 28, 2014","true","44.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I loved the first game, and this game is everything you could wish for in a sequel: More of the same, brilliant ideas, but different enough to feel fresh and new. For me, the best things about the game is that it respects the player and paces itself perfectly. It's never repetitive and each challenge you tackle feels new and different.\n\nEven when you're done with the game, you can go through it again with a new party and look for secrets you might have missed. One thing I've noticed in my now second playthrough is that I'm probably progressing 3x-4x faster than before, meaning knowledge is more powerful than any kind of weapon or equipment you find in the game, which I think is a testament to great design.\n\nIf you haven't played this kind of game before, I would actually recommend the first game over this one, simply because it's more linear and easier to get into. When you're done with that, you WILL be wanting more, and then you come back for this one :)\n\nI ran into some game-crashing bugs the first week, but they have since been fixed. There are still some performance issues in certain areas, but nothing major.

I have played and finished Dungeon Master 1 & 2, Eye of Beholder trilogy, Realms of Arkania trilogy, Lands of Lore, Wizardry 7... and of course Grimrock 1. Some of them were pretty challenging, especially W7 and DM2. Yet it was nothing compared to this game.\nThe combat is not the biggest issue. It's quite hard and I have to admit I suck at real-time micromanaging everything - attacks, potions and spells while running around avoiding enemies and traps. But at least you can restart on easier difficulty.\nThe biggest problem are the puzzles. Especially in the second half the game starts to throw puzzle after puzzle at you, each more and more complex and cryptic. With extremely vague clues, sometimes with no hints at all.\nI don't think I've ever needed a walkthrough while playing Grimrock 1 but here I had to check it constantly. I mean, in the final area I wasn't able to solve a single puzzle! And after looking up the solutions I was pretty sure I would have never figured that out.\nThis was also great - to access one of the maps you need to use a specific weapon located in a completely different map on the other side of the game. But the weapon is not marked as a quest item, it's just a standard staff. And because it sucks, I did the only logical thing - I threw it away somewhere. Imagine my surprise ten hours later when I discovered the staff is required to progress. I actually had to spawn it using a developer console to be able to continue.\n\nThis could have been a great game like the first one. Instead it turned to be such frustrating experience I actually had to force myself to finish it.","April 20","false","32.1"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","1"

The creatures all look uniquely designed and look amazing. There's even boss fights, absent in the previous game.\n\nNew mechanics implemented to encourage exploration and discovery, with secrets hidden around the world as well as digging around to find treasure.\n\nCurrently overall, this is LoG, but with alot more improvements both aesthetically and mechanically. Thanks devs for not letting me down with a great sequel!\n\nFinished the game on both endings, needless to say the game ends well and feels good from start to finish.","October 15, 2014","true","38.4"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

While the AI is better, you'll still spend most of your fighting time exploiting its behaviour since a straight up fight will almost always end badly.\n\nWhere Grimrock 2 really shines, however, is in the exploration and puzzle solving. Gone is the multi-level, single dungeon, where you now have something almost reminiscent of legend of zelda; a roughly open world, where your progression is primarily driven by your ability to explore and solve puzzles.\n\nAnd those puzzles, you say? Some of the best I've seen in games. While many are challenging, none have inexplicable leaps in logic, and every future puzzle is building on what you've learned previously. Clues are not as obscenely cryptic as in la mulana, but give just enough information for your mind to leap at the solution. There hasn't been a point in the game so far where I've been stuck with no-where to go, and yet many of the puzzles have me feeling like a genius on their solution. The balance of difficulty of the puzzles is meticulous.\n\nBuy this game. It's real good.","October 25, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashington/recommended/251730/","smashington","smashington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashington/","170 products in account","Like its predecessor, Legend of Grimrock 2 is a tribute to the grid-based dungeon crawlers of yore. Unlike LoG1, however, which was very straight-forward (or straight down, I should say), LoG2 goes for a more open exploration approach. This both works and doesn't work.\n\nIt works in giving you the impression that there's always something you've yet to discover elsewhere - hidden treasure, the way to access the next dungeon, the solution to that one puzzle you just can't figure out. It is frustrating, however, when you're not sure whether you already have the means to complete a puzzle in the area you're in or whether the clues you possess apply to a puzzle in an entirely different area. You also can't tell which puzzles are necessary to progress in the game.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly very well designed and more varied than in LoG1, partly thanks to the expansion of puzzle mechanics - for instance, a "level" can now have multiple levels (floors) within it. Towards the end, there are a few puzzles that seem a bit obscure.\n\nThe gameplay has been polished from Grimrock 1. The enemy design is now better suited to the apparent effectiveness of the side-stepping strategy that could be used to dominate almost any enemy in LoG1 - movement during combat is no longer breaking the game, instead, it is necessary to survive. The skill and spell systems have been reworked. There's much more variety in environments and when exploring the outdoors, the graphics are honestly quite pleasant to the eye.\n\nThe lack of hand-holding has its pros and cons. The feeling of accomplishment after completing a difficult puzzle is uncomparable, but when the difficulty of the puzzles is combined with the open exploration aspect, there is a high possiblity of frustration in not knowing where to go. Still, Grimrock 2 is a great improvement over its predecessor and a worthy contender for being the best dungeon crawler of all time.","October 23, 2014","true","35.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a game for people who like to use logic and have it somewhat easy solving riddles and puzzles, a degree of patience is really a necessity. Some of the riddles are really devilish and will test your mettle to its limit but the satisfaction of solving it - priceless!\nThe Almost Human crew took a lesson from all the critique as well as pleas made regarding their 1st title and made a really grand improvement. The game world feels much more open and the day-night cycle is just an icing on the cake, the variety of oponents is much greater as are their tactics (AI) and speed. Items as well have been improved both in terms of variety and usefulness. Not only that, the world is huge and varied, nearly each "section" has its own personal flavor and feel, you don't ever feel that every dungeon is the same. Your very first playthrough, assuming one figures the puzzles oneself, will provide well over the stated 20hrs of play time. Uncovering all the secrets this game has to offer will extend the expierince even farther, trust me I did them all.\nDue to the non-linearality, various modes, difficulties and some really interesting, possible party compositions it does offer viable reasons for a second or even 3rd playthrough.\nGraphically this game looks really, really gorgeus and beautiful. Some of the landscapes will put you in awe. Sadly I noticed 2 annoyences:due to screen tearing I played with v-sync on and sometimes, for no real reason the fps dropped from 60 to 30 rarely to 20. Alt+tabing was temporarily fixing the issue.\non some occassions the virtually no anti-aliasing really hurts. For people not playing in 1080p this might be even more hurtful issue.I do hope those might get worked on in future!\nOverall, a very worthy heir to LoG1 who took everything from its predecessor and made it even better, bigger, taller, deeper, grander!

The textures are a little under par for games these days but for 800MB download it's pretty good. within the first hour you'll experience a beach, a crypt and a forest, just to show the diversity of area's on offer so far.\n\nCHARACTERS ++\n-Characters have been overhauled and so far i can't complain, more classes and an extra race open up the party formation and can take a lot of thought depending on your play style,\n-The new ratling race is more for storage and less combat focused\n-Alchemist class grows plants for potions and uses firarms\n-Battle mage class is a combination of a mage and a fighter\n-Farmer class for food, not much else...\n-Fighter class weapon skill focus\n-Berserker class health and damage focus\n-Knight class health and armour focus\n-Rogue class for throwing, dual wielding and bows/crossbows\n\nLEVELLING +\n-Stat points are now automatic and depend on your class, I don't mind this as it simplifies the process without taking anything away from the game\n-Stats can be improved by having a healthy diet specific to the race of character\n-Skills are now all open to every class and have 5 tiers with ability unlocks at certain tiers, for example accuracy skill tier 2 allows for attacking with melee from the back row\n\nEXPLORATION +\n-Can feel a little different at first with the new setting but just start wandering and remember to check every wall and every square of the map\n-Underwater and you can catch fishy's, though they are our friends, not food (you can eat them)\n\nCOMBAT ++\n-Melee feels a little slowed down, be it very fractional, less spammy, more impact, makes kiting a little more difficult, still just as fun (might just be my impression as it is very subtle)\n-Ranged seems to have been expanded with the addition of guns and bullets as well as what seems like a larger variety of weapons.\n-Spell system has been overhauled, you no longer click a combination of the 3x3 spell panel, but draw a line in one motion, I imagine this would be more for touch based devices but it works fine and streamlines the job of casting.\n\nMONSTERS ++ (X2 Pirate bonus)\n-Feels balanced for early levels, not to hard to beat, not a cake walk.\n-Yet to find a monster being reused from Grimrock 1\n-First Boss was quite fun\n-Pirate theme, pirate rats\n\nMAP EDITOR\n-Yet to try, but can't wait with all the new features in game alone it should be a blast","October 15, 2014","true","51.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Not that the original is bad, but this is a good evolution of what they did originally.  It's tough and if you prefer to focus on the puzzles I suggest playing on Easy as the combat can be brutal.  If you don't like puzzles then this game is definitely not for you.  Some of them are extremely hard to figure out and you'll be running around trying to find clues.  I confess I've looked online more then once to get help.

Luckily no knowledge of the predecessor is required to enjoy this game. It does help if you know the core concept though, as the game never holds your hand apart from at the very start. The semi-turnbased classic RPG elements are not for everyone, as it does require strategic thinking while in combat, especially later in the game. The game often does not show any mercy in unexpected tough situations. It challenged me and kept me immersed at all time, which I greatly enjoyed. An aspect that I personally had great fun with is the puzzles. These puzzles are hardly ever straightforward and really make you think. Look around for clues. Any secrets? What does this text mean? And when you finally find the solution, you feel like a master of puzzlesolving.\n\nThere are some things that bother me. Some monsters seem just too strong in comparison to other in the same area. It catches you off guard, making you think you can take on the area while you definitely cannot. Also I think accuracy is always quite a bothersome thing for me. My characters keep missing their attacks, making me frustrated at times of danger. This is a common mechanic in classic RPGs so I just have to get used to it I suppose. And finally, although I love the concept of tilebased movement, it did take me a while to fully grasp it and gave me some issues along the way. In the end, mostly small subjective complaints.\n\nFinally, I absolutely love the level editor. As a level designer, I greatly enjoy this feature and it definitely was one of the selling points for me.\n\nI recommend this game to all hardcore players who enjoy a beautiful and expansive classic RPG.","October 28, 2014","true","151.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Many of the puzzles were very obtuse, and I had to resort to a walkthrough several times to find solutions. Lots of "well these abstract insturctions you may or may not have found on a note 3 zones over explain how to do it!" scenarios. There were a few times where I couldn't figure out where to go, and the combination of these issues almost made me lose heart and stop playing the game.\n\nAll that aside, the game is still great. The level design is good and the classes/skills are interesting. I (mostly) enjoyed my time with it, and it's a great game for someone who likes hunting secrets for finding hidden surprises.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game...

Both games are very similar with a few differences. If you want more detailed information about the game I would humbly suggest looking at my Legend of Grimrock review. The game sets you on the Isle of Nex as four shipwrecked prisoners (no doubt on their way to Mount Grimrock) and once again you must survive the harsh environment and escape alive. It is hinted at and you soon discover that you are here on someone else’s wishes and whatever plan they have in store for you surely isn’t in your best interest.\n\nThe story in Legend of Grimrock II is a lot more straightforward and you will quickly discover what your main objective is and where you need to go in order to complete the game, it’s a welcome addition to the series and all throughout the game it expands on the lore and universe that this world exists in.\nThe game still has its core elements and players coming from the first game will feel right at home. You now have 5 races and 8 classes to pick from which adds a great dynamic to the games combat. The puzzles in this game almost felt a lot more challenging and stimulating and didn’t feel beyond my ability to solve but, rather a good test of my abilities.\n\nOverall I felt like Legend of Grimrock II kicked it all up a notch with the game being more challenging than the first. Combat is still as engaging as the first, relying on maneuvering in real time and giving you a wealth of weapons, bombs, and spells to choose from. The aesthetics and atmosphere also feel the same but, improved upon, you go to a greater variety of locations and the music and graphics are simple and beautiful, should have no real problem running this game on lower end PCs.\n\nFor $23.99 USD and over 20 hours of gameplay, Legend of Grimrock II will give you bang for your bucks and you should feel like you got more than enough value out of this amazing game. It’s challenging and has great roleplaying, survival and puzzle solving mechanics and I enjoyed my time just as much as I did in the first game. Thank you Almost Human Games!\n\n\nTL/DR; Legend of Grimrock II is the ideal sequel to its previous installment, more challenging gameplay, more content, better graphics and atmosphere, expanding the lore and world, if you like RPGs or the previous Legend of Grimrock or want a challenging adventure then this game is for you! Its $23.99USD full price and you’ll get 25-30 hours of gameplay with great replay ability from the integrated steam workshop. If you don’t have either game but like what you see definitely get the $29.99 USD bundle for both games, that’s a solid deal.\n\n-Double Thumbs up from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews At: youtube.com/RoyialNetwork","February 12, 2015","true","23.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Your band of four mysterious prisoners just washed up on a mysterious island, run by a mysterious master.  Fight enemies both mysterious and non-mysterious, and find mysterious items from mysterious chests by solving mysterious puzzles.\n\nIf you've never played a game similar to this in the past, you're going to feel a bit confused, and perhaps turned off at first.  Although the game is concidered first-person, think of it like this - you are a floating camera, right in front of four party members.  That's right, you control all four.  Even more jarring for many will be the grid-based movement and combat.  The levels certainly don't appear much like grids, mut you move from grid-space to grid-space without any leeway.  No diagonal moves - only forward, back, and 90-degree turns.  This is one of my only complaints - it's restricive,  seemingly an un-neccisary "old school" feature, and sometimes makes me a little dizzy if I start making too many turns.  Controls are mostly menu based, requiring you to click on the weapon of a party member to attack and actually have non-weapon items (like alchemy equipment or warhorns) if you want to use them.  The games has a very nice map system which creates a classic grid-paper like map (nothing is labled for you, if you want to make note of something the game gives you the tools to do so)\n\nYou would expect, concidering the grid system, that combat would be turn based.  Nope.  You'd better get used to the system quickly, because strafing and dodging opponent attacks are often vital tactics for survival.  This game is quite challenging at times, and I often find that I feel under-leveled for the area I'm in, even when I'm actually not.\n\nCharacter progression is handeled quite well - you never feel completely satisfied with your characters, which is how it should be.  Skills only have 5 levels, but you only get one point per level, and there is something like 20 skills.  Character classes actually feel different from one another and many have very unique benefits / systems.  Alchemists actually grow more herbs once they're in their inventory.  Magic users are treated to a magic system that involves combining different elemental runes to create spells.\n\nThe environments are absolutely beautiful - this is possibly the nicest looking game I own, in my opinion.  But I'm a sucker for AA, so opinions may vary.  Everything is essentially open world.  The best comparison would probably be metroid, if only because most areas are blocked off by locked doors, the keys to which can only be found elsewhere.  That elsewhere is probably blocked off by some puzzles.  The puzzles are a nice level of difficulty, vague enough to leave you scratching your head, untill you figure them out, at which point you facepalm.\n\nAnd did I mention - you can make and download custom dungeons, some of which are campaign lenth?  It's a wonderful feature that adds huge amounts of value if you want to keep playing after you've finished the original campaign.\n\n-Important Note-\nIn the Windows version, custom dungeons are held in Documents\Almost Human\Legend of Grimrock 2\Dungeons.  Dungeons downloaded from the Steam Workshop are immediately brought there, but there are others on the Nexus which are too large to be allowed on the Workshop.  Place those dungeons in the aforementioned file as well.  Took me forever to figure that out.","March 24, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Having played and loved the first title of the franchise, I was positively thrilled to learn about the sequel.\n\nFor those who know the first game:\nEven though LoG1 was a great game, I always felt that staying inside all the time did not fulfill all of Grimrock's potential. I was amazed to see that LoG2 changed this impressively. The developers took some great steps forward with the sequel. Here's what's new:\n\nhandsome graphics\ngreat soundtrack\ndiversified outdoor locations!!!\nimproved character creation process\nmystifying story\n3D (layers of different altitude in one map)\ntremendously improved AI behaviour\nadditional monsters,  new items, innovative spells, challenging puzzles\ntons of wealth: buried treasure, locked chests, golden caches, etc,\ngigantic 34 levels to explore!\nnon-linear exploration - finally you have to ask yourself "Where to next?"\nOnly small downside I experienced: Backtracking in order to search for something left out or testing a theory to a puzzle was sometimes hindered by hoardes of monsters guarding ares, which were already cleared out. This makes grinding possible to an extent, but was occasionally also quite time-consuming. Also, in my opinion the main story itself provides limited "replayability" since it's just not nearly as satisfying anymore if you already know where all the secrets are. I hope that the level-editor will result in some great fan-made additional content!\n\nDifficulty Level\nThe game provides plenty of possibilities for the player to choose their own challenge. Five races, eight classes and 16 skills are paired with the need to form a specialized party of up to four characters. Three different difficulty settings govern the speed and thrill of the very dynamic combat system. As an Old-School RPG veteran I chose to play at the highest difficulty and preferred to draw my own maps instead of enabling the game's automap feature. Additional options exist to raise the challenge even higher. I was very happy to experience a higher difficulty setting not only in terms of more incoming damage and less output, but rather mainly in an increase of the combat's pace. I also didn't get stuck in an unfair combat situation, although different situations did often require to adapt one's strategy, which I highly appreciate in a game.\n\nSome puzzles were really challenging, having me ask my partner and roommates for advice and inspiration. I'm proud that I never used help from a guide or an internet discussion; with a reasonable amount of creativity it is possible to solve all of the riddles. Hardly any of the harder puzzles is story-relevant, so there's also the option of moving on and returning later to loot that particular room of booty.\n\nAtmosphere\nI mainly played in a candlelit room on a wall flat screen wearing headphones. I was often able to locate secret passages by the sounds of monsters behind walls. I could always tell from the direction of the sound in which corridor that blasted zombie was currently looking for me. On more than one occasion I heard myself scream in surprise or even fear when suddenly I realized some monster sneaked up on me! I highly recommend playing this game with an adept surround sound system!\n\nConclusion\nIf you love hack'n'slay games, online raiding parties, bragging about your new epic item in front of your friends and skipping story and text in favor of action, this game is NOT for you!\n\nIf you are an arachnophobiac, musophobiac, herpetophobiac, necrophobiac, nyctophobiac, hylophobiac, eremophobiac, ophidiophobiac or potamophobiac, this game is DEFINITELY not for you!\n\nIf you like games emphasizing social interaction, telling a detailed, pre-cut and pre-chewed story or featuring a lot of spoken dialogue, you might consider asking yourself if you can do without any of this. If not, don't play it, you'll just be disappointed.\n\nTo anybody else: By all means, give it a try!

The downside from a graphical standpoint is that some of the outdoor locations look stupid in a grid format.\n\nThey improved upon the combat of the original. All of the enemies are more intelligent and some even attack immediately after being in range. That helps fix the "circling" battle type of the original.\n\nThe story is nothing special, just like the first game. Except this time you have more than trying to get to the bottom of a giant mountain. The story makes you play fetch, AKA retrieve a bunch of crystals from each area. This made it feel even more like the child part Ocarina of time.\n\nGenerally if you liked LoG, Zelda, or RPGs, you may like this game, but is is worth a try for most people.","April 26, 2015","true","29.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Much game. So pretty. Much wow.\n\nThe expanded content, works well. The large scope of the island. Is intimidating. But the plentiful amount of food, shifts much of the mood of barely suspended dread, into a more casual, explore and adventure game. If you didn't play the first, I'd still very much recommend it. In fact, I'd go so far, right now, after 7.5 hours, as to say that it's a better game. More coherent, and more atmospheric.\n\nI don't mind the square layout of the environment, and a few of the areas are incredibly claustrophobic, simply from atmosphere. You can still make simple mistakes that get you killed. And sometimes pushing a button in the middle of a dungeon or area, can dramatically shift the mood right back to horror.\n\nI think the best way to enjoy this game is to play something like 5-15 hours, on normal or easy, just to get a feel for the new challenges. Then, restart, and choose at least one of the "2nd Wave" like options. These options, if memory serves, affect the regeneration crystals, and quick saving. Definitely helps to shift the mood back to the lost / isolated / tragic ambiance of the first game.","May 24, 2015","true","48.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Luckily no knowledge of the predecessor is required to enjoy this game. It does help if you know the core concept though, as the game never holds your hand apart from at the very start. The semi-turnbased classic RPG elements are not for everyone, as it does require strategic thinking while in combat, especially later in the game. The game often does not show any mercy in unexpected tough situations. It challenged me and kept me immersed at all time, which I greatly enjoyed. An aspect that I personally had great fun with is the puzzles. These puzzles are hardly ever straightforward and really make you think. Look around for clues. Any secrets? What does this text mean? And when you finally find the solution, you feel like a master of puzzlesolving.\n\nThere are some things that bother me. Some monsters seem just too strong in comparison to other in the same area. It catches you off guard, making you think you can take on the area while you definitely cannot. Also I think accuracy is always quite a bothersome thing for me. My characters keep missing their attacks, making me frustrated at times of danger. This is a common mechanic in classic RPGs so I just have to get used to it I suppose. And finally, although I love the concept of tilebased movement, it did take me a while to fully grasp it and gave me some issues along the way. In the end, mostly small subjective complaints.\n\nFinally, I absolutely love the level editor. As a level designer, I greatly enjoy this feature and it definitely was one of the selling points for me.\n\nI recommend this game to all hardcore players who enjoy a beautiful and expansive classic RPG.","October 28, 2014","true","151.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ready out of the gate, working, polished product that knows its strengths and weaknesses, it manages to present an old school dungeon crawling experience made with modern standards and excel at it. For a fair price of 24 dollars you going to get a fulfilling product that provides around 30 hours of gameplay, with free dungeon editor and a bunch of well done community made maps.\n\nCompared to its predecessor Legend of Grimrock 2 is doing well to learn on past mistakes and improves itself in many areas: boss fights are now more varied and interesting, level design isn't as convoluted but still contains many secret areas, leveling and class systems provide more room for experimentation, and the whole open world twist is just a great finishing touch.\nAs with the previous title, each area contains many puzzles and secret areas, so if you're really into treasure hunting you gonna have a good time.\n\nOverall all, I give Legend of Grimrock 2 a heavy recommendation and Almost Human Games deserve some applause for doing so many things right, where others have failed.","July 31, 2015","true","36.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A fantastic sequel to the first legend of Grimrock.  Almost everything from the original returns, and almost everything has been improved upon.\n\nThe developers have spared no effort to improve upon the foundation set in the first game.  Let's start with building a party.  There is significantly more depth this time around.  This new game has 8 classes up from the original 3, 5 races up from the original 4.  But it doesn't end there.  Tool tips provide more information.  Classes no longer lock you to a set of 6 specific skills.  Rather, there are 16 total skills that you are able to choose between to customize your character how you see fit.  You want a frontline knight who also can cast a poison bolt here or there?  Done.  The number of options also leads to a large number of interesting choices.  Sure, an insectoid has great mental stats making for a natural wizard.  But they can also get superior armor, making them easily able to play the tankiest of tanks.\n\nAll these options will warm the hearts of anyone that loves to get deep into the numbers.  While I find building a party great fun, don't worry if that is not your cup of tea.  The game provides a default party that you can use, and it doesn't take a lot of work to make a barbarian that focuses in strength, damage, and more strength.\n\nAs an aside, the character portraits have gotten a major and much needed overhaul.  Your party will look much better than last time around, guaranteed.\n\n\nOnce you have a party you are dumped on an island.  Filled with common pirate tropes the designers do a good job of pulling you in, with a steady stream of monsters, loot and puzzles that all gradually increase in strength.  The monsters are a major improvement over Grimrock 1.  There is a greater variety right out of the gate.  In addition this game has added memorable boss encounters, something the first game in the series lacked.  The environments too are more varied, adding above ground areas to the strictly dungeoneering of the first game.  And the maps are much larger.\n\nThere are new options and attention to detail everywhere.  There are now day and night cycles.  You can dig for treasure.  Combat now includes firearms and dual wielding.  New kinds of puzzles.  Larger variety of weapons and improved weapon descriptions.  Tons of new loot.  You will need all of your new toys to succeed, because like the first one combat can be tough for the unprepared.\n\nTop to bottom this game is an improvement over the original.  This is a modern take on classic dungeon crawling that is very satisfying for fans of the genre.\n\n10/10","October 15, 2014","true","26.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

There are a wide variety of items available, with many interesting choices.\n- the puzzles are wonderfully satisfying and logical, and there is nothing better than that moment where you work out a puzzle you have spent ages on; even if you have those 'ohhhh why didn't  i think of that sooner' moments when you realise how logical it actually was. Some puzzles are really difficult (well at least to me), and one or two I have had to seek help on - there is no shame on occasion! :)\n\nMake sure you bear in mind that the game is grid based (in terms of how your party and enemies move around) in true old school fashion - I find this to be a positive feature, but others may not. For some reason one or two people have bought it without checking the nature of the game - all power to the grid! :)\n\nThe game is far more 'open world' than the first game, allowing for exploration a little more than you might expect. You may find yourself going back and forth the same places a few times over some distance potentially. This is not necessarily a negative depending on how you see it, but I've seen it presented as such so I thought to mention it. Regardless, while it is sometimes irritating to go back and forth it is a very minor thing - the game rewards you for exploration and patience.\n\nIf you like puzzles, RPG's and don't mind dying a fair few times as you learn (in a satisfying way) then this game is for you.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nOh, and beware the crabs!! ;P No seriously, beware! haha","November 2, 2014","true","33.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's a good effort for the money spent on making the game, but the gameworld is a bit silly/lifeless.","February 22","false","4.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","4"

You could move in four directions only, and every 'cell' was a simple box outline with white being the wall edges. I loved it.\n\nLegend of Grimrock 2 uses the same four directional movement, but in a modern crafted world. The first game was confined to a giant dungeon, but this one spreads out over multiple themed areas, and many dungeons. Enemy movement and combat has been improved also.\n\nSolving puzzles is as important to gameplay as actual battle in LoG2, and what sets it apart. It is satisfying to figure a puzzle out, and often rewarding with good gear. Almost like a Myst game with a combat side; or if you are an older gamer like me, bliss.","November 7, 2014","true","78.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It takes me back to my childhood playing Ultima Underworld on my Uncle's computer when I would visit. So many hours spent enjoying that game in my younger years, and now so many hours spent enjoying this game in my adult life.\n\nThe game is a fantastic "old-school" rpg dungeon-crawler. A spirtual successor to those Ultima games (and obviously the successor to the first LoG).\n\nI have about 50 hours played under my belt and am only on my second play through. The game is lengthy if you are interested in fully exploring the game. Searching walls for secrets, finding special gear, collecting achievements. The combat is great, and although relatively simple in some ways, some different enemy mechanics force you to switch up combat styles often.\n\nThere are several different player classes and roles to choose from, so you can format your raiding party to your desire. There are an endless amount of combinations available considering the multitude of skills, races, and talents.\n\nI have heard some negative feedback concerning the replay value of this game, though I am not personally seeing that. I have completed the game once, and have now begun my second play through with a different group composition, and although I know where many of the zones/paths/secrets are, the game feels fresh playing with a different group. I have not even begun to look at the user created content yet, though I will be getting to that.\n\nAll in all, if you are a fan of dungeon crawling RPGs, then you will not be disappointed with this game. At an incredibly fair price for the play value (as I said, 50 hours in now, and I paid ~$13 for it) this game has an large amount of RPG elements to enjoy. This is a MUST PLAY, and at the current price, don't even both waiting for a sale, just grab it now and get crawling.","October 24, 2014","true","67.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But Grimrock 1 wasn't perfect : it was short, the riddles were inconsistent sometimes, and overrall the game was too easy.\n\nGrimrock 2 is a huge step forward... an evolution so major it feels like a totally different game. The maps are huge and beautiful. The riddles and enigma are very well done and fun to solve, none is too difficult and they all make perfect sense. The monsters all have different behaviours, making them unique. The skill system is quite good, and all classes have their unique gameplay (I use a knight, a barbarian, an alchemist and a warmage).\n\nYou are free to go anywhere, don't worry if the monsters are too hard to kill at first, just return in easier areas and explore, there are many hidden spots to discover. I'm almost at the end and everytime I enter a new zone, the ambiance changes in a very successful way.\n\nA lots of love has been put in Grimrock 2, if you like Dungeon Crawlers, it's a must have!","October 23, 2014","true","31.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

It is much simpler for the player to see the effects of each skill point.\n\nDungeon crawling is satisfying with clever, if not frustrating at times, puzzles along with plenty of combat.\n\nCons: Unlike the first one, the Grimrock 2 is more non-linear. Progress at times can be hard to gauge because of all the different levels to tackle, as well as some puzzles requiring hints from multiple levels.\n\nMimics have a tendency to scare the daylights out of you.\n\n\nIn short: If you enjoyed the first one, then you will very much enjoy the second one. Some may find the non-linear nature annoying yet others will in turn love it.

Aside from some CPU-related performance issues in some of the forest areas, the game holds up exceptionally well in terms of graphics-performance. What I enjoyed most was the actual difficulty of the game on higher settings, which is quite rare these days regardless of what platform you use.\n\nBasically, if you played the first game, this game is superior in just about every way--graphics, character creation & customization, difficulty, puzzles, story, and scale of the game. Other than that, it is just plain enjoyable to people who appreciate quality RPG games--the "indie" label to me is completely misrepresentivie of the quality and production values of this game.

While combat is exploity, and it is hard to truly immerse yourself in a world of blocky movement, the design is gorgeous and exploration is fun.\n\nThe customization of characters in the beginning of the game alone showed vast improvement from the original. There are more races to choose from, and more classes than characters allowed. It causes one to really think about how they want their party to look.\n\nSkills as well were improved, giving everyone access to all skills, and reducing the original 50 levels per skill to a simple 5, with check points so you might not even need all five points there.\n\nThe puzzles themselves were challenging a lot of the time, to the point where I got frustrated and had to look up answers (I take no shame in looking them up, they were straining).

The game is filled with monsters, XP, loot, hidden secrets, and puzzles so many puzzles.  I have had a blast playing this game.  You play a party of four characters of which you choose their class and race.  As you progress through the game the overall story unfolds and you begin to discover the history of the island via notes and signs around the game.  The game is a giant dungeon crawl, that doesn't mean it's all in a dungeon, there are above and below ground sections.  You progress and get better items, level up, and defeat monsters.\n\nThe game has its fair share of monsters to slay and fight tactically, sometimes many... in a small room... with no exit... BUT where this game shines is in the many secrets and puzzles placed throughout the game.  Many of these have to be solved to progress through the game, but most simply reward an astute player with cool items and the smug feeling of satisfaction.  Some of these puzzles had me thinking for a long while, but when I finally figured it out it was all worth it.\n\nAnother thing I'm excited for is the Dungeon Editor where others can make dungeons to share with the community via Steam's Workshop.

If your key driver in an RPG game such as Skyrim is in its graphics, then you will be sorely let down by the presentation of LOG2. That's far from saying the game isn't pretty - but its more functional in appearance than blowing you away with graphical awe.\n\nWhere LOG2 scores very highly is in both character progression and feeling forever in fear of every creature that comes your way. Your original band of four ship-wrecked prisoners are woefully under-skilled and lack any form of equipment. In fact, you literally start with nothing other than a washed up branch nearby to begin with.\n\nThere are the usual race-to-class pros and cons. Amongst my group, I created a minotaur barbarian with high strength and attack. A female knight who has attained the ability as the groups' main potion maker sits alongside - protecting my much weaker reptilian rogue and my insectoid wizard at the rear. However, they all have their own unique roles to play in the group - and this is one of LOG2's big strong points. Skyrim's multi-skilled/multi-talented lead role is definitely not seen here. Your heavy hitters dish out damage and also attempt to absorb it - while the brain-boxes lie in second file and do their work from a safe distance.\n\nLOG2 is a massively cerebral game. You can stand still for minutes at a time without concern of being attacked. It rewards lateral thinkers - those that think slightly out of the box and who attempt to intelligently work through a puzzle, rather than bash and kill their way through it.\n\nSome puzzles are easy - while some are extremely tough to work out. But LOG2 provides a highly rewarding and enjoyable quest as you push on ahead. At the time of writing, I was approximately 8 hours into it - and I'll definitely be seeing this game through to the end.\n\nFor all those who want more of a thinking player's RPG - you certainly can't go wrong with this.\n\n9/10","October 26, 2014","true","16.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I put the combat in parenthesis because while it is a prominent aspect of the game throughout, it is clearly not the focus of the game, which is the puzzle solving. The puzzles themselves get harder as the game progresses. If this is your first exposure to this type of game, it's likely that you'll find it relatively difficult as the puzzles do ramp up in difficulty rather quickly. Being a sequel I imagine that the devs are expecting that the majority of their players will have played the first LoG game in which the puzzles are generally easier and ramp up slower.\n\nSo now that I've covered what the game is, let's get into some nitty gritty.\n\nThe gameplay itself builds off of the first one, taking the core of the game and maintaining what it was, while making some distinct improvements based off player feedback from the first game. Monster AI has been improved so that monsters will try to counter squared dancing tactics (these are still effective, but sometimes need to be modified a bit based on what you are fighting). Monsters will also sometimes try to lure you to where they can hit you or even just wait you out instead of charging to their certain demise when you're hiding around a corner waiting to ambush them.\n\nEach monster has it's own unique mechanics for how it moves and fights, requiring the player to learn the best ways to fight each one. Some monsters will leap behind the player, or steal your stuff right out of your hands, while others will actively dodge your attacks by jumping back a tile, etc. This is a distinct improvement from the first game where monsters were mostly the same, just moving from tile to tile to attack you as directly as they could and only flanking you by accident, now when they flank you it's on purpose. There are also several boss fights in this game unlike the first game that really only had 1 boss at the end of the game. Each of the boss fights feels like a puzzle in and of itself because of having to figure out how best to approach the fight. Not going to go into any more detail than that on them though as I don't want to give away any spoilers.\n\nThe dungeon crawling experience has been enhanced as well with the introduction of the great outdoors, with a full day and night cycle, with some things happening based on the time of day or night. The first game was entirely indoors, on top of that it was highly claustrophobic with narrow halls and low ceilings. Lo♥♥♥♥nswers that by giving you multiple tiers of vertical movement on the same level and the openness of being able to be outside and see through the space between trees. About the multiple tiers, this adds an entirely new dimension to the game because this opens up the possibility for bridges that you can go over and under, pits you can drop down into and climb back out of, and ledges you can get up onto, all without changing to another map just because you went higher or lower than 'ground level' for the map you are on.\n\nThe original races were kept along with the addition of a new race, the ratlings. They also added classes, but with characters being centered around their skills, the classes are fairly fluid, offering advantages in the skills that the class would be good at but not really penalizing you if you decided to let say a barbarian learn to be a mage, or if you wanted a wizard to be able to wear heavy armor and stand on your front line. This opens up the party options and makes it so that there really is no 'bad' party composition. While some parties might be easier to play than others, any party can be made to work. This makes random party generation an interesting optional mechanic that you can take advantage of to give the game a bit more replayability.\n\nThe skills have also been refined since LoG1 so that each point in a skill is significant, making you noticeably better with that skill each time you add a point. Plus at certain points in skill development you gain additional perks, such as dual wielding light weapons, so that when you swing one light weapon it doesn't put both on cooldown, just the one you swung.\n\nThe story itself is 'hidden' within the game. You start off knowing nothing more than that you are shipwrecked and washed up on a beach. The story itself is delivered to you with that in mind, where you find notes written by the master of the island to you as his only real way of communicating with you, and you also find notes and other things left behind by others who were here before you, leaving the mystery of what fate befell them. The game's story stands by itself, without needing you to have played the first game, but players that have played the first one may notice small links back to it hidden on the island implying a deeper connection between the island and Grimrock than one might naturally suspect. That being said, while there is a story present, it is clearly not the focus of the game, which is the dungeon crawling itself and most of your experience is motivated by simply needing to survive on the island.\n\nThe game has a lot of secrets hidden throughout, most of which are found by discovering ways to access optional areas of the game. These hidden areas often contain powerful items that will have a significant impact on the game, but at the same time, none are absolutely necessary to progress through the game, they only make it a little easier to do so. Everything you absolutely have to have to progress through the basic game and get to an ending is offered in plain sight without the need for discovering secrets. I definitely don't recommend not looking for the secrets though as they will help immensely.\n\nAnd finally, when you are done with the core game, or just want to pound your head against something different for a while, there is a dungeon editor included with the game so that players can make and publish their own content using the features included with the game and some ability to add in entirely new stuff. (I wont be going into detail on the features and capabilities of the editor in this review though as I have yet to play around with it).\n\nFinal verdict:\nA worthy successor to the first Grimrock game that kept what made it great and enhanced what needed to be enhanced. A very good example of what the old school, tile based, dungeon crawlers are, and well worth the play if you enjoy the genre. Obviously not good for you if you aren't a fan of this type of game which spent about a decade in hibernation before the first Grimrock awoke the sleeping dragon... or cube as the case may be.","October 25, 2014","true","103.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The developers clearly improved the already good predecessor with some great features. The game offers more  options to personalize your party by adding a new race (5 total) and 5 new classes  (8 total).  The  fact that the skills are available to all characters leaves room for some interesting builds.\nThe nonlinear structure of the game after the first map is really great. It is now possible to leave a difficult puzzle and explore other areas first and who knows maybe you find a hint for the hard puzzle on the way.\nThe game rewards thorough exploration and has lots of hidden secrets waitng to be found by a keen eye or a reckless leap.\nThe gameplay is challenging, but never unfair and it gives the player a great deal of satisfaction once a hard fight is won or a tricky puzzle is solved.\nIn my opinion its one of the best games released this year and its sheer size puts many modern AAA-titles to shame. One of the best ways to spend 20 bucks.

I put the combat in parenthesis because while it is a prominent aspect of the game throughout, it is clearly not the focus of the game, which is the puzzle solving. The puzzles themselves get harder as the game progresses. If this is your first exposure to this type of game, it's likely that you'll find it relatively difficult as the puzzles do ramp up in difficulty rather quickly. Being a sequel I imagine that the devs are expecting that the majority of their players will have played the first LoG game in which the puzzles are generally easier and ramp up slower.\n\nSo now that I've covered what the game is, let's get into some nitty gritty.\n\nThe gameplay itself builds off of the first one, taking the core of the game and maintaining what it was, while making some distinct improvements based off player feedback from the first game. Monster AI has been improved so that monsters will try to counter squared dancing tactics (these are still effective, but sometimes need to be modified a bit based on what you are fighting). Monsters will also sometimes try to lure you to where they can hit you or even just wait you out instead of charging to their certain demise when you're hiding around a corner waiting to ambush them.\n\nEach monster has it's own unique mechanics for how it moves and fights, requiring the player to learn the best ways to fight each one. Some monsters will leap behind the player, or steal your stuff right out of your hands, while others will actively dodge your attacks by jumping back a tile, etc. This is a distinct improvement from the first game where monsters were mostly the same, just moving from tile to tile to attack you as directly as they could and only flanking you by accident, now when they flank you it's on purpose. There are also several boss fights in this game unlike the first game that really only had 1 boss at the end of the game. Each of the boss fights feels like a puzzle in and of itself because of having to figure out how best to approach the fight. Not going to go into any more detail than that on them though as I don't want to give away any spoilers.\n\nThe dungeon crawling experience has been enhanced as well with the introduction of the great outdoors, with a full day and night cycle, with some things happening based on the time of day or night. The first game was entirely indoors, on top of that it was highly claustrophobic with narrow halls and low ceilings. Lo♥♥♥♥nswers that by giving you multiple tiers of vertical movement on the same level and the openness of being able to be outside and see through the space between trees. About the multiple tiers, this adds an entirely new dimension to the game because this opens up the possibility for bridges that you can go over and under, pits you can drop down into and climb back out of, and ledges you can get up onto, all without changing to another map just because you went higher or lower than 'ground level' for the map you are on.\n\nThe original races were kept along with the addition of a new race, the ratlings. They also added classes, but with characters being centered around their skills, the classes are fairly fluid, offering advantages in the skills that the class would be good at but not really penalizing you if you decided to let say a barbarian learn to be a mage, or if you wanted a wizard to be able to wear heavy armor and stand on your front line. This opens up the party options and makes it so that there really is no 'bad' party composition. While some parties might be easier to play than others, any party can be made to work. This makes random party generation an interesting optional mechanic that you can take advantage of to give the game a bit more replayability.\n\nThe skills have also been refined since LoG1 so that each point in a skill is significant, making you noticeably better with that skill each time you add a point. Plus at certain points in skill development you gain additional perks, such as dual wielding light weapons, so that when you swing one light weapon it doesn't put both on cooldown, just the one you swung.\n\nThe story itself is 'hidden' within the game.

Anti Aliasing not supported currently for some reason. FXAA Injector apparently works however I've not tried it. Kinda disappointed about that considering how excellent the PC options generally are. Borderless window mode supported.\n\nPuzzles are good and the atmosphere is excellent. Really reminds me of those choose your own adventure books I read as a kid. Can't comment on the story yet but the game follows LOG1 where there are no cut scenes except at the beginning and end. You can find letters and details in the world which provide lore which is great.\n\nIf you want to immerse yourself in a dungeon within a mysterious island I recommend this game.","October 16, 2014","true","25.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'll be comparing this with LoG 1 but you'll get the idea even though you haven't played the first game.\n\n1-) I loved how day and night cycle of the world. First game takes place in an underground dungeon so the player has no idea whether it's day or night time.\n2-) There are more classes and a whole new skill system. I don't know whether you'll like the new system or not but I think it's simple and elegant with 5 skill levels and milestones that provides you with additional abilities (for example; you get dual wield (yes we have dual wield option now) ability at 3rd level of light weapon skill.\n3-) In my opinion the game is way harder than the first one, but in a nice challenging way. Also the puzzles seem to be more sophisticated and somehow makes you feel like a genius when you solve them.\n\nI think these are the main differences of LoG 2. If you liked playing the first game or interested in old-school RPGs than this game is an awesome pick for you.\n\nNote: The date of this review is 16.10.2014 and the game is out for a day now. I'm saying this because there are some technical optimization problems with the current state of the game (like it has low frames at some areas) but I think this issue will be fixed with updates at a later date.

I ask myself why I keep stopping my play through every time I delete this, and the same answer comes up. Its tedious and boring. Grimrock one was a favorite of all of my games. Very classical style of gaming. In grimrock two its all about moving around attacking then repositioning. Not a big deal if you have room to work with. The problem isnt the combat.\n\nThe problem with this game that Ive found is that you NEED to use guides for a good portion of the puzzles. "But why? Shouldnt you be able to figure them out on your own? Thats the point of a Puzzle game." I would think to myself. Yes, it would be, if a good portion of these puzzles actually had tangable and relivant clues to solving them. A majority of them are reduntant. Per example: The Glyph Room. You all too often will see a stone face shooting a projectile. And all too often will see stone plates on the floor. You get no hint. Just the room name. How would you even know that you are supposed to draw out the spell on the floor that is being cast from the shooting wall-head? You wouldnt. You get no hints about it, and no relivant clue anyplace. Another example "The Silent one has a friend. Head east into the sun." Alright...which takes you directly into a tree one step later from that point once you find the Silent Statue head that says ...\n\nThat paired withthe fact most dungeons, unlike Grimrock 1, have only one way through them in addition to needing to find some obscurecrack in the wall to open a secret door make this game nearly unplayable without looking for clues and spoilers online. I didnt enjoy this half as much as Grimrock 1. It just wasnt that good. The story isnt even there if you are looking for one. You were prisoners on a ship...some magic magnet pulled your ship ashore. You begin the game. All you know is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ running the place is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that likes to leave you notes about how hes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Thats your story. Nothing else to it.\n\nCant say I recommend this game over Grimrock 1. The puzzles alone are annoying and only make sense to the creator of them, rather than the player. The maps are ♥♥♥♥, and mostly a cluster♥♥♥♥ of come back later, the games plot lacks, one way dungeons, and enemies with far too many HP even with skilled adventurers and powerful weapons. Play Necrodancer, youll be playing the same ♥♥♥♥ here just with less reward.","February 22","false","18.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

This is an RPG with almost zero "role-playing," as there is not a single character throughout the game with which your party will interact with in any way, other than to kill.  No dialogue.  No choices.  No plot.  No NPCs.  Nothing.  Just enemies and puzzles.  And those puzzles?  Almost impossible to solve.  Many have no clues at all, so you must flip levers and press buttons and step on plates and walk through teleporters randomly, hoping you get lucky and "solve" the puzzle.  Other puzzles have clues half-way across the game world that you may or may not ever find.  I'm no stranger to puzzle-solving in RPGs, but I had to look up the answer to almost all of the puzzles in this game.  Half the game involves walking sideways along walls looking for switches...like a giant "hidden object" game.  And the charcters classes?  Make sure you look up the "correct' way to build a party, because the "wrong" choices are devestating (i.e. your characters will not be able to survive later in the game).\n\nSummary:  This is not an RPG--it is a puzzle game, and the puzzles are awful.","January 14","false","52.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

It adds in the one, big element I wanted for the first game and that is the outdoor setting. You still got your dungeons and caverns, but now you can also move outside as well, in the same manner of course.\n\nThe controls are pretty much the same, but at the same time the game feels much smoother. Also the monsters seem to have a bit more AI, as they can do the good ol' square dance as well.","October 15, 2014","true","21.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The first one is not too challenging, but then again it is the first boss :3\n- Spellcasting improvements; spellcasting can be drawn out instantly or premade like in the first game, and it also shows you what you're casting before you click cast if you've used the spell once before.\n- Guns! Yeah, seriously, there's guns. Ammo for guns cannot be retrieved, but it comes in larger amounts and does more damage.\n- Some area transitions involve horizontal movement instead of vertical, staircase movement (although stairs are still present).\n- The map is connected in a large grid, making it easy to see where certain levels connect.\n\nNeutral:\n- Limbs can be damaged and unusuable until healing\n\nCons:\n- The game is harder to run, I notice a performance drop specifically when saving. Otherwise it's still very playable.\n\nI will update this list as I see more things worth noting :)\n\nMore in-depth review:\n\nBefore even being an hour into the game, I quickly realized how much further Legend of Grimrock could be taken mechanic-wise. Every single addition to the game that I've seen has not only improved, but expanded on the original core game. Mechanics like swimming, new logic, outdoor enviornments, and full buildings are only a few of the new additions that I've seen in my brief time in Nex.\n\nIf you were disappointed with the original combat system with its exploitable strafe-n-hit tactic, then I'm sure you'll be happy to know that most enemies have trained for that. I have a lot of practice with the tactic, and using it in the sequel so far has led to a lot of quick, hard hits from enemies. From quick diagonal strikes from skeletons to jump attacks from imps to evasive rolling from walking trees (treants?), you're going to get smacked before you fully move into the tile to attack.\n\nIf you enjoyed the original game, buying this should be an easy choice. It's another incredible adventure with more to come from the workshop.","October 15, 2014","true","194.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Is it perfect? Not quite. Is it great? Oh yes!!! The graphics are amazing for a game of this genre, the ambiance of each level is unique and LoG2 has the greatest looking monsters I have ever seen in a Dungeon Crawl. As much as the first Legend of Grimrock was a great game LoG2 pushes the bar even higher. (They did a really great thing by adding boss battles)\n\nBe warned, if you are a stupid person or have slow keyboard reflexes stay away from this game. The puzzles can be quite a challenge in the later game and (on normal and hard difficulties) the monsters are quite hard to beat. This is not an easy game, kind of like the Dark Souls of Dungeon Crawls.\n\nI definitely enjoyed every minute playing this game and would heartily recommend it to anyone considering trying it out.\n9/10","October 15, 2014","true","37.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's biggerer and betterer in many ways, which also makes it less novel and quaint, but so it is with sequels. There's outside locations in addition to the traditional dungeons. The forests look nice, but do not conform to the grid based movement system as well as the dungeons. You can walk underwater and drown. The skill system has been revised, which seems like a good idea. The world is more wide and vibrant compared to the first game, but the best bits are the dungeons which feel just like Grimrock 1 with the combat and puzzles.\n\nP.S. there are more character classes; one of them is Farmer.\n\nIf you liked the first game, you'll probably like Grimcock 2.","October 16, 2014","true","28.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game is delightfully hard, as in challenging, but also stupidly hard. There are a lot of blind "I lose" buttons that are going to kill playes the first time, every time. You'll also die a lot because there aren't any hotkeys nor any pause button and you have to click really fast through inventory menus. The game math is opaque, counter-intuitive and unbalanced. Did you know that wizards are worse at being wizards than the hybrid wizard/figther class? Did you know that weapon damage becomes irrelevant to how much damage you deal in the second half of the game? Did you know that firearms are useless? Etc. Etc.

Potion making was awesome though.\n\nExploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).\n\nSpells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.\n\nCharacters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.\n\nMonsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.\n\nNear the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.\n\nPuzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.\n\nUnderwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.\n\nNot a whole lot of enemy variation.\n\nI felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.\n\nNo voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).\n\nI know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.\n\nArmor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.\n\n\nPros\n\nI like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.\n\nweapon special attacks were pretty good.\n\ngraphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)\n\nLevel design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.\n\nMost puzzles were fun to solve.\n\nMap in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.\n\nThe armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.\n\nEach enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)\n\nSound effects were done very well.\n\nPotions made are very useful.\n\nFor the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.\n\nGood unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.\n\nWhile I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account).

They also have some very nice extensions of the dungoen-crawling theme, and I have seen it all, starting with the original Dungeon Master. Do not expect it to be easy though. It is hard, sometimes very hard, but never (20h in) unfair. True, sometimes enemies will kill you and until you figure something out, you cannot actually figth them. Also, some (very few) puzzles are more obscure than I like, but for that there is the Internet.\n\nGraphics are beatiful, music supports the atmosphere. Day/night is done very well. Riddles often leave you with a sense of accomplishment, as many you will not solve on the first try.\n\nOne warning: For a first run, better have 4 different classes. Itemization is pretty good, but for many classes not sufficient to equip more than one char.\n\nAnd a hint: You find all the portraits from Grimrock 1 among the files.

This sequel manages to cross its own style with a Myst-like experience, where you end up on an island and have to figure everything out. The freedom of movement within the island is quite enjoyable : will you keep trying this dungeon with tough enemies but greater rewards or will you come back to it once you've leveled up a bit ?\nThe leveling, fighting and magic systems are okay but show their limits around the two thirds of the game. Once you've discovered most of the good stuff and figured out most spells, the game becomes really repetitive. The fact that the fights tend to pile up in the end made me wish the game was shorter, just so I'd be done with it. Apart from this end game tediousness, the clever riddles and the rich exploration are enough to justify playing it.","October 26, 2014","true","44.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShaneMoffatt/recommended/251730/","ShaneMoffatt","Shane Moffatt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShaneMoffatt/","876 products in account","I am going to start this review of by saying one simple sentence before i get into the Nitty Gritty of why you should buy this game!\n"This game is my personal GOTY for 2014 and every minute is a imerrsive blast of fun that i don't want to stop"\n\nNow onto the review!\n\nFirstly I will talk about the points i think make this game EXTREMELY good.\n- Gameplay\n- Immersion\n- Visuals\n- Sounds\n- Unique-ness\n\nThis game in it's gameplay does something that other games simply cannot capture, from the open worlds of skyrim all the way to one of my personal favourite RPG's (Fallout). What it does is something i don't FEEL in games anymore, it captures feelsing i didn't think a game could make and then encourages me to play the game with the freedom of my own mind.\nWhat i mean by this is the game immerses you completely in it's world, It never feels like you are playing a game but you are a crew of prisoners, fighting your way through a beautiful and luxurious island. Every atmosphere feels unique to the game and immerses you in the adventure, you REALLY FEEL like you are on an adventure, not PLAYING an adventure in a GAME. Like i said, i've loved and played many RPG's buy this is one of the few games that have captures a pure, undying sense of ADVENTURE from within me.\nThe gameplay is also something i love, the world feels seamless and connected which helps to support and ecourage you to explore and look for secrets. It's like small open-worlds, this way you can explore a lot and look for every secret - without overbearing amounts of land to cover. It's a game where doing puzzles, finding secrets feels extremely rewarding each time.\nThe combat in this game is what i believe to hit-or-miss, either you will enjoy it or... You will not. It's using an older generation of RPG as inspiration, Q and E to turn, then WASD to move around on a grid. Combat is real time, with a turn based aspect. Meaning you and the enemy attack eachother based on spell and weapon cooldowns. I believe the charm of the game (being the older style RPG) is either hit-or-miss, i myself love it though and it adds a unique charm that no other games capture!\nMy next point is the class and race system, it's executed so well i needn't say much other than you get a good amount of race and classes to build a squad that suits you, everythign plays completely differently than other classes. Later skill building further increases variation to a point where you can do what you want, and play how you want (and if you understand the farmer class, i assume you are a god at this game.)\nLastly the sound and visuals, they both work well together with the immersion to create a world that looks realistic enough to tottaly engross you, but still fantasy enough to really give off that old RPG feel. The games graphics are not taxing (but then my computer can handle anything) but still manage to blow me away even more than most recent releases ( *cough* Shadows of mordor *cough* )\n\nOverall this game is absolutely a brilliant game, developing it's strengths from the first game and making something near perfect. I have little to no weak points about this game so far and even if i did, i wouldn't bother putting them here simply because they would be as miniscule as; Only skill points and not stat points, or i am bad at puzzles and my brain hurts.\nBasically you want this game, it's superb, it's fun, it's beautiful and it does one thing i deem most important.\nIt's unique.","October 16, 2014","true","19.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The first LoG is fantastic. The big difference between the two is that while in LoG you almost always could progress to the next level, and the really crazy puzzles were for secret stuff; in LoGII the crazy puzzles are in the way all the time. Progressing in this game required me looking up in the internet all the time. I never once had to look anything up on LoG to finish it. To find all the secrets yeah, but I didn't *have to*.  Additionally LoGII gives the impression that you could complete the 'open world' levels in any order but this isn't entirely true. Some have to be completed in order becasue the solution to puzzles are at the end of one section. However, to know this you have to look it up on the internet. I recoomend LoG the first one, but this one, is just a very very crappy sequel. All the effort seems to have gone to making the graphics look good (which my mac can barely handle at the lowest settings), while gameplay didn't improve. If you play it don't use firearms (they're weak) don't use your golden keys willy nilly and get the snake charmer's rope to go down holes.","November 15, 2015","false","54.1"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

The combat is real-time but movement is still grid-locked and the perspective still first-person, so you will be wasting precious seconds spinning in place to get turned the right way while your enemies get free hits in; ruining any sense of "action" or "realism" that real-time combat should normally create.\n\nIt's the spell interface that really ruins the experience, though.  Picking out the correct order of nondescript runes that cast a spell might be (at best) a cute mechanic in a better game than this one, but when you're forced to do it in the middle of (already kludgey) real-time combat for every spell you will ever cast, it feels much more like you're fighting the game than the actual monsters.\n\nIt's a horrible mix of combat elements on par with the likes of Final Fantasy XIII.

Ive played what maybe 4 hours or so and ive found it exciting, fun and etc etc. Its a good game and makes you go, "oh god is that a skeleton knight? yeah yeah it is" as it lies in a heap of bones and dust before you and you feel great. But then you come across Some areas like the bog, now if you play it you know what i mean the two most annoying enemies that just reproduce constantly and just like making you there play thing like to wander like theres no tommorow, the frogs and mosquittos but ill get to that later.\n\nNow after being lost for about an hour i was studying my map (DO NOT TURN ON THE OLD SCHOOL MAPPING YOU WILL QUIT AFTE AN HOUR) i finally found where to go and this non linear world i thought i was in just shrunk to a stone corridor with a big red arrow telling you where to go. After discovering that dissapointment i entered the Swamps Duengeon (Hogs Burrow or something)  i got destroyed by the boss in there by all the poision but i was able to bust out with my solo knight and was limping to the nearest blue crystal as if i had to actually carry my three dead compainions until i ran into one of the most janky ♥♥♥ annoying enemies the mossquitto swarm.\n\nBoom i thought i was done i hadn't saved for an hour and i was going to die but i was so close i could taste that blue crystal that i insert into my compainions bodies, because its never explained how it actually works, so i tried to juke and jive this tukley through the repeating portals and thought i can do this. I can do THIS.\n\nThen i ran into the most annoying thing in the game, (no not the frog) the CONTROLS for the party which are so laggy and out of timed that turned me round ran me round and into a dead end then i knew it was over, Mosquittos can only be  killed by mages even thought there the size of rabbits with wings my knight can't do ♥♥♥♥ to them and just let them swarm him like there the actul size of mosquittos. I was very sad and angry as the last thing i saw was a mosquitto coming for all the blood in my single knights body with "YOU ARE DEAD" slowly fade in. Then i wrote this review with no biased opion.\n\nI this game is great, it is slow to start and you can get super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ very fast but when you slay a whole room full of mummies, you just feel like you've actually acheieved something, hopefully after a couple of hours have passed i will be ready to hop straight back in and hopefully will you when you, play it.\n\n8/8","October 17, 2014","true","6.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The enemies are kind-of underwhelming, just standing in front of you and hitting you -- unless you ran into enemies that are far too high-level for you, which can easily happen. There are some pretty annoying puzzles (invisible switches, items that are hidden without the game giving any indication of where you have to look, be-fast-and-move-to-the-correct-spot-or-you-die challenges, and puzzles whjch basically require you to die multiple times before you can actually get a glimpse of what you need to do to solve them). The character upgrades are too rare, and it is too easy to make a mistake in constructing your characters (I made an alchemist who uses firearms, but now I find that firearms and ammo for them are very hard to come by, while I have found fantastic bows with reusable arrows that I cannot use). Fortunately, enemies that are defeated do not return, so that's a plus. But overall, I find the fun factor not so high that I am keen to continue.\n\nWhat REALLY hurts the game is the complete lack of any story. Why are you doing the things that you do? Why do you walk around here? Why not just stay on the beach, build a big fire, and kill turtles for dinner until you are rescued? I don't feel that "exploring for the sake of exploring" is very rewarding. Ultimately, the whole story seems to come down to something like: walk around until you have collected 20 power gems, and then you can unlock the final door. Hooray!\n\nI played the first Grimrock for a while, and that game feels much better. There is an actual incentive for you to delve into the dungeon, and the atmosphere is suffocatingly claustrophobic. While in Grimrock II you are just walking through woods without rhyme or reason. The atmosphere of this game is just off.\n\nAll in all, I am on the fence as far as Grimrock II is concerned. It is not that it is a bad game, it is just not as good as the first one, and I rather play something else than more Grimrock II. So I have to rate it down, partly in compensation for all the up-ratings.","March 29, 2015","false","7.7"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

There could've been something to take attention from that and put it towards the combat itself. Its difficult to tell how to level characters because there's little to explain what to do and your given so few skillpoints you don't get to spread them around much and experience, and even spells are so few in number and spread out across several skills that you don't really get to have fun with them.

The Island of Broken Bones and Death TrapsGenre: 1st Person Old-School Tile-based RPG Focused on Combat with Puzzles.\nDeveloped and Published by: Almost Human Games\nPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and Linux\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\n\nPreamble\nLegend of Grimrock 1 jumped into the indie gaming scene in 2012. It was bringing old school dungeon crawling gameplay to the next generation with better graphics and ideas learned in modern times. It was a success and one of my favorite games of 2012. Fast forward three years later and I finally get the chance to play Legend of Grimrock 2. Its the expanded sequel that brought a new open world experience as well as new monsters, puzzles and challenges to face.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nEschewing its previously more directed experience in a dungeon, Legend of Grimrock 2 takes place on a very large island. The real-time first person tile-based RPG is back with a few new tricks. You now have eight character classes to choose from including magical warriors, alchemists and farmers. There’s a few new races and faces with new skill trees that you’re given far too few skill points to spend into. All of which takes place on an island named….Nex apparently. Your mission is...to...I guess survive on the island and figure out its mysteries. It's not hard to feel like the sequel was where the developers included anything and everything they could just to do it. I put in five hours before I called it a day, fair warning.\n\nStory and Atmosphere Thoughts\nThe game starts out with an animated CGI cutscene that depicts your group of prisoners getting shipwrecked on an island. An opening scene that is a little jarring (and an unnecessary expense) change from LoG1’s opening scene with still images. Somehow, that cutscene conveyed even less story about why your group of survivors here and what their purpose is. It’s the first sign that the story just isn’t as good this time around. All you really get is the island’s “owner” taunting you with written notes and giant stone face statues giving you cryptic clues and hints about the island as well as what you should do to move on. Neither of which really does it for me this time. Granted, LoG1’s story was pretty light as well but there was something to it that made me want to see what was going on. Here? There’s no reason for me to explore, outside of just doing it for completion sake.\n\nIt doesn't help that the atmosphere of LoG1 is gone. It’s no longer an old dungeon that has seen far too many people die in it. The soft howling wind, the scratching of enemy’s claws nearby, the sense that danger could be right around the corner, its just not here. Instead, it’s an island of themed areas. You’ve got the graveyard here, the beach there, a giant pyramid over there and a forest behind you, among other areas. When you've got the ocean waters acting as a barrier instead of a solid wall, it breaks the immersion. It's little things like this that hurt the game's experience.\n\nCombat Ponderings\nI said in my previous review of Legend of Grimrock 1 that the combat was balanced on a razor’s edge. If it strayed just a little from that balance, it would cease to be enjoyable. Well, the combat in LoG2 strays. I found myself in combat situations far too many times and against way too many opponents in cramped rooms. Where I would then be easily surrounded and slowly beaten to death in a war of attrition. The only changes to the combat system on your end is improvements to the magic casting system. Which, sure, the magic system is nicer to use. However, the combat system is still largely the same system as before. Circle around enemies, spam your weapons/abilities off cooldown as often as possible and hope the enemies die before your group gets done in. Oh and if you lose anyone, well, you’re going to be done in quickly.\n\nEnemies have new AIs (though I noticed that they would often get stuck with indecision) with new moves to avoid the typical strategy of the previous game. Which I would be ok with this change because it would force new strategies to be developed. But then I get quickly surrounded by enemies and killed off because I got stuck in yet another corner with three or more enemies trying to gnaw my face off. I signed up for a game about surviving with my wits and getting through tricky puzzles. I didn’t sign up for a combat spree-a-thon where I slaughter hundreds of enemies in long battles of attrition.\n\nDying in Death Traps\nThere are games that pull off death traps well, as part of the experience. You have to be careful how many times you use them, especially if you’re wanting to advance the plot along. I find the most effective ones are death traps used to teach players to be more careful and wary of their surroundings. But LoG2 doesn’t give you the clues to tell you that what you’re about to do is a bad idea. I died at least seven to ten times in five hours from pointless death traps. It’s a ton of trial-and-error gameplay that I got sick of in a real hurry.\n\nPC Settings Menu & Optimization Problems\nAll of the settings from LoG1 return and with a few new addition. Windowed, Borderless,  Fullscreen and a good selection of resolution options. V-Sync for which you’ll probably want triple buffering because the screen tearing is hideous otherwise. There’s a new Render Quality slider which substantially changes how good everything looks. Texture resolution, texture filtering, shadow quality and SSAO quality sliders with high/medium/low options. Field of view slider isn’t available but the standard field of view should be fine. Music and sound effect sliders are here with individual mute buttons. Settings wise, it has everything you’ll need.\n\nLegend of Grimrock 2 is horribly optimized. Even on the lowest graphical settings, my framerate would tank to 45 FPS just standing around in a forest/desert/beach with no visible enemies nearby. Get some fighting going and it tanks further. It isn’t consistent what will bring the framerate down. Its not even that great a looker. Sure, the underground levels, the creatures and animations look fine. But the outdoor levels? With the trees and plant life? They seem...merely adequate. It’s frustrating though as the game will lag at random times, making travel not nearly as smooth as it should be.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nLegend of Grimrock 1 was a title where less was more. Legend of Grimrock 2 seems to think that more is more. I don't agree. The atmosphere is gone, replaced with themed areas and more frustrating combat. Puzzles just aren’t as satisfying to solve this time around. And exploration? Exploration is hampered by the knowledge that you have to slog through respawning monsters and pointless death traps. LoG2 is a sequel that tries to be bigger and better than what it was, but loses what made the original fun for me in the first place. While I will give some kudos for the magic system improvements, the new classes that add a little bit of flavor to the gameplay and the new monsters with their different attacks, it's not enough for me. As a whole, it isn't the fun I wanted and I'm really disappointed by that.\n\nRead the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\nA Paladin’s Review: Legend of Grimrock: Fun Old School Dungeon Crawling With A Creepy Atmosphere","June 20, 2015","false","5.1"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","0"

I used to love Might and Magic but I don't like this. I used to love RTS like Warcraft and Age of Empires, but I don't like them anymore either. Hell, I think I used to like Grim Fandango, but when I replayed it, it was very poorly designed actual game around a quirky and interesting story.\n\nI think I want my RPGs to be far more Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition, Skyrim, Mass Effect, and Shadowrun. Not this. This was slow, boring, and tedious. I know others disagree, but such is an opinion. I'm avoiding games I thought I would like such as Legend of Grimrock and Pillars of Eternity.","June 14, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

It had a certain amount of combat in it, but it was kept to a minimum, and generally you were rarely outnumbered. You could take your time with the combat.\n\nLegend of Grimrock 2 seems to have forgotten it's puzzle roots and provide puzzles that are far too easy to solve even for someone who is generally not that into puzzle games, and adds a HEAPLOAD of combat to the game, and also against far more dangerous enemies. Enemies are also much more numerous in this game compared to its predecessor, leading to you being surrounded and slaughtered sometimes in seconds, leading to multiple frustrating reloads in order to handle random battles that you had no chance preparing for.\n\nIn fact, the random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t battles is what, in the end, caused me to give up and say good bye to Grimrock 2. I wanted a puzzle game, and was given a dungeon crawler with a subpar combat system instead. After I had finished Crystal Mines and ended up outside with 10+ rat patrols and the rat boss (which I'd already beaten) AGAIN I just had enough. There are so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments where enemies will spawn out of nowhere or just give you the middle finger saying "Oh, you solved that puzzle did you? Here, have a near impossible battle!"\n\nIt's just the fact that you have no chance to prepare for these that make it overly annoying and leading to multiple deaths and reloads just to try and get that one "perfect" battle that you actually survive.\n\nI was NOT looking for a combat game. I do not recommend Grimrock, in spite of it's graphics, atmosphere and puzzles. It's not worth it.","May 18, 2015","false","21.7"," 9 of 28 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","9","28","0","0"

The artwork is gorgeous, and the combat simple fairly simply to use.  The level-up system has a lot of nice variation without confining you too much.\nWhat I don't like:\n1.  You can only move in one of four directions: N, E, S and W.  Man y of the games challenges, in fact, rely on that rigid tie to a square grid, but after playing games like Elder Scrolls and Fallout 3, I find it disconcerting.\n2.  Some of the challenges require speed and reflexes that are simply beyond me, and  may be beyond many players.\n3.  While there's some freedom in where you go, overall the game is pretty linear, with advancing often requiring having found just the right item somewhere else.\n4.  The greatest sin-- too many of the challenges are "zap you're dead" challenges.  In some cases, the only way to get their measure is to be instantly killed by them.  This may require avoidance henceforth.  In many other cases, the only way to solve them is by advancing until you're killed, but at least see enough of the details to do something else when you restart the game.  Sort of like the Tom  Cruise movie, "Edge of Tomorrow"-- Live, Die, Repeat.  Ideally, a good puzle or challennge should be solvable by a lot of observing and thinking in advance-- i.e., without getting killed to get the necessary information.  This game has too many that are the opposite....","February 15, 2015","false","8.5"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","1"

OK.  I'll give examples as to why i'm ot really that excited about it but sorta like it because I love that genre of game.   i enjoy older games but this isn't old really, only released a year ago, and it's pretty UN-intuitive as far as using things, fighting, etc.  Nothing really wrong, but to me it's more of a job to play than something I  can immerse myself in.  It might have been better starting out if there was a bit of a tutorial.. a real tutorial rather than a hint here and there. Not everyone played the first one :) For example, here are some situations going through this game the first time with all the mental questions I might have had.  Starting out right off the bat you are in a cage and it says "Hint: right click on the combat panels" or something like that. well hell all I saw were characters, hands, and nothign else. so I finally looked it up and right clicked on the guy with the glowing hands, well, said it couldn't reach it.  well nothing told me the ones on the bottom were behind and the ones on the top were in front.  I finally by accident used the first one wit hteh stick and broke out. also nothing tells you that you can drag the characters around to change their positions.  You can't rely on players to know how to do things from the first game. you can't rely on players to figure out things like moving characters around to change position.  NOTHING tells you what food really does for you.. other than seeing a bar go up if you do eat... sure doesn't help the health any... will it eventually?  what happens if you throw this rock and it flies off? what if someone dies, how do I rez them?\n\nyou don't find the answers to these questions.. at least immediately .. if at all, unless you accidentally stumble on something. This game could be old time wonderful if the devs just took a bit more time educating the players.  It's obvious they just wanted to get this thing out the door or assumed way too much by not testing t his game with virgin beta and alpha testers.  If they had this would have been something taken care of.\n\nIf you played the previous game and like it , I advise getting it.. if you didn't, then buy it with the knowledge you are going to suffer in your experience till you get it all figured out or ruin your experince by looking up a walk though.. at that point if you are doing that, what's the point in spending the money!?","March 20, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","1","11","0","0"

So if a tough enemy breaks your arms (meaning you cant use your weapons) you have to back off and pray that you can use a healing potion to undo the damage only for the monster to break your arms again. Would be fine for hardmode, but I was on easyfor my first run. That apparently donesn't mean much.\n\nEnvironment: Ok, i have to throw my hands up here the game looks pretty nice. I had to kill the graphics to make it run properly though, as my computer its up to par but thats on me.\n\nStory: It sucks. Four dudes trapped on an island for seemingly no reason. I'm sure it gets better than that but I didn't play far enough to find out. Frankly, I don't care anyway.\n\nPuzzles: "X marks the spot." That is the dumbest hint I have ever seen. This was the first major puzzle of the game and I had to look this one up. I thought that meant I had to find an x. Nope. This was one of thos epuzzles that not only made me feel like an idiot, but it's solution was kinda stupid.\n\nOverall, this sort of game just doesn't appeal to me. I can see why some people might like it, but i can't recommend this game in all good honesty.","January 14, 2015","false","2.4"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","23","0","5"

I've spent about a quarter of time in game just retracing steps scanning walls; not my idea of fun.  Finding a hidden button/lever can mean the difference between progressing through content and being stuck at a standstill.  This could have been remedied by allowing the party to comment on hidden features similar to Might and Magic X.\n\nCombat was rather clunky, especially playing a wizard.  I found missle weapons to be lackluster, and ranged combat in general was a hassle with projectile collection.  You can effectively kite mobs using melee attacks as long as you are quick enough to move to another tile before giving the mob time to attack.  Additionally, there is no way to track mob health; there are no hit point bars or visual cues.  There is no feedback regarding if a mob is resistant to certain forms of attacks; sometimes skills do 1 damage and then the same skill will do 20 damage (is it because of weak attacks or damage resistance?)\n\nThe only methods of healing are via potions and resting.  I made the assumption that one of the schools of magic would contain healing, but that was not the case.  No class healing really detracts from combat.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be any form of skill reset.  Given that you start the game clueless regarding the skills, items, and spells available, it would be great to have this available in some form.\n\nHaving played MIght and Magic X, I feel this is an inferior clone.  It does have some nice perks, such as unique weapon skills and interesting puzzles.  Sadly, the game is bogged down by unnecessary tedious tasks and clunky combat/skills.","October 19, 2014","false","12.4"," 60 of 203 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","60","203","0","2"

Apparently there's no roleplaying except for equipping the four characters you command to deal with various baddies - it's just a long dungeon crawl. Now, for 20 bucks this wouldn't be a bad thing except for your movement, which is one square at a time controlled by your kb. Moving the mouse only changes your POV. If you don't have extremely nimble fingers this game is an effort in futility, especially during boss fights since movement is so restricted. It can also be hard on the normal difficulty. Your characters recharge and level up slowly, there's not much armor to speak of so I always felt at a disadvantage.

The trailer on the publisher's website is deceptive and misleading as to the game play style. Additionally, it is touted as a "game with an old-school heart but a modern execution". Other than the graphics, there is very little "modern" about this game.\n\nThis is within the broad ~35 year genre of a "crawler". Much like the word "transportation" (or vehicle) includes many modes of travel, but if Porsche came out with their newest "chariot" lineup, I wouldn't expect for it to be horse drawn. This cart is drawn by a mule.\n\nObviously, my juxtaposition of "Dungeon Crawler" versus "Dungeon Stutterer" was lost on some of prior thread flamers ... this is a "spastic dungeon stutterer" and not a "dungeon crawler" as the term has evolved.\n\nIt plays more like Adventure on the Atari 2600 ... which was a great game at the time, but I am glad gaming has evolved since then. This one has in theory, but not execution.\n\nI was tremendously disappointed.  And yes. I should have known better than to judge the book by its ads, cover. out of context reviews, and video. I should have watched it on twitch or youtube. I didn't... and wasted my money.\n\nIf you like it, great. Just be warned BEFORE YOU BUY that it has very limited movement, and you might do better with some dice and a scrap of cardboard, burn a stick and write your journey on a cave wall. Seriously, watch it before you buy (and not the developer's deceptive video).\n\n1.5 out of 5\n\nNamaste.","November 3, 2014","false","0.3"," 13 of 199 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","13","199","0","19"

Now the whole setting is a singular map (as opposed to seperate levels), and you can travel back to old areas via a "hub" system. Also new are some very unique enemies, boss fights, outdoor settings, and creepy sequences where the island's antagonist pops up unexpectedly. In addition, there are now firearms, which prove to be an interesting skill to level.\n\nYou can expect a foreboding and mysterious setting with many puzzles that require you to think outside the box at times. Enemies will cause you to jump in your seat when they pop up behind you, or quickly enter a room once you've solved a puzzle. They are legitimately difficult and you will have to choose your fights carefully until you get some of the better weapons in the game.\n\nIf you're new to the game, or get frustrated easily, I'd recommend doing your first play through in easy mode, it prevents the enemies from being too overwhelming and allows you to concentrate on puzzles and exploration.\n\nYou may be temped to run to the internet for help on the puzzles, however you should know that the greatest fulfillment, which goes hand-in-hand with the enjoyment of the game, comes from solving the puzzles yourself. Those "a-ha moments" are what makes Grimrock 2 stand out among its peers.\n\nMinor quibbles include a couple of puzzles which were overly cryptic, and if you are patient, being able to swivel around difficult enemies continually without taking damage due to the tile-based system. In Grimrock 3, I'd like to see enemies that can walk to the next tile and attack you from their side, that would definitely require additional strategy.\n\nOverall, easily one of my favorite games of all time, easily in my top 5, and I've been playing for quite some time.

The game truly doesn't hold your hand.\nHints are plentiful and usually both easy to find and understand.\nLevel editor and custom dungeon support.\nGame length is around 20 hours on a first playthrough depending on how hard you search for secrets.\nPlenty of secrets and treasures for you to find and toy with.\nMany different possible playstyles and party composition.\nSeveral bonus difficulty modifiers. Also, normal doesn't feel like easy.Cons:\n1v1 combat can be extremely easy once you learn the controls and monster ai.\nA flying enemy appears that is invulnerable to most types of damage far before most players have the ability to deal with it.\nRan into a progress halting bug where a key didn't spawn. Upon reload, the key spawned. This could be a serious issue if a player is using some of the difficulty modifiers.\nGame design promotes certain party compositions and leaves some playstyles almost worthless.\nWith the amount of available skills, it is disheartening seeing that you can only utilize a few per character due to the low amount of skill points received throughout.\nSpecializing is key to effective party members from the start and there is no way to understand this without playing for several hours.\nIf you are experienced or plan ahead, late game bosses and enemies become a bit easy as damage scaling coupled with potion usage makes for insanely strong builds.\nOverall, I found this game phenomenal. It steadily increases the challenge both through new variety in monsters and puzzles throughout a lengthy game in a natural way. The music is astounding and boss fights are intense. There are very few cheap traps and most puzzles can be solved quickly if you find and comprehend the hints provided. Secret doors are usually (almost always) audible from the location of the object that opens them so if you pay attention you can find them. If you get stuck, you can go to a different area for most of the game and come back later thanks to the free roam design. Enemies respawn (and get more difficult as your level increases) but it takes a considerable amount of time to the point where I've never seen them respawn in the current dungeon (note that I rarely slept throughout the game though). Progression is consistent and if you get stumped, walkthroughs will make you facepalm because the solution is usually right in front of your face. If you are looking for a challenging, enjoyable, long (compared to modern games), cheap (again compared to modern games), and gratifying game, Legend of Grimrock 2 could be the game for you.","January 2, 2015","true","51.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each time a charactor levels up you only have 1 skill point to use.  There are not many different skills so that you need to agonize over for 10 minutes on every level up, but enough so that specialization and planning ahead is important.","January 2, 2015","true","37.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Legend of Grimrock 2 features many of the familiar mechanics seen in the first game, yet it improves upon the AI significantly, where they are less rigid in movement and are able to avoid your strikes or even counter-attack you as you move to their side, seemingly learning from your actions (a tactic commonly used in the first, where you strafe to their side and attack before strafing away). It features the grid-based movement and introduces new weapons, weapon attacks (special attacks) and a new race to boot. The puzzles are more interesting this time around and arguably the difficulty has been upped. Boss battles are exciting and there are many hidden areas for you to find, with each hidden area becoming more and more difficult to discover as its clues become more subtle. The maps have also been increased in size, where multiple paths can be taken for you to try out different puzzles, leaving you with the option to come back later if you wish. The visuals have also been improved and are quite impressive. A definite must-buy if you are a fan of the first game.","October 19, 2014","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game truly doesn't hold your hand.\nHints are plentiful and usually both easy to find and understand.\nLevel editor and custom dungeon support.\nGame length is around 20 hours on a first playthrough depending on how hard you search for secrets.\nPlenty of secrets and treasures for you to find and toy with.\nMany different possible playstyles and party composition.\nSeveral bonus difficulty modifiers. Also, normal doesn't feel like easy.Cons:\n1v1 combat can be extremely easy once you learn the controls and monster ai.\nA flying enemy appears that is invulnerable to most types of damage far before most players have the ability to deal with it.\nRan into a progress halting bug where a key didn't spawn. Upon reload, the key spawned. This could be a serious issue if a player is using some of the difficulty modifiers.\nGame design promotes certain party compositions and leaves some playstyles almost worthless.\nWith the amount of available skills, it is disheartening seeing that you can only utilize a few per character due to the low amount of skill points received throughout.\nSpecializing is key to effective party members from the start and there is no way to understand this without playing for several hours.\nIf you are experienced or plan ahead, late game bosses and enemies become a bit easy as damage scaling coupled with potion usage makes for insanely strong builds.\nOverall, I found this game phenomenal. It steadily increases the challenge both through new variety in monsters and puzzles throughout a lengthy game in a natural way. The music is astounding and boss fights are intense. There are very few cheap traps and most puzzles can be solved quickly if you find and comprehend the hints provided. Secret doors are usually (almost always) audible from the location of the object that opens them so if you pay attention you can find them. If you get stuck, you can go to a different area for most of the game and come back later thanks to the free roam design. Enemies respawn (and get more difficult as your level increases) but it takes a considerable amount of time to the point where I've never seen them respawn in the current dungeon (note that I rarely slept throughout the game though). Progression is consistent and if you get stumped, walkthroughs will make you facepalm because the solution is usually right in front of your face. If you are looking for a challenging, enjoyable, long (compared to modern games), cheap (again compared to modern games), and gratifying game, Legend of Grimrock 2 could be the game for you.","January 2, 2015","true","51.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought the first game was great but had many problems that left the game needing more. The main thing I love is how open the world is and how you can play the game in essentially whatever order you want, unlike the first game which was far more linear. The goal overall is to gain access to the final area, but in what order of areas to go to before that is pretty much up to you. This allowed me to work on another section or puzzle when I get stuck rather than just quitting or caving in to internet help. Speaking of internet help, you may need it. The game is very challenging and if you don't save often, you may find yourself raging...a lot. No deathes feel too cheap as eventually you'll learn to recognize everything as a potential trap, but be warned that it can be unforgiving at times. If you enjoyed the first game, then you'll enjoy it's sequal. If you didn't like the first game, this entry may have fixed what you disliked, but likely didn't. And if you haven't played the first game, I would recommend playing the sequal first and going back to the first game later on, if at all.

The main difference in the game is that instead of the sequential level design of the first game, LGR 2 has a more horizontal layout that allows more organic exploration then simple sequential levels. This does not confine the secrets (the many, many mind bending secrets) to simply the designated "dungeon" sections of the island either, in addition to simple little caches and puzzles on the island surface, you can find riddles and clues that can lead you to buried treasure chests, which was a great touch and encouraged backtracking (which was not much of a pain, the island has a small hub that links the major wings together). One flaw would be the diving mechanic, some tiles are covered in water and your party cannot stay in them for long without drowning, coupled with the fact there can be underwater enemies and your attack is disabled when underwater, you can get pinned into a corner and be unable to get out, resulting in you needing to load a previous save.\n\nThe combat has been polished greatly from the first, rather then gaining perks that would allow for a random chance of a special attack, the weapons themselves have special attacks noted in their discription that can be activated by holding the attack button (at the cost of some energy/mana). All the spells from LGR 1 make their return, as well as some more interesting ones, but I do believe that more spells should have been implimented. However, the requirments to cast the spells have been reduced as a result of a simpler leveling system, so your mage is no longer a "one trick pony".\n\nThe leveling system was revamped from the original, all skills now only have 5 levels instead of 50, and you gain one point to spend per level. One thing of note is that your stats now level automatically (but can be enhanced by drinking special potions) depending on your class, which can be a bad thing if you really want full control over your characters' growth, but not everyone does so its more of a neutral point. The skills also have milestone perks and per level upgrades, similar to the original. Overall the leveling system was streamlined rather then completely changed.\n\nOne mechanic that was greatly expanded was the alchemy system, which acts as the party's healing. There are more ingredients, more potions and the potion interface is similar to the spell casting interface so it can be used in combat with ease (something the first game needed badly). Your alchemist can also make bombs which act as one time spells with additional effects (freezing the enemy, setting the ground alight, etc). The greatest alchemist can even cheat death, if you find the correct recipe that is.\n\nOverall, there are more items, more enemies, more ground to cover, more dungeons to dive into and more secrets to uncover. I would give the game a 9/10, it would be a perfect 10 if not for the annoying water sections and the lack of very many new spells. A great game, if you liked the first one, get this one, if you never played the first one, consider getting this one, the stories are independent and the second one is a bit stronger gameplay wise.","October 18, 2014","true","61.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had long felt a bit disappointed that these types of games were no longer being made as we moved into the modern age of gaming. I had actually been made aware of this game before the first Grimrock, though I have since purchased the first LoG after finishing this one.\n\nThe movement might feel restrictive to people who are not accustomed to the genre, however this game is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had playing a video game in years. The story is a bit barren and vague, however the gameplay itself is what makes this game great.\n\nThe combat is difficult enough to keep you on your toes until end-game, and the puzzles are challenging enough to keep you engaged, requiring discipline and a sharp mind to figure out, however not so vague that your average gamer won't be able to get through the game if they really tried.\n\nIf you are new to the dungeon crawler genre, then there is no time like the present! Just don't give up, and don't use any walkthroughs or online help. If you are into a more diablo-like or Skyrim-like experience, you might be a bit frustrated by this game. This isn't exactly a general audience-oriented game. It is certainly pointed at an older generation of gamers, however effectively modernized. It's challenging, it's beautiful, it's about time for these types of games to make a comeback.\n\n","February 9, 2015","true","46.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chowza/recommended/251730/","chowza","ChoWZa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chowza/","105 products in account","If you want a way to beat the game on hard with out too much stress. It seems that they built the farmer into the game for this purpose because there is so much synergy to this strategy. I went with a Lizard Knight, Lizard Rogue, Lizard Alchemist. Human Farmer with skilled tech and fast learner. I put the 1 point into alchemy on the farmer (yes not the alchemist, the farmer). The rogue/alchemist took light weapons/accuracy and put their first point into Accuracy 2 for reach. Then straight light weapons until max, then crit until max. The alchemist is really just a rogue who sacrifices his rogue abilities for the herb spawning tech. All 3 lizards take poison immunity, the knight takes fast metabolism, and the others take endure the elements. This means the only damage that can hit the rogue/elem (usually magic [always?] through the front row has to deal with 50+ resist all, and straight immune to poison). Now that all that's out of the way, I let the farmer contribute in the early game with the sling and rocks but by the time I got the first boss I just keep him dead. The farmer is dead 99.99% of the time. This lets me stack all my best armour on the knight, convert all the herbs to health pots (at crystals when I res the farmer he makes pots and gets to partake in 1 sometimes 2 fights until he's dead again). The knight takes armor/athletics and lastly dodge techs. Since only the knight tanks when slots are broken you don't have to worry about multiple characters having slots broken, so it's less use of potions. Also with fast metabolism pots are 2x effective. (Also 3 living party members consume less food, not that it's going to matter.) Now for the poison immunity, when you get to the herder poison mushroom spawner fight, you will be around level 5-6, don't kill all the spawners, I left one alive (the back one where the orb is) and I backed my party on the tile where the bag is picked up. 3 poison immune lizards are 100% immune to the little sapling type mob, and the mushroom head guys that spam poison, those mobs cannot do a single point of dmg ever, except the 3rd mob is a mushroom type melee mob. Luckily for you, you've been paying attention and have a beefed up knight with all your best armour pieces so far. With some finesse and running around you can kill this room indefinitely, as you get higher level you will be able to hold that one tile (where the bag is) without ever moving. These mushrooms drop food (not 100%, but regularly). You will amasse this beautiful stack of mushrooms on the tile right in front of you. When you are convinced you're high enough level. Finish the encounter and go outside to the crystal (not too far) and res your farmer, take him back and have him eat all the food (don't try to carry the food, let it sit on the ground).\n\nWith a human farmer and fast learner tech, I was able to get him to level 17 when the rest of the party just got 11. Thats with leaving plenty of food for everyone to spare.\n\nAn alternative to this strategy, would be to make the farmer a lizard as well with poison immunity. There is a healing crystal that acts like a real crystal (1-time-use) that drops right in that room. You can wait until you have enough food on the ground and the place under well enough control to res the farmer, eat all the food, level him, and put him in the front line. If you don't have poison immunity and res the human he'll die immediately. If he's in front he'll be subject to the melee dmg in there too, if you intend to keep him alive the rest of the way, he'll need to be up front and tanking. For this reason you should consider giving the farmer things like Athletics/Armor/Conc[3](shielding)/Alchemy etc. I wouldn't worry about the farmer as a damage dealer, it won't be worth the extra mouse effort to click his weapon when you're dealing with the 4 rogue attacks which do more than enough dmg.\n\nAlso if you don't want to spend that much time there leveling, just get the farmer to 5 for max alchemy at this stage, and leave him dead through the whole game, doing pots at crystals.\n\nIf you want to use a non poison strategy. I recommend a knight/battlemage/rogue/alchemist I would probably make the alchemist a human with 'skilled' tech for lightweapons/accuracy/alchemy so I don't have to sacrifice points in dmg early. Obviously rogue/alch get accuracy 2 first then no more accuracy ever, you know the drill. Once light weapons is maxed you could put the alchemists points in alchemy instead of crit. I recommend rushing Con 3 for shielding on your page. The 25 Prot on the buff will be an absolute must keep active ability.\n\nGood luck.","March 9, 2015","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be honest, when I first started LoG2, after about 15 minutes, I nearly uninstalled it.  The ONLY reason for this was the controls.  I haven't played a grad based game in, well, a very very long time.  This took me back to the "Lands of Lore" days, and even then the controls were not grid based.\n\nBUT.. I decided to press on, and I am happy I did.  I love this game.  I love how the world is not overrun with creatures, but yet they are there.  I love how when you encounter a puzzle you can really take your time to solve it, and you're not worrying about being bombarded by beast, or time restrictions.  Sure, a few of them require "quick thinking" and "movements" but for the most part, you really gotta sit back and take your time to work it out.\n\nI have to mention drops here too.  I have a really hard time deciding what to hold on to... what to discard...Obviously, a pair of tattered gloves can be left behind, but a "serpent staff", for instance.  If all my current weapons are better...... but why do I have this feeling I should be lugging it along?  ;-)\n\nSo, if you've never played a grid based game before, it might take you a bit of getting used to... but once you do, you'll be happy you stuck with it.\n\nI am really, really, hoping the devs have plans for a LoG3.  :-)","March 21, 2015","true","39.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Features an outside world that can lead to dungeons, and then dungeons that can connect to other dungeons. It makes the world feel interconnected and organic.\n- Clever puzzles. The majority of the puzzles in the game are very mind-bending while also being reasonable enough to solve on your own.\n- Improved Combat. The enemy AI isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn good. Enemys will often move try to pin you down, dodge, and even flee. Also, if you're a wizard-lover like me, you'll greatly appreciate the improvements to the spell system, and the skill tree system as a whole.\n- VARIETY. This game does a fantastic job of making the world varied enough to keep it fresh while also making it consistant enough to make the world feel connected. Just when you start getting sick of an enemy type or a weapon that you have. the game will throw in something new. Even the puzzles have a decent amount of variety to them with some being reflex-based, being observent of your surroundings, thinking outside the box, and even cracking codes!\n\nCons (I'm gonna be honest, these are pretty nitpicky):\n- While the inclusion of guns is nice, I feel as though they were a bit of a missed opportunity. I came across maybe a total of 3 or 4 firearms on my 1st playthrough, and for the often pitiful damage they do they aren't worth it for the amount of times they seem to malfunction and backfire. There is a firearm that's good, but you'll hardly use it out of fear of wasting the very small amount of ammo it has. Hopefully, they'll be buffed for Grimrock 3. *crossing every finger I got*\n- 2 or 3 puzzles in the game felt a bit lazy or too ambiguous, but they're greatly overshadowed by the amount of good puzzles in the game.\n- Legend of Grimrock 3 hasn't been made yet.\n\n10/10, Even if you're not a fan of dungeon crawlers, after this game you will be, take it from me, a guy who's never played a dungeon crawler before this one.\n","December 28, 2014","true","36.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Heck, it may even throw the occasional jump-scare to keep you on your toes if you find yourself fully relaxed and enveloped, like I was. Nope, I wasn't expecting that thing to jump at me, or to be ambushed during a nap.\n\nMake your adventure-squad and set-sail for puzzling fun. When you need a break, take on an impressive beastiary with swords, shields and spells. A lot of the old cast have returned - as have new ones. Combat can still be cheesed like before at times, though the game will throw trump cards at you if you rely too heavily on it - and there's some pretty nasty boss-battles in store to boot.\n\nThree out of two thumbs up for this relaxing-to-frustrating rollercoaster that'll have you fist-pumping on the completion of every puzzle or after emerging victorious from hard-fought battles.\n\nLoving it!","December 28, 2014","true","44.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While Grimrock 1 provided you with a dungeon crawler in the truest meaning of the phrase i.e. you were in a dungeon, just a dungeon, from start to finish in a somewhat linear journey through, but that's not true for Grimrock 2.\nThe world of Grimrock 2 is open to be explored and your adventure within it will be much more non-linear. In this world you will walk much more in open air but don't worry there's enough dungeons to be crawled. The game will not tell you where to go now and instead you are free to explore on your own, provided you are able to defeat the enemies and solve the puzzles that stand in your way.\n\nThe puzzles in Grimrock 2 are very well made and range from a simple push the button that clicks, to much more elaborate ones, that could take clues from every corner of the world to solve. Either way the puzzles make sense and are rewarding when solved. Their difficulty isn't too high that it should impede the progress of your adventure but there are also plethora of more advanced puzzles and sneaky secrets to be found and solved if you desire the greatest rewards.\n\nCombat has also changed in comparison to the predecessor. The enemies move faster and react quicker and are in general more varied. There are more weapons (completely new firearms class) and armors to be found. The skill system has also been improved and allows for much more versatility.\n\nLegend of Grimrock 2 just has much more content than the predecessor in almost all areas while it still provides the same experience and more, including some subtle humor.\n\nIn conclusion answer these questions:\nAre you interested in some old school first person dungeon crawling?\nDo you like a world where the lore of it is not handed to you on a silver platter but you are free to find out about it through exploration?\nDo you like solving puzzles and finding secrets?\n\nIf yes, then I can wholeheartedly recommend Legend of Grimrock 2 to you.","April 5, 2015","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it's not without some flaws, and there are parts of the game that I feel were done better in the original - overall it's still an enjoyable experience.\n\n.\n\nThanks to a nice mix of dungeons and newly added outdoor areas, environments are a lot more interesting and diverse. Characters are more interesting to develop with the revamped skill system, and chargeable special attacks add an extra level of depth to combat. Progression is less linear and you'll often find yourself backtracking to different parts of the world, gaining access to previously inaccessible areas or secrets (though it can also be frustrating when you don't know where to go and wander into a higher-level area).\n\nOn the other hand, I found dungeon design to be somewhat weaker - most fun and memorable battles I've experienced were during boss encounters where there's more open space, cover, and bigger and more interesting enemy combinations. Less can be said about normal dungeon areas, which often put you into narrow corridors or otherwise linear paths or even dead ends. This leaves little to no room for strategy, often causing fights to boil down to "attack with all characters, step backwards, repeat".","April 22, 2015","true","50.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a game that truly respects the player's intellect, and the puzzles and secrets in this game are many and challenging. This game requires skill just as much as it requires planning ahead and problem solving - which makes it an awesome adventure game.\n\nMy only complaint is that you aren't told what all the key items are, so you could find yourself dropping a key item to clean up some inventory space, only to realize later that you need it, and it is now lost in this huge world.\n\nThat being said, the immersive world you're in, the beautiful scenery and monsters, the challenging gameplay and the amout of choice you're given makes this game a true dungeon-crawling masterpiece.\n","July 13, 2015","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bosses might be a little bit easier in some places, but you still have a lot of challenge as you need balance using items, skills and managing who is in the front row taking the damage and movement is also key in this one as some enemies have many different kind of attacks that you have to dodge.\n\nThis game is really easy to get in to but still has a lot of challenge and can be played in short periods and feel like you have accomplished something. Just after few hours of playing the game world opens up so that you have multiple dungeons to explore, notes for hidden treasures and there are even some cool traps, like items that you can pick up just out in the open and then be teleported to a dungeon where you are surrounded by enemies.\n\nSome bad things about the game might be that some builds are useless when compared to others so the character customization is kinda bogged down and there seems to be very little story or interesting characters, so I would not suggest this for people who like a story driven rpg like maybe dragon age or gothic 2, witcher and such.","July 16, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm impressed with the variety of scenery you get exposed to. I don't understand why they didn't show off all the different locals on the store page. The cemetary, the forests, the graveyard, the castle, the crypts, the mines, the streams, etc. It's always something different.\n\nSome new features in this genre: Guns, gloves, walking underwater, smooth movement after the first couple of steps - really great and something I was hoping for.\nDiscovered you have two sets of weapon loadouts for each character - for example a gun and ammo in one set, and dual weild daggers in the other. NICE\n\nAI: all of the enemies seem to have unique AI and abilities and it's really refreshing to this genre. Some enemies have instant attack to thwart the sidestepping exploit common in this type of game, and some can transition between tiles quickly, or even jump to other tiles. New enemies that can occupy your grid (pack of rats) create new combat scenarios. Combat is generally very challenging, fun and rewarding.\nThe puzzles so far haven't got me stuck for long because it seems like there's always somewhere else you can go, and that tends to help you figure out what to do. Great design. :)\n\n10/10 this is such a great game - one of the few games I'll play to the end. This game is maybe not for everyone but out of the tens of thousands of games I've played, the Dungeon Master and Grimrock series will be ranked in my top 10 best games list.\n\nI wish the game had a vignette filter (darken screen edges) and a brightness control.

Legend of Grimrock 2 has the same thrill as the first, but bigger. For me, this game brought a new challenge to the original idea. Whereas before, monsters seemed a bit random as far as why some were in the area and some weren't, now each area has its own set of monsters and puzzles to get through. Instead of a dungeon and wondering if you will get out, (and what the hell all those dreams mean) we are lost on an island wondering if every move we make is truly our own or just the island owner pulling our strings.","June 13, 2015","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you liked the first one, you will probably like the second one even more (although I can see one some people seem to think otherwise).\n\nThe sequel is huge, a much bigger game than the first LG. I liked the increased variety in the sequel, and having many smaller dungeons and a large overworld map is a big improvement. However, at times due to the size of the game, it was easy to get a bit overwhelmed. I didn't put enough notes on the auto map early in the game and sometimes forgot where things were. Later I documented everything, which helped a lot.\n\nMy only major beef with the game is with some of the puzzles. I play this type of game as much for the puzzles as the rpg elements. Most of the puzzles are good to excellent, but for some I had to resort to hints. For these puzzles, whenI read the solution, I knew I would never have figured out the puzzle myself and I had no idea how the player was expected to figure the puzzle out. I didn't encounter this issue in the first Legend of Grimrock.","May 27, 2015","true","66.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I will say if you want a game that challenges your lateral thinking as well as your reactions this is a great choice.\n\nHaving just finished Grimrock 2 my reaction is one of disappointment that there's not more to play. Although there is, of course, as there’s a whole Workshop of levels to check out. I may have a go myself – I’m feeling all inspired :)\n\nBut the main story mode in this is really very engaging. If you think you’re stuck during the game then try something else, a different area, perhaps. The only gripe I have is that while playing I occasionally felt some of the puzzles were a little _too_ obscure - occasionally relying on assumptions about the players that may not hold true for all or using out-of-game knowledge (or experiences) that not everyone has. But I found ways around that and others may feel that criticism unfair, I’m sure (I’ve avoiding going into details for the sake of spoiler avoidance).\n\nThis games improves on the first game in so many ways. Although I would encourage you to play the original Grimrock there’s no need to do that other than it’s a gentler introduction to this style of 3D square based RPG.\n\nA highly recommended game to challenge brain as well as brawn.","October 31, 2015","true","52.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of a dungeon and wondering if you will get out, (and what the hell all those dreams mean) we are lost on an island wondering if every move we make is truly our own or just the island owner pulling our strings.","June 13, 2015","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bosses might be a little bit easier in some places, but you still have a lot of challenge as you need balance using items, skills and managing who is in the front row taking the damage and movement is also key in this one as some enemies have many different kind of attacks that you have to dodge.\n\nThis game is really easy to get in to but still has a lot of challenge and can be played in short periods and feel like you have accomplished something. Just after few hours of playing the game world opens up so that you have multiple dungeons to explore, notes for hidden treasures and there are even some cool traps, like items that you can pick up just out in the open and then be teleported to a dungeon where you are surrounded by enemies.\n\nSome bad things about the game might be that some builds are useless when compared to others so the character customization is kinda bogged down and there seems to be very little story or interesting characters, so I would not suggest this for people who like a story driven rpg like maybe dragon age or gothic 2, witcher and such.","July 16, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On top of that, dungeons have more dark spots that you can't see into on when you take rendering settings to low, making the game significantly harder w/o a torch.\n-I personally wish the u/i was layed out differently, like having the character portraits in the middle rather than the corner, or if the u/i was just more customizable\n-can't bind character attacks/spells to a key\n-while it's not the point of the game, npc's and towns would have been cool\n\nultimately it's a fun game with decent value at full price","December 27, 2015","true","36.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You might also say it's like if Might and Magic X was good. The exploration is by far Grimrock 2's strongest point, with a sprawling open-ended world to explore and tons of secrets to find. It can be tense too, as you come to expect horrible things to happen when picking up items, etc. Multiple times I got jumpscared by unexpected enemies. The graphics are even pretty great, especially for an indie studio. Character building and progression isn't bad, though there's some useless skills and it starts to not matter what you level towards the end. Music is great on the menu and in boss battles, but nonexistent otherwise. It works for Myst and Demon's Souls, but I would've preferred some more traditional music to the ambience in this case.\n\nThe one thing that really threatens to spoil it is the combat system, which is carried over from the previous game where it also was a problem. Positioning determines roughly 90% of your success, or should I say, whether or not you can find four open squares to move around on. People cheesed enemies in Grimrock 1 with squaredancing, and instead of revamping it, the developers just made skillful squaredancing 100% necessary to have any success in combat. There are more nuances in enemy movement to make it interesting, but if you ever get cornered at the end of a hallway, even the god damn mosquitoes will tear your party apart. I don't care if it's old school, It's fundamentally broken, and anyone who stuck up for it after the first game is wrong. It also sucks that you have to click small icons and make complex actions with the mouse while doing all this movement, when even the 90s RPGs allowed you to attack with hotkeys for your characters. However, combat isn't the majority of the game, and in MOST cases it's manageable without much frustration. It's only when they throw enemies at you in cramped hallways that it stops working well. There were a lot of times where I got gameovers and then easily overcame them the next time because now I knew where I could safely fight.\n\nAnyway, whatever, good game overall.","August 26, 2015","true","46.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you ever played the old Eye of the Beholder gameboy game or something like it, you'll appreciate this. Grimrock takes the classic dungeon crawl scheme and modernizes it.\n\nThis just doesn't mean better graphics and game mechanics though--the developers of this game really thought about these and spent time putting in intricate, yet very solvable puzzles and riddle-like passive narratives into the game. Meaning, you will be challenged, but you will also feel very rewarded when you figure something out. This perfect balance along with some nice, classic RPG elements make for some great fun.\n\nLegend of Grimrock 2 is better than the first, but this is only because of the graphics upgrade and the much more diverse environments you get to explore instead of being cooped up in a tower all day!\n\nOn my top games list--a must for lovers of the genre!","January 7","true","78.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although there is, of course, as there’s a whole Workshop of levels to check out. I may have a go myself – I’m feeling all inspired :)\n\nBut the main story mode in this is really very engaging. If you think you’re stuck during the game then try something else, a different area, perhaps. The only gripe I have is that while playing I occasionally felt some of the puzzles were a little _too_ obscure - occasionally relying on assumptions about the players that may not hold true for all or using out-of-game knowledge (or experiences) that not everyone has. But I found ways around that and others may feel that criticism unfair, I’m sure (I’ve avoiding going into details for the sake of spoiler avoidance).\n\nThis games improves on the first game in so many ways. Although I would encourage you to play the original Grimrock there’s no need to do that other than it’s a gentler introduction to this style of 3D square based RPG.\n\nA highly recommended game to challenge brain as well as brawn.","October 31, 2015","true","52.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had never played the first one and got this one with the Humble Bundle Monthly subscription so I decided to give it a go.  It's pretty neat.

Combat is a little silly requiring you to always strafe away from your enemies but doesnt really take away from the game too much.  Puzzles are on the whole good and give the player a challenge.  However some are unbelivably cryptic and I would recommend consulting a game-guide if you waste more than 10-15mins on any one.","July 4, 2015","true","35.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
