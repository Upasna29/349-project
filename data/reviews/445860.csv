I wasn't sure what to think of it when i first saw it, because I'm a big fan of real war planes and I was afraid that this game wouldn't satisfy me need for planes in VR.\nOn the other hand I loved Toy Commander on Dreamcast, so I gave it a shot.\n\nI was surprised in a very positive way when i first played it! It has a beginner friendly but also very satisfying fly physic that slows to learn complex maneuvers.\n\nDOGFIGHTS ARE VERY INTENSE.\nI fought against friends and it was very intense. Fighting against the AI is a good training. Aiming is easy and the level design features a lot of interactive elements like shootable blocks, balls or even slot cars.\n\nMY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS THE RACING MODE.\nDogfights are intense but once i tried the racing mode, I found this even better. I raced against 2 other players and it was incredible intense. Three planes racing towards a narrow hohle where just one of us will fit through? Oh yeah. :)\n\n\nSummary of Pros/Cons of the current Early Access release:\n+ Immersive, gigantic looking rooms/apartments (a great feeling of beeing tiny)\n+ Lovely detailed planes (that woman in the double decker <3)\n+ Intense Dogfights\n+ Awesome Racing Mode\n\n- No ingame Voice Chat to chat with the Team\n- In Racing Mode all players should choose the same planes because some are superior regarding top speed\n\nI'm looking forward to the upcoming maps and planes!","April 5","true","2.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It's one of the best VR Games out there at the moment, and incredibly advanced for an early access game!\nSo now im gonna explain why exactly i love this game :\n\n1. Gameplay :\nThe gameplay is pretty simple. You fly a plane, and shoot other planes.\nBut one point, wich a lot of plane games f*ck up is done incredibly well in Toy Plane Heroes : The controls.\nThey are very responsive, and very easy to understand and master. You use one stick, to rotate the plane around it's own axis, and the other one to turn your plane left or right.\nTo accelerate you just press RB (on an Xbox controller), and to brake you press LB.\nShooting is done by pressing the triggers, one for each weapon.\nWhere you shoot is depending on where you look. The two elements of steering your plane with the controller, and aiming your shots with the head makes the whole game very complex and deep, while it's still easy enough for people who know how to handle controllers! (If you're not a gamer though, you shouldn't start gaming with this game...)\n\n2. The Graphics\nI can't say too much about the graphics, because this game has a toy... -ish(?) style to it, so of course it isn't hyper realistic. But overall the graphics are really good! They do exactly what they're supposed to be, the textures have a very good resolution, and the whole toyish look comes across great!\nAlso, the style makes for relatively low graphics requirements, which is pretty good!\n\n3. The motion sickness\nSo, for a plane game you would probably expect a lot of motion sickness, but, even though i get motion sick pretty quick, i can play this game for long periods of time without a lot of motion sickness! The only two times when i really get sick are 1. when i fly loopings (wich is understandable), and 2. when i get shot and my plane tumbles down. Because of the rapid movement, wich i can't control, it's really hard to look at. But after like 3 times, i just instinctively closed my eyes, which basically eliminates this problem.\n\nSo overall this game is just awsome! I just recommend playing it for yourself. Especially with friends, it's awsome. Though, the bots are also very fun to play against.\n\nOverall im giving a rating of 8.5/10","April 17","true","4.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I was up and flying in seconds and I even configured my HOTAS and was able to use it without any trouble. The game looks very promising. I recommend it.\n\nOne downside: I never experienced motion sickness in my life until I played this game. Yikes!  I don't think it's the game's fault, though.\n","April 23","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Smooth xbox controls, fun aireal combat and seeing my brother looking behind him in his plane and nodding is just beyond everything. This was my very first multiplayer VR experience, and it was awesome! Thank you so much for creating this game! It runs as a dream here on my DK2 and CV1. Highly recommended and I'm eagerly awaiting updates!\n\nFor those complaining about nausea, I experienced none of it, and I have only medium VR-legs. Might have to do with your settings, because it ran perfect for me (which cannot be said about some other games, blegh).\n\nEdit: I had a demo at work a while ago and several people spent some time flying around in VR, getting shot down by easy AI's and doing loopings only to get stuck in lamps and under the bed. They all LOVED it, and no-one got sick at all. This only strengthens my belief that settings might be a problem for some people. Recentering when in the plane can also help a lot.","April 17","true","5.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The physics are nice and simple, while the combat is relatively slow paced but still takes some strategy.  I also really like the art design of it and I think it just works great, flying around in a tiny toy airplane is just cool. A number of people have brought up motion sickness, but that kind of seems to be normal with these kind of games when you first start playing them.  General VR sickness rules apply though, once you start feeling a little sick just stop immediately and come back the next day.  Soon enough, depending on how susceptible you are, you wont get nauseus anymore. I do think it's a great benefit to use even just a cheap joystick though as it's a little bit more natural than a controller or mouse and keyboard.  This is game is worth a try for the price, and the developers are adding more to the game in the form of more maps, game modes, and recently new aircraft that should be more bearable when it comes to motion sickness.","May 28","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would love to see a control scheme more like Anshar Wars 2 (for the Gear VR), where you use the headset to control your craft's motion and the controller to aim your weapon - that makes games like this MUCH more tolerable in VR, as the motion of your head better matches what your eyes are seeing, thus decreasing feelings of disorientation and nausea (I feel none whatsoever in Ashar Wars 2 and none in general on most VIVE games). If at all possible, PLEASE incorporate that as an alternate control scheme to make this game more accessible to a wider range of people, including myself.\n\nAnd as a side note, the game runs flawlessly on my system (GeForce 980 Ti x2 and core i7-5930 @ 4.0 GHz with a SSD on MSI Godlike board), so specs/settings have nothing to do with it. It is the disconnect between the visual stimulus and what the vestibular canals of the inner ear are sensing. Add the alternate control scheme I suggested, and it will be way more comfortable. ;)","May 10","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

Luckily the maps are very imaginative, that suits you're heights and the adventure.\nThe controls can be altered, which comes in handy, though you can't change the way you aim (I wouldn't change that anyway since that's a way even noobs like me can hit stuff).\nI really recommend the game, it's tons of fun and fairly easy to get into.","May 11","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
