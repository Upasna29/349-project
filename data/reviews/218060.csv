It has you playing as CommanderVideo, jumping, blocking and springjumping his way across 5 different worlds to escape back to his crew.\n\nThe game expands wonderfully on the original, with different playable characters, costumes, challenges, bonuses, dance combos, the lot. It looks better, it controls better and it feels better.\n\nNor does the game ramp up towards the end arbitrarily, but instead puts difficulty into the game thematically.\n\nReally super fun, completed each level on hardest difficulty within 7 hours.

Everything about RUNNER2's gameplay feels as if it was developed in direct response to criticisms of the first game and is definitely more approachable and polished than before.  If you just straight up didn't like the original game however, this one isn't going to change your mind.\n\nThe setup is largely the same with the only chief differences being the spiffy and colorful new aesthetic and changes that make the game a bit easier to handle. If you were a fan of the original's retro visual style, you'll likely be disappointed with the more distinct cartoony look and sound of RUNNER2, but if you were a fan of the gameplay, you're still in for a treat.\n\nThe biggest and most requested change is that there are now optional mid-stage checkpoints, which can make learning stages a bit easier. It's up to you whether you want a score bonus or a safety net, so there's a nice little element of risk vs reward here. The difficulty curve is straight up perfect this time around, with really nice ramp ups in challenge where they need to be with some easier stages sprinkled throughout to keep the bloodpressure down. Stages feel more like complete songs now, each with a really nice build up and repetition of patterns and mechanics with really nice flourishes at the end.\n\nRUNNER2 is also a much bigger game than the original, containing 125 stages (100 normal stages and 25 hidden retro warp zones), multiple characters to play as, tons of unlockable costumes, and some Super Mario World'ey alternate exits toat can open up different paths in each world. I certainly found a lot of enjoymen in wanting to unlock everything, but you don't really need that mentality to enjoy what the game has to offer.\n\nOverall, RUNNER2 is simply a better game in every respect. The new visual designs may turn off some fans, but they don't affect the core gameplay which is still solid as hell.","January 12, 2014","true","18.0"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","44","46","0","2"

Having never played any of the Bit Trip games, I'd read rave reviews about this game and about how good it was.  The first thing you notice when you start the game are the vibrant colors and beautiful backgrounds.  The art style is really clean and crisp; it makes everything easy to see and prepare for.  This is important because every jump, slide, bounce, block, super bounce and slide jump you do are all in rhythm to the song playing in each level.  Bad controls would absolutely break this game because of how time sensitive it is so I'm happy to say they are nearly flawless.  A players success with this game is going to be solely based on how good their hand-eye coordination is.  With sound being so important it's a good thing then, that the music is generally upbeat and enjoyable.  It gives a relaxing feel that works well even though the game itself is about timing and reaction.\n\nIf you pick up every item in a level and beat it you get a "Perfect" rating.  You can also get a "Perfect+" which is picking up every item along with getting shot out of a canon that moves up and down and hitting a red bullseye at the end of a level.  This can be really frustrating if you're trying to get Perfect+ on every level, say for an achievement that requires it.  You might be playing on hard and on the 10th try you finally beat the level, pick up every item and now it's time to try and hit the bullseye.  There's no surefire way to hit it other than sort of feeling it's the right moment to fire.  If you miss and you want the Perfect+ you'll have to play the whole level over again to get the chance to hit the bullseye again.  This is literally the only thing in the game that might detract from someones enjoyment of it in any way.\n\nIt's not a huge game taking around 5 hours to get through the first time but Hard mode is where the game really shines as it fills in a lot more of the song with obstacles and enemies that are missing on easier difficulties.  You can also play 8-bit retro levels that are hidding throughout stages.  I didn't find them anywhere near as enjoyable as the main game however.  Bottom line, this is a great game that should be enjoyed by everywhere and a game that can brighten your day whenever you play it.\n\nSingle Player Play Time - 5-6 hours\n\nOverall 8.5","November 11, 2014","true","23.4"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","36","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/218060/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","I have waited my whole life to hear Charles Martinet say, "soft, bulbous bosom."\n\nRunner2 is rather interesting. I wasn't a fan of the original BIT.TRIP RUNNER. But I love Runner2. And the reason is almost everything about it. Runner2 gets nearly every single thing that it does right, and excels in all of those places where RUNNER fell flat. If this is what happens when the BIT.TRIP devs are able to refine and reinvent their own series, I'd like to see them do it more often.\n\nRunner2 opens with our narrator, the legendary Charles Martinet (who you will probably recognize from his famous roles as Ray Trace in Space Quest 6, Civilian Male in Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, Police Station Reporter #1 in The Dead Pool, and of course MC Ballyhoo in Mario Party 8), introducing himself and the game, before taking us on a journey through the repressed imaginations of the disturbed.\n\nBIT.TRIP RUNNER and Runner2 run along with the same basic gameplay. As Commander Video and co., it is your duty to run to the right until the game tells you that you may stop. You duck, kick, block, and jump over obstacles while picking up gold bars and red plus signs. You do not control the running. That's automatic, and you will continue running at a steady pace until you run into something that you shouldn't.\n\nWhich you will! A lot.\n\nLuckily, Runner2 is a lot more forgiving in this aspect than RUNNER was. Every normal level now has a checkpoint in the middle for you to fall back on once you get halfway through the stage. Boss stages are LOADS more forgiving, as they have checkpoints after every round, and there's no longer a boring non-boss section of the boss stage to run through at the beginning before even getting to the boss. I ultimately quit RUNNER because I had gotten sick and tired of having to run that section again and again every time I failed 75% of the way through the boss fight, so you can imagine how immensely relieved I am that they added a few CC's of "forgiving" to this thing. You do still have to play a game of "what not entirely obvious thing do I have to do to dodge this obstacle and/or harm the boss" during these battles, but the pain is massively alleviated by the ever-so-welcome checkpoints.\n\nThat said, the hardest bit of this trip is still the final boss (on hard, anyways).\n\nNow, when I say the game is forgiving, I don't mean to say that it's easy. I mean, it never seems unfair, but to me that's a good thing. I understand that some gamers may want their reflexes strained beyond human capacity, and that's fine, but the most hardcore gamers who can play competitive Tetris while using their toes to take on a long line of challengers at Street Fighter III Alpha Turbo Hyper Go Go Omega Jamboree will probably not have the heart-pounding digital adrenaline burst they crave, here. The rest of us humans will find Runner2 to be a game that's just as difficult as want it to be.\n\nSee, in Runner2, you can challenge yourself as much, or as little, as you choose. More difficulty leads to higher risk, but typically also more points if you're successful. To start, you have three difficulties to select from. Then you have the split paths which are often found up to several times in levels. Red signs point to the more difficult paths, which also have a tendency to contain keys or chests. There are a few obstacles which can be avoided entirely, or met head-on for points. Collecting gold and pluses nets you points and multipliers, and collecting all of them earns you a nice bonus on top of allowing you to play the cannon minigame at the end of the stage for up to 10,000 additional points. And you always have the option of jumping over the checkpoint (discounting boss stages) to challenge yourself to do the entire level in one shot - for loads of points, of course.\n\nPlus you can dance, if you want to. You can leave your friends behind. Because your friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, well they're going to eat ♥♥♥♥ on the leaderboards, that's for sure.\n\nI started off on Just Right for most of the game, but halfway through the penultimate world accidentally wound up playing a few levels in Rather Hard before realizing my mistake. But I found it to be enticingly difficult - rather than frustratingly difficult as I had expected it to be - and decided to stick with it. And sure, I struggled with it at first, but eventually you settle into a groove where dodging denser and denser combination of obstacles becomes something natural that you do without really thinking about it. Interestingly, difficulty doesn't effect the placement of obstacles and collectibles, but simply adds to them. The gold is in the same position on every difficulty, but on higher difficulties two hops and then some stairs can become a slide, a hop, a slide-hop, a kick, another hop, and a slide-hop up a set of stairs (while standing up for a split second every so often to collect gold on your way up).\n\nHonestly, this all just comes back to one really important, deal-breaking point: the level design in Runner2 is splendid. Some of the more subtle elements are properly thought-out and given care, as well. For instance, there are these jump pad things. They're like springs embedded into the ground. If you hold the appropriate key, you will launch into the air as you run over them. The clever bit is that the top of them wobbles down into place as they enter the screen, as a way of pointing them out to the player, since they are otherwise flush with the ground - still visible, but less noticeable.\n\nAll that said, Runner2 desperately needs a kill key. Or... "bonk" key. Whatever they like to call it. Some levels have a bit near the end where it's easy to miss a single piece of gold by jump-gliding just a hair too early, and then it's a clear, obstacle-less shot to the goal. Since there's no restart from checkpoint option, the only way to go back to a checkpoint is to hit an obstacle. Ultimately, you're forced to start that level from the beginning if you wish to perfect it. On the easier levels, this is boring. On the harder ones, vexing.\n\nAlso, rails will bother you for awhile until you're used to them. Actually dodging obstacles on them is simple. But it seems like the deadline for jumping off of one is oh-so-slightly sooner than it is for the edge of a platform. It can be tough to judge this properly, and I've fallen off of far more rails than platforms when intending to jump far.\n\nEven with the occasional quirk, I very much enjoyed playing Runner2. It looks great, too. It's certainly more visually impressive than its predecessor. There's a great deal more personality to it, between the quietly disconcerting backgrounds and the mildly euphamistic stage names. The music starts off kind of easy to ignore, but gets better as you progress. The second-to-last world has a creepy understatement to it, and the final world has a sort of... well, it reminds me of Blood Dragon. Does that help? I really enjoy it. The soundtrack adds an incentive to collect the pluses, too, as not only do they give score multipliers, but they add (oh, I get it) complexity to the music.\n\nOh, hey, speaking of nothing at all, because I just removed the bit I segued from, I know the game tells you up front that it recommends using a controller. Now, I have a controller that I could very well use. But out of pure, unfiltered laziness, I didn't. And I have to say, the keyboard worked out perfectly well. Better than you would expect. Hands are at WASD and JKL;. J jumps, and K kicks. Think of WASD as arrows. W launches you on those jump pads, S slides, and D puts a shield in front of you. Also, A dances. That's not really a direction, it's just kind of there.\n\nAlright, time to wrap this up. What else? Uh, the DLC character pack is money well spent. Dr. Fetus uses a struggling Bandage Girl as his shield. Josef goes into short mode instead of sliding. Retro stages are fun.

Bit Trip Runner 2 is, actually, a very simplistic side-scrolling platformer with some slick rhythm elements and a very unique, whimsical style.\n\nYou play as Commander Video and your task is to reach the end of some levels, DOMINATE your robotic nemesis, and save your friends.  The first level starts off pretty chill, just jumpin' over some lil' bumps in the road, look out for some robots. Not a big deal. Everything is going great until you see- OH MY GOODNESS-  an airborne robot threat! You can't jump over him, so you're forced to hit down and SLIDE underneath it. You might be thinking "Dang, now I gotta jump over things AND slide under things too, this is getting a little outta control".\n\nFortunately, things only get crazier as new mechanics and abilites are introduced. Over time you'll be hoppin' on springs, grinding on rails like a skater dude, karate kicking through your enemies, deflecting power cubes with your force field barrier, and dancing 24/7. Trust me, its too sick. The game offers 3 different difficulties, but the overall challenge is pretty tame. Fans of the 1st Bit Trip Runner may be disappointed at the drop in difficulty.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of the game is it's musical magnificence. Not only is the soundtrack itself killer, but the ways in which sound is integrated into the platforming is a real juicy treat.  As you progress in a level the soundtrack will increase in complexity, and every single action that you perform in the level, like completing a jump or hitting a spring, will make sounds that add to the beat.  It's little things like this that make Runner 2 stand out and make me say "I LIKE THIS GAME."\n\nThere's plenty of costumes and characters to unlock, and 100+ levels to complete. If you go for 100% completion, this game can occupy you for quite some time. I must say that, for me, it was truly a slamtastic experience. So, If you are thinking of purchasing this, I'd recommend looking at some videos of the game in action so you know what to expect, but rest assured that you will be buying excellence.\n\nTo sum it up, if Bit Trip Runner 2 was a wild animal, it would definitely be a funky lookin' rainforest ape.\nThank you for reading this review.","June 11, 2015","true","22.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","17","19","4","1"

Same problem with a gamepad (i played most of it with an xbox controller), so it turns out that jump and kick is X and A and because they are so close together some random level in world 3 or 4 is the hardest in the whole game because you have to do a couple of successive jumpkicks up some stairs.\nFor someone playing quite a few precision platformers this is mind-boggling, how could anyone think that buttons that you need to alternate quickly should be so close together, the most annoying part is that kicking before jumping sometimes cancels out the kick. Even worse is that the shoulder buttons are not used for anything but dancing, if the shoulder buttons would be kick and block gamepad controls would be fine.\n\nCheckpoints = Chokepoints\nBefore hitting a checkpoint you get slowed down, in later levels there are a few checkpoints that are positioned so poorly that the slowdown will simply kill you, even if you memorize the spot it is very irritating and completly ruins your timing every single time.\n\nWhite on White:\nSo the first 2 worlds have white/greyish backgrounds and grey enemies, making them hard to see. Enemies in general look all rather similiar, because of that you sometimes die because you couldn't properly see the enemy instead of actually hard gameplay sequences.\n\nCannon-Minigame:\nMost levels are easier than bit.trip runner 1 even on the hardest difficulty, but not getting a perfect+ because being slightly off with the cannon is just a way to artificially increase the playtime, even if you get good at the cannon minigame you will miss a couple times.\n\nBeating the game perfect+ hardest difficulty on every level isn't good enough:\nNo, to 100% the game you have to play every level on all 3 difficultys and get the cannon-minigame perfect on every single level. Compared to bit.trip runnner 1 the levels on the hardest difficulty are rather easy, but playing on easy is so boring that i can't believe some people actually completed the game with 100%.\n\nDancing mechanic:\nI don't even know how this mechanic could make it in the game. So if you want to get highscores you have to dance pretty much every second you can, artificially increasing the difficulty for yourself because the game isn't designed tighter.\n\nI think that covered the most big problems i had with the game, despite all that i played through the game, compared to bit.trip runner 1 it is way more casual but offers fun for a couple hours.","January 15, 2014","false","17.1"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","8"

What I got was something with the same basic gameplay, but with a lot of extras.\nExtras? Extras are good, right? If you played the first Runner, there was almost nothing more satifying than getting an extra, then speeding along with the music at full audibility, collecting gold with a rainbow contrail stretching to infinity. Sadly though, in this version, extras result in a watery rainbow which trails sadly in your wake, and the music doesn't really noticably change throughout the course of a level. I suppose that anything less wouldn't fit the new 'style' of the game.\nNo, these extras are the normal sort of game extras, extra characters and collectable outfits and a 'reward' system. Collectible outfits? If you're still thinking of the first BIT.TRIP Runner, you may be wondering how that works. I could tell you the first outfit was a pair of earbuds, and you might wonder if that meant whitining a couple pixels on the Runner's ears. Not to fear though, it's all part of the new 'style'.\nAt the beginning of the game, a smarmy narrator informs you that CommanderVideo has been sucked into an alternate dimension, while fighting in some manner of justice league. A new world awaits, with a lot more living things, and more importantly, real 3D graphics.\nI don't feel that 3D graphics really do much for the game. I felt that my runner was not a s responsive due to the slower nature of the jump animation. In fact, starting out, the overhangs on staircases would always make me trip, as I was used to a more 2D perspective from playing the first runner. Moreover, when I tripped, the runner would swim backwards like an octopus, at a constant rate no matter where I was in the level, which was really irratating if I tripped towards the end (compare Runner, where returning to the start took a fixed amount of time, no matter what).\nThe presence of a lot more living things is worse for the feel of the game, though. In the first runner, the living things include huge tunneling worms, fish, clouds with mustaches, and trampolines with eyes. What all of these have in common though is that they are separated from your gameplay. None of them are beneficiaries or detractors to your Herculean run. Your enemies, such as they are, are robots. In Runner2, the first thing you see is a spike-thing sitting in the road. Then, as you go further on, a drunken pickle registers you at a checkpoint. This makes the aesthetic lonliness which the first game had impossible to acheive. End the level, and a sign flips to tell you it's an "Amazing Acheivement!". If you've collected all the gold, you no longer get to go to a fiendishly difficult bonus level, but instead get fired out of a cannon.\nAs the game mechanics were introduced I noticed another thing I didn't like about this sequel, namely, the trigger keys no longer did what they used to. I really enjoyed using A+RTrigger to Jump-kick in the first Runner, but in the second it was not to be.\nAll in all the game comes off as extremely patronizing, with it's hollow achievement system (called 'rewards' for some reason) and its collect all the costumes mentality, which bothers me much more in the face of the sink or swim of the first Runner. It has some promising new mechanics that the first one did not, but they don't necessarily play out. An example is tracing a circle with your right stick, an idea I thought was pretty novel until I realized it had absolutely no impact on the game besides earning extra points.\nIn an effort to enjoy the game more, I switched to the drunken pickle as soon as I possibly could, so that I might be able to enjoy the game for what it was, instead of comparing it to the first runner. A fine idea, though at the character change screen I was briefly greeted by the monstrousity that is CommandgirlVideo. For heavens sake, I believe that collection of black pixel which comprised the protagonist of the first Runner was gender neutral, for that matter, so is the word 'Commander'. Is there any purpose for a second amalgamation of pixels with secondary sexual characteristics other than to alienate half the population from the main protagonist? Do the words 'separate but equal' ring any bells?\nIn any case, I continued playing the game, pretending now that it was the adventures of drunken pickle. I was plesantly releived that noone seemed present at any of the checkpoints, but drunken pickle's extra mode was an all-green rainbow, which should, in any reasonable game, be an oxymoron. I finished off the level, and defeated the boss.\nBut then came a cut scene, featuring CommanderVideo going pointlessly into a whale, even though I'd been playing with drunken pickle the whole time. And then the checkpoints were populated again, by a crab man in a hut. And then I lost interest, and let the game run on to give me Steam Card drops while I wrote this review.\nSo, in conclusion, Runner is better. If you were thinking about playing this game, play Runner. If you've already beaten Runner, go back and do all the challenges, or do it on Perfect mode. If you've already beaten it on perfect mode, then grab your square frames, put them on, and meet me in the cafe down the street, which serves 100% economically sourced coffee-flavored foam, and we can chat about how the first Runner was so much better, before BIT.TRIP went mainstream.\nBottom line: Though Runner2 may be better played with a controller, it's better to play the original Runner with that contoller.","February 9, 2014","false","1.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

The cannon must be fired at a very precise moment in order to hit the bullseye of a target. This is the difference between a 'Perfect' and a 'Perfect+'\nThis is very annoying when you've just completed a level perfectly, skipped the checkpoint (grants 50,000 extra points) and made it to the end; because if you miss the bullseye, you must start the whole level over again.\n\nOther gripes include the multiple intro screens before the main menu (I don't need a recap of what happened in the previous game every time I load up) and one level where you must to jump up some stairs while kicking, which wouldn't be a problem if the buttons where mapped differently, but there isn't any option to configure the controls.\n\nRegardless of minor issues, this is still a fantastic game.","March 8, 2014","true","31.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It's not really a platformer, more like a crash course of obstacles to avoid. Which might sound boring, but it's actually pretty fun!\n\nThe gameplay is relaxing, yet challenging; there hasn't been anything that made me ragequit, just try harder; the normal difficulty setting seems to be really balanced, and also implementing checkpoints makes the frustration factor go waaaay down. One note though, if you don't have a controller, you might have a bad time.\n\nThere is a lot to do here. 100 levels, with collectibles, chests, keys and other stuff. You can go for all the items, try the high score or try the deceptively tough warp zones (3 lives...)

You sit there, not realizing that you're smiling and moving to the music and even humming along, and then it hits you; you're a kid again, and there's not a care in the world. It's almost magical. It's also everything a sequel could hope to be in every category, and it's become one of my favorite games on Steam. I could go on and on with statements like these (and they would all be true) but all you really need to know is if the game is fun or not, and the answer to that is absolutely, joyously, colorfully YES.\n\nThis game is not only a loveletter to fans of the original game (on which it improves on everything fans asked and hoped for and then some) but also to anyone who is a fan of stylish, musically driven platformers or rhythm games. The world is vibrant, hilarious and creative with giant, cartoonish backgrounds that will sometimes even distract you from the game with how funny and imaginative the situations are. This goes without saying but the music, a major boon and pivotal component of the gameplay, is completely stellar. Each world has a new song and you'll want to collect all of the music pickups as soon as you can to add more and more layers to the beat. The levels are laid out in such a way that each jump, kick, bounce and deflection adds a complementary tune to the soundtrack, and it makes you feel like the songs are not just background audio but a real part of the experience. The gameplay has been reworked and is far more about actual skill, timing and reflexes than the original Bit.Trip Runner's reliance on memorization and punishment through repetition. The moves are simple; you can duck, kick, jump, and block. Simple, right? It's the way Gaijin Games combines these basic manuevers in the levels that give you a real challenge that never feels cheap or frustrating so that when you lose, you know why and you're raring for another shot. You know how to duck and you know how to jump, but what happens when you're faced with a grounded and floating pair of enemies with space in between? You duck and jump at the same time, of course! A floating enemy with a wall underneath? You kick while sliding! In this way every new challenge feels organic and satisfying because you are mixing these moves that you've mastered to navigate these mazes of music that the developers have created for you. Soon you're flying through the air, blocking cubes, shattering floating enemies, jumping and sliding at a pace that will make onlookers think you must have been playing this game for years.\n\nThere's 5 worlds complete with bonus stages and hidden retro courses, unlockable characters and costumes, three difficulties (and optional checkpoints, THANK GOD), leaderboards, challenges and achievements, so you'll be playing this game for quite a while if you want to see everything it has to offer. At the price this game goes for now on sale, it's really a no brainer. Pick it up, pick up the soundtrack, maybe even grab a copy for your friend. Yes, it's that good.

Even tried binding the buttons to keyboard presses using the Logitech profiler software, but those petty tricks is no match for this game's stubbornness.\n\nAnywho, onward and upwards with my trusty wired gaming keyboard. This proved less than optimal, as there's a really noticable input lag. I know it's part of the game design that you remember the pattern of the obstacles anyways, meaning that you should be able to simply adjust the timing of memorized keypresses. But under normal circumstances good reflexes can make up for what you forget - so NOT being able to do so in the very last stages of the game ups the difficulty A LOT.\n\nLower the difficulty to grandma mode you say? NEVAH!\n\nThe first 85% of the game is mostly smooth and enjoyable sailing, but the last parts had me yelling at the monitor. It didn't seem to mind though.\n\nIf it weren't for the aforementioned technical problems, I'd give this charming rythmic platformer a respectable 80%, but I can't justify more than 65%.\n\n\n","December 21, 2013","true","9.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

If you did not like BTR1 for difficulty reasons, maybe you'll like this! Levels have checkpoints now, but on the other hand, you've also got to do a lot more precision movement as the game goes on*, so... kinda wipes out the assistance the former gives you after a certain point.\n\nOverall this is a good game! Again, if you played its predecessor, you know what you're getting into here. The problem is that it's a huge friggin' mess design-wise. If you're into challenging platforming, that's still here, it's true, but sometimes hitboxes are really unclear (and this is twice as bad with the DLC characters). If you were the sort of OCD completionist who loved the prior game's "perfect" scores, guess what: you now have 3x the content. The game ranks you on if you perfect EACH DIFFICULTY LEVEL. Irritated by buying the prior one later and finding the high score table locked up by perfect scores forever? Well guess what - this time you now have to spam a key to get the best scores while you're challenging the stage.\n\nIn fact, a huge amount of the problems I have with this game come down to "mash this button now!!!" or oddly-timed QTEs in the middle of what's generally a platformer**. If you miss an item, you see the item and you know where you screwed up. If you miss a button-press you don't get "too fast/too slow", and suddenly it's rage-inducing because YOU PRESSED THE KEY FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. The others are basically "learn the level or go screw" design - not only do some stages have multiple exits (kindly marked, however), a couple branch in multiple ways before converging at the end... and not always in ways that let each path get perfect scores. Having to replay a stage over and over just to HUNT for gold in an auto-scrolling game sucks. Having to replay a stage because you need to beat a level to go back and take a specific path in a prior level if you want to unlock a costume or character sucks***.\n\nAgain: this game is a mess, design-wise, but it's not a BAD game. Just... well, the kind of bitter pill pretty much every Bit.Trip game was, where it was JUST close enough to being excellent to make the flaws more jagged.\n\n* It is entirely possible some of the "harder" moves aren't present on lower difficulty levels. (There are three: easy/normal/hard). I would not know about this, I've been going through on Hard.\n** I am told that if you're not playing this on a keyboard, you have to spin joysticks in time with an obstacle instead on some of these. I don't know which seems more miserable.\n*** This is not a joke. Every world has some items/paths locked behind keys, which only appear after you effectively finish a world and take a specific path to open "the Key Vault". Sometimes they will be locked behind "must have X/Y gold in this world to progress" gates, too! It's like a Rare collectathon in the middle of a pure platformer.","January 14, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My sense of rhythm and eyesight are both pretty terrible, so it was too much for me. Runner2 improves upon the original in every way, though the art style might be harder for some to read.\n\nRevolving around a constant runner of your choice, you have to enter a series of combinations that both make music and allow your runner to progress to the end of the level. It may sound simple enough, but the difficulty ramps up on its own, and the level of challenge can be controlled by the player. The levels rarely feel too long, and the check point can be a life saver.\n\nRunner2 constantly gives incentives to keep you going, with humorous costumes and characters to unlock, leaderboards, retro levels, and great animation. The reverse merman and disco hamburger had me grinning even when I was stuck on the same section for an extended period.\n\nRunner 2 is aesthetically pleasing with simple mechanics, great challenge, and lots of personality.\n\n****The DLC is a great character pack. The characters offered in the pack are beloved and sure to please many gamers.

Another great example of what a sequel should be, BIT.TRIP Runner2: Future legend of Rhythm Alien does a great job of maintaining the expectation of the first game while improving and adding more to the series to make an even better game than the first. Not only is there more content, but the game overall has had a massive overhaul. The music is still just as great and is even more prominent in each level and it instantly becomes a joy to start running regardless of level and the sound design in general is greatly improved and it’s even narrated by Charles Martinet! The style and graphics have taken a huge turn for the better; the world is filled with even weirder worlds, colors, style than the previous game and, overall the game now resembles something more like a modern cartoon. The gameplay is still simple and more or less the same from the first, however levels have been improved, aside from the checkpoints now at about the mid-point of each level (which you can skip for bonus points) most levels have extra or various routes to take, some more difficult with greater rewards vs. easier routes or ones that will give you access to other levels. You can now also play different characters and unlock a great variety of costumes for each one. The game also has added more abilities you unlock to give greater variations to the scores you can earn in each level and it also has effortlessly combined leaderboards and scores from Steam friends right into the game and each level has different variations depending on the difficulty set; all this combined makes it a joy to play through each level and go back through ones you’ve beat to try to achieve a greater score or top friends who have also played.\n\nBIT.TRIP Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is a great sequel and if you’ve already played the first game the sequel should be a no brainer purchase. For those of you interested in the first game, I recommend picking up Runner2 as it offers a lot more and it is only $15.00 USD, only $5 more than the first game. BIT.TRIP Runner2 is a great game, it’s challenging, easy to play, difficult to perfect and master and it has loads of unlockable stuff and, can easily entertain you with its fast action and great music. Definitely pick this up if you enjoy arcade styled games, fast paced games, games that capitalize on music or family friendly games, it truly is a game everyone can enjoy and for the asking price you really can’t get much better than this.\n\n-Double Thumbs Up from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork","January 27, 2014","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Looks better, plays better, has more variety and better design overall. Unfortunately it has the opposite problem as RUNNER; it can tend to drag, and there might be a bit too many levels. Granted, I think this problem is only an issue for achievement-hunting people like myself, but it still really got tiring to play this near the end. The three difficulty modes might be a bit unnecessary, easy is an absolute joke and is barely fun due to how much there isn't to avoid. Hard at least stayed decently fun throughout though it's not as hard as the original RUNNER even at its hardest points (maybe for the better, though). I've said a lot about the negatives but they're really minor, honestly, since I enjoyed this game a lot for most of the time I spent playing it and I don't regret playing it, it's about as good as runner-type games are ever going to get.","October 16, 2014","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game offers you three difficulty settings (so there's something for everyone) and each level has a checkpoint (which you can skip for bonus points).\n+ A good number of levels and collectibles.\n+ Unlike RUNNER, this game has a proper score system which allows for highscore hunting.\n+ Lots of customization.\n\n- Acquiring a Perfect+ on a level requires you to hit the bullseye on the Bonus Chance minigame. Which is pretty pointless. Why not earn it by skipping the checkpoint instead?\n- A tad too easy, even on Rather Hard.\n- Stupid humor to be found throughout the game (such as the level names "Tripping on Herbs" and "Sweaty Dangle". There's more.)\n\nBIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is a great spinoff of the BIT.TRIP games and might even be the best auto-runner game yet. It's actually one of those rare games I decided to get 100% completion on.\n\n8/10","February 7, 2014","true","29.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The game looks and sounds much better, and Runner2's gameplay seems more forgiving than its predecessor. Levels now have checkpoints, which could be entirely avoided if one so desires. The bonus retro levels, once found, can be completed without having to go thru the main level again. And the difficulty isn't quiet as intense as in RUNNER although it still offers 3 difficulty settings. One of which being "Rather Hard" which could still be challenging to any RUNNER veteran.\n\nThroughout some levels are hidden things like the Retro levels, additional characters, and keys & chests that unlock costumes. Those and aiming for Perfect+ in each of the 3 difficulties will have you replaying levels over and over again, easily spending much more time on this game than RUNNER.\n\nRunner2 comes definitely recommended, more so than RUNNER.","December 28, 2013","true","143.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The enemies, obstacles, and items throughout the stages all make music when defeating, dodgeing, or collecting them. It sounds pretty neat when you go through a stage having everything make sounds. The game is also pretty challenging, but there is a checkpoint around halfway through a stage that you can retry from if you fail a stage. This is probably the best game of this type of genre that I have played. There are tons of collectables, rewards, and things to unlock. The game itself will take around 6 hours to finish, but you can easily add at least 6 more hours if you go for all the unlockables.

With this installment, not only do these tropes continue, but with flair that the series has never attempted. This is the same old rhythm platformer you know, with more personality and accessibility; a refreshing step from the classic, and in my eyes, a damn good sequel. The new art style is a particularly welcome feature in my book. The visuals are very slick and aberrantly fitting. The music is encapturing, as one may expect from a BIT.TRIP game. The controls are responsive. Everything seems to mesh together well into a melting pot of skill, reflex, and sometimes, luck. This time around, the gameplay is expanded to make the experience more accessible. Hardcore rhythm challenge-seekers (or challenge-seekers in general) shouldn't worry; the difficulty is just as punishing as one would assume, it can simply be toned down. Casual players also are welcomed due to this, and that is why I would recommend the game to players of all types.

Runner 2 is essentially Adventure Time meets classic Super Mario Bros and Sonic Adventure series. Your character runs from left to right with the screen behind (you can't go back) and you aim to collect all the gold (similar to Sonic's coins) and multipliers.\n\nI really enjoyed this game ever since I got it and have been playing it as much as I can the moment after I got it AND had a controller to play it. There are very few games I want to 100% achievements on and this is definitely one of them.\n\nPros:\n1. Definitely an improvement from BIT. TRIP Runner 1 with simply having checkpoints.\n2. Really beautiful graphics and music.\n3. Mechanics are fun and difficulty isn't because of something cheap/cheating -- rather just a matter of timing (very doable)\n4. Easy controls for the controller.\n\nCons:\n1. I needed a controller to really progress through the game. I believe it is also HIGHLY recommended to have a controller for this game.\n2. The last world/part of the game gets rather difficult to distinguish between the level course, your character and the background. The complimentary colors and theme is waaaay too much.\n3. Perserverance and patience are crucial in this game as you *will* die and repeat a level multiple times for one reason or another (primarily to learn the mechanic of a boss, improper timing for a particular mechanic, or typicaly "I SWEAR I HIT THE BUTTON! and it doesn't happen scenario).","July 5, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's almost like the designers looked at what made old games great, put their own spin on it after dropping about 47 tabs of acid, and proceeded to vomit forth one of the most charming and enjoyable games I've ever played.\n\nI mean, ♥♥♥♥, there's a character named Hamburger Whetfahrt in it.

Functionally it serves as a kind of pure-reflex rhythm game, with musical themes which bear repeating and creative use of an xbox-style controller. The visual upgrade to faux three-dimensionality does not accompany floaty or imprecise controls as is so often the case – in fact, the sequel has even tighter controls than the first, and every obstacle is clearly delineated without interrupting the overall graphical style.\n\nPlaying BTR2 can be a soothing, cathartic experience, but with variable difficulty levels and lots of hidden secrets there are plenty of challenges floating beneath the surface. This game is perfect for gamers of any age and ability, so long as they can enjoy Katamari-style quirkiness and the sense of achievement that comes with well-honed reflexes.\n","March 4, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since this game is a directly numbered sequel, there are some similarities between the two games. One thing to note is the series's trademark pixelized art style is changed to a more stylized and cartoony look. Overall, the worlds are less brightly colored and flashy but still are trippy or weird in nature. The music is also not chiptune in nature, but still has the style of Bit.Trip to it. Some songs wil be familiar to those who played prior games like Runner, and the music is still electronica based. Most fans of the original Bit.Trip games might bemoan these changes, but they actually are a refreshing change and still carry the same kind of charm and style that makes this a Bit.Trip game. The story continues from the ending of Runner, with all of Commander Video's friends and Mingrawn Timbletot being in the cutscenes. However, Commander Video is sent into an alternate dimension and chases after Mingrawn Timbletot in this more cartoony dimension.\n\nThe gameplay naturally takes after Bit.Trip Runner. Players keep running and must dodge obstacles using several abilities. Runner 2 adds new objects in the levels to mix things up, such as a loop the loop, speed boosts, and rails. Additionally, the player has a few more abilities to use to navigate new obstacles. Included in every level are checkpoints that players will restart at if they hit an obstacle after that checkpoint. The checkpoint may be skipped to earn bonus points, but at the expense of starting from the beginning of the level if they mess up. Alternate paths are showcased more in the game, and even have signs showing which paths are easier or harder. The harder paths tend to give more points, but may also have a treasure chest to unlock costumes or even unlock a new level with an alternate exit. Some levels also have keys which must be activated first from a Key Vault level. The levels with keys then are to be replayed to unlock a padlock and get another treasure chest. The difficulty tends to be easier than Runner on the Just Right difficulty thanks to the checkpoints making levels more bearable and the difficulty curve not being too extreme like in the first game. Runner 2's Hard mode should give a challenging set of levels with a difficulty not unlike the previous Runner game. There are more levels overall in Runner 2, which should make this game longer than the 5 hours of gameplay expected in the first Runner game.\n\nBit.Trip Runner 2 might look a bit different in style to other Bit.Trip games, but this game is just as fun as the first Runner game. Runner 2 boasts more features in the gameplay and is a longer experience while having the signature Bit.Trip style to the game. With a fun cartoony style and a variety of levels with good music, different level designs, and more fair difficulty, Runner 2 is sure to be a great experience that gives challenges and different things to be expecting.","July 25, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The mechanics are expanded upon to further the depth of your interaction with the game. Dancing is possibly one of the best move mechanics added, being a purely optional mechanic that tests how well the player can plan out their actions for extra points. Levels are much better composed in terms of layout and rhythm, feeling much more thought out and rhythmically pleasing. The levels are much more consistent in length and difficulty, and the optional checkpoint system takes a lot of the more painful frustration out of playing while keeping the level still challenging. There are also multiple paths, marked with which path is harder or leads to an alternative exit. The sound effects that generate the random notes are much better sounding and match the key of the background music. While the game does build with difficulty, there are now three ACTUAL difficulty levels to Runner2, and a lot of the precise jumps are pushed to the collecting gold and hard mode instead of being forced to make those precise jumps in every mode. I personally like the ascetics of the world design and the more general electronica music. Also, the boss battles, which were the weakest part of the first Runner game, are very well done in Runner 2.\n\nThere are some problems Runner2 still has. The bonus game at the end of a perfect run is a bit contrived. It's very different from the rest of the game, and, if you mess up on it, will require you to play the entire level again if you are aiming for a Perfect+. At the end of most levels is a point of no return, where there is only gold and no hazards; if you miss any of the golds, you cannot hit yourself to restart at the checkpoint and are forced to reset to the beginning of the level. The secret retro levels are more well done but still only have the one level background, making them a bit repetitive to the eye. One of the level mechanics, the loop-de-loop, controls very differently if your are using a controller versus a keyboard; with a controller, you have to rotate a stick to point at Commander Video, but with a keyboard, all you have to do is mash the space bar, which is much less fun and possibly easier to achieve.\n\nNone of these problems should deter you from purchasing this game. I have had a very fun time with this and I hope you do too.","January 25, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scottacon/recommended/218060/","scottacon","Scottacon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scottacon/","449 products in account","An excellent sequel. It takes what was wrong with the first game and revamps it to make it more enjoyable.\n\nGameplay is simple to get a hold of, and the difficulty curve rises at a good rate. The three difficulty settings allow you to tailor your experience to how much of a challenge you're after, and the "Just Right" difficulty provided enough of a challenge for me to enjoy the game from start to finish. There is a good amount of incentive to replaying levels with unlockable characters and costumes as well as collecting Retro cartridges.\n\nThe biggest difference from the first game to this one is the addition of Checkpoints - and the best part about these is that they are optional. For someone like me, who grew rapidly frustrated with the first game, the addition of Checkpoints is a welcome change. For those who enjoy the challenge, you can simply jump over them for extra points rather than using them.\nAnother change is the implementation of multiple pathways, which is a neat idea but I always went for the "dangerous" route regardless - and I did not feel the need to go back and do another path unless there was an alternate exit or a hidden treasure. Both pathways lead to the end and have the same amount of gold, so unless there's a treasure there's not much point to making the choice other than, again, deciding how much of a challenge you want.\n\nVisuals are very aesthetically pleasing and the design for the menus, cutscenes, and world map are nice and consistent. Some of the character designs were a little -too- weird for my taste but for the most part they are fun and interesting. Sound is great; Charles Martinet does some great voiceover work and the music - as to be expected - is well-suited to the gameplay and easy on the ears.\n\nI highly recommend this game. It's a fun platformer with a neat twist that will easily fill some spare time.","April 24, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay is of a platforming-meets-rhythm persuasion, where your character runs forward at a fixed pace and you have to clear obstacles that spawn in time with the soundtrack. The soundtrack is gorgeous, by the way.\n\nBad at rhythm games? That's fine! Runner2 uses clear visuals with vivid colors to help you know exactly when you need to jump, duck, kick, block, or dance your way to victory, and it gives you the entire first world to become familiar with those mechanics. Bad at timing in general? That's also fine! There are three difficulty settings to give challenge for those who want a challenge, without the frustration for those who don't.\n\nThe Runner2 experience is that when you are doing well, you feel it. You are rewarded with pleasant changes in music, sound effects, and visuals. Your senses are bombarded with happy things, and you can't help but enjoy yourself. Unfortunately, when you perform poorly, you feel that as well. Stages that you just can't seem to get past are frustrating, though there is some satisfaction in finally figuring them out. There is no redemption, however, for the times that you stupidly mess up the very last step in a stage and have to start over. At least there's checkpoints this time around.\n\nIs this game for everyone? Pretty much yes, though maybe not at its original asking price. Buying this with the soundtrack was a good decision for me, but so was waiting for a sale. You can complete the story in 5-10 hours, with 100% completion taking closer to 20-30 hours. If you're a quantity-over-quality type person, wait for the price to drop down a touch. Otherwise, put on your running shoes and join Commander Video as he tries to reach the right side of the screen.","February 9, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is both good and bad as the previous game left more to the imagination and was arguably cleaner in presentation. This game however is technically superior and offers additional features that make it the superior product. The general gameplay consists of endless running punctuated by input commands which help you navigate obstacles on your way to the finish line. The game is part platformer and part music box as completing actions successfully plays a certain tune as each action or obstacle has a distinct sound.

Check points, retro cartridges, keys, chests, alternate routes, and some clever methods of varying scores have been added to the Bit.Trip formula.\n\nIf you're one of those people that strives to be number 1 on the leaderboards, then the developers have kept you in mind. You can now press the right trigger to do a short dance to gain some extra points in between obstacles. Loops have also been added that have you use the left analog stick to follow commander video to rack up more points. Keys and chests are also point modifiers. AND you can jump over a checkpoint (one of the greatest new additions in my opinion) to get a huge point boost.\n\nMy one big issue with the game is that it seems pretty pretentious. For some reason, the developers got Charles Martinet (the voice of Mario) to be the narrator. At the risk of sounding unprofessional, the first thing I thought when I found out about this was "okay...?" Sure he's a great voice actor and all, but the real issue here is that the game doesn't need a narrarator at all. To the game's detriment, story elements are added at the start of the game and between levels. Sadly, I care as much about the story presented here as the Angry Birds story. Both the story and humor (if you can call it that) both fall flat here. The game would have been much better if it just stuck to its roots. Running and jumping.\n\nWhether or not the game is worth $14.99 is highly debatable. I can say that I would never spend that much money on this game. However, I got it on sale for $1.19 during a Fall Steam sale. Needless to say, that was an excellent price for this game. If you can get it on sale for around $4.99, I'd say it's a must buy.

It also features really good and fitting voice acting this time.\n\nThe gameplay is largely the same. A couple of new moves have been added (like kicking while sliding), some levels have branching paths (with difficult paths offering more rewards like extra characters and costumes) and each level has a checkpoint in the middle that you can skip for bonus points.\n\nMy only very minor complaint is with the cannon minigame at the end of each level. It’s very easy to ruin a perfect run by missing the bullseye, forcing you to restart the level. Thankfully the game is so good that replaying a level isn’t a punishment.","August 14, 2014","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay is of a platforming-meets-rhythm persuasion, where your character runs forward at a fixed pace and you have to clear obstacles that spawn in time with the soundtrack. The soundtrack is gorgeous, by the way.\n\nBad at rhythm games? That's fine! Runner2 uses clear visuals with vivid colors to help you know exactly when you need to jump, duck, kick, block, or dance your way to victory, and it gives you the entire first world to become familiar with those mechanics. Bad at timing in general? That's also fine! There are three difficulty settings to give challenge for those who want a challenge, without the frustration for those who don't.\n\nThe Runner2 experience is that when you are doing well, you feel it. You are rewarded with pleasant changes in music, sound effects, and visuals. Your senses are bombarded with happy things, and you can't help but enjoy yourself. Unfortunately, when you perform poorly, you feel that as well. Stages that you just can't seem to get past are frustrating, though there is some satisfaction in finally figuring them out. There is no redemption, however, for the times that you stupidly mess up the very last step in a stage and have to start over. At least there's checkpoints this time around.\n\nIs this game for everyone? Pretty much yes, though maybe not at its original asking price. Buying this with the soundtrack was a good decision for me, but so was waiting for a sale. You can complete the story in 5-10 hours, with 100% completion taking closer to 20-30 hours. If you're a quantity-over-quality type person, wait for the price to drop down a touch. Otherwise, put on your running shoes and join Commander Video as he tries to reach the right side of the screen.","February 9, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is addictive, if a little repetitive. The content is solid, with 100 normal levels + a few retro ones, a bunch of different playable characters, mutliple difficulties, and collectibles!\n\nThe checkpoint, and having it optional, is a very good feature in Runner2.

The stage's are better and more fun, they have checkpoints you can take if you want to and it has a nice high score system where you see how your friends have done on the stages. The graphics are really pretty and I enjoyed them a lot. The music's decent.\nThe game's very simple because the characters run at a preset speed so you just need to avoid obstacles. For me that caused some focusing problems since I'm used to focusing on the character but here you need to focus on the stage. But it's no problem since it's probably because I'm autistic.\nIt took me 10 hours to complete on the normal difficulty but there's a lot of things to do if you want to 100% it. A lot of collectibles and extra stages and stuff like that.\nI'll give it a 7/10, worth your money but it's very simple and thus gets a bit boring at times, unlike other platformers where you're in charge of the characters movement.","July 3, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is an amazing game. IT is a straight upgrade from the original game, and it addresses most of the first game's faults, mainly difficulty. In the first game, if you got hit in a level, you would go all the way back to the start. In Runner 2, there are now checkpoints that save your progress after reaching the halfway point in the level. And this is where the game really shines. If you dont want to use checkpoints, or want that original Bit Trip feeling, you can jump over checkpoints and skip them, which even awards you bonus points for doing so. And if you find the game too easy, you can change the difficulty.\n\nIn terms of looks, Runner 2 is pleasing to look at. The graphics are pretty good, and the characters, backgrounds, environments, and objects are all very detailed, and they even interact with you ( enemy eyes will follow you as you jump\nover them). They are a little jagged here and there, but they are very easy to forget about.\n\nGameplay is very solid, and Runner 2 's gameplay is very similar to the first, with differences here and there, such as loop de loops. The game is a little hard to play on keyboard, just due to the way the keys are laid out and you cant change what key does what, but it is managable when you get used to it. The game takes plae where th first left off, and there are five worlds with a huge amount of levels. Each world has a sort of base music, but each individual level has a different remix of the song. Just like in the first, whatever you do in the level adds to the song playing( gold pieces are spaced so when you collect each one, it makes a tune that goes with the song) The game is easy to pick up, since you start out with just jumping, before the game introduces you to sliding, blocking, kicking, and many other features. It gets difficult as you go on, but if its too hard you can just turn down the difficulty. The game also has a lrge amount of replayability, some levels are locked until you have a certain amount of gold, or some lvels are locked until you beat the key vault.\n\nAll in all, a very fun platformer. If you enjoyed the first, then youll love the second.\n\n","December 11, 2013","true","39.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Runner games are typically reserved for casual game players and the overall colorful lightheartedness supports this. On the other hand the game seems to target old-school platformers with it's unerring demands and retro sections. It also seems to target that weird audience that thought Rayman's Raving Rabbids was the FUNNIEST THING with the awkward backgrounds, adult innuendos, and a sassy dancing hamburger person.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes it's serviceable for a runner, it basically boils down to a string of quick time events, but the levels are mostly ho-hum. The problem is there are a ton of levels with little variety and many sections get terribly repetitive. There are some levels, as well as boss battles, where you can see how everything could come together if really implemented well. Unfortunately the good ideas are watered down among so many levels, I would rather see half as many levels but more tightly defined and better designed.\n\nA large part of the game is the challenge of collecting all of the gold pieces within a level. It's an interesting diversion but with the aforementioned staleness of the levels I really stopped caring about 100% completion. All the gold is used for is unlocks of further levels (didn't I say there were too many already?) Add in that the developers have added other ways to get you replay levels (hidden keys, missing the target at the end, achievements that reward you for completing a level on all 3 difficulties!?) and the repetition goes through the roof. If there were fewer well designed levels I would care more about my score, practicing to get it -just right-, but the motivation just isn't there to do it again and again 100 times over. Even the leaderboard isn't much of a motivator as many scores seem to have been gained through exploitation and you would never get close by playing the game as intended.\n\nWith the constant repetition of levels the soundtrack gets old FAST. I can only platform to soothing jazz with timed bleeps for so long. Each world has essentially one song with slight variants as you play, I found the fire world to be the most engaging but the rest to be forgettable or slightly irritating. Alas with a game so focused on the tie-in with the music I would have hoped for more variety and higher quality.\n\nThere are other nit-picks here and there (inescapable intro, you can't remap buttons, it often errors when looking for leaderboards) but at the end of the day the biggest issue I have is with flow. With rhythm games it's all about getting "in the zone," letting the music take you as you enjoy a grand musical adventure. Games like Beat Hazard, Rock Band, or Rez have this in spades; you are moving on instinct becoming one with the music. Sadly this game rarely offered those moments often jarring me out if I started to get into it. Whether it was from the camera zooming in or out at odd times, the overly busy backgrounds creating unnecessary distractions, or the "one hit you die" mechanic taking me back to the start of the level due to questionable collision boxes, the game just wouldn't *let me enjoy it*.\n\nI really wanted to love this game but I've got to give it 1.5 out of 5 stars. There is a brilliant little soul hiding away somewhere in here but it is covered up by fluff and questionable design choices.","January 3, 2014","false","4.5"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

The art is beautiful, and it's nice to see that Gaijin can make a beautiful, non-retro game. The music is wonderful as always. The gameplay, though... I normally really love music games of all sorts, but the gameplay is incredibly frustrating. The levels still go on way too long, and they're pretty hard, even near the beginning, which means that you will end up re-doing the same parts of the same levels over and over. I don't think the first Runner has a checkpoint system, and that is definitely a welcomed addition to Runner 2, but it's not enough. This game is certainly challenging, but for me, it wasn't a fun challenge at all.\n\nThe keyboard controls are baffling. You can use the arrow keys and space bar, which I highly recommend over what they tell you the controls are.\n\nThe BIT.TRIP series is a cool experiment in rhythm games, but Runner, for me, was a failed experiment and I don't know why that's the game that got a sequel. If you liked Runner, you'll love Runner 2, but I can't endorse this game for anyone else.","January 11, 2014","false","0.9"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

Had a better difficulty curve so you weren't guaranteed PERFECTs for the first 15 levels. Checkpoints were kinder than the first game where you had to play the entire bloody level every time you even slightly cocked up but the checkpoints are still few and far between which is very annoying... Graphics made it a lot nicer and feel more alive. The cutscenes were irritating and the game would be better off without them but that doesn't make too much difference. The controls were very dodgy, and RETRO levels hurt your eyes like hell, and you couldn't see where gold was because of it being disguised with the background. Despite being better than the first one, that still doesn't make it good.","January 11, 2014","false","1.6"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

You're running along the stage, collecting clumbs of gold and other things to improve your score. I like the soundtrack a lot, and it is often syncronised for the moment you pick up gold. It is a nice touch. It also offers secret Retro levels and unlockable characters.\n\nHowever, even though the gameplay is a lot of fun, it has two very frustrating things that destroy the fun for me. It is a terrible PC game. I want to be able to configurate my own keyboard controls the way it works best for me, and not be forced to use a specific way of playing. It offers three different way to control with keyboard, but they are all clumsy to play with. I want to be able to spread my buttons, and this game does not allow me to do that. But I am sure if you got a controller, you will have a much better time.\n\nEven though you collect all the clumbs of gold and other collectibles on a level, you are not getting a perfect score unless you do a totally out of place minigame at the end of the level. Your character jumps into a cannon, a big target shows up, and you need to time it right and shoot yourself into the centrum of the target to receive the perfect score. If you miss, you are not getting a perfect score even though you collected everything, and you have to redo the entire level again to get to the mini game, and hopefully do better. I feel good about doing well on the level and have collected everything, but the mini game at the end is like a smack in your face. It is very demotivating to continue playing when it is like that.\n\nAllow me to configurate my keyboard controls like any other average, PC game allows you to, and get rid of the out of place mini game at the end of every freaking level so I can get the perfect score I am supposed to get when I collect everything. When the game has been fixed, I will recommend it a lot. It really is a lot of fun.","January 20, 2014","false","3.1"," 24 of 47 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","24","47","0","0"

With over 100 levels, dozens of unlockables, lovely visuals and a wonderful soundtrack this game is a really delight to play.\n\nThe premise is simple: get from one end of the level to the other in a free-flowing smooth run. But this game is not for the people who have slow reactions times or get frustrated easily. It is hard, and quite unforgiving. Repetition is going to happening in this game, but because of the quick reload and charming music, it's hard to feel put out.\n\nWhen you do get a great run going, it's fantastic. All the notes and melodies stiched together with your actions makes it a grand way to know you're doing well. Not to mention that it also helps timing your moments with the logical note progression.\n\nOver the multiple different worlds, there are retro levels, multiple paths and different bosses to change things up, and the dastardly combinations of different moments makes you really appreciate the level design - which may appear simplistic at times - but it very finely tuned.\n\nThis game is great in short bursts for those that don't have much time, it's great for those wanting a challenge, and especially if you like the recognition for seamlessly stringing together your levels and actions. Everything about this game screams that the developer cared about making their game. From the cutscenes narrated by Charles Martinet (who also does the voice for Mario) right down to the charming animations and fluid movement.\n\nThis game is something you should seriously consider purchasing, playing, loving and then realising that you have to do the whole game on all three difficulties and then all the extras and then costumes and then...","November 25, 2013","true","16.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Gaijin ditched the retro pixel-art look that had graced all their previous games in favor of improved, more modern visuals. While the old style definitely had some charm to it, the change is a very welcome one. The various backdrops are just beautiful. I've seen some people mention that the new art style can be too distracting, but so far it hasn't affected me negatively at all. The chiptune soundtrack is as catchy as ever and the game controls just perfectly; very responsive and accurate which makes getting into a good groove such a joy. I also like how Runner2 keeps the same basic rhythm-based gameplay from the original in tact while adding things like branching paths, cutscenes reminiscent of an old 50s serial, and a bunch of collectables to entice you to replay levels. It really does feel more like a full-featured game than the original.\n\nThere's also the addition of a checkpoint system and different difficulties to make the game more accessible to the novice/casual crowd. As someone who enjoyed the unrelenting nature of the original, I'm alright with this. Veterans can skip checkpoints entirely in favor of bonus points and bump the difficulty up from the onset to get the best challenge. It's a smart move by the developers and a win-win for everyone.\n\nIf you liked the original Bit.trip Runner, Runner2 is more of the same and then some. It's exactly what you'd want out of a sequel: It keeps the established gameplay in place while making some necessary and welcome improvements along the way. Even if you didn't like the original because of its difficulty, the more accessible nature could put Runner2 right up your alley.

Runner 2 is not plagued by the uneven and harsh splike in difficulty that upset so many in the first iteration. It has much more content than the original, it has three different difficulty levels to accomidate a player's skill set, and it also now has checkpoints. For those who relished the challenge of the first game...don't worry, the hard difficulty setting will give you everything you ask for, and you have the option to skip checkpoints for bonus points. The graphical style of this game is much different and does look quite a lot better...however I think I still have a preference for the way the first game looked. The game is also narrated by Charles Martinet who is best known for doing the voicework for Mario. I imagine this will be a plus for some and an annoyance to others. As with the first game, in my opinioin the music is also very good in Runner 2 and helps to keep pushing the player through those difficult spots. The biggest issue I have with the game is how some of the achievements are tied in with the bullseye minigame event that takes place at the end of each level (assuming you have collected all the gold pieces). I think the achievements should have been related to whether you chose to skip the optional checkpoint or not, and the minigame at the end should only have served as a mechanism to increase the player's score. At the end of the day it is a very good game that will give you about five to six hours on just a normal playthrough and probably twenty plus hours if you try to 100 percent the game.","December 1, 2013","true","22.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But when I played the first world, the background is too glare that I hardly see the obstacles and golds. It is very distracting to play. The background suppose to make the game more enjoyable not the opposite. The green cucumber that shows up when I reach checkpoint is distracting as hell. I can't play this game for too long cause it hurting my eye in the long run.\n\nThe soundtracks are quite nice. You have few characters to play and customizes costume. There are also secret level to discover on some stages. Game play is ok, not too hard or easy, in the balance. Its getting repetitive when you tried to hit the perfect highest score which you need to collect every golds, skip the checkpoint and finally hitting the red center on canon.\n\nI think this game miss an important thing in platform game which is momentum of jumping. Like most platform game, the faster you run, the more far u jump.

But when I played the first world, the background is too glare that I hardly see the obstacles and golds. It is very distracting to play. The background suppose to make the game more enjoyable not the opposite. The green cucumber that shows up when I reach checkpoint is distracting as hell. I can't play this game for too long cause it hurting my eye in the long run.\n\nThe soundtracks are quite nice. You have few characters to play and customizes costume. There are also secret level to discover on some stages. Game play is ok, not too hard or easy, in the balance. Its getting repetitive when you tried to hit the perfect highest score which you need to collect every golds, skip the checkpoint and finally hitting the red center on canon.\n\nI think this game miss an important thing in platform game which is momentum of jumping.

I was surprised when I fell into a game cartridge and was transported to an old school bonus round, which added a bit of difficulty to a level that I had been so far breezing through.\n\nOverall, this is a great game even if you haven't played the original. Actually, at this point, I would sort of recommend not playing the original unless you want to be filled in on the story or you want an additional challenge. Even though the story picks up from where the previous game left off, all you really need to know is that you are a cool little dude running through the brightly built world.\n\nAs a side note, as other reviewers have stated... no, you don't actually need the sound to play. It helps a lot, though. Rather than thinking too hard about precise timing, you can use some quick thinking skills and figure out when you should press buttons. Oh, and from now on I will be referring to pickles as 'garden sausages'.","December 4, 2013","true","34.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a fast paced runner game where the music really immerses you deeper in their universe. It is easy to pick up and play - and the game does a great job of introducing new moves and mechanics the deeper you get in the game. Bit Trip trains you well slowly and by the end of the game you feel like a pro!\n\nMusic! Every world and level has unique music - but what really stands out is every time you collect something - it feels like it is to the beat. The more you collect - the better the music and you end up having even more fun!\n\nFrustration factor is ZERO, but that does not mean it isn't challenging. There are multiple difficulty levels so you can still feel challenged - but not once did I want to throw a controller because of wonky gameplay design or controls. It is a smooth experience from start to finish.\n\nLength! There is 5 unique worlds with about 15-20 levels per world. You can unlock new characters and go into a few secret 8bit worlds. You will not be disappointed by the length of the game - and at no point does it begin to feel overly repetitive.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you are looking for phenomenal music and stunning art. It is a running game with great controls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doubleplayer/recommended/218060/","doubleplayer","DoublePLayer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doubleplayer/","2142 products in account","This is a fantastically made game. It's a very good entry to the BIT.TRIP series and it's also a great example of how the sequels should look like. Even though this game is more of a spin-off to the original BIT.TRIP series, but that's a small detail. One thing must be said, if you didn't enjoy the first RUNNER, do not fret, as this game's difficulty curve is much more sane. The difficulty is controllable with three settings to choose which change the amount of obstacles in levels by quite a bit, unlike its precedessor, where it only removed gold bars on easy and enforced perfection on hard.\nBIT.TRIP RUNNER 2's story takes place right after RUNNER 1 as Commander Video gets zapped into a different dimension while chasing after the vile Timbletot. All of the cutscenes that expose the plot to the player are narrated by one and only Charles Martinez, the legendary voice of Mario, as such they're done quite well both visually and in terms of voice acting, though they're not the main focus of the game.\nThe player's objective in BIT.TRIP RUNNER 2 is to guide the ever running Commander Videothrough quite a number of levels, 70 plus 25 secret levels. You can't stop the character in place whatsoever which is part of the challenge as you have to deal with obstacles thrown at you on the fly. Asides from such prude actions like jumping and kicking you can also dance which is a neat risk-reward action as when you dance, you can't do any other actions for half a second, but every time you do it, you get points. All of the levels, asides from the secret ones, have their own leaderboard and you can compare yourself to the world's finest and your friends which is a cool feature that makes you replay the levels trying to get the highest score. There's a tiny issue with this though, as the leaderboards from all the difficulties are combined. This causes a problem as on some levels you can get a much higher score by perfecting it on the hardest of difficulties while on others it's better to just choose 'easy' and dance through most of the level as there's a nigh negligible amount of obstacles.\nI mentioned gold bars earlier but there's also more collectibles to find such as + thingies that look like the core from BIT.TRIP CORE that make your mode go up. You start every level at Hyper and ascend to Mega, Super, Ultra and finally Extra. The modes change a couple of things, first of all the music changes a bit every time from getting more instruments to a very mellow and melodic state on Extra. Secondly, the character will start getting some stars going from their back finishing on a cape on Extra, as Commander Video gets a 'Rainbow' cape which doesn't have the necessary seven colors but it's pretty in its own right. The least visible change is the scoring as the modes work as a multiplier system.\nThe game's difficulty is done in a very good way, some levels are not linear as you get to choose if you want to go the easier or the harder path and all of the levels have a checkpoint, that you can go through to do its job of becoming your new starting point when you slip up or you can jump over to get a hefty score bonus but at the risk of starting the level all over again if the player makes a mistake. The secret levels are much better done in terms of difficulty than in RUNNER 1 as they never use patterns that are either first shown in later levels or just plain don't appear outside of a singular secret level. Every single one of them tests what you should have learned by playing the regular game. Not to mention you have three tries as opposed to one and you can go back to it from the world map at any time.\nThe worlds are littered with gold bars which allow you to access some of the harder levels and possibly unlock Commander Video's friends or costumes. They don't bring any change to the gameplay, but they're there to enjoy the levels. Like I mentioned before, some of the levels are totally skippable as you only have to go down a path that's shown to you on the world's map. Every world has its own boss too, which are quite cleverly done as they never change the rules of the game but bring their ways of hindering your progress.\nThe graphics are quite stylish and very well done, although I can see why someone would just avoid the game due to its uniqueness. The backgrounds with their little details, the little faces on the stop signs which you have to kick, RUNNER 2' numerous details are quite amazing to look at if a bit hard considering the nature of the game, some of the details you might be able to see only by looking up videos from the game, as BIT.TRIP RUNNER 2 doesn't have a replay system. Some might complain about the animations as Commander Video instantly goes from running to sliding or kicking but I assume it's done in that way as to not confuse when you're in the necessary state to overcome the rapidly incoming obstacle. The secret levels themselves are done in a 16-bit style including the Commander Video that's known from the earlier games in the BIT.TRIP series.\nThe music is fantastic in this game which is not a surprise considering it's a BIT.TRIP game although it might get a bit repetitive to some people as there are two tracks per world that the game switches between so on 1-1 you'll get Track A, 1-2 gives you Track B and then Track A makes its return in 1-3, and so on. This is alleviated through the mode changes as you get more meat out of one track. The secret levels get their own tracks per world which are made in a retro way, just like their graphics.\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game to the point where I would buy any DLC with new levels the moment it came out as I seriously would want more. Seriously though, if you're scared of this game because of RUNNER 1, try it out at someone else's place as the game unfortunately doesn't have a demo that I'm aware of.","November 28, 2013","true","27.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You get your moneys worth playing it on the easier difficulties, but it is the semi OCD completionist mindset that this game really comes alive. Three difficulties for every level across five worlds requiring to play a game at luck after each level to see if you can move on or not will definitely have you ripping out your hair for that perfect 100%. It is the reason why this game took me 61 hours spread across two years to complete. This game has alot of intersting mechanics that keep the game fun and interesting such as the retro mode and multiple pathways aswell as beautiful scnery unique to every level. I enjoyed all of it up until the final world when it became repetitive and seemed unoriginal with the sky being a set image not moving. However I am just nitpicking my complaints.\nThe bullseye mechanic however it total rubbish in my opinion and has frustrated me to the extent that I had to replay the final level 9 times on the hardest difficulty to finally 100% the game. What is a bullseye you ask? Well the bullseye is if you perfect the level (as in get every gold piece aswell as upgrade) you have the chance to shoot yourself out of a cannon onto a dart board. To fully complete the level you have to get it right in the centre, which is a pain. If you fail this you have to replay the entire level nomatter how difficult it was because as a completionist you cannot get the achievement for 100% the game without doing this in every level. Seriously guys.\n\nIf however you don't plan on getting 100% you will find this game extremely enjopyable and vivid with life in a world wich emmerses you and is a gernerally feel-good game. Brilliant job guys. Truly.","September 25, 2014","true","61.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is the direct sequel of BIT.TRIP Runner, that i enjoy playing more than the original. This sequel contains more than 100 levels, a lot of costumes to unlock, it also has access to the glorious 'retro' levels, the 8-Bit era! The biggest different between Runner 2 and the original would be the visuals, Runner 2 has very colorful and beautifully levels.\n\nOne of the things that most players ask was a middle checkpoint on this game, personally i don't see the point of adding a checkpoint on this game but the devs did make some players wish come true. You know have the chance to go throw, but if you pass the checkpoint you won't get some points, so you have two chances, either pass the checkpoint and be safe next time you miss the floor or don't go throw the checkpoint and gain some extra points.\n\nMy only complain would be the motion blur on this game, at least for me causes lot of headaches and dizziness, only if the game had a option to turn it off would be much better.\n\nIn case you are looking to something addictive, fun, was to test your skills, well Runner 2 is strongly recommend to you!\n\n~ 7.5/10","January 26, 2014","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The first reason is that this game is really, really badly optimised. It stutters and gets below 10 FPS on a computer that is used for playing Assassins Creed Unity and Call of Duty Advanced Warfare. The second reason is the bad ... jumping? The game is rythm orientated, ok, but what is in rythm is the guy that runs and the things he runs through. The player however have to press the button right before the rythm kicks which makes the game frustrating to play. The place where you have to press the button to jump successfull is so small and so close to the obsticle that you miss 80% of the times and yes you have to do the whole level again.\n\nAnd at last and not least is the music. It is just ... bad. It's ok for 5 - 10 minutes but then you just want to stuff cheese in your ears.\n\nThis game is bad and if you want a casual game to play ... this is not it.\n\nI boght it for 1.19 euro and it is too much for this game.

The chararcters and costumes have a funny looking texture too. The landscapes are great. My favouite world was the 5th (BIT.TRIP)\n\nSounds/Music[9/10]: Scenario-fitting music and sounds. Sometimes really calm, sometimes really speedy. And the sounds are just great. Really good job.\n\nStory[5/10]: I think the story could've been better. It was a little dull to me. I didnt really knew what was going on. Make the 3rd game's story better :).\n\nGameplay[6/10]: For my side, I've played with the keyboard, since I don't have a controller and oh man.... It was really bad. I've always mixed up the buttons(A,S,D,W,H,J,K) and it was not fun. I can only blame myself for it, I will buy a new controller. But in the end I've experienced the controls. I'd say though the moves were pretty nice, and it was a lot of fun playing it. The obstacles had a nice variety, too\n\nUniqueness[8/10]: I think you can't be indifferent with this game. You either love it, or you either hate it. And this virtue gives it a really nice feel.\n\nDifficulty[2/10]: This is one of if not the hardest games I've ever played. I might be a n00b, but sometimes i had a really big struggle playing it on QUITE EASY gamemode. It isn't unfinishable though. I feel SMB is easier than this ;-;.\n\nCharacters[10/10]: Very nice variety of characters. I died at the costume called "F♥♥♥ing Turkey Suit". Has more than 20 costumes which you can choose from. Has 7 unique characters. It's really funny.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros:\n+character and costume variety\n+beautiful and funny landscapes and graphics\n+lots of unique moves\n+lots of unique obstacles\n+collectable things\n+funny gamemodes\nCons:\n-hard bosses\n-hard difficulty\n-sometimes repeatable landscapes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall[8/10]: I think you should try it out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/recommended/218060/","ejbspeed","Pywackett-Barchetta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/","340 products in account","When you boot up this game, it immediately charms you with a clever little "brought to you by" screen that changes sponsors each time you play, and wonderful narration by Charles Martinet. Wonderful narration that quickly becomes a jumble of important-sounding terms in what I guess is supposed to be humorous, but which sadly sums up the experience itself: a jumble.\n\nPeople praise the art style. Personally, I find it really, really creepy. I found myself avoiding checkpoints lest I get the image of the living, seemingly-drunk pickle man standing there burned into my brain, and then it turns out jumping over checkpoints makes him angry and he chases after you, so that doesn't help. Outside of the game and on the menus, though, the game is a treat for the eyes. Or it would be, if it didn't stop for a plain black loading screen upon every single button press.\n\nWhere it actually matters, though, is the gameplay, and that's why I'm giving this a thumbs down, not any of the petty stuff above. First, it seems simple. Run, jump. It's classic. Then they add sliding. Okay, this works. Then they add kicking, and springing, and spinning, and bouncing, and dancing, and it all becomes a confusing, frustrating mess as you try to amble your way through even the first world without being bombarded with eighty new button presses to memorize. Any time you hit an obstacle, you are forced to watch the game drag your character back to the start/checkpoint, a simple addition that feels like a cruel, merciless taunt after a while, as if to say "now you have to do all this again because you missed this stair!"\n\nSimple stairs remain insanely difficult even before the game piles on this stuff. It's already hard. It just feels brutal in a way that isn't fun. One twist I very much like is being able to get a much higher score by taking a risk and actually dodging the checkpoint. This is rather creative, and puts some high stakes on the affair really quickly. However, if you do manage to get every gold piece and red plus throughout the level for a perfect score, then wait, no, you don't have a perfect score yet! Time for a cannonball minigame! And if you don't hit the bullseye, it doesn't count and you have to do the whole level again to try again!\n\nIt tries, it really does. But it feels quite often like this game doesn't want you to have fun. Just when it hits a good stride, it finds a way to undo it. The rhythm aspect doesn't even fit, as the music sort of plays out of time with the actual level and regardless of what you're doing. So this is a game, yes, but I have no idea who it's for.","June 23, 2014","false","2.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It adds nothing to the game. They also added a cannon minigame at the end for much the same reason.\n\n7.) The mechanics that are introduced never do anything.

Runner was my favorite in the series but was relentlessly hard, even early on. Runner 2 fixes these issues by making levels more fluid and by adding a checkpoint halfway through. The game is mostly the same, but with added obstacles and better graphics.\n\nThe game plays roughly the same as the last one. Watch Commander Video and his pals run to the right while you jump kick and dance your way to the end of the level. Some added obstacles are a four-way diamond that you need to press the corresponding button when you get to each corner. Another obstacle is a loop-de-loop that you use the right analog stick to follow your character as he runs inside. Various obstacles are introduced as the game progresses and by the end you need to be quick and have all these memorized as soon as they pop up. I actually never felt overwhelmed by having to remember too many abilities, it felt just right. Levels have you ducking, jumping, using your shield to block flying blocks, kicking stop signs, and even kicking some in the air as well as while sliding. The abilities are timed to a catchy 8-bit soundtrack that is even better and richer than the last game. As you move along there are gold bars to collect as well as red plus blocks that add track to the music as you move along.\n\nThese elements are what everyone loved in the first game and they stayed in this one, but the game is just more forgiving. Honestly it was more fun because I never even got to the second level in the first game. Runner 2 features bosses at the end of each level that are pretty fun and very challenging. There’s a new path feature for levels that change the difficulty depending on which path you choose. Red and green arrows will point to which path is which, the red path usually has hidden chests that unlock costumes as well as Retro Cartridges. These 25 retro levels are actually in 8-bit like they were ripped straight from an NES game. Very charming and fun to play.\n\nYou are also scored by doing everything in the game. Dancing is one ability that adds 2,000 points with each move. I just found the whole game very addicting and couldn’t put the controller down. Rarely did I find a spot where I was stuck and even rarer were occasion where the game’s own design got in the way. I would fly by something so fast that I would die several times before realizing what was going on and what I had to do. The whole game is just super fun and challenging and very rewarding. If you get all the gold bars and the 4 red plus signs in the level you get to shoot yourself out of a cannon at a target to get a Perfect+ score. Very challenging but fun.\n\nThe graphics look amazing with each of the 5 levels being unique. My favorite was The Bit.Trip which was level 5. You can see other Bit.Trip games being played in the background as you run along. My biggest disappointment were the lack of extra characters. There are 5, but what about Super Meat Boy and other characters from the last game? I wanted more honestly. The PC version at least gets a little extra flair with depth of field and slightly better lighting effects. This is just one artistically stunning game.\n\nOverall, Runner 2 keeps what everyone loved in the last game and adds a lot more depth and more layers of fun while being more forgiving. There are lots to collect and a ton of challenges to complete while you play. There are a few levels that were hampered by their own design flaws, and I just wish there were more unlockable characters.\n\n--Score: 9/10","November 25, 2013","true","11.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I hope the sequel is easier than this"? Conversely, did you play BIT.TRIP RUNNER and think "This is too easy. Please give me harder levels"? If you fell into either of these categories, then BIT.TRIP Runner2 is the game for you. If not, you probably didn't play BIT.TRIP RUNNER and you are missing out on a lot. You're probably wondering "But wait! How can a game be both easier and harder than its predecessor?" Good question. 10 points for you. We'll get to that later though. The original BTR was a 2D-8-bit-side-scrolling-obstacle-adventure game which incorporated rhythm-based platforming. Obscenely challenging, the game from Gaijin was played by a relatively small audience, but almost universally appreciated by its players. Cut to 2013, and its successor is released, in a more beautiful, elegant and dynamic form; Bit Trip Runner 2 (or BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien).\n\nOn the surface, a game is, basically, a set of graphics, sounds and controls. The better a game can balance and sustain these elements, the better it will be, fundamentally. In all of these areas, BTR2 shines; it differentiates from the last game in the graphics sphere, upgrading to a 2.5D look with fluid motion from the characters and beautiful environments which are illustrated in a style which is similar to that of comics. All of the animations are still reminiscent of the arcade style, but have been modernized with smooth textures and motion paths (although there are still 8-bit bonus levels, likely as a tribute to the rest of the Bit.Trip universe). In terms of audio, the soundtrack is where all of the Bit.Trip games shine; in BTR2, the chiptune style of previous games has been mostly abandoned, with a huge range of acoustic and electronic instruments being used. However, the drum tracks remain in the chiptune style, which characterizes the game as one with arcade influence, but (again) modernizes it. The controls of BTR2 are largely similar to the last Runner title; however, many players claim that it is much smoother with a gamepad. Personally, I prefer a keyboard, but it does seem that gamepad support is much more optimized for BTR2 than the original BTR.\n\n\nYou may recall earlier, when I mentioned the fact that BTR2 is both more difficult and easy than its predecessor. This is due to a couple of core game mechanic changes which have been incorporated in the newest installation in the series; for instance, there is now a checkpoint between the "Mega" and "Ultra" stages of each level (roughly halfway), which makes the game much less forgiving of late-level mistakes (a feature that was much desired by first time players of the infamous 1-11, or "Odyssey"). Furthermore, the courses themselves appear to be slightly easier. However, there are some features which make the game much more difficult; for a start, you are required to collect every gold bar on every level to advance to the next world, which was not compulsory in BTR. Furthermore, you are granted bonus points for jumping over checkpoints, so if you wish to compete in any way against your friends list (which has an integrated leaderboard that pops up at the beginning of each level), then taking the checkpoint is a poor decision. Finally, the inclusion of dancing adds an element of time management into the game, forcing you to try to suck as many points as possible out of this small animation, but not go for a millisecond too long and force an error, and the new obstacles which require you to jump and slide at the same time require much better timing than any other obstacle in the game.\n\n\nIn BTR2, you play as a character named Commander Video, whose apparent skill in consistently running, jumping, sliding, blocking and punching appears to have landed him within a hastily written story which somehow incorporates excessive obstacle courses into some sort of adventure. It is a captivating, heart-wrenching story which touches on themes of accepting the outsiders; the unwanted members of society. However, you're wasting your time if you play only as Commander Video, despite his well-written backstory and emotional struggles; there are a grand total of 8 playable characters, each one more interesting and enjoyable than the last. The greatest of these characters is Unkle Dill, a green alien who has various ridiculous costumes, such as a nerd outfit and a farmers' outfit, and appears to be under the influence of an extremely broad range of depressants at all times. If there was but one reason to play this game, it is Unkle Dill alone.\n\n\nThere are a hugely large amount of video game styles in this world, and in a medium of media which is largely dominated by military FPS titles and random fantasy RPGs, it is absolutely refreshing to play something as different and varied as the arcade/modern rhythm hybrid that is BTR2. Despite the reskin of the characters and environments and the new soundtrack style, the game manages to stay true to the Bit.Trip franchise to an extreme level. Furthermore, the beautiful graphics and encapsulating soundtrack make the unforgiving madness of the game much less frustrating than the barebones angerfest that was Bit.Trip Runner. The bottom line is, for a petty price of $15, the game is completely worth it, even just for something to look at. If even this is out of your budget, a Steam sale or Humble Bundle is bound to come along which will give you the game for pennies. Either way, it is an absolute must-own, and is one of the most enjoyable and interesting titles that have been released recently.\n\n9/10","November 30, 2013","true","7.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Therefore, there can be no such thing as an "objective review". Anyone who claims otherwise is simply lying and is purposefully being deceptive.\n\nSo with that in mind, the following is simply a description of my subjective experiences with this game. It is arranged in broad categories in order to help the reader look at what they care about in games.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDOES IT WORK / BUGS / GLITCHES\n------------------------------------\nI play on Linux, and the game runs excellently without bugs or glitches almost all the time.\n\nSometimes, however, the game causes my PC to hang and gets stuck in a loop. This bug hasn't been fixed since I bought the game a few months ago, which I think is careless on the part of the developers.\n\nAnother consistent bug I have observed is errors in Leaderboard rankings at the start of each level. They often tell me that I am offline, while I simply am not.\n\nOther than these rare or minor problems, I find the game to be a very well polished piece of software.\n\nGRAPHICS / VISUAL ART\n-------------------------\nWhile this game is nothing groundbreaking in terms of graphics or visual effects, it has a very unique visual art style that might be described as cartoony and wacky.\n\nAs you proceed through the game, the visual art style, especially the environment, changes to match the progression of the game's minimal storyline. Not only does this keep things interesting, it is also successful in altering mood and affects you emotionally, providing context for the game to a small extent. Similar variation in the playable character's visuals are also a nice aspect of the game, which encouraged me to unlock as many of them as I could.\n\nOne major problem I had with this game's visual art style is that I found it difficult to concentrate with so many things happening on the screen. Some objects, when destroyed, fly all over the screen blocking your view. In a game where split second reactions to what is coming next is so important, this is frustrating and often irritating. This is especially true in the last level, where the visual art style is intentially pixelated while being 3D at the same time.\n\nAUDIO ART STYLE\n-------------------\nThis is one of the few games where music is actually a driving force in gameplay. The music helps in pacing, in making you move forward, in having fun and especially adds to the soothing effect the game has on you overall.\n\nSTORYTELLING\n----------------\nThis game has a very minimal storyline which is essentially a placeholder to guide the player through the levels and gives a minor sense of purpose. This game isn't about a story.\n\nGAMEPLAY / GAME DESIGN / IS IT FUN\n----------------------------------------\nOverall, I think this is the game's strongest point, and intentionally so. It succeeds in making you want to play it for long amounts of time, while wanting to finish all levels and complete challenges.\n\nThis is primarily due to the surprising amount of depth in the game's level design that constantly challenges you by trying to pull you out of your comfort zones. In some levels, you can almost hear the developers laughing in glee as you try to get past a particularly unnaturely placed obstacle which makes you learn new ways to react to it.\n\nThe way the game's obstacles sync up with the music and the overall "speed" of the game makes it a very pleasant experience. I often found myself wanting to play this game when I wanted to relax. This was surprising because the gameplay is the complete opposite of "relaxed".\n\nVALUE FOR MONEY\n--------------------\nThe amount of entertainment this game has provided me was well worth the price. I recommend it especially if you are looking for some simple gameplay-oriented entertainment.\n\nVERDICT\n---------\nIf you are looking for a gameplay-focused game with good design that challenges you and provides entertainment through visuals and music, I recommend this game highly.\n\nIf you are mainly looking for a story, this game doesn't have much to offer.\nIf you get bored/frustrated by timing-based gameplay requiring split-second reactions to lots of obstacles, this game can be very irritating.\n\nOn the other hand, if you get obsessive about completing levels and challenges, this is a great game for you.\n\nPlease note that this game does not play well with keyboards, and you need a controller to enjoy it to full extent.","November 30, 2013","true","15.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/recommended/218060/","techbane","Techbane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/","875 products in account","The Bit.Trip games are all pretty polarizing. Runner seems to have the most notoriety of the series, probably because as a platformer it's theoretically the most accessible, yet in practice it's a complete exercise in masochism. Runner 2 (mostly) ditches the deeply ingrained faux-retro look of its predecessor, makes the bonus stage system less horrible, and adds functional difficulty settings and a midway point to each level to somewhat mitigate the frustration factor. If you weren't a fan of the original, though, I wouldn't expect this to change your mind.\n\nDespite checkpoints the levels are still just as finicky, the game now utterly botches its tutorializing of the keyboard controls (protip: use the arrow keys and spacebar, not WASD and J), and regardless of which graphical style the game uses it still seems overly 'busy' and can be unnecessarily hard to focus on the elements that you have to to be able to play well.\n\nIn brief I'm really lukewarm on both games, but this one does have Charles Martinet voicing the narrator of the game's plot which is presented as a corny homage to old Saturday morning cartoons. So it's got that going for it.","October 5, 2013","true","1.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

First, the game is sickeningly hipster, which would be find if the soundtrack didn't also become a casualty. Its the same music from the first game, reworked to be on an apple television commercial. Its worse.\n\nThere's also a small (but massively noticable if you played the original) control lag in the new content.. No idea why, i can only guess its related to the animations. What's really nuts is gaijin haven't forgotten how to make razor sharp responsive controls, the retro bonus stage is exactly the controls from the original.\n\nThe last problem i have is difficulty balancing in the sequel.. in the original, both finishing the levels and getting all the gold bricks were tied to the curve.. ie, if you had the skill to finish it, you could nearly always collect all the gold bricks. Here, they've made it stupidly easy to finish a level, but to compensate, made getting all the bricks more of an exercise in memory, which is a real cheap way to get replayabilty.\n\nDamn hipsters :)","December 16, 2013","false","1.4"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rulsat/recommended/218060/","Rulsat","RLST","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rulsat/","247 products in account","EN/PT-BR\nI can't really say I enjoyed this. The first Runner's charm (or even the original Bit.Trip series charm as a whole) was the combination of simplicity and insanity. The art style was simple, the music was simple and enjoyable, the commands were simple and difficulty grew on chaotically (though in a seemingly natural way). Runner 2's mistake is all of this. The art style is fancier, but forgettable; the music is tiringly repetitive (excluding the third world's - Supernature's - themes); the commands try to be unnecessarily a little bit more complicated; and difficulty by level design doesn't make you feel like you're being challenged. Actually, the few more challenging parts are so misplaced that you feel like "finally I beat it, I was getting bored" instead of "hell yeah! I DID it!" Moreover Charles Martinet's narration, albeit short, isn't as brilliant as you'd expect. Also the game fails when it tries to be funny - yep, I'm talking about the costumes and the dance moves.\nOverall the game isn't bad. It just feels like just another game you'll forget soon, or worse, like a ripoff of the original Runner instead of its sequel. I definitely can't say I recommend it.\nGive it a shot, though, if it has at least a 70% discount. Otherwise, stick to the originals and you'll save some good bucks.\nScore: 5/10\n\nEu não posso dizer que eu gostei de verdade desse jogo. O charme do primeiro Runner (ou mesmo o charme de toda a série Bit.Trip original) era a combinação de simplicidade e insanidade. A arte era simples, a música era simples e agradável, os comandos eram simples e a dificuldade crescia caoticamente (mas de uma maneira que parecia natural). Runner 2 peca em todos estes aspectos. A arte é mais trabalhada, mas é esquecível; a música é cansativamente repetitiva (exceto pelos temas do terceiro mundo, Supernature); os comandos tentam desnecessariamente ser um pouquinho mais complicados; e a dificuldade através do level design não faz com que você se sinta desafiado. Na verdade as poucas partes mais complicadas são tão mal distribuídas que você se sente "até que enfim consegui vencer, já tava de saco cheio" ao invés de "AE ♥♥♥♥♥, CONSEGUI". Além de tudo, a narração do Charles Martinet, mesmo que curta, não é tão brilhante quanto você esperaria. E o jogo fracassa quando tenta ser engraçado - sim, tô falando das fantasias que cada personagem pode usar e das danças.\nNo geral o jogo não é ruim. Você só sente como se ele fosse mais um jogo qualquer que será esquecido rápido ou, pior, como se ele fosse uma cópia do Runner original ao invés de sua sequência. Eu definitivamente não posso dizer que o recomendo.\nMas experimenta, se for o caso, se ele estiver com tipo uns 70% de desconto. Caso contrário, fique com os originais e você vai ter poupado uma grana boa.\nNota: 5/10","January 31, 2015","false","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is the sequel to the needlessly difficult BIT.TRIP RUNNER. Luckily, this game is twice as easy and has twice the charm.\n\nRunner 2 is a side-scrolling platformer which scrolls for you - you just have to dodge all the perilous obstacles in the way by a series of key or button presses. If you get hit, you get sent to the beginning (or checkpoint) of the stage. It can be frustrating, yes, but holy hell you have not seen frustrating until you have played the original RUNNER.\n\nRunner2 aims to fix the difficulty issues that the original had. For starters, there are now three difficulty levels - easy, normal, and hard. Playing at a harder or easy difficulty will not have any penalty on your scores, which is welcome for those new to the game. Also, there are checkpoints mid-stage so you don't get sent ALL the way back when you However, you can opt to skip the checkpoints for a point boost, but you obviously run the risk of being sent all the way to the beginning when you die.\n\nThe game's visuals are bright, colorful, and have a lot of charm to them. For the first time ever in a BIT.TRIP game, the game is rendered in a full 3D environment without any Atari-inspired graphics. A welcome change, in my opinion. The game's music is fantastic, and even has music by chiptune artist Disasterpeace for the retro levels. And did I mention that the game has narration by Charles Martinet? I swear to god this game has everything.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff to do in Runner2. You have three difficulty levels, gold pieces in every level, retro levels that have to collect and then play, characters, achievements, and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting about. You will spend a lot of time in Runner2 if you're aiming to 100% the game, which is quite worth it.\n\nIn conclusion, Runner2 is one of those sequels. A sequel that improves on nearly everything that the original has, and more. I heartily recommend Runner2, and it is well, well worth your time.","December 16, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, go ahead and save yourself a few bucks by picking up BIT.TRIP Complete because you're going to want the other games eventually anyhow."\n\nBIT.TRIP Presents Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is a fantastically fun, beautifully constructed, musically catchy, and perfectly balanced challenge for gamers of all shapes/sizes/skill levels.  In my opinion, there were only a few ways that Gaijin Games could've improved on the formula that made the original BIT.TRIP.RUNNER such a massively fun and soul-crushingly addictive experience.  A) Add an optional mid-level checkpoint for those of us who have a rage-quit tendency, B) polish the graphics and improve the contrast between character/obstacles/background, and C) create a more stand-alone story and game experience by improving the corrolation between the worlds/levels, making their visual appeal and location-specific music stand out from each of the others, and spread these ideas throughout the game menus/maps/etc.\n\nAll of these ideas and so much more were applied to Runner2, and I can't recommend it enough.  This game has provided hours upon hours of laughter and massive fun for me and the rest of my family/friends.  Given the price point that it's at even when it's NOT on sale, I'd say it's an absolute no-brainer.  Thank you, Gajin Games!!!","June 22, 2014","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As an auto-runner, gameplay is fast-paced, demanding quick reflexes to avoid obstacles.\n\nRunner 2 is significantly easier than its predecessor, Bit Trip, which was punishing from the very beginning and had a somewhat steep learning curve. Runner 2 does a great job gradually introducing new mechanics into the mix and the difficulty level can be easily adjusted to your play style. Checkpoints can also be skipped for the reward of extra points as well. The 3D graphics also allow for asthetics and camera angles that were not possible in the first game.\n\nGameplay does not seem to be repetitive, at least not yet. I have just started World 5 and I'm still enjoying the game. For those looking to 100% games, there's lots of replay value in collecting all the gold and achieving perfect on each level, as well as finding the secret retro stages and unlocking all the costumes and characters.\n\nI can't think of any major flaws, but the color palette for World 4 is a bit strong. Trying to focus while staring at the bright red color scheme is a bit hard on the eyes.\n\nOther than that, I highly reccommend Runner 2, especially if you're into platformers, rhythm games, or platorming rhythm games.","December 26, 2013","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is like half a second delay from the moment you press a button and the character reaction to it. It is unaceptable in this type of game where right timing is key.

This made the top of my alphebetical list, and I must say that it was a pleasure to farm through. It's simple and addicting through repetitive but rewarding level design, a plot that's not the worst, and a phenomenal soundtrack.\n\nBut would I rack up anything more than, say, 2 hours? Probably not. It was a bit too repetitive, and, like many indie games, the plot is never its strongest point. Personally, that over mechanics will always compel me to blow more time into the game. It would also be wise to get a controller for the game.","May 30, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That single change makes for a much less frustrating experience.\n\nAre you a platforming champ, with reflexes at the peak of your game, going for high scores? Great!

It speaks to Runner 2's natural progression of what's demanded of the player in each stage.\n\nThe art is whimsical and interesting and I like seeing all the cute faces in the background. Character outfits are inspired and silly.  The music itself builds each stage but remains soothing throughout (I was digging the hard edge of World 4).\n\nIf I had any qualms, I'd say that the visual effects upon bypassing certain obstacles can obscure too much of the screen, especially considering the variation in destruction animations of, say, barricades or rebounded beats. It's not too much of a buzzkill, but I'm pretty used to flashing colors and vibrant distraction and I still feel like it gets to be a little much at times.\n\nPure peaceful joy.\n\nEDIT- I like achievements because I can see stats like the following: in the five hours I've played this game, I've made it farther than 90% of all people who ever play this game.

I have it on my Wii, it's a fun rhythm game. This sequel, however, I didn't like. The game usually has your character jump a beat after you actually hit the button, making precise movements almost impossible. I used the game on easy mode, but it was still hard for me to get into (and hard overall). One of the only reasons why I decided to buy this game was because of the Good Friends character pack, which included Quote from Cave Story, a 2D shooter which I worship and you should too. Anyways, about Runner2. I never got why the name was so long. Just call it "BIT.TRIP Runner2" or something. "Future Legend of Rhythm Alien" is pretty unnessicary for the name. I'd give this about a 3.5/10 if I was feeling generous.\n\nTL;DR: Buy the original if you want a decent rhythm game.","July 3, 2014","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Runner2 changed that: while expanding on BIT.TRIP Runner gameplay, Runner2 offers friendlier learning curve and adjustable difficulty, which is a welcome change for all those non-hardcore gamers who wish to actually enjoy the game without regular rage-quits. And that doesn't mean that experienced BIT.TRIP-ers won't be satisfied with the challenge: set the difficulty level to "Rather hard" and go for those Perfect+'s!

Rhythmic.This game is all of it. Not one for hardcore shooter gamers, but instead for gamers who enjoy some good soundtracks incorporated with the gameplay itself. Can be frustrating at times, as there is little room for mistakes. Art is surprisingly great and all the aspects of the game work perfectly together.","March 16, 2014","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game is just as annoying as the first one but the controlls are more annoying.
