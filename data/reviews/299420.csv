Between the terrible port of an iOS game, the broken English, and just the game breaking bugs that don't even allow me to continue the game, I can't choose what is worse.\n\nHere's a quick look video if you want to see this for yourselves, or simply read the rest of my review for the sad truth of this game.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/YHwAvmdHSWM\n\nSo let me just start by what drew me into this game, the ability to make and customize your ship and levels. It seemed pretty neat that you could make a ship however you want and launch yourself at your foe. The rock, paper, scissors mechanics of the guns is cool, too. Machine guns are devastating but shields render them pretty useless, but torpedoes can blow through shields no problem, while anti-missile guns can stop the torpedoes even getting near you and so on. And the best bit of all this is that you can combine different weapons together to make up for their weaknesses. It's a pretty solid concept. But done very, very wrong.\n\nLet me start with the gameplay. After customizing a ship to your liking with limited resources, you get thrown into battle with no warning or start-up screen. Your curiously silent weapons are blazing like no tomorrow, and there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop them. The only controls you're allowed are moving with WASD, so the only thing you have to do is point yourself at the enemy and strafe to win. Yup, that's it. And once you win the match with this method, your met with a low-res banner stating you won. Needless to say, it didn't feel like I did.\n\nThe next thing I couldn't help but notice was the terrible English littered everywhere. Sometimes the tutorials made me more confused about what something did rather than help. But hey, I can overlook it since this game isn't exactly story driven. So I pressed on some more, and encountered some interesting and overpowered enemies to fight. But rather than use my crappy weapons compared to theirs, I just used the terrible AI to my advantage and watched them drive themselves into cliffs. That seemed to be the most effective method of taking dudes down. Hell, sometimes they ran into walls themselves without me having to do anything. It was kinda funny, but mostly sad to watch.\n\nBut still, I continued like this was a guilty pleasure until I couldn't go on anymore. Not because I reached the end, but because the game is broken and doesn't allow me to. It won't let me go any farther in the single mode, Island Loot is still locked for whatever reason, and the multiplayer is dead on launch day. There wasn't a single game going. I tried scrolling what seemed infinitely through the level selection menu, but all I saw was the levels I did and lots of blank screens. And thus that led me here to this review since I can't continue beyond that point.\n\nI'm not even gonna bother ragging on the obviously large touch buttons and poor mouse controls, so I'll wrap it up here. Don't get this game unless you want to be disappointed by a cool concept like me. Maybe if they patch this mess of a port and it goes on a steep sale will this be worth it. But for now, stay away. Stay far away.","May 21, 2014","false","1.9"," 95 of 145 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","95","145","2","16"

In this game mode you have three bots that go over to enemy bots and slap away at their bots, the winner is the one left standing, or you could trash all of that if you enemy has a black hole launcher or cannons that just pushes you away until time runs out and the defender wins. These strategies usualy involve one tank bot and two other shooter placeb behind them, or all of the bots are tanks and shooters. I know that their are more complicated stradegies that can go into this game mode but those can only be expanded by buying better weapons.1.Easy to play game mode\n2.Easy to regain bullets\n3.If you win a match it will put you with stronger opponents\n4.If you loose a battle it will match you up with weaker opponents\n5.Variety of stradegies\n6.Has the oppurtunity to choose starting position1.Limited amount of bullets\n2.Small chance of winning against stoger opponents\n3.Sometimes AI is completly stupidFleet battlesThis game mode is for the people who are less lazy then the poeple who are mlg at Auto Battles, I currently consider this their primary game mode because is is listed as the first game mode on the list and it also has their own in game currency to play it ,oil. This game mode is one were people can have the same strats as a the Auto Battles but instead of haveing three uncontrollable bots that go and try to kill the other bots you have to kill the other teams thing? I have no idea what it's called but it's a shiny ball of light.  The strategic view about this game mode is that you buy bots with electric thingies based on the weight of that bot meaning that if you are low level then you have a chance of winning if you send out alot of small bots that ae able to destroy your opponents larger bot. This gammode is by far the most balanced game mode, and has close to no flaws.1.Strategies include bot design as a requirement\n2.Strategies include when to use which bot\n3.Strategies include makeing small cheap bots for spamming\n4.Strategies include large bots for taking out aeverything\n5.Strategies include pretty much everything\n6.Good balance between strong and weak bots\n7.Good balance between the person winning and the person loosing1.Getting wrecked by people with hammers and lazersBoss battlesEvery good boss is pretty much three huge hammers with shields, AA guns,  and a few magnets. This boss has close to no counter unless you consider standing at the back of the safe zone with your two freinds all with lazers and thrusters to avoid the magnets.1. Alot of strategy involved with making a good boss\n2. Auto Battles and Boss Battles share the same currency required to play(bullets)\n3. Bullets are easy to regain\n4. Gives you boss points that you can spend at the boss shop\n5. Allows you to move around your bot in a 2D mode1. The rewards are OK but I find I get more out of Auto Battles\n2. Everyone makes pretty much the same bossMultiplayerUnlike the rest of the game modes this one is a third-person shooter were you can Wreck them scrubs.  Their are two types of game modes Get the Ball (PvP) or Survival (PvE).  Get the ball is a game mode in which you are in a 3D Arena and you control one of your bots and your goal is to run into a floating ball which you then carry around, when you have the ball you are slowed and have less defence, you have to carry that ball for around a whole minute.  I don't think that this game mode gets you much gold or metal as survival because you only get gold or metal from killing other people but if you kill a person more then once then they imediatly rage.  Survival is were you and some other people are trying to protect 3 Power Ups from hoards of AI robots, at first this may seem like you are recieving nothing but in actuality once you get to the higher waves you start recieving more then 50 gold and metal per round.  In both of these game mode everyone who wants to get kills uses bots with giant hammers on them because their is currently no counter to them.1.OH BABY A TRIPLE! and MOM GET THE CAMERA!\n2. No cost to play\n3. Good gold and metal gain\n4. Wrecking them scrubs1.Everyone uses a hammer\n2. Hammer = OP\n3. Getting wrecked like a scrubCommunityThe community that this game has is one of the nicest communities that I have every seen in a game, The people their are realy accepting and answer almost every question about the game. Don't know were to start after going through the toutorial, ask the community.  Want more friends to play the game with you, ask the community.  Don't know were to cummunity is, ask the.. wait, it's right here. Want to find a a different game to play that is not Cubegun, ask.. NO ONE! This game also has a very friendly in-game global  chat that im sure would also be friendly.. if anyone used of course.1.You can ask almost any question you want\n2. You can search for friends\n3. You can eaven ask why some game modes were taken out even though they are mentioned all over the place1. It is kind of small, but their can't be anything done aobut thatCreaters The creaters of this game a relentles bunch of video game makers who are amazing at what they do, from them you can expect a constant stream of new content.  The creaters of this game are also  all over the community and accept almost any good and realistic ideas that you throw at them, an example of this is that the tracking missile were an idea suggested by this person and now it's an in-game weapon.  And then their is the spelling. I find that I aquire OCD purely based on the fact that everything is in a forign language and acts as though english is the secondary language, nor is their a language canging button to change that. Thier is also the fact that somethings are spalled miscorrectly in english, an example is how Get the Ball is spelled Get the Bal, they should just rename it Get the Other L in Bal. Also when someone leaves multiplayer it says "Name" has leaved IT SHOULD SAY LEFT NOT LEAVEED, LEAVEED IS NOT EVEN A WORD! I know that english is not your primary language but it doesn't seem the most professional. Remember the creaters of this game are amazing.1. They are inveractive with the community\n2. They are fast with updates\n3. They take sugestions1.litttle spelz an grammmers\n2. 没有语言的变化 No way to change the languageAchievementsMan was I looking forward to aquiring the vast amount of achievements that this game had to offer, for you see I need achievements to get self-esteem and I need self-esteem to get achievements, so it's a chain reaction until I run out of achievements. Why did I run out of achievements you ask thats an easy one, bacause Around 75% of the achievements are broken.  I am currently dead inside. The reason that over half the achievements are broken is because they took away the gamemode that over half the achievements were based off of. I ran out of characters, so im skipping pros and cons.\nDespite bugs and everything else I think this game is worth it.","September 5, 2015","true","13.0"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","29","39","5","0"

But since the last update it was really good because it was a real system introduced into the game, there are only a few errors. There were also a lot of new weapons and levels that make added some interesting there. A level system makes the game more difficult and thus better, because earlier you won without any problems.","May 31, 2015","true","7.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","1"

The weapons are quite varied, and the synergy effect is functioning properly (e.g. Nothing is undefeatable). Currently there are 2 solo modes and 2 online modes.\n\nThe devs are real active, and they sometimes release updates and bugfixes daily! They are also very open to feedback, and as such, the game improved A LOT over the year.\n\nStill, the lack of players means there will usually only be 1~3 servers for multiplayer, and player fleet battles are real uncommon. However, you will usually find somebody to play with. There are still a whole lot of bugs, and UI needs improvement as it looks ♥♥♥♥ now.\n\nI would give this a 8/10, it's not a must-play, but you will most likely have fun.","August 11, 2014","true","166.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Having played a couple hours I can say that the population is really low but the gmaepaly is there if a little buggy. In CubeGun you craft airships out of blocks and equip weapons and propulsion, from the tutorial it seems you can control ships either with a third person perspective manual, or with an RTS style mouse drag and click.
