You get them from teasure chests but they seemingly have no purpose. What does the H-ability do? It typically damages you for random amounts of HP, but the picture shows a fireball looking thing.\n- No sound effects\n- Recharging your health takes a long amount of time\n- Combat is extremely poor, and consists of you just holding and hoping you don't die\n- Some levels are quite vague, and overly challenging\n\nContrary to other reviews I've read, there are 12 levels total.","May 4","false","8.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"
