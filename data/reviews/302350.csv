Under a Killing Moon made quite a racket at the time, being one of the first games that used FMV, and not just for cut-scenes but also in-game, and for being so unprecedently huge (it shipped on 4 CDs). This was cutting edge stuff back then, when some games were still shipped on several floppy disks... And than this mammoth came!\n\nAnyway, technologies aside the game turned out to be really interesting and clever. I spent lots of days and nights playing it (I was 14 and had zero experience in computer adventure games at the time) but in the end I made it, although I used hints several times. I've been hooked on point-n-click adventure games ever since.\n\nFrankly, I bought this game several days ago more out of nostalgia than anything else. I thought I would play an hour or so, remember the good ol' days, so to speak, and be on my way. Well, what do you know, I spent the night playing it and I'm now roughly half-way through, fully intended on finishing it.\n\nMy next step would probably be Tex Murphy: The Pandora Directive, which I haven't played at the time of its release due to some compatibility issues.

Despite belonging to a "classic" saga, I had never heard of this game when I got it from a bundle, so I started playing it out of curiosity holding zero nostalgia.\n\nEvaluationThe game has a noir-ish, futuristic ambient. How they don't really achieve it is part of the charm of the game. For example, you have flying cars, but you still have bricklike laptops and something like MS-DOS.\n\nThe game lacks "darkness" too: people die, you (may) die, more people are going to die, but still the atmosphere is so naive and Disney-esque that there is no drama, no tension.\n\nBut it is still funny and humorous. I had some really good laughs with the FMV and dialogs. And that's probably the best value of the game.\n\nI get that in its time, the game had to be a start-of-the-art in both technical and production values. I remember 1994 as the year my family purchase a 486 with no multimedia equipment. But nowadays those values are very dated, with graphics showing weird aberration effects, plain textures, lots of glitches and ugly low-res video (not only low-res, but also amateurish edition), but that's what you get when you play a game more than 20 years old. The FMV and the completely voiced dialogs and inner thoughts of the main character could be enough to forgive most of the sins of the game. Even nowadays, a full voiced game like this one is a plus. But I have to reiterate in the sins part.\n\nControls are terrible. It shows that in that time there weren't too many references of what is proper usability. Player navigates using the mouse as if one were using an analog pad in a touchscreen (the mouse is your finger), which is very hard to control. You cannot navigate using the keyboard, no WASD, but still requires the keyboard to raise/lower your "head" or look up/down.\n\nThe acting and even the direction is questionable at least, but it is still charming enough.\n\nPuzzles are a bit too few and easy. That is good for a "quickie", but it doesn't help the game in feeling "complete" or even rewarding. Well, they are harder than those in your typical Hidden Object Game, but I feel them to be below those in other point-and-click games.\n\nMost of the game is spent navigating the environments looking for objects which are, most of them, easy enough to locate. An experienced, inquisitive player may find every object in each room and not need to review already visited rooms, although sometimes that is needed for new objects to appear.\n\nThere is yet another big flaw in the story, or at least an important part of the story that is completely overlooked.\n<spoilers>\nWhen you destroy the evil guy's space station, you kill HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people, all the population that knows of and believes in that cult, you wipe them out. You are a genocide. It's a Master Plan worthy of Evil Hitler: convince the ones you want to kill that they have a Master Plan, let them get all in the same place to celebrate and annihilate them in a press-any-key-to-continue-simple action. Ok, these ones were not nice people, at all, they were going to kill everyone else. But next day, you are giving tango lessons. WTF!\nYes, ranting about it was the main driver to write this review.\nAnd let me reuse this spoiler block to say that the final puzzle (or more precisely, the lack of a "puzzle") is really anti-climatic.\n</spoiler>\n\nFinally, the game has a very opportune in-game help system, complete and totally optional, which makes virtually impossible to get the player stuck in the game. The game also has an introduction to the series, a score system to help you fully explore the game and a hinting system to help you not get stalled in the game.\n\nSummary and veredictPros:\nFun, humorous game.\nShort.\nVoiced dialogs and FMV.\nMeta-game parts: help, hints, scores, etc.\nHistoric value.Cons:\nToo Disney, too little Noire.\nA bit too easy and simple, some perceived lack of content. The last part is much more easy than other parts of the game.\nYou can die. If there were autosaves, I didn't find them. Save often.\nControls.\nDefinitely inferior to its sucessor.\nI recommend the game because I enjoyed playing it. It is fun and short enough to be not repetitive or annoying.","February 20","true","13.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/batflunkie/recommended/302350/","batflunkie","Bryneunderpunches","http://steamcommunity.com/id/batflunkie/","50 products in account",""Under A Killing Moon" is the third game in the Tex Murphy series and is a 3D First Person Point & Click Adventure with bits of Full Motion Video. The majority of the game takes place in the slums of a post-apocalyptic San Fransisco still in the midst of World War Three. After solving a petty burglary, Tex is tasked with recovering a countess' precious family heirloom, a bird statuette and must rely on his expert deductive skills (or lack there-of) to tackle this case head on.\n\nThe game is full of camp (the good kind), but also portions of comedy and really good acting, which typically unheard of in a game of this manner. So it would be fair to call it one parts "Sam & Max Hit The Road" and one parts "Myst". The game's only downside is the 3D portions. Navigating around is akin to sliding on ice and most definitely takes some getting used to. But what makes it truly a cut above the rest is it's very intuitive "hint" system that throws you a mulligan if you get lost (you earn points from conversations, getting clues, and solving puzzles and use them as you please).\n\nOverall, it's a great game that's an absolute must for fans of old school computer games and point & click adventures alike","November 29, 2014","true","6.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

However, unlike the first two Tex Murphy games, this one is actually playable and kind of fun. You are a detective, putting together clues to solve cases. Sometimes it gets a bit confusing (whether from the terrible graphics/gameplay, lack of explanation, or just from normal human error), but there is a HINT button that is there to help you. You can only "buy" hints with points that you acquire from playing through the game on your own. Overall, it's a somewhat fun, old school game. It is full of full motion video (FMV) and the acting is awful! Even so, the game itself is decent and kind of fun. Since this game is super old, it's not really worth paying for by itself.

Now I finally got it as a part of the Tex Murphy Classic collection.\nExcluding the firt two titles, Tex Murphy is a series of detective FMV adventure games ("interactive movie") set in a post-apocalyptic future. This adventure game sub-genre was relatively popular in the 90's as digital video technologies were emerging, but never really lived past that time. Under a Killing Moon, is one of the early examples of that genre.\n\nWhile it was a technological marvel back in the 1993, the game didn't really age well. Stuttery FMV sequences, bad compositing effects and very early 3D environments are sometimes laughable and anything but impressive today. However I consider it part of the charm, as Tex Murphy adventures always were a mix of things that seem like they would never work well together. This retro feel actually helps to convey the atmosphere of a dystopian future, although it probably wasn't intentional at the time of making.\n\nIt certainly isn't a game for everyone, and I'm not sure if this is the best game for the newcomers to the series (maybe start with some of the newer titles), but if you like FMV adventures, have a thing for retro, or just enjoy quirky games, you should definitely give it a try. There is a cool story, great puzzles, and couple of good laughs in this Tex Murphy adventure, and you should play it for that.","May 26, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At a time when an Intel 66MHz DX/2, 8MB of RAM and a 2x CD-ROM were considered a "beefy rig", this game was also bleeding edge.\n\nThe FMV cutscenes were amazing, but it was the explorable 3D world which truly blew me away. No GPU acceleration here either, because there was no such thing in the consumer world: It's all software-rendered, texture-mapped polygons, and beautifully so. A true feat of programming for the time.\n\nBut more than that are the detailed plot & storyline, and immensely well-thought-out interactivity. You can click on nearly anything visible and Tex will make some amusingly snide remark about it.\n\nThe objectives often require some creativity to figure out, but aren't overly difficult and can be accomplished in any particular order, and I appreciated that the game's creators didn't pull any cruel replay-because-you-forgot-something nonsense. (e.g. "You're on Chapter 4 but didn't get Item X in Chapter 2? Darn, you'll have to replay all that!") Sure, there are trivial extras you can miss, but nothing critical.\n\nI was surprised to enjoy playing this game 21 years later - Hard to believe it's old enough to drink! It shows it's age, but with the right DOSbox scaling filter (I used advmame3x over the default of normal2x) many of the graphics are revived and look as though they might've been made yesterday.\n\nThe only thing which threw me off is the lack of any input configuration, which means you cannot map keys, and hence cannot use the (now-standard) WASD keys to get around. I eventually got settled with using the mouse (think default Wolfenstien 3D controls) to make my way, but it still felt clunky no matter what. Whether this game supports joystick input or not I'm unsure, but if so, I'd STRONGLY advise looking for a joystick-to-WASD wrapper utility. I probably would have if the game took more than 11 hours to complete.\n\nIf you're playing this game for nostalgia, or are a retro-game enthusiast, I'd highly recommend Under A Killing Moon.","August 10, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
