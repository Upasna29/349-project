"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/310070/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Note: video review embedded below.\n\nThe saddest thing about The Nightmare Cooperative, is that it's only real use is as a starting point for getting people into other games.\n\nIt's a turn-based roguelike that simplifies genre staples into something far more accessible than the genre is known for. You only have the ability to move and use a special attack, there are no stats or leveling systems, equipment is barely present, and the game only ever exists on a single screen. And all of that is great because it means people who have shied away from roguelikes do to their unforgiving difficulty and complex systems are going to have a much easier time learning The Nightmare Cooperative, and then might be compelled to try something with a larger scope to see why games like this have become so popular.\n\nBut that also means that there's very little to actually keep you busy here. After only 30 or so minutes I'd already seen just about everything in the game, and an hour later managed to clear it all together. With how basic the mechanics are, each of my runs felt all but entirely indistinguishable, and there was never the sense that I was actually getting much better at the game or had any way to do so. And that's perhaps what's most frustrating about The Nightmare Cooperative. When your means of interaction are so aggressively simplified, it can feel like the game is playing you as much as you are it.\n\nThe Nightmare Cooperative has a bad habit of putting you in situations which feel based entirely on luck. I consistently found myself locked into corners at random, already able to see my imminent death as I began to walk in circles prolonging the moment, and that's immensely aggravating because it seems like you have no control over whether or not you're going to get screwed over and have to start again.\n\nI enjoyed The Nightmare Cooperative as a brief, lightweight entry into a genre that's often far too intimidating, but it gave me little cause to spend anymore time with it. If you've never played a roguelike but are interested in giving them a shot, this probably wouldn't be a terrible place to start. Just know you'll be wanting to graduate to something more advanced fairly soon.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8GbKtV6tf0&list=PLmaGkDQUd2inWbUZoSoB7v2zcJ_cJ0VGA&index=2","February 13, 2015","false","1.6"," 54 of 67 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","54","67","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/recommended/310070/","More_Badass","More_Badass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/","624 products in account","If you go into this game expecting a grand and complicated experience, you'll probably be disappointed. The Nightmare Cooperative is a compact game, a roguelike distilled to its base elements. You won't find complex skill trees, or a multitude of loot to collect and equip, or expansive environments for you to explore and perish in. That's not a bad thing; if you're looking for something simple but challenging, simplified yet also strategic and tactical, The Nightmare Cooperative excels.\n\nThe set-up is simple, a framework for the action rather than an extended narrative. Your village is in disarray; go out, gather gold, fight monsters, survive. The core of The Nightmare Cooperative is its gameplay and that aspect proves to be much deeper and more engaging than the story. If you've familiar with Michael Brough's 868-HACK, you'll feel right at home among Nightmare's enemy-filled rooms. Similar to that game, your goal here is to amass a high score, the amount of gold you collect equaling your final score. Opening chests rewards you with gold and spawns enemy so choosing whether to rush for the exit or increase your score is a crucial choice. Enemies move when you move so each step forward is a strategic decision that, when combined with the game's mechanics and varied foes, gives The Nightmare Cooperative a methodical, puzzle-esque vibe.\n\nYou don't control a single hero in Nightmare, but rather an entire group at once, each hero moving and using their special abilities simultaneously. Each hero is unique and positioning and formation is important since their abilities are only effective under certain conditions. The Archer can only shoot enemies directly ahead, the Mage can hit enemies on diagonals, the Warrior can perform two strikes in one move, the Ninja can pass through enemies, and so on for the other seven heroes. Supplementing these abilities are items that provide special perks, such as extra life at the expense of mana or not spawning enemies when opening a chest.\n\nThe enemies you face are equally varied and cement the game's strategic puzzle atmosphere. Some enemies travel along predictable paths. Others mirror your movements or move extra spaces in a turn. Turrets rotate and fire in intervals. All this knowledge is always at your disposal and define how you position your heroes, which heroes are best for a given room. Managing four heroes at once, while timing and syncing your movements to evade enemies or get into formation to attack a desired enemy with a specific ability, is a satisfying challenge. It's best to approach each move in The Nightmare Cooperative slowly and carefully, taking the time to plan out your next steps, thinking about where you are and will be in relation to enemies and hazards. A poor decision can easily find your heroes scattered across a level, cornered, a beneficial move for one character being dangerous for the others.\n\nThe colorful distinct art style rounds out this compelling package. The Nightmare Cooperative is all about the gameplay, the turn-for-turn decisions that make the best roguelikes so satisfying. Those looking for something with more depth may find the game lacking, but the strategic gameplay, varied heroes, and one-more-go appeal makes The Nightmare Cooperative a worthy addition for fans of the genre. The developers plan to add a challenge mode that will feature rooms with predetermined heroes, enemies, and layouts designed to test your strategic prowess. A mobile version is also in the works, with an estimated release time frame sometime later this year.","July 16, 2014","true","1.7"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","39","45","0","0"

With a simple premise, the game is about surviving a dungeon with multiple units on screen. Similar to dungeon crawlers like Legend of Grimrock or Quest of Dungeons, you move one space at a time, and so does the enemy. A singular command makes all of your units move, thus the "Cooperative", which is where the real challenge settles into the game. Making decisive moves to help all of your units survive is vital, yet very hard to master.\n\nFor more information, gameplay footage, and more, check out my commentated video review here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS5UW3k-9vo&feature=youtu.be","July 15, 2014","true","1.9"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","6"

I haven't played much but I like it so far.  After seeing some of the negative reviews I feel I have to defend it a little bit because I think some people expect it to be something that it's not.\n\nThere's a lot more strategy than at first glance because all your characters move at the same time but they are on different spots on the grid.  So if you move a wizard up to get him out of the way of a monster, you also move your barbarian or whatever other characters you have, and they might end up in danger.  You have to really plan your moves if you want to get lots of loot and kill monsters.  You could just rush straight for the exit and beat the game in no time if you prefer, but personally I'd rather get most if not all of the treasure first.\n\nEach character has a special ability that can be activated if he has a potion (the blue bottle). It's a one-time use, so there's more strategy for you.  So far I've had 3 different characters: and Archer (special ability is to shoot across in a straight line), Wizard (special ability is a magic attack diagonally only), and a Barbarian (I think he could beat a monster in one hit instead of two).\n\nYou start out with one character with low health.  Each monster takes 2 hits to take down so you can lose health quickly.  There are heart potions that you can grab to increase your health.  You gain extra characters by finding them in levels and going up to them.  But you can only choose one character per level, so if there are two available on that level the one you didn't choose with disappear.\n\nThere are also special items you can grab that do special things.  I can't remember what they are called exactly, but they are like artefacts.\n\nOH, and every time you open a treasure chest more monsters appear!","March 24, 2015","true","1.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","1"

The game deviates from the standard roguelike path by adding more of a puzzle vibe. Like in 2048, you control your units by moving in one of four directions, all units move at the same time in the same direction each turn if able. Of course like any good dungeon crawler, there is no lack of enemies and other hazards to slash your way through or sneak around. The end result is some really fun gameplay that requires lots of foresight if you wish to make any real progress. It's simple to learn and easy to play nature notwithstanding, it offers a nice little challenge.","January 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","4"

It features a whimsical cartoony visual style, with cerebral gameplay mechanics. The game also has an enjoyable class based system, where you can gain allies who have their own special trait that you can exploit in order to progress through the game.\n\nThe Nightmare Cooperative has some pretty strong mechanics, but it is a little light on features. You're getting the game's campaign mode and that's about it. there's no multiplayer, hardcore mode, or any other game modes to try. It's all about the base game, and collecting things to fill your collection.\n\nOverall, the Nightmare Cooperative is an interesting game that should serve well as a fun distraction from the main games you're currently playing.\n\nPros:\n- Appealing visual style\n- Cerebral gameplay\n- Interesting class based mechanics\n- Simple and easy to understand\n\nCons:\n- Light on features\n- No "real" animations\n- Might not be for every one","July 7, 2014","true","2.0"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","4"

This game is very straight foward and easy to pick up (even if you are a newcomer to the Rogue-Genre). The main objective of the game is to venture to the bottom floor of a dungon claiming loot and assembling a larger band of heroes. In this game you start off controlling two random heroes, you move both of them simultaneously which at first can be a little annoying but after awhile it becomes pretty fun; no worries the game is also very straight foward, as I said earlier, at any time you can mouse-over enemies, items, and other heroes to get a rundown of their abilites or a helpful tip. The simultaneous team gameplay is pretty fun, often I found myself trying and experimenting with new tactics and strategies. After the first floor random heroes will apear thoughout the dungeon(s), each hero has their own special ability (Priests can heal, Ninjas can jump, archers can shoot at a distance, stuff like that); this causes the gameplay to become both challenging and rewarding because you'll constanly be trying to keep your team alive while progressing into the harder levels. There are also items in the game which can give your hero slight perks, but nothing groundbreaking. There is no level up system which makes it a little casual (you won't have to worry about having a good build) while at the same time hard (Enemies will feel tougher while your heroes still stay the same). All and all, its a pretty fun Rogue game with a nice unique gameplay feeling.\n\nAnywhose, long story short, this game is a pretty fun roguelike with short (If i'm correct there are 16 floors? 4-standard, 4-ice, 4-dark, 4-desert) with challenging gameplay.\n\nIn terms of criticism the price is a little high in my opinion for such a small game; I understand that it's a new idea thats fresh to the rogue genre but for the same price you could get some of the more elaborate rogue-like games with more replayability. Future updates would also be nice, maybe a gamemode where you could take one hero into the dungeon (rather than two). Ehh- I'm just nitpicking.\n\n7/10 (Buy it if you're a Rogue-Like-Fan, if you're new to the genre I'd suggest getting it on sale since perma death can be a little frustrating, unforgiving and discouraging to beginners but to a veteran its what makes the genre magical)\n\n(Edit: I revised my review a little, orginally I had wrote it half awake; and I didn't expect to be on store-page when I woke up)","July 16, 2014","true","2.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The monsters are varied, each monster has their own movement pattern and special abilities, such as swapping places with your characters or poisoning them.\nThe game can be beaten in just one hour, plus one hour of learning the mechanics and thinking out the general strategy, in other words, it's really short. There are scoreboards, and, undoubtedly, just beating the game is way easier and faster than beating the game with the maximum amount of gold, since opening treasure chests spawns new monsters. However, competing for high score may not be a big enough incentive to make most players come back to it over and over again.\nI think the game is well worth your time if you're into puzzlers, and whether two hours of fun are worth the price is up to you to decide (if you think the price is too much, keep an eye on game bundle websites, since the game has been bundled lately on multiple occasions).","March 21, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Despite being labelled a turn-based rogue like, it's in fact just a proper Roguelike.\n\nFirst Impression Video\nhttp://youtu.be/3qLWk4pMqvA\n\nMonsters move when you move, they move when you attack, and the levels and traps are randomly generated.\nDespite having rather simple mechanics, the game has some rather good depth and difficulty. It's not hard for the sake of being hard; it's hard because of the actions you take and how to try to collect treasure.\n\nA simple patrol monster doesn't seem like much, but one wrong movement three turns ago might just come around to bite you in your behind.\nThe party based mechanic is interesting as well, all you characters move at the same time, and their abilities are used so as well. So careful planning is needed. You simply cannot just go into this game thinking you can richly rush through a level. The simply act of collecting gold and opening chests increases the game difficulty and changes the area and  puzzles.\n\nSome chests are marked with numbers, and this corresponds to the affect they'll have once opened. Open a chest with the number two and two things happen. You can get two monster spawns, or a monster and some acid on the floor.\n\nDotted randomly on floors are lovely gold crowns, the jewels your party so desperately seek. Although surround by spikes, your only way to get to them is by pressing a button which is also randomly generated on the floor. Even this can change the level as once spikes drop, there is nothing to stop a monster from moving over them.\n\nThe music in the game is rather relaxing, adding to the fact that the game is both suitable for casual and hardcore players. I say this because you can easily play a few levels and call it a day, or if you're the completionist type you can easily lose hours accidentally.\nThe graphics aren't much, but the visual art style is lovely; resembling paper craft models. I find the style very pleasing, and it blends in rather well with the music and effects. It feels as if you're playing a paper crafted board game.\n\nI can easily recommend it to people, and if they want to see what it plays like I have a first impression video for them.","July 16, 2014","true","4.0"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"

I love strategy games and this was a fun puzzle to break, however as a warning I only put 2.3 hours into this game as of the review and don't plan on playing the game again (outside of introducing it to friends). Your mileage may vary depending on how fast you pick up the mechanics, and how much you enjoy replaying the game with unlocked characters. In all honesty this game feels like an early-access version and would be much better with some polishing.\n\nTo clarify the main con I have with the game, after I unlocked all the characters I no longer have a desire to replay the game. There is gold you can gather with the detriment of summoning additional enemies - which I enjoyed and my first time through I gathered a lot of gold, but it appears to be useless. After that I no longer prioritize gathering any gold and the game got a lot easier and less multifaceted. I would also attribute some of the feeling to the lack of fanfare you receive with a victory, the ending feels like the arbitrary level count was reached so it ended with a short splash screen then you get to start over again.\n\nBut what the game does amazingly well is keeping itself simple, yet having some deep strategic decisions. You can control 1-4 characters that all perform your instructions simultaneously, meaning coordinating your team is difficult and rewarding. Even the most basic enemies will wreck your heroes faster than you can blink given the opportunity, giving you a great feeling of achievement when you conquer a rather difficult fight/room. There is also no RNG (possibly with the exception of enemy AI) so this allows for some deep planning potential.\n\nAll in all I am glad I played this game and plan to share it with other friends who enjoy this type of game, however I only spent a couple hours on it, unlocked everything the game had to offer, and don't plan on playing it again solo. I would recommend picking this up if you enjoy strategy games, but just understand you may not get much play time out of it.","April 12, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This mostly results in an interface screw from trying to keep track of so much stuff all at once. It's not a roguelike nearly as much as it's a puzzle game with randomly-generated, sometimes practically impossible levels. If you want a party-based roguelike, go check out Steam Marines instead - it lets you control the characters individually, which actually allows for some real strategy rather than just luck and bumbling around.","March 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So even people who thought they liked the game didn't bother plalying it much.\n\nI like the idea of this game but the implementation is somewhat lacking. I was hoping for a very simplified version of the wonderful Desktop Dungeons. Instead it seems I got a half finished game.\n\nFirst off, the developers should fix the control scheme. The dialog that pops up when you launch the game shows controls that don't work (WASD). I also couldn't get my Microsoft gamepad to work. There is reference to the jump command, but this doesn't exist (space is special ability). I still don't know what the mouse buttons do, if anything.\n\nFor a game where one mistake can end your game, the rules are very vague. What happens if two characters have their special ability active? Can I choose to select which one to use, and if so how?\n\nThe Ninja special ability says something like "jump behind enemy". But how far behind, I haven't quite figured out yet exactly when it is active - sometimes I am inline with an ememy with space behind the enemy, why can't I jump?\n\nI haven't been able to find anything online to explain the fine points of the rules. And to be honest, I don't like the game enough that I feel like experimenting to determine these rules by trial an error.","January 10, 2015","false","1.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

A shame, It really could have been so much better... Oh and I would comment about graphics or sound, but the art style is always hit and miss for me.

(in-game option doesn't work)\n- Retail price is a little too steep, in my opinion.
