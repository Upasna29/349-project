"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/recommended/261940/","cublikefoot","cublikefoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/","2402 products in account","Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/the-mysterious-cities-of-gold-secret-paths-cub-game-review/\n\nI’ll start off by saying, I’ve never seen the original anime that this game is based on. I actually did not know of its existence until I stumbled onto this interesting game. I might actually want to watch the 80′s anime, the game made it seem quite interesting. Because of this, I’ll be unaffected by the “nostalgia factor” that many people had when they saw this game. Anyways, I’ve seen a lot of people purchasing this purely out of nostalgia, and learned about the show because of it; now, onto the review!\n\nI was slightly disappointing by how the game played out. The game essentially combines puzzle elements with some scavenger hunting mechanics. That’s the entire game in a nutshell. The basic concept of the game is not that hard to understand. You’ll find yourself switching between the three main characters, Esteban, Tau, and Zia. Each character has their own special ability used for certain puzzle mechanics found scattered throughout the levels of the game. Each of these skills will have to be used in a certain pattern in order to complete a level. This ultimately results in the player wandering around looking for an object that pertains to a character’s ability, like a crack in a wall, which Zia can slip through.\n\nThe levels can easily be traversed with a free-roaming camera, marking each character with an icon and allowing you to figure out the solution to a puzzle from an easier perspective. The problem with this style of gameplay is that switching between the characters feels like a chore. You have to operate all three characters separately, each being used for their ability. Throughout the game, you pick up these “parchments”, which act as collectibles scattered throughout a level. Collecting them all gives you a gold medal at the end of the level for finding them all. The problem with this is that some of the parchments are color-coded, allowing only certain characters to pick them up. This can be a nuisance when you have one character standing on these parchments, unable to pick them up, and the actual character needed to pick them up on the opposite side of the level, awaiting their orders from the player.\n\nThe puzzles can be a bit shallow sometimes. There was one instance where a series of pressure plates were laid out in front of me, and three of them had to be activated to open the next door. Above these plates was a plaque that only Tao could read. Reading it tells you what plates to stand on, usually in the form of a riddle, which is nice, but some of them were a little too easy for my tastes. Along with the parchments that can be collected, there is a treasure chest hidden in each level. Finding the chest unlocks an illustration, just another bonus collectible to find.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that I ran into a game-breaking bug twice. I had to press a button to open a door, and upon pressing the button, it showed the door opening, then immediately closing. I thought I had messed up somewhere, but upon exiting and restarting the game, the door stayed open and I could continue with the game. This happened to me in the first and third worlds. Both occurring near the end of the level, which was quite annoying, having to restart the level.\n\nThe game’s graphics were awesome. In-between levels, cutscenes would play with the style of the original anime and leaves me wondering if these cutscenes were actually in the anime themselves. I’m sure fans of the original show would appreciate that. The animation for the characters was smooth, but could be clunky at times, especially when walking across platforms that can be turned with a lever. Overall, the art style was very charming and I really liked it. Although not memorable, the music was great and fit the theme of the game well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnKX2H3kBA4","November 25, 2013","true","7.9"," 48 of 58 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","48","58","0","4"

I don't remember well the story in itself but the main song yeah.\n\nSo, I'm glad to have that game in my library. Esteban, Zia and Tao learn about a possible City of Gold in China and go there.  But once there, between pirates, bandits and several puzzles, how will they manage?\n\nThe story is told also with cinematics that gives you the feeling that you're watching an episode of the series, though I must say that some sequences didn't really make sense at all.\n\nThe gameplay makes you take control of the three characters, with their own special tricks: Esteban can activate special pillars as the chosen one, Zia can get through small cracks and Tao can read every inscription you'll find so that you can solve the puzzle without forgetting that the parrot, Pichu, that is hanging with Tao, can steal keys.\n\nThe game is mainly about that: finding dragon stones, use them either to solve a riddle needing 4 people for plates that are activated when there is a weight on them or to open doors, sneak out areas with enemies (and trying not to get captured), etc.. It's true that for an adult, the game may be seen very very repetitive and very easy to manage (though some puzzles are kinda hard) but the game is pleasant, mainly because of challenges (time, captures, scrolls to collect and even a treasure chest with pictures to unlock).\n\nAnyway, you can retry a level as you want and with achievements to unlock, you'll have to negociate some levels very very well to earn them. It's not always easy to do a speedrun by collecting all scrolls and avoiding captures when enemies's patterns are letting you only a small frame of time to act.\n\nWhile the game is set in China, you can see a diversity of background: jungle, monastery, Forbidden City, even a City of Gold and caves too. The soundtrack is sticking also to the series.\n\nThe three little downsides I've experienced aren't really breaking but as I keep my finger pressing on the left click button to lead character, I often see them go where I don't want and be captured. Also, during a level, I was captured as Tao and suddenly, I had a close-up. I switched characters and everything was back to normal. Also, I was used to restart at one point and then suddenly, the game threw me back to an earlier phase, meaning that I had to restart it as I was aiming for a perfect level for achievement.\n\nI find the 15 bucks price tag a little too high for the game, but if anything, if in discount or in a bundle, you can go ahead for many childhood memories!","January 1","true","21.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It's a puzzler.  Based on 3 kids alternating to solve puzzles.  The puzzles are not difficult at all and doesn't take more of an elementary level of knowledge to solve.

I have to say I've been a fan of the original since it first aired in the 80's, so hearing the new voices was a bit jarring.  For anyone just jumping into the series, lore is irrelevant, as is knowledge of the original series.  It stands well on its own.  Still, I can't see anyone that isn't already a fan picking this up.  It's a boost of nostalgia, but I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to the series.","June 23, 2014","true","1.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/recommended/261940/","stambo","stambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/","1618 products in account","This game had the potential to be really fun to play. It has an interesting art style, amazing cutscenes, puzzle solving with multiple characters and the potential for a great story.\n\nHowever it suffers from some terrible design decisions. The puzzles are really simple and require next to no thinking to figure out, which makes it obvious that this game is intended for the younger audiences. The stealth system is very simplistic, enemies have no recollection of you and all you have to do is stay out of the line of sight and hide in a bush or a vase or something like that if you are spotted. Managing the playable characters is extremely tedious and it would help a lot if the developers added some simple commands such as follow, as it stands right now you have to move each character individually through the whole map. The levels are short, but they feel extremely long because of the aforementioned difficulty with controlling the playable characters.\n\nAnd the absolute biggest problem with the game is how the story is presented. Mysterious Cities of Gold is based on a cartoon and also copies the story from it, including the cutscenes which are taken from the cartoon. This makes the game not suitable to play for anyone who isn't familiar with the cartoon, because all you get from the story are gorgeously animated short cutscenes which skip ahead a lot, because the game is trying to present the story of the full run of the cartoon within a small number of short cutscenes..\n\nDo not play this game if you are not either familiar with the story or a preteen. If you are at least one of those, they you will likely enjoy the game. However I am neither one, so I simply got frustrated and bored with it.\n\n5 / 10","November 21, 2014","false","1.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

After the events in South America, you follow Esteban, Zia and Tao as they travel across China in search of the second City of Gold.\n\nPros: This is a bright and colorful adventure game, the 3D graphical style very respectful of the 2D anime it follows. Each character has a unique ability, and you must swap between them while traveling through labyrinths of jungle, caves and palaces, avoiding capture and solving puzzles to make your way across. The game is easy to pick off, perfect for any kids to learn.\n\nCons: Obviously meant for a touch screen, the point and clicking doesn't work as well with a mouse pointer's accuracy, often requiring several clicks to press a button, pick up an object or move exactly where you want to move. The clip-montage cinematics don't explain the story, but simply tells you at which point of the show's story you're at, so anyone who hasn't seen the Second Season won't understand most of the story or character development.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nAlthough many of us grew up with the First Season decades ago, the recent Second Season of The Mysterious Cities of Gold was marketed specifically for children, and this game targets that audience. Therefore, I cannot blame this game for being easy or meant for children. If you haven't seen the show, you are unlikely to find any interest in this game. But for what it's trying to do, The Mysterious Cities of Gold: Secret Paths does it justice.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","March 29, 2015","true","20.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A simple mapping of menu buttons could have address this, instead it smacks of cheaply done mobile port with a high price tag. If you decide to use the controller, you'll have to get off the couch to reach for the keyboard and mouse at the end of each level. Trying to use the default mouse control is worse, as you won't be able to interact with most objects no matter how hard you try. The puzzles seem a bit simple and a little repetitive.

After also watching the first series (30 years later) my 4 year old son was super keen to dive straight into this game. He loved it and probably would give it like a billion stars. Here is my slightly more objective review as played through with a 4yr old.\n\nPros\nA fun game for kids. Starts out quite easy but gets much harder at the end. Nothing a gaming experienced adult could not do fairly easily. The thinking puzzles are probably harder than the timing/movement ones as the former could not all be done without my help.\nA great game for teaching kids mouse control. To begin my son could hardly use a mouse, by the end he was dodging pirates as well as I could (despite the hit area problems, see below)\nThe story was decent despite not having seen the second series of the show. Cut scenes were good.\nCons\nThe hit area on many of the buttons and triggers (PC/Steam version) was really poor. Still playable but the arrow often had to target the ground below the button rather than the button itself. This is clearly an issue of the touch device/console port which does not cater for much finer mouse precision.\nThe puzzles are fairly repetitive basic game mechanics (click this button to open this door to grab this key, etc..) and are not realistic to the storyline in any way, just there to make the game playable.\nIn the final cut scene the ghost of MU says "none the less there is something else you must know..." GAME CREDITS!... what what!? I guess I will have to watch the show :(\nOverall good game for kids but probably not for adults even if they are die hard fans off the show.","April 13, 2015","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nice game it turned out to be too!\n\nIt's a puzzle game where you stand on a pad which will either activate another pad, move a wall, or rotate an elevated pathway.  By switching to another character, you advance to another pad or to another room, and repeat.  One of your characters can slip through narrow gaps in walls, another can steal keys.  Additional challenges are added later by avoiding pirates and other characters that will catch you if they spot you.\n\nWhile the game is a "kids game", I (in my 40's) still enjoyed it overall despite not having watched the tv show when I grew up.\n\nThe Good:+ Cut-scenes.  I like the anime cut-scenes and there are quite a few of them.\n+ 30 Levels.  There's quite a bit of content in this game.  Just over 10 hrs to complete the campaign for me.\n+ Animation and Music.  Seems like a well-done game overall.\n\nThe Eh:~ Controls.  The controls are OK and nearly got caught a few times because of that.\n~ Speed runs.  To earn the Time badge per level would take an additional speed run.  Definitely something you can't earn on your first play through (not after the first few levels anyway).\n~ Abbreviated cut-scenes.  The cut-scenes, while beautiful, are definitely very fast paced and edited from something longer.  They tend to feel like a 1 minute recap of the highlights of a 20min episode, which is possibly exactly what they are.\n\nThe Bad:- Achievement Bugs.  Had to play Level 30 twice to get it to register the 2 achievements for completing the Region and also the Game.  Only 12.5 minutes as I knew all the puzzles now, but still.  That said, even with my racing through it I was still 30 seconds to slow to get the Time badge; I told you those weren't easy.\n\n\nWhile this is a kids game, the puzzles certainly got a little tougher near the end.  Moreso just because of having to find out which symbols to stand on.  So some levels took me quite a bit of trial and error to finally find the combination to move on.\n\nSummary:  A decent game, but not great and probably most enjoyable if you're familiar with the series.  If you're not, there's probably better puzzlers out there.  7 out of 10.","March 5, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice and animation are a bit off, however it's notthing too horrible.  This is a children's game so the puzzles are simple and charming.  Full grown fans like myself will like to play it to see the story unfold as our three brave heros search for another City of Gold in a far-away land, but I did grow bored of the simple puzzles after time.  However, they are just the right level for younger fans!  Nine stolen cheese wheels out of ten, mainly because the animation, but lovely, is kinda...  off.","March 13, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole concept comes down to simple puzzles and no variety. There is also no full support for controller. Nevertheless, as a big fan of animation will play to the end, but I expected a lot more.","August 25, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
