Next to no backtracking or branching paths, but there are a few hidden areas that reward you with money or extra lives. Checkpoints happen on almost every single screen transition, so deaths don't set you back too far nor do you need to remember to hit up a save point. However once you run out of lives, you're sent back to the start of the level, but you get to keep all of your money. So some of the harder bosses get eaiser on multiple tries, since you have more money for better upgrades each time you attempt it.\n\nAs for an actual review, it's easy to tell the game was first made for a touch device, with the slightly awkard shooting controls. When you hold fire down, you lock your view to that direction, but can still move freely. After a stage or two it starts feeling normal. The first playthrough is fairly easy, with a few annoying boss fights, but the second playthrough "ZANGYOU" (Overtime) is where the real difficulity is at. The second time through all of the stages get tweaks to their layout, while still keeping the overall shape of the area the same. All of the weapons feel like they have some use, which is good since there aren't many even with the upgrades.\n\nWhile there's not as much character development or plot as Cave Story, there's still plot and dialog between stages, and the 2nd playthrough has its own as well. However if you enjoyed Cave Story for its music, Kero Blaster does not dissapoint. Overall, if you're into run-and-gun platformers, its a fun game to play through, worth the base $10 to me.\n\nPink Hour and Pink Heaven are both demos for Kero Blaster.\n(Played when it wasn't available on Steam)","November 11, 2015","true","5.3"," 89 of 97 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","89","97","5","4"

Everything in the weapons, levels, and enemies feels meticulously tuned to perfection. I love all the odd little gameplay homages to games from my childhood: Mickey's Mousecapade, Megaman, Adventure Island, Mario World, TMNT, etc.\n\nIt's not as big a story as Cave Story, but the goofy office characters are much easier to relate to. The Hard mode is actually a new story with new levels and bosses, so you haven't really completed it until you've done that.","November 29, 2015","true","7.3"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

Outside of a few very questionable bosses, the game remains consistently fun. The stages are expertly designed in both layout and enemy placement in order to give a lot of diversity of feel to a game without a huge amount of mechanical depth as well as encouraging the player to use all of the different weapons the game has to offer. It is very difficult to get through the game exclusively using one weapon.\n\nThe base game is pretty short (around 2-3 hours) however there is a fair bit of bonus content. In particular, ZANGYOU mode is a hard mode which ramps the difficulty up quite a bit and adds some new content and dialogue in as well.\n\nOverall this game is a masterfully crafted experience that is simple to play but has enough diversity to never wear itself out. Fun gameplay, a cute aesthetic, and amazing music make this game highly recommended from me, even at the full price. Further, there are two free pseudo-demos called "Pink Hour" and "Pink Heaven" which contain similar gameplay though shorter and easier. If you are unsure about purchasing this I would recommend giving them a shot first.","November 11, 2015","true","7.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","16","17","3","0"

Sadly, the game is pretty short, even with Zangyou and Omake modes, I promise you'll never want this game to end.\n\nTalking about characters and story, characters are pretty easy to relate to, more than Cave Story. The story is very simple, just read the description of the game and you'll get an idea.\n\nGraphics are ok, how the character is drawn is pretty simple compared to other graphics, this annoys me a bit but it's because the graphics on the game in fact were going to be alot more simplier (check Daisuke Amaya's YT account, he has a very early trailer of the game, it even has cat waifu savings)\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty much like Cave Story's, but the engine it uses is different, however, some songs are just pretty good, the soundtrack may be even better than Cave Story's.","December 28, 2015","true","28.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

You can tell that the guy who created Cave Story is behind it with the art style in question, but it never hits the same level of charm or story that that game did. It's originally an IOS game that feels more at home here, with simple controls but solid gameplay that relies on good level design and basic weaponry to propel it forward. What it doesn't have is anything that hits you in the mouth, aka the knockout punch to really sell the game, as it's solid in most aspects, but not great in any one either. Some elements have problems with boss fights that let down and an overall sense of having played the game before, but for a title to pick up on sale, it will bring back some memories of Cave Story while you play through it, and it is enjoyable. Just don't expect Cave Story 2.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0zlBJWN3Xw\n\nLists:\n+:\nStrong level design adds to the game's variety over time and helps the simple mechanics succeed thanks to enemy placement and rearranging of hazards.\nSimple straight forward gameplay that feels polished, and doesn't go overboard in any one way. Feels like most pieces fit together with no issues.\nDifficulty curve is solid as there's a solid progression of it throughout the game, never having large gaps or peaks of difficulty, but a solid rise of it.\nControls feel at home here as opposed to the iOS.\nGun variety is simple but rewards smart use of each gun type and different gameplay styles.\nYou'll get some nostalgia for those who played Cave Story by the feel of the game.\nJumping takes a bit to get used to for some of the more tricky jumps, but it does settle down once you get an understanding of what the game is going for.\n-:\nSome boss fights miss badly being basically regular enemies with nothing really new to show for it.\nAudio options missing, and screen resolution options are really non existant. Even for a mobile port, it doesn't really do a good job of playing to the Steam strengths.\nSome jumps go for the extreme limit of jump height, leading no room for error, and frustration sets in.\nThose Expecting Cave Story 2 in terms of charm and story will need to look away, as it never hits that level.","November 12, 2015","true","3.5"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alphayak/recommended/292500/","alphayak","J-Mac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alphayak/","69 products in account","I really like this game, but this is not Cave Story. Cave Story was more explorative and had secrets hidden in little nooks and crannies like Super Metroid. Kero Blaster has a very linear progression, akin to something like Mega Man. This linear progression is a big strength, because enemy placement is supurb. I'm not going to go into any story aspects of this game, because I don't want to spoil much, also its not a game with a heavy story. I really enjoyed the stage design, like I said great enemy placement. The pallet choices were good, the pixely aesthetics takes me back to the old days. It's also got a great soundtrack, I mean can you really expect less of the guy who made other games like Cave Story and Ikachan. Studio Pixel did a great job with this release, I know it has been out for some time, but its nice to see it released on steam.\nThe only real downside is that you'll have to grind money off of enemies or die a lot in later stages to get your weapons and life meter maxed out, but grinding doesn't seem like that much of chore because this game can get hard. Especially if you're playing Zangyou Mode which is Kero Blasters new game+/ hard mode.

Where the game really shines in my opinion is how solid the mechanics are. All of the weapons are unique, useful, and fun to use (not to mention upgrade). The boss fights are great, and I always feel like I'm challenged just the right amount by them. The story is hardly very deep, but it's nevertheless charming.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mragdg/recommended/292500/","mragdg","mr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mragdg/","161 products in account","Kero Blaster is overall a great game. It has much charm and kept me hooked enough to unlock and beat all of the main content it could offer. Some may find the story lacking but I prefer this approach as opposed to too much dialogue or too many cutscenes. My only complaints have to do with a few very questionable design decisions that I feel keep it from being one of my top favorites.\n\nThere is an impressive controls menu that shows you a whole keyboard to map as you please. I did not play the game with a gamepad so I can't speak for that. I did not notice any input delay or lag while actually playing at any point which is so important in a game like this. You cannot use the mouse to navigate any of the menus though which seems like a pointless limitation. There is a scaling option but it does not work in fullscreen. Such a thing is easy to program, I have done so myself, and I'm disappointed to not see it there as I have poor eyesight and particularly benefit from this feature.\n\nThe weapons are designed very well. They all feel unique and serve their own purpose. You may find a favorite weapon but at least every now and then you'll need to take out another one to get an enemy around a corner or beat enemies in a much more efficient way.\n\nThe enemies themselves are very fair once you learn how they work and often require you to learn a new strategy to kill of them without taking damage. Some enemies don't hurt you unless you attack them and you can walk through them or bounce on them freely which came as a nice surprise as they were annoying otherwise.\n\nYou can upgrade weapons and boost your maximum health at certain points in the game. These are usually around halfway through a level, and you're left guessing as to where that is exactly. I felt very relieved whenever I saw one for the first time for each level because I knew it likely meant I got to refill my precious health or get a very welcomed upgrade to help me tackle enemies, sometimes in new ways. The prices are very high however, and I assume this is as a result of one of those questionable decisions I briefly mentioned.\n\nYou've got a finite amount of lives. When you die, you lose one and start back and the most recent save, otherwise there is no penalty for death. You do not lose any money by simply dying whatsoever. Saves happen very very often. When you lose all of your lives you get a 'Game Over' which starts you at the beginning of the level with everything you had before and 3 lives. If you happen to be low on health, beyond the rare store or beating the level your only opportunity to gain health is to kill an enemy and hope he drops some. It doesn't happen very often. Sometimes you'll carefully clear out an entire room and only get money. Sometimes you'll kill an enemy to restore three health even if you didn't need it. Sometimes they'll drop an extra life which is a big deal because a life is a free pass to restore all your health essentially.\n\nEvery time a level transitions all normal enemies respawn, enabling players to farm health and upgrades. If you're having trouble with a level or boss but only have one life left, then your best option is either to farm rooms and cross your fingers really hard or kill yourself and get three lives. Why not, you'll be back where you started but with a huge advantage in comparison. No real punishment other than consuming your time. I don't think beating a level restores your lives either. While on paper this system may look good, I believe it encouraged the developer to allow elements of trial and error to be introduced and balance things in such a way that accounts for players being more powerful than they would otherwise. It's okay if something is cheap because there's, again, no real punishment. I would much rather have lost all of my progress including the upgrades I bought that level if it meant that the game was more exciting and fair.\n\nThe platforming physics are frustrating. They're not buggy and work the way they are supposed to, it's just that they're so intentionally clunky. Movement on the ground is fine but your air control is so painfully lacking that I lost count of how many times I saw my fate at least a second away but could do nothing meaningful even with the jetpack. This happened to me a couple times with things that I had no way of knowing were coming too. Some would call that "artificial difficulty", I just think it's bad design in a game of this sort.\n\nIf you hold the shoot button in a certain direction, you're stuck aiming in that direction as you are moving. It's very helpful but you can't toggle in the menu or hold a key to activate/disactivate on hold whenever is appropriate. The way you aim horizontally is also determined by your momentum if not standing still, which makes this mechanic feel very sticky. If you stop shooting in a direction to shoot something that just came up behind you, you can't quickly flip in that direction and you have to unintuitively wait until the character can turn around.\n\nYou have four/five weapons to choose from eventually and have to switch between them one at a time which does not feel good. This is a computer game with rebindable keys, not a console game. I assume it supports a controller but there's no good reason why I can't have a key on my keyboard to select each of those weapons in particular once I get them at least.\n\nI would like to add context to these complaints by adding that I have beaten the true final boss of the freeware version Cave Story (can't write this review without mentioning it at least once) with just under the max health and without any health potions (unintentional gimp). I never felt like Kero Blaster was too hard, it's simply that it can be frustrating for the wrong reasons.\n\nThere is a boss rush mode but by the point you get there the game becomes too easy for it to be satisfying in my opinion. There's a timer though and you can easily play it again to improve that time. You can also of course intentionally put handicaps on yourself by not buying upgrades or starting a new file if you lose all your lives.\n\nAgain, I did enjoy this game a lot and would recommend it to anyone who likes cute platformers. If you're not a fan of moderately challenging ones and are only going to get the first ending it may not be worth the price however.\n\n\nSummary:\nIt's kind of like Cave Story but more clunky and with less obtrusive of a story. And it encourages grinding. But it's stil a lot of fun.","March 3","true","15.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

This is one of those well made games that don't revolutionize anything but just works. It's an action platformer, with lots of variety of environments and enemies.

Each time you die you keep all your money, so eventually you'll beat whatever part you're stuck by simply having more fire power. Bosses don't have to be beaten ever again! which is nice considering they are not only difficult but quite long.

This time around, the levels are pretty much "get to the goal, beat the boss and repeat" and the story is a bit more silly and japanese.\n\nPeople complain about it being too short but I thought it had a lot to offer: it has the main campaign, a harder remix of the main campaign with new levels and bosses, a boss rush, a New Game+ and challenging achievements.\n\nI would say that the price is a bit high and the graphics can be pretty simple, but other than that, it's a pretty solid platformer.\n\n8/10 Would work overtime again","April 3","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Timeswordsman/recommended/292500/","Timeswordsman","Times","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Timeswordsman/","242 products in account","Kero Blaster is a bit of an odd duck. It's the second major release from lone auteur game designer Pixel, who about a decade ago created the absolutely legendary Cave Story. Pixel has made a few small games here and there since then, but this is his second major retail release.\n\nLet me say first that if you liked Cave Story, you'll like Kero Blaster, and that's really because it's just more of the same. A few of the mechanics are changed up here and there and there's a much heavier emphasis on arcadey action than plot and characters, but when you get down to the shooty pew pew bits it plays exactly like Cave Story did.\nSomething that fans of Cave Story may not like, however, is that Kero Blaster is short, and comparitively easy. Veterans of Pixel's works will have no trouble breasing through the campaign. If, however, you are new to Pixel's games, then Kero Blaster would be an excellent start.\n\nFrom a personal view, I enjoyed the game a lot, but I did find it lacking in some regards. The "prologue" game Pink Hour gave the impression that Kero Blaster would, like Cave Story, be a story driven exploration game rather than a linear arcade shooter, and I get the distinct impression that was the original intention. Environments are detailed and interesting, and buyable upgrades are priced in such a way as to suggest a longer game. I feel like Kero Blaster is a game that the devoloper got bored of and just wanted to get out the door so he could move on to something new. This is supported by most of the music, sound effects, and even some of the assets and sprites being recycled from Cave Story, which is odd when Pixel is well known for his MIDI music and pixel art, AND because there were new sprites and music in PInk Hour.\n\nHere's the break down:\n\nPros\n- Fun, high action shooter with extremely tight controls.\n- Four interesting weapons to choose from, each one feeling unique and special.\n- What new sprites there are are cute and endearing.\n\nCons\n- Short, perhaps three hours if you have a lot of trouble, and two if you don't.\n- There's very little story. What's there is cute and funny, but it feels rushed.\n- The entire game has an aire of partialness, like this is only part of a game. A really good part to be sure, but incomplete.\n\nIn closing, I recommend Kero Blaster because it's a fun little diversion, but since it's so short and lacking in plot, it'd be best if you picked it up on sale. The base price is a little much for what you get, but it's still a great game.\n","February 23","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To start off, if you're looking for a veritable Cave Story 2, this isn't it. Kero blaster is less Metroidvania and more Arcade side scroller.\n\nIn the game you play as a Frog who is part of the Custodial Sciences division of a company and has to kill strange alien creatures. To do so, you have a variety of upgradable weapons to fight with. Health is dealt with in what I would call a mix of Zelda and Mario style. You have a certain number of hearts and when you run out you lose one of the three lives you started with.\n\nI really enjoyed the game so far. The bosses are interesting, the enemies are unexpectedly challenging, and the upgrades are deffinitely worth the gold you spend on them. In addition you have a seemingly simple plot running in the background about the Frog's boss.\n\nOverall if you're looking for a solid Arcade platformer, Kero Blaster is the way to go. It's simple, the controls are tight, and you play as a frog. What more could you ask for?","December 6, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've been a fan of pixels work for a long time, so it blew my mind that this game was so mediocre.  The game lacked the freedom of movement and challenge of Cave Story. It didn't even have the relaxing atmosphere of ikkachan.  It sat in a boring middle ground; not too easy, but never satisfyingly challenging.  The recent update changed that.\nThe base gameplay is the same as release.  You are a frog that shoots its way through linear levels with various weapons that you obtain as the game progresses.  Gunplay is similar to Cave Story's; with the adition of the ability to shoot while walking backwards and the removal of aiming downward.  You can collect coins when you kill enemies, and these can be spent in shops to upgrade your health and weapons.\nKero Blaster now has an additional campaign that unlocks upon  finishing the original set of levels, and that is where the real fun begins.  While the original levels were boringly easy, the new levels are seriously challenging.  This new set of levels really makes the gameplay shine, and the game now feels like it belongs with pixels other classics.","November 18, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have multiple different guns to play around with, each with 4-3 tiers of upgrades which can be purchased through coins you collect throughout the levels.\n\nAt first the game might seem a bit easy and simplistic, but as you progress the challenge ramps up and the game becomes a blast to play. This challenge increase definitely comes into play with the two extra game-modes which change up the base game in interesting ways and really test the skills you've built up thus far.\n\nAll-in-all the game isn't incredibly long but you can easily get 10+ hours out of all of the game-modes.

I've been a fan of pixels work for a long time, so it blew my mind that this game was so mediocre.  The game lacked the freedom of movement and challenge of Cave Story. It didn't even have the relaxing atmosphere of ikkachan.  It sat in a boring middle ground; not too easy, but never satisfyingly challenging.  The recent update changed that.\nThe base gameplay is the same as release.  You are a frog that shoots its way through linear levels with various weapons that you obtain as the game progresses.  Gunplay is similar to Cave Story's; with the adition of the ability to shoot while walking backwards and the removal of aiming downward.  You can collect coins when you kill enemies, and these can be spent in shops to upgrade your health and weapons.\nKero Blaster now has an additional campaign that unlocks upon  finishing the original set of levels, and that is where the real fun begins.  While the original levels were boringly easy, the new levels are seriously challenging.  This new set of levels really makes the gameplay shine, and the game now feels like it belongs with pixels other classics.","November 18, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game leaves weapon and health upgrades in the hands of the player, and depending on skill there's quite a bit of nuance to be had with a playthrough. The generous money system is there to bail players out should things get too frustrating.\n\nOnce you finish your first playthrough the new Zangyou Mode becomes available, and this is where Kero Blaster really hits its stride. Remixed stages and and a slew of new enemies and bosses provide a juicy enough side story for new players, as well as a challenging incentive for players who played Kero Blaster the first time around to give the game a second look.\n\nOverall the locations are imaginative, the spritework is charming, and the difficulty is brutal.

Unlike Cave Story, the game has almost no "Metroidvania" elements in it's design. Instead weapons and upgrades are unlocked naturally as you progress through the seven levels. There's no back travel function, so when you beat level 1 you can't go back to it short of starting a new game.\n\nAs far as difficulty is concerned, it is easier than Cave Story. An auto save function allows you, for the most part, to effectively retry rooms with no major downside except towards the finale when the checkpoints start breaking up by several screens rather than one. As long as you don't die (and the menu button can be brought up at any point so even if you miss a jump and plummet into a pit as long as you're quick enough you can still retry no consquence.) you can keep retrying infinitely if needed. That said, Hard mode, or "Zangyou" mode is a definite challenge with it's own storyline. It revamps existing content IE new stage layouts, enemies and even boss patterns are slightly or completely different. Long time Pixel fans, or even just players who enjoy a good challenge will greatly enjoy this mode, as normal mode is decidedly lacking in serious difficulty until the last sections of the game.\n\nGameplay is fun and basically a more straight-forward version of Cave story system with some key differences. Instead of weapon exp, money drops, which can be used to upgrade weapons or buy defensive items like more health or revive jar. Weapons no longer downgrade if hurt enough, and stay consistent. Like Cave Story, each weapon has at least 3 stages. Each one progressively better than the last. Some weapons even have a fourth stage. There's a total of 5 weapons in the game, one of which is a secret. They're all very useful and surprisingly well balanced. If you're the type to stick with one weapon, you'll probably have trouble in certain parts, but for the most part every weapon works exceedingly well in all situations the game presents. In order to max all the weapons though, expect to do a bit of grinding. If you ignore defensive upgrades you should have to do relatively little though, something else rewarding good play.\n\nMusic and level design are pretty much what I expect from Pixel. Nothing really stands out as much as some of his other soundtracks, but I still absolutely enjoy Kero Blaster OST. Levels too, probably aren't his best work but his stage design is very "fair". Most area gimmicks or traps are explained in safe areas to give you a heads up and nothing really is "trial and error" about Kero Blaster. It's difficulty is extremely honest and if you die it's usually on you, not because of a cheap death. The story is kind of non-existant, very simple story. It's very cute in a way, particularly with it's foreshadowing.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice little sidegrade to his other work, Cave Story. It does some things better and some things worse. If you're a mega pixel fan you'll be happy to know it definitely delivers. If you're a casual fan you'll find this probably MORE enjoyable. Even if you've never played a run and gun platformer before, this game is probably one of the best examples of a place to start. Either way, I hope you have as much fun as I did.","November 22, 2015","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is more leisurely paced than other games of the same genre, like the Contras; success here depends largely on correct weapon selection and intelligent steering of the slow-walking, high-jumping main character.  There may be a lot of games like this, even many that are flashier and faster, but few have the shining spirit, perfect balance, or sense of fun that Kero has.  Truly, it's in a class of its own.  A lot of people are disappointed that the story of the game doesn't follow the same epic science-fantasy track that Cave Story does, and that's a real pity; Kero Blaster's tale of a plasma rifle-toting frog janitor's battle against digital demons and "work-producing" machines may not bring a tear to your eye, but it's really cute and filled with great ideas.  It's a perfect match for the game type and visual style.\n\nI beat the original Playism version a year ago and loved it, but didn't think it was quite the equal of the astounding Cave Story.  After having played the considerably spiced-up Steam version, I completely take it back!  This new and improved iteration includes "Zangyou" mode:  a hardmode that not only cranks up the difficulty, but remixes the levels, adds new enemies, a new story and new cutscenes, and completely replaces the last stage with a new huge, awesome level culminating in a gauntlet of bizarre bosses who put anything in normal mode to shame for weirdness.  It's no exaggeration to say that Zangyou, which only unlocks after beating the game once, makes up a good 50% of Kero Blaster's unique content!  Now THAT'S how you do a hardmode!\n\nAnother top-flight game for Pixel's portfolio!","December 4, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The jumping mechanic can be a bit awkward; however, it rarely impacted much as there isn't a whole lot of precision platforming.\n\nDefinitely worth a purchase if you haven't tried it already!","May 15","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your task as a player is to get to the end of the stage and defeat the boss.\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay is quite basic, and rightly, so given that the game was inspired by old classics such as Mega Man or Contra. You move Kero with the arrow keys, jump with Z, and fire with X. You can also fire in 3 directions: up, left, and right. Whenever you start firing, your firing locks into whatever direction you started firing in, allowing you to strafe. Kero's movements are a bit slippery and floaty, but you get used to it. Eventually you'll find more weapons that you can switch between with the A and Z keys. You can also buy things from the shop with all the hard-earned cash you collected! Finally, there is a jetpack which offers you further momentum and allows you to reach higher places. Surprisingly, the jetpack feels like it actually has some weight to it, which is impressive for such a simple game. In short, it feels good.\nPRESENTATION\nMost people have something that furthers their interest in a specific game and makes them want to finish it, whether it's the gameplay or the story. In Kero Blaster, the presentation is what kept me going. Simply put, the graphics are stunning and the music is perfect. In more detail, Pixel's art style used in the game creates emotions for the player to experience, as with the music. When you're in the ice level, the color palette is mainly whites and blues, creating this sense of a calm, cool atmosphere and the music complements it, while the stark greys and other industrial type colors give off the impression of danger or fear. The song that plays during the first part of the 6th stage is one of the most suprisingly dark & depressing themes I've heard in a video game. My favorite part would have to be the second part of the 6th stage. The colors mixed in with the scenery make you feel like you're experiencing a part of someone's past that they would like to forget, and the music, while nothing spectacular, is INCREDIBLY effective, making you feel cold and distant. Pixel knows how to strike certain emotions, and It just gets better the more you play. It's incredible, nuff said.\nDIFFICULTY\nNow comes my LEAST favorite part of this game. Don't get me wrong, I love a challenge, and Kero Blaster isn't even that hard. But it seems to have taken my least favorite aspect from the 8-bit era into account-cheap encounters. As in, "HOW IN THE WORLD WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?!!". One time an enemy fell from the sky right     as I entered a room. Another time, a bird flew in right as I was about to leave a room and killed me! How is THAT fair? Sometimes while you are focusing on one thing, you don't notice the other thing coming to get you, like a falling ceiling light, for instance. And whenever you game over, you have to start from the VERY beginning! Even on the really long last level! One more nitpick is that Kero is kind of slow, making it hard to dodge stuff when things get crazy. Even though it can be cheap though, it can still provide you with a fair challenge, and those moments are usually a lot of fun.\nTL;DR\nI liek the colors and sceenery and the music it's gud and gamplay is gud but the difficulty can be cheap.\n8/10","May 25","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excellentist/recommended/292500/","excellentist","FantasticPancake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excellentist/","363 products in account","From the developer of Cave Story, Kero Blaster is a solid game with plenty of polish and sensible design choices. I occasionally found myself going through levels multiple times because I ran out of lives against bosses, but nothing felt particularly unfair, and each new trip through a level rewarded me with enough money to upgrade a weapon or my maximum health.\n\nThe levels provide a variety of challenges, from fast paced reaction-based combat with a large group of fast enemies to slow, precision-based platforming. The game organically paces itself by switching up the style of challenge and the speed of gameplay.\n\nIt has a wonderful hard mode which is really more of an epilogue (or part 2, I guess), with totally new levels sharing similar themes and bosses, and an entirely different final level with five new boss fights.\n\nA quality game lasting about 8 hours that I'd recommend to anyone who wants a fun, light-hearted jump-and-shoot style platformer.","June 4","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
