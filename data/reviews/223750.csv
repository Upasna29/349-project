"http://steamcommunity.com/id/razoleg/recommended/223750/","razoleg","Cunning Fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/razoleg/","664 products in account","This game can break you or it can make you. You'll know what a real "achievement" is when you take off in a helicopter 7 hours later and realise you know every switch in the cockpit. You find yourself reading books about hydrodynamics, aerodynamics and your reader library starts to look like a spy's wet dream with military plane manuals, charts, quick start guides and startup checklists. You can then distinguish MiG -15bis from MiG-17F, you start talking in abbreviations. Your right hand is getting really buff... because it takes a lot of force to keep that joystick in proper position for horisontal flight as older planes have basic trim and no autopilot. You then try to come back to normal life, but you don't understand why people don't know what Mach 1 is, what is the Bernulli's formula and how it relates to aerodynamics, how translational lift is achieved. Your hard disk isn't filled with porn or memes, it's filled with pictures of aircraft in random liveries that you flawlessly copy in Photoshop, you then learn how to actually use Photoshop properly. Radio talk is nothing new to you - you know what "Fox-1" is and the difference between "right 3 o'clock" and "3 o'clock", you know the distinction between UHF, VHF and what TACAN is. You buy books about seemingly forgotten conflicts, like war in Angola, and you read any bit of information related to airforces, airplanes, pilots. You actually know how to avoid a missile, what every strange beep and tone at every frequency is related to, your normal daily conversations with just about anyone usually start with "Did you know that nearly 50% of all Thunderchiefs were destroyed in 'Nam?" You have a strange aversion to civilian pilots and you cringe when you hear the word "captain" in relation to one of them. You actually know what aircraft are shown in the news... You then separate your steam library into "games" and "DCS".\n\n\n-----\n\nTThe serious part of the review.\n\nP.S. Do not go to steam forums - the moderators are horrible and the community is offensive to say the least. Do not expect them to help you. It's so bad they don't even know English well (kazareal - I'm looking at you) and they ban everyone save for 5 "groupies" that constantly lurk the forums whilst stroking mod's egoes (Don't belive me? Look at discussions and see which people comment - they are all the same five-six accounts). Go to Hoggit. ED Forums are filled with banhappy moderators as well. Do not join "military" clans like TAW or whatnot. You will be prompted and nearly forced to - do not react. Do not reply. It's a game, games are for fun - go ahead and fly with friends, but for the love of Icarus do not join any of these "brofessional" clans.\n\nA little video showing how the developers and moderators treat the community: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FkiuqhS9cY\n\nA few threads about the community:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/223750/discussions/0/496879865901775177/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/223750/discussions/0/364042063118084442/","November 24, 2015","true","114.8"," 869 of 906 people (96%) found this review helpful 593 people found this review funny","96","869","906","593","30"

I've since got a flight stick, trackIR coming, all because of this game. It's my current favorite thing to do on a PC right now.\n\nIf your a sim veteran, you'll fit right in.

If that's what you're looking for, go download War Thunder; you'll  have hours of fun with it.  DCS is a high fidelity simulation geared towards pilots, sim-heads and plane geeks -- of which I am all three, therefore I absolutely adore it.  If you fall into that same category, go ahead and push the download button then come back to finish reading.  If, however, you're an average gamer looking to jump into a plane and start blowing away the bad guys, it's very likely that you'll be sorely disappointed with DCS.\n\nThe focus in DCS is realism, literally down to every switch, knob and light bulb.  The people who love this simulation crave detail, and it provides that in spades.  But you must love to fly.  I don't mean you glance at planes occasionally and think, "That's cool."  I mean you have to be the sort of guy who spent hours and days and months as a little boy thumbing through books about planes, watching television shows about them, and generally absorbing every detail you could.  You skipped meals and let your rent run late as a young adult so you could afford your next lesson in a beat-up old 152 at the local asphalt strip.  You have strong opinions about the viability of the F-22 vis-a-vis the F-15 on a cost/return ratio.  In other words, you eat, sleep and breathe aircraft.\n\nDCS is a plane hobbyist's dream, and it is deliciously difficult, providing an enormous feeling of accomplishment for every task:  cold starts, taxiing, take offs, radio navigation, and landing are just a few examples.  The combat is simply the icing on the cake; the real object here is learning to fly the various aircraft in all their hyper-detailed glory:  cussing when you burn out the starter on the P-51 because you forgot to turn the fuel booster pump on; reveling in a successful crosswind landing on a short strip at dusk; setting up a clean Maverick attack and executing it perfectly then rolling off into a valley; or finding an airfield at the last possible moment and bringing a damaged bird in on fumes and prayers.\n\nI suppose you could use the arcade mode settings, but I can't for the life of me imagine why you would choose to do so.  It would be missing the entire reason that DCS exists.  That's like buying a liter bike and putting training wheels on it.  There is no dynamic campaign, there are damned few missions, and there's no progression model, (and thank God for that).  It's a simulator, not a game.  The planes are the stars; the handful of pre-made missions are just there for when don't feel like creating your own.  Sometimes, just flying a radnav loop above a thick overcast can be relaxing.\n\nAs for the individual aircraft modules, I own a majority of them.  They are all uniformly excellent, though you should stick to the aircraft which use the pro flight model and fully interactive cockpits.  Several of them, such as the F-15 and Su-27, are just ports from Lock-On; avoid those.  Of all the modules I own, the F-86 is the one I keep coming back to time and again.  It has a special charm, being at the leading edge in the early days of jet-vs-jet combat.  The sound is stunning (it sounds exactly like a real jet turbine; crank  up the surround sound), and the plane is easy to learn.  Note that when I say "easy," I've thousands of sim hours and hundreds of civ-av hours.  I adapted pretty quickly, but if you're new to realistic simulations, it will probably take you several hours just to figure out start-up, taxi and take-off.  Once learned, however, the plane rewards you quickly, with a feeling of speed unparalleled in simulations to date.  A dogfight versus a MiG-15 will give you an appreciation for the high speeds and energy envelopes involved, the enormous scope of the battle, and the difficulty of hitting a small, fast target with nothing but machine guns.  It's less a knife fight and more like a ballet -- if ballets were performed on salt flats in Formula One race cars.   Note that I recommend you start out by learning the art of jet-powered gun passes against an unarmed transport.  Practice that for several hours before moving  up to targets that shoot back.  Otherwise, you'll be watching that MiG from a parachute.\n\nA couple other modules which stand out for their excellence are the MiG-21 and the UH-1 Huey.  I have reviewed the latter separately; search my review library.  They're all good, of course.  The best part is that you don't have to buy a single plane to get started:  the Su-25T and the TF-51D are included in the free download.  All you War Thunder mouse heroes, try the TF-51 and prepare to be humbled.  You just THINK you know how to fly.\n\nAs with any high fidelity simulation, I strongly recommend HOTAS equipment with rudder pedals, as well as TrackIR.  You'll have to spend some time setting up your controllers and tweaking your curves.  Accept this right now, or you'll get frustrated.  This is a program for adults, not impatient children.  Also, DCS provides excellent support for triple-monitor systems like Nvidia Surround, you're golden if you're a superwide or ultrawide resolution guy.\n\nHey, it's free; try it out.  Just set your expectations for what you're getting into.  If you're looking to be shooting down the Hun five minutes after the download completes, you'll almost certainly be wasting your time here.  But if you had internalized "lifty-thrusty-draggy" by the age of 12 and are still willing to engage in a lengthy debate about the relative merits of the XB-70 Valkyrie program, you'll adore DCS.  It was made just for you.  Welcome home.","May 16, 2015","true","95.7"," 441 of 482 people (91%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","91","441","482","43","20"

I have played for over 700 hours(this only includes DCS flight time, I've played Lock on 1.0 and FC1 for 500 hours too) and I don't get bored of the series. There is a variety of aircraft and helicopters that are currently out as modules to the game which are sold seperatly. I have all the module and have tried out each and every one. The DCS modules include the A-10C, P-51D, KA-50, UH-1H Huey, MI-8 MTV2 Magnificent Eight and the TF-51D (Recon aircraft, which comes free with DCS world).\n\nEvery DCS module has amazing detail and requires you to study on how the aircraft start up and how the aircraft functions. If you enjoy studying things before you try them out you will definetly love this sim. You can also just jump into the cockpit and mess about which is fun but the most fun is studying the sim and getting the aircraft up in the air, then the next step is employing the weapons which is even more fun. There is a module called Flaming Cliffs which is a good module for people who don't enjoy much of the study aspect of flight simulators and they can just jump in and hit a few keyboard buttons and get the plane started in less than 40 seconds.\n\nThe F-15C (New Update introduced the AFM (Advanced Flight Model) which makes the aircraft much more realistic), SU-27, SU-33, MIG-29A, MIG-29S are the flaming cliffs aircraft, these aircraft allow you to perform CAP (Combat Air Patrols), BARCAP (Barrier Combat Air Patrols) etc. Whilst the DCS: A-10C can be used for CAS (Close Air Support), FAC (Forward Air Controller) etc. Each aircraft in the game as shown above can perform various tasks but you also need to know the aircrafts limits in what roles it cannot perform, This will help you not get killed!\n\nOverall, I Highly recommend this game if you enjoy military flight simulators and enjoy learning about how aircraft operate and how to use each aircraft weapons systems, Navigation systems etc. If you don't like the study aspect as said above you can just get the Flaming Cliffs DLC and hop into one of the faster jets and shoot some unlucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down.","April 28, 2014","true","43.4"," 167 of 191 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","167","191","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinxis/recommended/223750/","blinxis","Blinxis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinxis/","283 products in account","DCS world offers quite a few modules that really add variety to the game. The engine and flying dynamics are a sight to experience just by themselves. I didn't really know what I was jumping into when I bought this game. I've played Microsoft Flight Simulator x, X-Plane 10, Wings of Prey, and IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 for a few years now. But all of a sudden had an "itch" for a modern military flight simulator with an up-to-date game engine. If you're in the same boat, or unsure if whether or not you want this game, then please keep reading.\n\nPros:\nFlight dynamics- Easily one of the coolest features in this game. Every aircraft has a different "feel" to it. It's still a bit of a shock to fly one particular aircraft for so long, and then swap to another. DCS offers view modifiers when flying this aircraft. The player can experience positive and negative G forces (in the game of course), while straining their body to turn in on a MIG for an air kill. But be careful, straining the aircraft too hard can cause aircraft issues from instrument failures, to having it's wings/rotors completely ripped off in a realistic fashion. I can't tell you how many times I've been "downed" for blacking out pulling hard G's.\n\nEngine- What first caught me off guard starting this game was the engine limitations. At first I thought the map size covered a very small section of Georgia, then after learning how to pull up the map...I was in shock. It covers roughly 80% of Georgia, spots in Turkey and Armenia, and approximately 150NM into Russia...and yes, this is all one map! Not only is the map pretty large, but the graphics themselves are stunning. Not the "best graphics I've ever seen", but it's probably one of the best that you'll get for a combat flight sim.\n\nAI- The complexity that goes into how the AI handle ground vehicles and aircraft are simply amazing. And you're not stuck on a single difficulty setting, You can tune EACH INDIVIDUAL aircraft/vehicle,infantry, or whatever to suit your abilities! The AI will react to whatever you do near or at them accordingly. You spin up your GAU and lob a few rounds near a tank, they'll get the hell out of there. You see enemy AIs flying over a friendly SAM, the SAM will prioritize air threats and act based off of threat level. They see a wingman go down, they'll probably buzz out for the day. Just one of the many things you'll encounter against AI.\n\nCustom missions- I was so excited to see that I had the option to create my own missions/campaigns. The ability to make the combat environment more dynamic by the minute really adds immersion to the game. I can't say that I've found an online game so far that was playing a default mission from the game. I can't say that I wasn't excited to have the option to watch a bomber drop 16 Stand-off munitions against a single SAM unit.\n\nAttention to detail- Usually when it comes to flight sims, there's one thing that lacks from anyones expectations, and that's the detailing. I'm defining attention to detail as a graphical representation of minor details within the engine. Details within the cockpit are phenomenal! The glass on the Instrument panels reflect the surroundings, the sun beaming into the cockpit reveal microscopic scratches on the outside of the cockpit as well as the metal panels surrounding the pilot. The heavy breathing of the pilot when making difficult maneuvers. The list goes on!\n\nActive developers/community- The devs update this game to FIX known issues within the games, before they consider adding anything new, and this is a big thing for me. I'm tired of seeing other devs pushing updates that focus on new features without fixing the previous features of the game. So far updates have been rolling in between 1 and 2 month intervals, which honestly is a good pace for this game. Aside from the devs themselves, we have the community. The user downloads page on DCS's website is full of downloadable content, whether it's a new skin, texture mod, or a whole new\ncampaign for the players to enjoy. There's also tons of multiplayer servers up-kept and ran by the community as I write this. A polite and professional group of individuals to say the least.\n\n\nCons:\nComplex- I would honestly not recommend this game to someone who has NEVER played a flight simulator before, UNLESS you want to experience a challenge of reading tons of pages of information on how to fly the aircraft. However, there are ways around this, such as having automatic start-ups, and basic controls for flight. If you just want to learn how to do maneuvers in an aircraft, then you can always revert to the mission editor and create your own mission to start in the air...without air or ground threats if you prefer that. This game would also be impossible for newer players if they don't have a joystick of some sort. Playing using only your keyboard and mouse, or a standard gamepad controller will not do you any good.\n\nNew Aircraft- I'm not saying new aircraft themselves are a bad thing, it's just how they release it. For some reason whenever a new aircraft goes beta for DCS, they start by selling it on their website, and not steam. Before they had the option to redeem keys bought on their site to steam, but has been removed since then. This puts the DCS community at a slight disadvantage, because now there's less DCS enthusiasts testing a new feature for it's main release. Which in turn, may hold the slight potential of having bugs slip through the cracks for release. But that's just my opinion.\n\nTerrain- Yes the world is huge, and has endless flying space, but my main snipe is that the hills/mountains are too "sharp". They don't even have a gradual incline/decline to them. It's hardly noticeable from a higher altitude, but CAS aircraft/Helis would be able to notice it quite easily.\n\nFinal verdict:\nAll in all, DCS: World's pros easily outweigh the cons when it comes down to playability. I have no doubt in my mind that flight simulator enthusiasts who crave a modern day flight simulator will get to experience a game that will fulfill that satisfaction of Air superiority.\n\n-"Blinx"","July 27, 2014","true","692.4"," 109 of 114 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","109","114","0","2"

No matter what your taste in aircraft or flying may be, there is fun to be had in DCS.\n\nYou can purchase aircraft from a wide number of time periods, from WWII, The Korean War, and even modern battlefields. There's also some very nice helicopters to purchase, but I can't comment on those, as I don't have any.. ;-;\n\nIf you like CAS, BVR, Dogfighting or just screwing around with friends in fast aircraft, DCS World is most certainly worth trying. The free aircraft you get, the SU-25T and TF-51 give you a pretty good feel for what you can expect in DCS, but I definitely reccomend picking up a full fidelty module if you like it, great fun learning what all the alarms mean... ._.\n\nOne quick note though, getting the game directly from the developers is a better choice than Steam, as the version from ED's site gives you earlier access to new modules, updates, and let's you buy modules from sales on ED's site AND Steam, which cannot be done with the Steam version ;D\n\ntl;dr : BUY IT AND YOU CAN CRASH TOO :D","October 30, 2014","true","4.8"," 145 of 163 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","145","163","9","0"

If you only want to play with a keyboard and mouse, or even a controller, DCS World is not for you.  If you enjoy flying the C172 in FSX with arcade settings, DCS World is not for you.  If you want a SIMULATOR that will take time, practice, and a good set of controls to become somewhat decent at, then this may be exactly what you are looking for.\n\nThe free SU-25T that this game comes with is incredible.  The quality and attention to detail is beyond anything I have ever seen in a freeware aircraft for another simulator, and, frankly, in most payware ones as well.  I found it relatively easy to fly, and the controls were pretty simple after mapping most of them to my joystick.  The missions are decent, and even after purchasing a few DLCs I still find myself coming back to blow up some tanks in the SU-25T.\n\nWhile purchasing DLCs is optional, you will definitely want to find a good joystick and throttle; the more buttons the better.  I have been using the Saitek X-55 Rhino HOTAS system and Pro Flight rudder pedals, and I still often wish I had more buttons for my  Ka-50.  TrackIR or something similar is also highly recommended.  Don't even try to play this with a keyboard and mouse - you'll save yourself a lot of frustration.\n\nMost of the negative reviews here are complaining about the complexity of the game.  And honestly, I don't blame them.  Eagle Dynamics published a hard-cover, 534 page manual for the Ka-50 for $189.  But there is nothing more rewarding than actually putting the time in to learn how to fly it and knowing that if you ever had the chance to fly one in real life, you would know exactly how to do it.  The Air National Guard used the DCS A-10c to train pilots transitioning from the A-10a the the A-10c.  This is clearly not *just* a game.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure what else to say.  This is by far the best air combat simulator you will ever get your hands on outside of the military.  If you're serious about flight/air combat simulation, by all means download this.  Even if you're not sure, try it anyway; it's free.  Just please don't leave negative reviews because it's not an arcade flying game; that's not what it's supposed to be.\n\n10/10\n\nSorry for being so serious :3","November 27, 2015","true","57.0"," 104 of 111 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","104","111","7","7"

It has such a realistic feel that not many flight simulators have. When I started I was just using the free modules, once I got hooked I started spending money on the game. The first module I bought was the UH-1H Huey and if you have ever played with it you will know how big of a learning curve there is. The Ka-50 is like flying with butter (it means its easy) unlike the Huey where you need to put the pedals and stick to a certain position so you can get into a good hover. If you ever look at the manuaIs for some of the aircraft it goes so indepth I feel like I'm acually studying to fly the thing. I love this game.\n\nPrices: The prices for each module tell you what kind of experience you will get. In most cases cheap modules will give you a non-clickable cockpit and less functions. In most cases more expensive modules will give you a clickable cockpit more function. Each module is like a new game. It's pretty simple.\n\nBugs: The game has bugs like anyother. At this point I have been able to shrug them off and laugh at them. There are a couple screenshots on my profile of the bugs.\n\nConclusion: If you want a realistic military aircraft simulator, you dont mind spending money on modules, and you can be patient when learning a new aircraft this is probably the game for you.\n\nThank you for reading my review.","June 27, 2015","true","653.4"," 97 of 103 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","97","103","7","0"

However, that should be common knowledge. The reason I am writing this is to address an issue that keeps cropping up. When people write negative reviews say "Oh my god, the DLC is so expensive. WTF were the creators thinking?", that really pisses me off. The modules are separate games. Hear me? SEPARATE. GAMES. On the DCS website, you buy them individually. However, steam puts them in the DLC section, probably for ease of access. I am going to say this one more time. The "DLC" is not DLC. They are games on their own. They need DCS world to open them though, (Something I learned the hard way) but that does not mean they are DLC.

This part is free to use and you get the Su-25T with it, a Russian ground attack aircraft thats really fun to fly.\n\nThe additional modules/aircraft you add can be classified as "Medium Fidelity" and "High Fidelity". For a quick example, the Su-25T is a mid fidelity aircraft, to start the aircraft on the parking lot you press Shift + L to turn on the avionics, Ctrl + L to turn on the navigation lights, Alt + Home and Ctrl + Home to start left and right engines and then you are ready to taxi adn take off. Hi fidelity like the Ka-50 and A-10C on the other hand you start the aircraft up by following the actual, real-life procedures with clickable switches and buttons in the cockpit. This will require a lot of study and practise.\n\nThe Flaming Cliffs 3 module includes the aircraft from Lock On Modern Air Combat, updated to work with DCS World. These are of the "mid fidelity" type aircraft and contain some awesome fighter jets.\n\nAnother module is Combined Arms. The main feature of this module is that you take control of almost any ground unit (tanks and stuff!), and coordinate in strike missions with other players in aircraft, BUT, you can also drive around and shoot your cannon, surfice to air missiles, artillery, rockets and it is awesome fun in single player too (albeit not simulated very realistically). There are also rumors that you may also be able to control sea units sometime in the future.\n\nIf you like aircraft, like to study how machines work and like fire laser guided missiles and drop GPS guided bombs this is the game for you!","October 26, 2014","true","404.4"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","45","51","2","0"

DCS World comes with the SU-25t which includes tutorials, multiplayer, a campaign, single missions and a mission editor. It's an entire game, for free!\n\nThe best part of DCS World is the ability to combine the various modules, DCS: A-10C and Combined arms for example. All the modules are linked through DCS World and therefore you can play on the same server as someone else flying/controlling different vehicles to you in one big battlespace! So if you fancy taking on a highly realistic combat simulation then pick up DCS A-10C for DCS World. If you want something a little more forgiving then you can grab hold of Flaming Cliffs A-10A.\n\nMore and more aircraft are being added all the time, with the F-15, F/A-18, MiG 29, SU-27 and SU-33 expected fairly soon. There are also sims for the Mi-8, Huey, KA-50 Black Shark and also the P-51D Mustang!\n\nIf you love aircraft and want to jump into something more true to life than 'Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X' then this is the product for you!\n\n(Joystick with rudder function and some kind of head tracking system is highly recommended! Facetracknoir is free and works with any webcam)\n\nOverall this game is fantastic if you are into modern aviation and don't mind a somewhat steep learning curve.\n\n\nIn case you were wondering (as others have) The reason steam thinks I have not spent any time AT ALL playing this game is because I use a non-steam shortcut to play it, the standard shortcut that steam provides does not work with the steam overlay for me. So before you start making clever remarks about how I know about the game, just bear that in mind :)\n\nI get no benefit from having written this review, it is for your benefit so why would I lie about it? it's absurd lol.

If you're looking for a mouse and keyboard game, and a game to play with your 14 dollar joystick - War Thunder is a click away and will probably wet your panties like no other.\n\nSecond entertaining reads are about game stability or performance. Problem #1: Get the game from the developers and not off Steam. Been Using Eagle sims for 5+ years, and like ANY other flight sim game - they will crash, and periodically set your machine on fire. Simulators are not games you load up to test your UB3R:L33T gaming rig on - play Crisis. Sims have more processes going on than your mother on menopause - so PHAT FRAMEZ will not be achieved here. See War Thunder.\n\nThis sim is split down the middle with accurately modelled aircraft and "10 button" fighter jets. The DLC's that are expensive are aircraft that are detailed down to the ♥♥♥ sweat left on your seat. They act, fly, and control like the real thing - and that's what you're paying for. Regular sims dedicated to a single aricraft were also set to sell at 30-50 dollars back in the flight sim golden era. This game comes for free with a dedicated aircraft: SU-25, complete with tutorials and a myriad of controls and commands. This aircraft alone will keep you busy, and gives you the ability to fly with others. Simulators like this are fantastic and require you to put the time in - and you will be rewarded for it if flying these types of simulators is your thing.\n\n10/10 - Strongly recommend this to anyone interested in putting some time and dedication into a combat simulator.","February 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 166 of 253 people (66%) found this review helpful 83 people found this review funny","66","166","253","83","10"

Through out three seperate installs I have logged over 200 hours and regret not one second. DCS offers unmatched realism, but not only is it realistic at being a simulator, it is fantastic at simulating what it is like to be a military pilot, this is what in my opionion sets DCS apart from all other simulators. I have noticed that many complain about the price of the module, trust me they are worth every penny, you will most likely spend somewhere north of three hours reading through the manuals, five hours practicing the procedures, at least twenty hours learning and perfecting techniques in that aircraft, and then countless hours enjoying yourself in the cockpit of a legendary fighter aircraft. You never will get screwed over by a low quality overpriced addon as you would in FSX or Xplane, as Eagle Dynamics is very picky about the content made for their game, they ensure you get a realistic flight model, a cockpit full of a bunch of buttons that each their own purpose, and a way to throw ayay a ridiculous amount of time. The SU-25 and TF-51 are not made to be permanent, they are meant to introduce you to the dynamics of the sim, I would reccomend buying the A-10 and spend some time in it and then decide that you love this game as the SU-25 and TF-51 are not an accurate reflection of what this game really is.","May 3","true","47.1"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

The unarmed version of legendary WWII Mustang - the TF-51, and Russian twin-engine ground attack jet Su-25T.\nThe TF-51 comes with fully clickable/interactive cockpit - means you can move every button with your mouse.\nThe Su-25T does not have this feature but it comes with large variety of weapons.\nI can safely say that both free planes (the TF-51 especially) are on pair with some pay-ware add-ons for other flightsims. The TF-51 model and flight dynamics are really amazing.\nFree DCS also includes powerful map editor - you can create your own missions, scenarios or even whole campaigns.\nSim also allows you to play in MP with your friends.\nThanks to that you can get hours of entertainment with out paying anything extra.\nRegarding the map - so far its still the same old Caucasus theater but its big enough for all those war birds.\n\nWhat you can buy:\nVarious planes and helicopters called "Modules" made by ED or third party companies, additional campaigns, additional maps (currently Nevada terrain only) and expansion called Combined Arms that allows you to control many ground units and even atni-aircraft batteries.\nPlanes included in Flaming Cliffs pack does not have clickable cockpits and are more simplified, other modules are pretty much stand alone study sims. Those are not "cosmetic dlc planes" - every DCS module is a in depth replica of real aircraft/helicopter that was developed for more than a year, tested by real world pilots/ground crew, and mostly (like Huey helicopter) are licensed by their real life manufacturers. Every plane has excellent 3d model, in depth system simulation and flight model.\nI see lots of confusion regarding module prices - you can go to official ED forums and see for yourself what those planes are made of.\nAfter flying with all of them I can safely say - if you are serious flight simmer you wont regret purchasing any of them. DCS modules gives you months or even years of entertainment - I don't know many AAA games that can do that.\nThere are few aerodynamic flight models used in DCS World - less advanced and more professional ones - if you want familiarize yourself with details you can look up DCS wiki page. The most advance one Professional Flight Model (PFM) works pretty much as a virtual wind tunnel and its most realistic atm. To be honest planes that utilizes PFM feels just incredible, comparable to best add-ons for X-plane.\nAlso DCS in my opinion has the best helicopter flight model next to X-plane.\nOf course every module comes with really in depth manuals (100-300 pages of detailed informations) and this shows how complicated those planes/helicopters are.\nI must mention that lately DCS introduces shared MP cockpits that allows you to fly in the same plane with your friend - it was introduced with official ED module L-39.\nFull list of available planes and helicopters with upcoming ones can be found on official Eagle Dynamics website. Some are currently not available on Stream platform.\n\n\nSumming up - this is not a game. DCS must be played with at least joystick, or preferably HOTAS setup and TrackIr. You can try to fly with keyboard or controller but its not recommended.\nIf you are less experienced, before jumping in to more complicated modules, try the free version, or start from getting one of Flaming Cliffs planes.\n\nhttp://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/products/world/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Combat_Simulator\n","May 21","true","0.1"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

I've been playing some form of DCS since 2009 when I purchased LOMAC and Flaming Cliffs 2. I started out with LOMAC and progressed to FC2. Now I own several modules, including FC3. I didn't download DCS World on Steam until January of 2014. Prior to that I had DCS in its individual state. Now I have several modules: FC3, A-10C, P-51D, KA-50 and the free modules (SU-25T and TF-51). There are several different options in terms of modules and their respective level of simulation. There is survey level and study level. Survey level includes the SU-25T and the Flaming Cliffs modules. The cockpits aren't clickable and they have basic systems and start-up procedures. You can start an F-15C in 20 seconds by pressing RShift + L and R Alt +Home for the left engine and R ctrl + Home for the Right Engine. There you go, the plane is started. A study level module is much more complex and involves procedures almost identical to what you'd find at an air force base in terms of pre-launch/launch.  The cockpits are clickable and the weapons/systems usage are 98% spot on. The manual can be anywhere from 100-200 pages for the Flaming Cliffs and SU-25T modules and can be more than 600 pages for the "study" level modules like the A-10C.\nThe learning curve for this game is somewhat steep, especially if you do not have any experience with any form of aircraft or prior simulations. If you're coming from games like War Thunder Simulation mode or Il-2, that will give you a good background so at least you're familiar with using an ADI or HSI, though IL-2 is more realistic. If you approach this simulator with a notepad (digital or pen and paper) you can be successful. Just because you're good at the training module does not mean that you'll remember everything you learn. I strongly recommend a decent joystick (I have a HOTAS X that was $40 and it works perfect for me), a smart phone at your side to take notes, and I also recommend storing the flight manual on your phone for quick reference. The game comes with the TF-51 and SU-25T for free so you don’t have to pay and can “try before you buy.”  The former is the trainer version of the P-51D. The cockpit is virtually identical but it does not come with a HUD.  You also cannot mount weapons on it. This is okay because it is free and it is what is considered a "study" level simulation so you can get an idea on how the start-up procedures work on the study level modules. The SU-25T is survey level but it is harder to fly than any other fixed wing I’ve flown so far (I’ve flown all of the FC3 modules, the P-51D and the A-10C). It is a less maneuverable version of the SU-25a that comes with the FC3 package. I put together a video with a few clips of training sessions and kills I’ve accomplished with the 25t: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P26iNN2TsjM\nThe graphics are very good for what you’re getting. You’re talking about rendering an obnoxious view distance as well as multiple ground, sea and air units. I sent a screen cap of 2 F-15Cs flying at Dawn at 20,000’ altitude to a few friends and they commented that the pilots were so lucky. I had to explain that it was a simulator and they were surprised. There are many videos on YouTube of DCS and you can see that the game sometimes looks true to life. There are other portions that look “muddy,” such as air to ground missions. However, every aircraft and almost every mechanized ground unit is modeled almost 100% of what the real life version looks like; down to the panels and bolts. Even units that aren’t flyable/drivable by the user are still modeled very accurately. Since the release of DCS 1.5 your graphics capabilities are increased greatly. They still use many of the same elements as the original DCS in terms of texture but in DX11 now instead of DX9. When 2.0 and the Vegas training map release, it is said that the graphics are going to blow people away even more. I personally run it in 1920X1080 as my rig cannot max out the view distance and offer triple screen capability simultaneously. My specs are listed on my profile.\nThe sounds are spot on. They’re accurate in terms of “biotching betty” (the voice heard in warning systems), sounds of missiles launching, the sounds of the plane approaching and departing, comms, etc. Everything is extremely immersive. The sounds of AWACS and your flight radio also add to immersion.\nIn terms of controls, the controls are as accurate as you make them. There are people with customized “pits” that take advantage of MFDs, pedals, and $500 joysticks. I’ve spent $40 on my joystick but I must use a modifier. Modifiers are buttons that allow other buttons several secondary uses. Example: the trigger button fires my gun. If I press modifier1 with the trigger it switches in between the gun as my primary aiming system on my HUD to whichever missile I was using (aim-7, aim-9, aim-120). One huge advantage is Track IR5. Track IR provides a head tracking apparatus that intensifies how you look around in the cockpit. If you turn your head 5 degrees in real life, it can turn it 40 degrees in the game. This is adjustable to your liking. I strongly recommend this if you expect to be competitive. Using the HAT in game is not as effective as using your head to look around. Eventually the Oculus Rift will be released. Users using the Dev Kit for Oculus report unparalleled immersion in DCS and other simulators. If you have the graphics capability and the money, running the game in triple screen offers a significant advantage.\nIf you want a challenge, yearn for professional military pilot-like camaraderie, look forward to making your first “splash” in game this is the game for you. There’s nothing like meeting certain benchmarks in a game with the learning curve of DCS. Taking off from your base, navigating the waypoints to a certain objective, flying through terrain infested with SAMs and enemy AWACS to take out an objective and RTB successfully is extremely gratifying and never gets old.  If this is what you want, this is your game. If you lack patience, if you do not understand how an altimeter or compass works and are not interested in grasping the idea, if you are the type of person who needs instant gratification, if you are unwilling to take notes for a video game, and you are the type of person to yell at somebody on your team in games like CoD or BF4, this is definitely not the type of game for you. As stated before, the reviews on this are polarized; there typically is not a happy medium. You like it or you don’t. Try the free demo before purchasing additional modules!\nGood luck!\n","November 18, 2015","true","74.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

In this simulator it is no game, you have to learn how to fly, operate avionics, radios and weapons. Even though the learning curve for the advanced aircraft might seem big there are interactive tutorials that will teach you, which is better than reading some of the multi-hundred page manuals (which should be read when wanting to know how to operate something in the plane if the tutorial missed something). The world in this game is huge, mountains, ocean, towns/ cities. You can achieve long range flights with the map size. Also there is aireal refueling (only with the A-10C and most FC3 aircraft) which caters even more to long range flights. As some of you probably knew before you read this, that DCS is a combat simulator. So on top of having planes with realistic flight characteristics and avionics, you also have the ability to use that planes' weapons. The weapons are just as realistic as the planes, and yes, bombing with planes like F-86F is just as hard as it always was for the real pilots.\n\nThe only thing that is missing from DCS is more modern fighters that are not like FC3 aircraft, so far the A-10C is the only modern plane (but it is only a A/G aircraft) and from what I heard the F/A-18C is coming to DCS so hopefully it will expand the variety of planes and helicopters in the future","June 3, 2015","true","608.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

One below a full motion simulator, in my opinion.\n\nThis ultra high-fidelity simulator is great if you're experienced with flight simulators and basic physics and aerodynamics. (I recommend you understand how stalls work, G-limits on humands and the stress points of planes.)\n\nWith all but the most minute buttons modelled you can really mess up your flight if you want too, there is no hand-holding here. Can't stand the relative silence of the cockpit? Well that canopy can come off with just a click of a button or a flick of a switch.\n\n----\n\nWhile the base DCS World is fun it just doesn't compete with the DLC; the UH-1H Huey and MiG 21Bis are there for those of you who want a real challenge (The Huey is just a hard fly and the Fishbed is a rocket with wings attached and not a whole lot of fuel.)\nIf you just want a change of plane Flaming Cliffs 3 brings you the F-15 Eagle, A-10A, Su-27, Su-33, MiG-29A and MiG-29S; They don't come with clickable cockpits so they are a good fit for people who are transitioning from the Su-25.\nIf you're looking for a good transitioning point into the planes with clickable cockpits I recommend the A-10C featuring a fully clickable cockpit and relatively easy start-up.\n\n----\n\nOverall I (As an avid player of Flight Simulator X and X-Plane 10 and an overall flight simulator enthusiast)  recommend this game ONLY if you have a joystick and are prepared to buy DLC and other peripherals in the future. Don't expect DLC to be free, the complexity and time invested to make these modules is massive and you can easily put 100 hours into each module.\n\nTo play this flight simulator you are all but forced to have a joystick; it's a flight simulator, it's not a game.\nI recommend your next purchase to be a TrackIR 5 or, if it has been fully released when you're reading this, maybe an Oculus Rift.\nFinally, if you plan on flying the helicopters get a force-feedback joystick and RUDDER pedals, racing pedals with almost certainly not work and if they do they won't work nearly as well as genuine ones.\n\n\n----\n\nRecommended brands:\nJ: Saitek X52 Joystick\nJ: Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog (VERY expensive but VERY good.)\nP: CH Pro Rudder Pedals\nP: Saitek Pro Flight Combat Pedals\nH: Oculus Rift\nH: TrackIR5\n\n(J:Joystick, P:Pedals, H:Head Tracking)","January 1, 2015","true","231.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The modelling of Air-to-Air missile performance is unfortunately quite simplistic (as are countermeasures), and high explosive bombs don't do much due to a lack of splash/fragmentation damage modelling, but the flight models and systems fidelity are superb. There's a reason DCS is a byword for high-fidelity simulation now.\n\nDon't come into this expecting your experience flying Warthunder or whatever to translate, though. You must have a joystick of some sort, preferably with a twist axis (unless you own a set of rudder pedals) and a throttle (unless you have a proper HOTAS throttle). Knowledge of basic aerodynamic concepts is important, as is the ability to dilligently monitor your aircraft's systems for potential problems, and the ability to learn the limits of each aircraft you buy.\n\nLuckily, you get two aircraft for free with the base game download. The Su-25T will teach you basic air to ground and missile avoidance techniques, while the TF-51 is basically the exact same aircraft as the paid P-51 module, minus the armament and a fuel tank in the fuselage that you'll leave empty most of the time anyway because it ♥♥♥♥s with aircraft performance. Get yourself a cheap stick and take some time to learn the free aircraft.

If you come from a simulation background you will have no problems learning this sim. But if like me you started off without a clue or played the rare session of FSX you will have a lot of learning to do, even more if you do not know about military terms and equipment. This simulator is as real as it gets for most modules excluding the Flaming Cliffs add-ons. You definitely need a decent HOTAS system to be able to play, I recommend the Thrustmaster Hotas X which costs about £30 new and you can upgrade to a better system later on if you become addicted like I and many others have.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A DLC SYSTEM.\nDCS world uses a modular system, you get the SU25T and the unarmed variant of the P-51D for free. The SU25T is an FC3 style module. This means that the plane and weapons systems handle as they would in real life but the cockpit is not clickable, you have to use a keyboard for most functions. Modules apart from FC3 modules are fully detailed with clickable cockpits. Alot of people complain about the prices of the modules but they are reasonably priced, if you think about the hundreds of hours of work and research required to make these modules then it is totally worth it. Modules range from the nimble and quick Gazelle helicopter to the flying pig that is the A10C to the old WW2 planes like the P-51D, this sim will cater to a broad range of audiences. I have bought the FC3 module because of its large amount of planes but I plan to buy the KA50 soon (reviews for those are separate). The SU25T is enough to get you into the fight.\n\nGREAT COMMUNITY, GET TEAMSPEAK\nDCS World sports a large and great community, several youtubers play DCS World and it’s not hard to bump into them online. If you don’t know what you are doing HOGGIT is a great place where there are people ready to teach you the ways of DCS. The unofficial Facebook group is also a great place to meet people and learn new things. Almost everyone is welcoming. The number of multiplayer servers is great with anywhere between 10 to 50 people online at once which can quickly turn into a mess if you do not communicate properly. One thing I must stress is the importance of teamwork and communication, TeamSpeak is a necessity if you are going online. It can help you survive a lot longer and reduces stress on other team members. Teamwork is key, sending CAS in without CAP is a recipe for disaster in PvP. The multiplayer caters for many styles, whether you want a quick session in PvE or a long campaign in PvP, you will love the many community made missions. These missions require a lot of structure, GCIs and flight leads are a vital aspect to success, so listen and communicate with them. The amount of times when the team is going for one objective and most of them are on TeamSpeak when a few loners outside of TeamSpeak refuse to help, losing the objective has been very low, even then I think they were new to the sim.\n\nGRAPHICS AND SOUND IS GREAT\nThe graphics whilst a little outdated are great, tonnes of vehicles are modelled with great detail and the modules look fantastic. The ground can look dull at times but with DCS 2.5 coming out this is set to improve. The sound effects are very nice, listening to the RWR can drive you crazy at times but it is all very immersive. Watching your missile detach from your wing and hunt your target can be very entertaining and immersive. Watching your wingman breaking off to attack a target, then popping tonnes of flares as he turns with AAA unloading hell on him and the sky is breathtakingly spectacular, I have never seen anything like it in any game engine.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis sim is breath taking and very rewarding but frustrating at times. You might witness a few game crashes but all will be forgiven when you actually learn and enjoy it. The learning curve is steep and you will be destroyed if you jump straight in without reading or doing training missions, but the feeling of overwhelming joy when you destroy your first enemy in PvP is great.

The planes are a bit expensive but 50$ to me is worth learning how to manually start(some modules dont have fully functional cockpits), fly, and learn all the weapons an systems the aircraft uses.  they do all go on sale up top 75% off ive seen so keep a close tab on sales cuz they dont happen to often and dont last long.\n\nit does take along time to get the hang of expecially if u dont play flying sims much.  u will have hours of fustration an crashing but its all in the learning process.  the more u fly a particular plane the better u will be at piloting it.  all planes fly differently and have different weapons and systems.  ive been playing for 900HRS so far an still dont know how to fly all the aircrafts... havent spent all my time learning all them either. i just stick to the ones i like mainly...\n\nOnce you do get the hang of things you can play online with other people. there is a lot of servers to choose from which most are made and hosted by DCS players.  it is much funner flying with other people doing coop missions or just practicing flying formations.  to play online u have to make an account at http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/auth/?register=yes\n\nwell, happy flights, and good luck.  download it NOW, play for HOURS.\n\nP.S.  dont need it but highly recomend a joystick/hotas.  even a cheap one will make flying easier. for a nice cheap joystick that works great for beginners try the logitech extreme pro.  used it for along time.  resently got the saitek x-55 rino,  its amazing and worth it if you take flying seriously!","September 3, 2015","true","346.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I've been flying DCS since 2011, started with the KA-50, and it was exactly what I have always wanted in a flight sim: the full complexity of operating the flight, navigation, and weapons systems of a modern attack helicopter.  A-10C?  Same experience;  Highly detailed, fully-simulated flight, navigation, communication, sensor, and weapon systems.  This sim doesn't hold your hand and you get out of it exactly what you put into it.\n\nFor someone looking for a less-intense entrance into combat flight simulation, try DCS Flaming Cliffs 3.  The flight physics are a little more forgiving, and the systems complexity is greatly towned down, all while still maintaining realistic performance capabilities and excellent approximations of real-world detection capabilities and engagement envelopes.\n\nI only have one word of warning to give:  Once you get a taste of DCS, you'll never be satisfied with the limited aircraft "simulations" implemented in Battlefield, ARMA, HAWX, and similar games again.","July 15, 2014","true","85.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I own almost every module, no sim in history has ever came close to the detail of DCS. All negative comments about prices for modules or it being not user friendly is mute. This is a hardcore sim, if you love aviation then you will love this game. And it's slowly becoming the only true combat sim left for props.(Even though the ww2 aspect of the game is still very work in progress) IL-2 battle of stalingrad has went the wrong direction. IL-2 1946 is good, but the online community is dead, and the game has shown it's age. War thunder isn't even a flight sim, that games sim battles are a joke.\nThe only other good option is IL-2 cliffs of dover with team fusion mods, it mixes hardcore elements of engine management, but is more forgiving than DCS.\n\nThe module price in DCS is entirely justified by the quality done, if you can't see that, then you just don't understand what you're looking at. I recommend downloading the standalone client from the DCS website, you can benefit from both the steam sales and the companies own sales, which when they have them are HUGE discounts like 70% off.\n\nIf you are interested in this game, give the Su-25T a try, (It's free) it's one of my favorite aircraft still. And then bump up to FC3, if you manage to overcome the initial complexity of working the radar, then when you buy a full, entirely simulated module like the A-10C or MiG-21 then it will make life easier.\n\nThough I NEVER recommend a beginner to pick up the a-10c, because even the more simplified FC3 aircraft are too much for a lot of people.","May 28, 2015","true","36.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

Two planes (as of 2014: P51 trainer, Su25T Frogfoot) for free. The TF 51 (P51 trainer) is the more in depth of the two planes and is not for the feint of heart but should give you an idea of what the level of realism you should expect out of many of these DCS modules. Currently, DCS A10C, Blackshark 2, UH1 Huey, MI8MTV2, P51 and (Millitary) all have in depth flight dynamics and controlls with a fully interactive cockpit.\n\nFlaming Cliffs 3 is a module that comes with the F15C, MIG 29, Su27, Su33, Su25, and A10A. All of these aircraft have a slightly simplified flight model and do not have interactive cocpits. It should be noted though that this pack allows you to fly many different types of aircraft with the price of one module.\n\nPros-Epic, Realistic, Online community is pretty awesome, quality online players\n\nCons- Game engine can hold your system back (32 bit, runs on 2 cores, heavy on processor, only 1.5 gb ram), dated terraini detail, small community (though a quality one) Few aircraft choices, steam no longer supports serial numbers bought on DCS websight (steam serials are still supported by DCS standalone/nonsteam client though)\n\nRealistically speaking, this game doesnt offer a whole lot in terms of aircraft count like some of the competition out there. However, the aircraft are extremely well detailed and handle exceptionally realistically. In a dying age of flight sims, DCS is still going strong, with some of the most realistic aircraft modeling around, with a persistent community and invovled developers.\n\n","June 22, 2014","true","100.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The VR user interface is fully capable but is not polished.  The traditional flatscreen interface is used in VR and you can't recenter in the game (that I have found).

I have seen a lot of combat sims come and go but none have ever been; as well put together, well thought out, realistic, had such a wide scope of details and interaction, nor had such an easy to use and stable online facility. There is also a wide array of single player and campaign missions (if you are not up for online interaction). I also have to give a big thumbs up to the constantly expanding and updating choice of vehichles (helicopters,tanks,planes) that are being made available to us. (standalone DCS already has a large back catalogue of vehichles and these will inevitably find their way into the steam stores at some stage however, in the meantime there is already a large selection of well known favourites available).\n\nI have to say that DCS world ticks all the box's,\n\n1.flight charecteristics are amazing,\n\n2.on board systems are detailed and relevant,\n\n3.real world type damage that affects your planes abilities,\n\n4.detailed weapons systems and management that actually get a bit of adrenaline pumping,\n\n5.sound is fully imersive not to mention well balanced (no ear aches after prolongued play at full volume.)\n\n6.Graphics are jaw droppingly stupendous whether inside the cockpit or outside the plane graphical detail is heart stopping as is the landscape and objects/buildings/mountains/sea/clouds/sun (and I am only running NVIDIA 750ti ! I would love to see it on one of the latest generation GPU's the mind boggles...)\n\nI think the biggest tribute that I can pay to this simm is that: when I use air travel in the real world since DCS I know and can feel every thing the pilot is doing from take off to landing - though this can make for some nervous back seat driver feelings ("He's retracting those flaps a little early for my liking..." "I SAY ! STEWARDESS Could I have a word with the pilot please...^^ [air marshall raises eyebrowes] ;)\n\nQuite simply a 5 star release\n[disclaimer] this is not an arcade title !

(Updated 10/13/2015, shortly after graphics overhaul. [NOTE!] So far these upgrades are not shown in the above screenshots)\n\nThe Good:\n-A large array of aircraft to fly(if you buy the moduls). Many of which are fully interactive, as in almost every switch and button can be flipped with the click of your mouse(you can rebind the keys as you see fit). The rest of the aircraft are more like simplifed simulations, not fully interactive but easier to learn. As far as I know, they handle realisticly.\n\n-Amazing graphics post update! The lighting, weather, and smoke effects are absurdly good, the ground now uses a bump map, meaning flat textures on the ground cast shadows, it really makes the terrain look a million times better. Basically it just looks better and even runs better.\n\n-Detailed single player campaigns for each and every aircraft, some single player campaigns very in their difficulty and legnth. For example, the A-10A's campaign features smaller scale misisons that don't require much time to complete. Where as the SU-25's campaign features much larger scale misisons that take much longer to complete(imagine after taking off from your airfield, you must fly for 20-30 minutes to the combat zone, then fly back to land when your mission is complete, Which I guess is more realistic).\n\n-Quick misson generators which allow you to practice with your aircarft before doing the campaigns.\n\n-One thing I really like is that you can choose your payload, each aircraft has a large variety of weaponry, and it is fun carefully choosing your payload according your mission objective. Variety is such a great thing, and variety is something this game has in large quantities.\n\n-The game is very well optimized now, it used to run like garbage even with incredeble hardware, but even after the graphics overhaul, the game runs a lot more smoothly than it did.\n\n-The load times have been vastly improved, it used to take 5 minutes to load anything up in this game, now its about 30 seconds to a minute to load. Any subsequent load time is around 15 seconds.\n\nBare in mind my hardware specs are as follows:\nAMD 8-core 4.0 GHZ\nR9 290 with 4GB of VRAM GDDR5\n12GB 1600MHZ of RAM\n\nThe Bad:\n-expect a minor frame rate dips if our have mirrors and ground clutter active.\n\n-The game's training is hit or miss. The SU-25T(which you get for free) has training missions that are interactive. Then you have most of the Flaming cliffs 3 aircraft which have shoddy low res videos, that is out of sync with the sound and voice that is explaining everything. For the Mi-8, the game will only teach you how to turn it on, take off, and how to use the weapons, but it only tells you how to use the rockets, and 2 of the 3 types of gun pods, and doesn't teach you how to use bombs. Worst of all, it did not teach me how to land with the helicopter, which is harder than you may think. I crashed 40 times trying to figure out how to land properly. The game has a steep learning curve, and the training videos just makes an already hard to learn game even more inaccessible.\n\n-I find that the default controles are confusing and clunky. I basically had to completely setup and rebind the contols to something more comfortable. This took a lot of time, learning what each function did, then figuring out what my new layout should be. But when your done, your done and can enjoy the game. Keep in mind, you have to completely set up your controles for each indavidual vehicle!\n\nIn conclusion:\nIf I can add anything more to the review, I will. But overall, the game is great, and I highly reccomend it if you like flight simulators.","August 3, 2014","true","103.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

DCS World has really grown on me. The simulation of airplanes by third parties is very well done, even with some of them still in beta. Eagle Dynamics also has a great idea shifting the burden of module development onto third parties for the most part, allowing them to commit more manpower to features, engine upgrades, and other things we have yet to learn about. The World War 2 planes, while few in number (P-51, BF-109K-4, and FW-190D-9) are well made, and a blast to fly.\n\nIntegrates seamlessly with the Tacview software so you can review flights later on in a similar way Red Flag debriefings are handled.\n\nYou will need a decent flight stick, one with throttle control. The learning curve is steep. If you want to get the full experience, expect to spend a few hours learning how to start your particular aircraft, operate it's various systems, how it handles, optimum turning speeds, and how to evade missiles. If you stick with it, the payoff is very worth it.","November 13, 2014","true","134.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you are willing to learn how the planes handle, learn what the limitations on each plane/weapon/vehicle are and practice, practice and more practice then DCS World is an amazing experience and game.\n\nThe two planes that come with the free version are perfect for learning how to fly, the DLC modules bring in more challenging planes, maps and campaigns.\n\nThe free map in the Black Sea region is huge, with more than enough land mass and sea area.\n\nWork is constantly being done on the sim aswell to keep the graphics and sound up to date, the new 2.0 update in testing at the moment is fantastic looking.\n\nThe free single player campaign for the SU-25T is interesting, the tutorials are informative and the included mission editor is easy to use and gives you the ability to create very advanced missions and campaigns.  Multiplayer is also an amazing experience.\n\nI'ld recommend DCS World to anyone with an interest in flight from both modern and WWII eras, even if all you want to do is experience flying and not interested in combat.","April 8","true","48.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

They add great planes and learning how to propely use these aircraft, from every tiny bit of detail will surely engage you for hours and hours.\n\nThe game could have a dynamic campaign though, but other than that, it is a solid hardcore military simulation.","June 11, 2014","true","115.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The SU-25 is the only aircraft that can effectily provide SEAD (Supression of Enemy Air Defences) like SAMs and AAA.\n\nIt does take a bit of time to set up to the way you want.

If you're just getting it for the Su-25T or FC3, stick with a simpler joystick.

If you really like having a less - arcade, realistic experience, and you have some patience, you will learn really fast.\nDevs put a lot of time and effort in every module (which have clickable cockpits), so there are only few planes at the moment, but there are multiple dev groups. There are 2 types of modules (DLCs):\n\n---  Very realistic, with clickable cockpits (everything is funcinal just like in real-life): A-10C, KA-50, UH-1H, MI-8, MIG-21, P-51, BF-109, Fw 190D-9, F-86, C-101 Aviojet, Hawk T.1A - some of them are in Beta (as for now), but even those have a lot of features already (A-10C, KA-50 and UH-1 are 100% complete), also there should be F-15 and F-18 soon\n\n--- Other modules are from Flaming Cliffs 3 which is like more arcade version of DCS, but has DCS engine and absolutely compatible. Those FC3 planes are not clickable, so they have less realistic features (you don't have to press 40 buttons to start up, just push 4 buttons on keyboard, wait 10 sec and it's on), but it's still enjoyable especially for new players.\nDCS is free but it has only 2 free modules - SU25-T and TF-51D. SU-25 doesn't have clickable cockpit, but it still has many features - weapons, autopilot, radar and stuff, and TF-51D is fully clickable (but doesn't have any guns)\nSome DLCs have manuals, but even if they don't, just go on Youtube or Google. You can also use manuals for real aircraft, those have a lot of pages but they worth it.\n\nMultiplayer has a lot of servers but only few have more than 10 players.\n\nThe downsides of the game - those are quite random but common.\n- FPS - i'm running the game with Radeon HD7950 (overlocked, equal to GTX770), sometimes getting 25-30 fps on low-medium settings - when on airfield, near some big town, or in multiplayer. But usually it's around 50, getting better when im flying and there are less cities around - may go higher than 60, like 90-120. But, some people say they having 50+ fps on ultra high. Those maybe Radeon drivers, or my luck\n- Bad synchronization with Steam - overlay doesn't work randomly or it doesn't count hours of playing (5 hours instead of 50)\n-Haven't noticed any gamebreaking bugs yet.\n\nHope my review was useful, sorry for some misspells\n","February 13, 2015","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

There simply is no substitute for CAS aircraft simulation. Falcon BMS provides a great F16 simulator. However, for everything else DCS is superior in every way. The A10C is the most faithfully recreated aircraft in their line up. But you can still have a great time flying the Russian black shark. The feeling you get when you successfully start an aircraft from a cold start is amazing. You also get to try out the SU25 for free (and the modern version for a price). it's not nearly as fun as the A10C, but it still lets you learn the basic weapon systems. It's VERY IMPORTANT to remember that the A10 is NOT the same as the A10C. the A10 will get you a more forgiving "arcadey" aircraft (but still more realistic then something like say ace combat or battlefield, think of the old Jane's flight sims level). the A10C will give you the real deal. The A10C package does include basic tutorials for things like learning how to properly fly/start/land/engage in an A10. But things like working with JTAC will not be explained. So quite a bit of reading is required on your part.","May 25, 2014","true","11.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I was quite sceptic at the beginning but I still had my old joystick here and I thought: hey, it's free so let's try it. Flight simulators were always an alien genre to me but now I can't get enough. I bought the A-10C addition shortly after that, and was overwhelmed by its complexity (vanilla was already quite good).\nDo not expect to lift off in less than 10 minutes. There is so much to do that you basically need to switch to the manual for every button or switch. Sometimes the manual isn't enough so you search the forums for useful information and somehow you end up reading military documents about the maths behind escaping a missile. At least 50% of my time with this game included doing research about some specific systems and I haven't even tried them all and don't even fully understand those which I use frequently. But you know what? I have been playing this game straight for a week, my sleeping cycle is deeply disturbed (I go to sleep at 5 A.M and get up at 9 or 12) because it is so addicting. I also tried the included mission editor and it seems to have a whole lot of potential.\n\nThere are a few downsides however: the campaign may feel quite realistic with much action going on, but it is missing some kind of story. Even though it is not as bad as  ARMA communications, the voices feel a bit robotic and monotone. I wish the AI would do some smalltalk even if it is maybe not appropriate.\nAnother point is the map: it is huge, for sure, but after a while it becomes a bit boring. Not that it matters much, but I like looking out of the window when flying to the combat zone. However, along with the new EDGE engine, ED will bring out a new map afaik.\nI had a few performance issues during huge bomb dropoffs (dropping my entire payload) but all in all, it performs excellently for having so many units running at once.\nAlso you need to be very, very patient. For example the navigation system on the A-10C needs around 4 minutes to start up and you really shouldn't move the vehicle until it is done. My best time from starting the game and taking off on the runway lies around 7 minutes and I repeat it for every single mission. And more often than not I get blown up before even dropping my first bomb. It can get quite frustrating.\n\nIn conclusion, this is one of the most hardcore simulations I have ever touched and I will be touching it for some more time. it is deeply addicting and will lead you into buying more stuff so you can fight better oder try out new things (maybe a HOTAS instead of that old joystick). For those who have played other flight sims, don't wait. This download is well worth your time and the Su-25T model is really easy to fly in comparison to the A-10C. It has a few flaws, but you can easily ignore them while still trying what that button does... hey let's just push i- WHAAAaaaaaaaaa......\n\nI'd gladly give it a 9/10 and that one point missing is for taking my sleep","April 12, 2014","true","214.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You have to love flight, (which I do,) and you have to know the controls/general similarities among all aircraft (which I also know). This ain't War Thunder or IL2 Sturmovik or any of those types of games. This is a full-out sim.\nI, as a frequent FSX pilot and aircraft enthusiast, love this game. But, on the other hand, if you're one of those guys who wants to hop in a cockpit with all of the systems already running and not worrying about how to find the flaps switches, then DO. NOT. GET. THIS. GAME. Get War Thunder instead. It's still fun. Trust me. I play it.\nLet's focus on the main point. This game is absolutely free. Yes, I know, only two free aircraft. But they're incredibly realistic, plus it's not like real military pilots switch from aircraft to aircraft, just as I love flying the Boeing 737-800 in FSX. It's the plane I fly the most, and the same logic goes for this game. You get involved in one aircraft, you learn about it, you cry over the lost hours of your life spent learning how to fly it, and then you love it. You don't go 5 minutes into an SU-25 and then decide "meh. I'm more in the mood for flying a MiG. Maybe after that I'll also fly a Mustang."\nTo sum it up, it's free, and it's either you love it or you hate it.","August 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","5"

The Ka-50 Black Shark helicopter, and the A-10 C Warthog for example, are two highly detailed aircraft that will take most budding pilots weeks to get to grips with, let alone master.  Fortunately, DCS World provides a more immediate introduction to the flying module without the extremely high learning curve in say the A-10C, and with a reasonable joy stick, you'll be flying fairly quickly.  There are several aircraft to pilot, including the F15, Su27, Su33, Mig 29S, and the Su25.  The flight modeling is exceptional and level of world detail extremely high.  I would recommend having a fairly high end PC to really enjoy the physics and visuals in the game - it is processor heavy.  Ideally, you probably want to invest in a joy-stick and possibly flight pedals down the road, if you really want to immerse yourself in the art of combat flying.   I've been playing for several weeks now getting to grips with the Su-27, and it's been suitably challenging, offering a lot return playability.  Cranked up to full realism, and this quickly becomes a very, very challenging simulator - which of course is where a lot of the joy comes from.  Be prepated to be truly immersed in the flight environment.","January 27, 2015","true","78.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its the kind of game that you can play for hours and still not learn everything there is. I have played 26 hours at the time of this review and still haven't used the autopilot, weapon systems, and much more. Everytime I play this I seem to learn something I didn't know before. It does take a while to get a hang of and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who gives up easily because you do need to crash a lot in order to get a hang of everything. It is a game that seems to reward those who put in the time to learn how to fly specific planes because it has a ton of keyboard bindings, some a necessity some a conveniance. The planes you get in the free version do a good job at showing two sides of piloting. The TF-51D is a plane that in the game requires some learning in order to know how to just start it since it has an eight step proccess to start the engine. Once you get the TF-51D in the air it seems to be an easy plane to learn because it doesn't have a very high top speed and therefore has less you can mess up with in things such as landing. The SU-25T is completely different because it makes everything on the ground easy but once you are in the air you can break your wings off if you turn too sharp (which I know from experience). The community from what I have experienced is very friendly and I don't hesitate to ask them questions because they are helpful for the most part, aside from the LCtrl+e+e+e jokes every once in a while. Overall this game is great, it is a game I would willingly buy which makes it even better that it is free.

This game does have a slightly steep learning curve, but that is countered by video tutorials available at the main menu of the game. I highly recommend that you visit the developers website, and download a copy of the checklist for the aircraft that you wish to fly. Then print it out and keep it handy, or download it to a tablet. The graphics are not bad for a flight simulator, but are not cutting edge. The multiplayer is not bad, but depends on the server and its mission.

I bought the Flaming Cliffs 3 Addon so far and it is tons of joy, it is quite a bit challenging to learn the ropes if you are new to simulators (like I am) but once you get into it, you'll have a lot of fun.\nRussian and American planes both have different avionics, making them feel different (and as such you have to learn to use both separately). Still trying to get used to the radar, but locking on and firing with missiles is piece of cake once you learn how to (watching the tutorials for both russians and americans twice did the trick for me).\nSo, all in all, if you are looking for a very realistic simulator, definitely give this one a shot because the basic game is free and has the Su-25 and the TF-51 in it, which by themselves already offer a lot of fun, and from there you can decide whether you want to get into the game more.\nP.S.

DCS World is as good as Prepar3D and the combat already unlocked.  If you fly professional simulators, you know detailed simulated aircraft can be usually $40-150+, so this is much cheaper.  On sale, it is an absolute steal.\nCombined Arms alone for $5.99 is worth it because you're getting the best tank and armored simulator you'll ever find, period.\nThe UH-1 Huey is the only one I've seen with such detail and you would normally pay close to $80 for something like that for Microsoft FSX, Prepar3D or X-Plane.  So, for sale price of $15, its another steal!\nIf you ever wanted to try a Flight Simulator, this is the one for you because the tutorials give a much lower learning curve.","September 17, 2014","true","18.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's free to try.\n2. It's the best war plane simulator out at the moment as my feelings go.\n3. Each "DLC" is a whole game on it's own. It's not only added content in the manner of new plane, but it is intended as full game with campaing. All this is then integrated in one world for Multiplayer purposes.\n\nAnd now for those whou would want to read a bit more. :)\n\nIt's so damn complex it blows my mind. It simulates the whole plane, each part of the machine is simulated in some form. It depends on what dlc you buy but for example the A-10C or KA-50 (and others too) have fully clickable cockpits and simulated on board computers. You can do everything a real pilot could do. With combination of really powefull mission editor anything is possible.\n\nYou get whole campaings for selected planes and even in the free to play basic package you can run a campain with SU-25 plane. Now when you combine this with multiplayer and really superb community, you get a package that can keep you entertained for years. Mercenary mission with your friends or with you "clan" are only the top of the iceberg here.\n\nI have only one con here, the game is really demanding. You will NEED to have a 64bit machine and highend CPU/GPU to really enjoy high details. This will maybe be solved when a new engine will be released (it's planed for this year) but I wouldn't put high hopes for this.

The 'free to play' strategy does work if you put out a quality product like DCS World which gives you everything that a full price game offers but then offers you more as DLC for a price because like me you will pay that price.","July 18, 2014","true","17.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You know how you have all those dials, gauges, switches and stuff in your typical aircraft cockpit? Well in DCS they all actually mean something and have ramifications as to how your aircraft performs.\n\nI can't stress this point enough, DCS (Which stands for "Digital Combat Simulator") is a SIMULATOR. That means that it's less focused on traditional game design paradigms and more concerned with realism. Sure it's probably not 100% Realistic, I've never piloted an aircraft in my life (and never will due to medical reasons), so a real pilot would probably be able to pick at things. That's fine, to my understanding it's about as close as you can get with modern technology.\n\nYes this means a steep learning curve, ESPECIALLY due to the fact that not all aircraft operate the same. They have different start-up procedures, binded to different keys (or differently placed buttons), different avionics systems, and different controls.\n\nI know that this is a turn off to most of you, but I'm giving it a thumbs up for one simple reason\n\nIf you are just plain curious it's free!\n\nYeah yeah there's a buttload of DLC which has most of the content, but If you try it and it's not your thing, no harm no foul, but if you take the time to actually play it, slowly learn how to operate your aircraft, and have the patience, focus, and willingness to try, try again, you are in for a treat!\n\nBecause once you get used to it, flying these things is really freakin AWESOME! These things FEEL like jets, and to a degree, you are crossing miles of (virtual) landscape in pretty much a blink of an eye, and delivering a projectile at even greater distances in some cases with avionic-assisted precision! Just an awesome feeling I think!\n\nAlso for those who like attention to detail, some of the DLC planes (including a free one you get, a T51 Prop-plane) actually have the ability to click on individual buttons/turn dials and cranks alongside the binded keypresses. Which is really neat!\n\n*Just remember though you are buying planes for an extra simulation experience, it's more of a self-study than anything unless of course you need to round out roles because I'm sure Ground attack/CAS isn't going to be what everyone wants to do in a Combat aircraft sim.","February 16","true","8.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

High speed fly by's or out manuvering a missile, Learning to hover a chopper or using the chopper to wreck ground forces who will return fire on you. DCS has a great design team and third party partners to keep this sim up and running till we all die from old age. I recommend this sim to serious gamers who want a learning curve, who want a rewarded feeling when you win an air battle because its tough. A person who likes to fly using ILS during a storm or wants to utilize their instruments because they work. Realism and updates to realism is what this sim is about. A community of folks who will help you learn your way until you one day are helping another learn to fly, fight, land in a shot up jet under tedious conditions.

Look for the TL;DR at the end.\n\nThis is probably the best deal on Steam. You don't have to spend a dime and you get access to an increadiable game. It's a full blown simulator, so expect a decent learning curve, especially with the weapons and navigation systems, but the game comes with a full compliment of interactive tutorials. After a good Saturday of playing, I had a good handle on everything and could freely enjoy playing. Mastering those skills is something else entirely, but of course, part of the fun.\n\nRe-playability, for me this is probably the most important part of any game and for me, this game offers a lot of replayability, if your willing to put in some work. The game comes with a handful of missions, but the Mission Edditor allows you to create your own custom missions and it's a POWERFUL tool. Create a vast and complex mission or even campaign or a simple scenario for you to practice your shooting skills. If your savy, you can even use Lua to write your own scripts and really add complexity.\n\nYou don't need additional hardware for this game, but a good flight-stick at the minimum will make the game a lot more fun. If you have some cash and want to get a HOTAS stick and throttle, that's probably the best way to go. I don't have one and don't plan on getting one and I'm quite happy with that. Certain actions take me a bit longer, because I have to hit CTL-ALT something.\n\nTL;DR - If you're looking for a combat flight simulator, this is the best I know of. If you have some money to spend I highly recomend the A10-C add-on. Expect a decent learning curve with a high pay off. A lot of re-playability with the custom mission editor. Maybe get a flight stick.\n\n10/10","March 6, 2014","true","115.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

That being siad its also a huge disapointment dlc wise. I have bought both the f-15c and a-10c (4.99$ and 9.99$ i think) dlcs and expected to get a full flight expeirience with each craft. the f-15c has no training missions which makes the craft absolutly worthless to me. the A-10 has a wonderful training program but they skimped out on any decent content campaing wise. thats only 2 of the 250$ worth of dlc and if they expect me to pay 49.99$ for a single plane they better ace the cheaper ones to show me what im getting. because of this the A-10 will be the only dlc ship i ever fly and my review went from one of praisal to one of disapiontment."""""\n\nReached 69 hours and got my first MP kill followed imediatly by my second... Followed imediatly by me spinning out of control due to excessive dive and improper nose trim adjustments.\n\nThis Game is amazing. My review was at i time when i thought i understanded this game. I've logged a decent amount of time since then and fell in love with the Su27, and this flight simulator is absolutly fantastic. My advice is not to make rash judgments, take the time to learn everything properly and Multiplayer makes the game ( Although you will be blown up a lot ). Ask questions If you need help, obviously not everyone is willing to help but this game seems to have a fairly positive community.\n\nAlso you can find a flight manual for the f-15 in the file location and there are plenty of tutorials on the web.","June 23, 2015","true","76.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","10"

And on top of that you get to blow stuff up! What else could you ask for?\n\n-Modules I have tried out-\n\nA-10C: Most thorough flight simulation I have ever flown. From what I can tell all of the flight systems, computers, and avionics are operated exactly how they would be in real life and also have the same advantages, faults, and limitations. That being said starting it up from a cold start is always rewarding (If you do not mess something up along the way) but also very braintwisting. I have a much higher level of respect for the pilots who fly them for not just smashing their heads into a pulp trying to get the plane started up. The flight dynamics are exceptional also, and it's intricate weapon systems are very fun to blow up Russian tanks with.\n\nUH-1H Huey: I have flown hundreds of flight simulators, but they were all with fixed winged aircraft. I could not find a better way to learn the art of helicoptering from this jem. The Huey is a historical legend for it's service during the vietnam war among others, and its later civilian services that still continue to this day. It sure flys like a legend too, you will not find many complicated computer systems you have to spend days learning about in it. Starting it up is simply turning the right combination of knobs and switches. Flying it is not real challenge after spending enough time to get used to it. You will learn to hover it and land in the most obscure places possible. It's flight dynamics like any other DCS title is exceptional. From the basic increase in lift as the helicopter gains horizontal velocity to the more uncommon stalling. The developers really show pride in their work as many other aerodynamic effects are modelled in such as rotors breaking due to a high RPM and negative G environment. The weapon systems are really fun to mess around with, there is really not much to them apart from shooting a minigun in the direction of your enemies and watching the carnage.\n\nFlaming Cliffs 3: A great module for the less experienced flight simmers or casual player. Instead of focusing on a single high quality aircraft the developers worked on a great variety of more mediocre modelled aircraft. There are no interactable cockpits here besides closing the canopy. Apart from that, the planes are still modelled well for the status quo of a flight simulation. The F-15 included however has a very well modelled aerodynamics system that blows all the others in this module out of the water. Even though this module is much lower quality than the other titles, it is still very fun. And lets face it, cheaper too for the amount of content and variety it has.\n\nI would reccomend for more veteran flight simulators to stay away from this module as most of the planes are not very well modelled and some are just dumbed down versions of other aircraft in the simulation like the A-10A and SU-25.\n\nThe F-15 is the plane that makes the module worth it, and as it is now only 10$ I reccomend just buying that instead of paying $50 on Flaming cliffs 3. The only reason I got it was it was on sale and was the same price of the F-15 at the time, so it just made more sense to buy all of Flaming cliffs 3 instead of just one aircraft included in it that was the same price as it.\n\nFree aircraft:\n\nTF-51: The TF-51 is a real fun plane for aerobatics if that is your cup to tea. It has a pretty good flight model and has a fully clickable and interactable cockpit, its flight and internal systems are just as well modelled.\n\nSU-25T: Although it is not exceptionally well modelled with the fact it does not have an interactable cockpit, the SU-25T is one of the most combat effective ground attack planes provided in the simulation. You will have plenty hours of free fun learning the plane's systems, flight characteristics and employing it's weapon systems successfully. A great plane to introduce new pilots or players to the simulation.","August 3, 2014","true","149.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Make no mistake, this is a flightsimulator at heart, no GAME. Even if there are planes with a very low learning curve, for the full 'DCS experience' you should read or watch the manual/tutorials.\n\nThere are planes/helis for casuals, hardcore flightsim-nerds and of course newbies.\n\nIf you want to fly the A-10C and still find new things to learn after two years (~600 pages manual) or a Su-25T where you can learn how to fly & kill stuff in a few minutes with a tutorial is completly up to you.\n\nWW2 era is progressing at a quick pace, at the time of writing there are two very active WW2 dedicated servers with fun& sometimes realistic scenarios although the allys are quite a little outgunned at the current point with only the P-51D Mustang, but that will change very soon.\n\nDon't expect any balancing to spare your feelings, if an engine is more powerful IRL it will be in DCS.\n\nI own all the current released DCS modules and promise you every full DCS module + FC3 is worth the money. No starforce DRM, buggy patch or delay development can destroy the immense fun I got out of this. This sim is the next  best experience to flying a plane RL we can get on the civillian market right now. X-plane/FSX/P3D have just inferior flight models and I have yet so see anyone of those do a comfortable 6dof-friendly & clickable cockpit like in DCS.\n\n\nPro-Tip: You can fly the Su-25T & TF-51D for free! The latter is nearly exactly the same as the P-51D Mustang, only unarmed. With the Mustang you can really see what this Sim is about, Su-25T look what FC3 may be like.\nTip 2: MiG-21 for the awesome afterburner kicks, turn & burn my friend!\nTip 3: F-86F for awesome engine feels, that slow engine spooling is a beauty to fly and especially land.\nTip 4: A-10C, requires a good joystick (BUTTONZ!11) to play comfortably but may also be played with inferior joysticks if you work with lot's of modifiers. After you get the hang of this the only plane that is more rewarding might be the F-16 from Falcon BMS.","August 3, 2013","true","659.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

After following start up procedures and insuring everything is in working order I slowly raise the collective.  My bird starts to steadily lift off the ground though it wants to spin to the right.  I rudder till it is straightened out and continue to ascend, wobbly.  I leave the confines of the airfield I took off from and make my way to a nearby city, making long sweeping turns as I go.  This isn't so bad I think to myself.  I've seen videos of people trying to fly and hardly getting off the ground, I guess ArmA3's advanced flight model actually payed of!  After a flying around the city for a few minutes, turn my attention back to the airport.  Is that a C-130 I see?  Surely it is.  I have to go get a closer look.  I make a beeline for the airport, my instrument panel shaking violently as I proceed at dangerous speeds.  As I approach the plane, seeing that it is indeed a C-130, I spot a C-17.  I've got to check that out too, I pull back on my stick and to the left, lower the collective a bit and rudder into the most beautiful turn I've ever seen.  Across the flight line I spot a 707 chasis.  I wonder if that is a KC-135!  I take off in it's direction.  As I approach from the front I realise that I am going to have to make a near 180 in order see the rear of the aircraft to see if it is infact a KC-135.  I pull the stick hard to the right, but I was coming in too fast and forgot to correct my collective.  Panic sets in as I watch the altimeter rapidly tick lower and lower.  Now is not my time.  I hammer up on the collective and continue to bring the helicopter around.  An alarm goes off, I assume it to be alerting me to the rapidly approaching ground, no such luck.  The helicopter lurches upward at an alarming rate, the alarm doesn't stop.  Suddenly I hear a loud *CLUNK*  I think to my self, "What the hell was that?"  I then realise that it suddenly got a lot quieter, the sound of blades cutting through the air no longer a constant droning.  Infact it isn't their at all.  Alarmed I look around and spot my blades hurdling through the air.  I quickly apologize to my stoic faced co-pilot, he seems to have resigned to our fate.  Nonetheless I punch at the controls to no avail.  In a short moment we slam into the tarmac, exploding in a fireball of glory behind the aircraft I was so eager to check out.  I never found out if it was a KC-135 or not.\n\n10/10","September 18, 2014","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Coupled with some third party voice activation and a decent HOTAS joystick, you really can't go wrong with DCS and the A-10c DLC. The helicopter DLC (namely the Huey) from what I hear are also brain-numbingly well done.\n\nExpect some reading! I ended up printing out the 700 pg manual, memorizing two different bands of radio channels, and of course teaching myself the startup and setup procedures. And I'm still learning! Some people call this the epitome of "study-sims" but to me, that's like calling a good book the epitome of "wordy-books." Don't be silly.\n\nEven though the DLC packs I've gotten have added up to be the most expensive title in my library, even getting them on sale, I've gotten much more than I ever expected, with more to come having only really stretched my wings in the A-10c. Certainly not purchases I regret. But not a flight-sim for those with a short attention span.

While not for the casual button mashing type, this sim rewards those who want to properly and correctly learn how to use and operate the complex modern weapons systems that are on modern combat aircraft.  The DLC addon planes are  a bit expensive for what you get IMO, but at sale price are worth it..\n\nFC3 is def the best bang for your buck, with all the content that is included.\n\nDO NOT jump into this and instantly expect to be successful.. it takes practice. My only real complaint about the game  itself is the lack of training missions. In LOMAC there were videos and play along missions that taught you what and how to use the systems.

I own every DLC released to date but I mostly fly the UH-1 and the A-10C, using the Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS joystick and throttle, the Saitek Pro Combat rudder pedals and TrackIR from NaturalPoint. Yes, that's a lot of gear (and advertisement), but the DLC cockpits are SO well made, it's amazing!\n\nSpeaking of DLCs, this game does not feel like a DLC scam. The companies that have made the aircraft in the "single aircraft" DLCs have done amazing jobs. Fully interactive cockpits with "six degrees of freedom" movement (you can move in three dimentions inside the cockpit) make for a very immersive experience. The personal reward of being able to cold-start an A-10C, taxi to the runway, take off, navigate to your destination and safely land again is a great feeling!\n\nThis is to WarThunder what Arma3 is to Battlefield; it's a step-up in realism for the "gamers" that are looking for more than bunny-jumping, headshots and "lulz".","January 21, 2015","true","88.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The realism is outstanding and it's fun to play over and over. The amount of variables that can be controlled is almost overwhelming at first, but in a good way. The whole setup allows for a whole lot of freedom to plan an attack or a counter attack or to pretty much fight the enemy anyway you want. I really can't wait to see what they have coming in the future. It's hard to find a game that I truly get excited about these days but this is definitely one of them. They even have aerial refueling. Man is it hard but that's part of the fun. The only issue I have, and it's not really about the game design itself, is that I wish there were more American combat aircraft. I hope it's in the works but I'd really like to fly an AH-64 on a sortie in the Middle East or fly an F-22 and bomb the crap out of ISIS. There really is almost an unlimited amount of expansion as the creators didn't box themselves in with this game. The game is totally outstanding, even for Russians. :) :) (BTW that's why there are so many Russian aircraft)","February 27, 2015","true","60.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a simulator, not a arcade game like Ace Combat. There are settings in Dcs that make it alot like Ace Combat or War Thunder, but if you want to play this game right, you play it like it is ment to. I have yet to learn the systems of the aircraft I have (Flaming Cliffs 3) so I still have a little waise to go before im ready for intense combat. Here is a small list of some of the aircraft that will be added to Dcs in the coming months: F-18 Hornet, F-18 Super Hornet, P-47 Thunderbolt, Spitfire Mk9, F-14A/B Tomcat, L-39, and others. EDGE and Dcs World 2 should be here at any time, my guess is anywhere from the end of this month (March), to April. But thats just my guess, so take it lightly. With EDGE, Dcs will be even better with some sweet new graphics. New maps will also be added overtime aswell. So overall this is a great sim for those that love militery aviation, I myself am using it to "train" myself in some of the basics of flight and flight in combat, cause once im done with high school im going to get on track for joining the Air Force, so its a very good tool to have. Its a fun sim, its not arcady, and you actually have to put in effort to learn, so it gets a like form me! So grab a pair of wings and lets BRRRRRRTsome stuff up!","February 2, 2015","true","261.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I fly the A-10C, KA-50, and Huey alot. I do have many years of Flight Sim experience so flying them is no issue with me.

I see in all the negative reviews complaints about complex controls.. This is not Arma, where planes and helicopters model less than a quarter of the systems they have; this is a realistic combat flight sim. If you don't have a joystick you are not going to enjoy this sim. Note that even "game" mode is more realistic than Arma.\n\nTo those who think this is just another free to play money grab.. Each module has about the same amount of time put into them as each complete Battlefield game.. (maybe not Combined Arms)\n\nPros:\n- Extremely detailed systems modelling for the A-10C, P51 and Ka-50 (although controls can be frustrating without a TrackIR)\n- Very high detail graphics-wise\n- Free updates add to the sim as well as fix things (the engine is also updated sometimes for more functionality)\n- Very large range of vehicles and aircraft to fight against\n\nCons:\n- Poor AI (without extensive scripting in the editor). They overuse afterburner and run out of fuel when they reach their target, MiG-31s enter dogfights rather than outrun their enemies, ground units can see through forests and buildings, helicopter gunships fly high when attacking and almost never hover etc.\n- Some aircraft have lower resolution textures that look ugly, but that is expected from a high detail, realistic flight sim\n- Virtually unplayable without a joystick, but that is once again expected.","September 16, 2014","true","112.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After following start up procedures and insuring everything is in working order I slowly raise the collective.  My bird starts to steadily lift off the ground though it wants to spin to the right.  I rudder till it is straightened out and continue to ascend, wobbly.  I leave the confines of the airfield I took off from and make my way to a nearby city, making long sweeping turns as I go.  This isn't so bad I think to myself.  I've seen videos of people trying to fly and hardly getting off the ground, I guess ArmA3's advanced flight model actually payed of!  After a flying around the city for a few minutes, turn my attention back to the airport.  Is that a C-130 I see?  Surely it is.  I have to go get a closer look.  I make a beeline for the airport, my instrument panel shaking violently as I proceed at dangerous speeds.  As I approach the plane, seeing that it is indeed a C-130, I spot a C-17.  I've got to check that out too, I pull back on my stick and to the left, lower the collective a bit and rudder into the most beautiful turn I've ever seen.  Across the flight line I spot a 707 chasis.  I wonder if that is a KC-135!  I take off in it's direction.  As I approach from the front I realise that I am going to have to make a near 180 in order see the rear of the aircraft to see if it is infact a KC-135.  I pull the stick hard to the right, but I was coming in too fast and forgot to correct my collective.  Panic sets in as I watch the altimeter rapidly tick lower and lower.  Now is not my time.  I hammer up on the collective and continue to bring the helicopter around.  An alarm goes off, I assume it to be alerting me to the rapidly approaching ground, no such luck.  The helicopter lurches upward at an alarming rate, the alarm doesn't stop.  Suddenly I hear a loud *CLUNK*  I think to my self, "What the hell was that?"  I then realise that it suddenly got a lot quieter, the sound of blades cutting through the air no longer a constant droning.  Infact it isn't their at all.  Alarmed I look around and spot my blades hurdling through the air.  I quickly apologize to my stoic faced co-pilot, he seems to have resigned to our fate.  Nonetheless I punch at the controls to no avail.  In a short moment we slam into the tarmac, exploding in a fireball of glory behind the aircraft I was so eager to check out.  I never found out if it was a KC-135 or not.\n\n10/10","September 18, 2014","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Coupled with some third party voice activation and a decent HOTAS joystick, you really can't go wrong with DCS and the A-10c DLC. The helicopter DLC (namely the Huey) from what I hear are also brain-numbingly well done.\n\nExpect some reading! I ended up printing out the 700 pg manual, memorizing two different bands of radio channels, and of course teaching myself the startup and setup procedures. And I'm still learning! Some people call this the epitome of "study-sims" but to me, that's like calling a good book the epitome of "wordy-books." Don't be silly.\n\nEven though the DLC packs I've gotten have added up to be the most expensive title in my library, even getting them on sale, I've gotten much more than I ever expected, with more to come having only really stretched my wings in the A-10c. Certainly not purchases I regret. But not a flight-sim for those with a short attention span. Startup procedure is a solid 10 minute process. :)\n\nWith only a keyboard and mouse, expect a slightly more substantial difficulty curve","September 16, 2014","true","64.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I currently have about 40 hours of game time logged (and have spent at least twice as much time reading manuals and watching tutorials). Yet I feel that I still have so much more to learn.

I really like this plane because you have to turn on the engines like if you would on the actual plane and thats not all.

The First im gonna say 50+ Hours I played with my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro $40 Joystick (I live in Australia), I played Su-25T, FC3 and Partially A-10C. I played them all comfortably the only thing that was needed was to remember more keybindings etc for the A-10c and Su-25T, FC3 all the important stuff was able to be bound to my joystick regardless the point is, for a free simulator that has a amazing engine and crazy realism to it all you need is $40 for a joystick and any extra money for modules and you can play. I bought the HOTAS Warthog around 60 hours into the game still dont have rudder pedals but thats fine I just use the 'Z' and 'X' keys thats it, if you love Military aircraft and you plan on enlisting one day then install this game, do it you wont regret it, if you love a challenge this is the game for you. To lay it out ill put some pros and cons below.\n\n\nPros:\n- The SU-25T and PF-51 Mustang are Free\n- The best Military Aviation Simulator on the market\n- Aircraft are being added all the time for example Leatherneck Sims is working on a F-14 Tomcat model which is gonna be amazing\n- All eras of Aircraft from 40's all the way to current.\n- FC3 is more of a easier version but still in relation to the realism flight.\n- Plenty of Single Player missions and servers to play on.\n- Graphics are beautiful on this game as well as the sound.\n- Performance is good even in MP, I have a 8 year old GPU and a Quad core CPU and with come custom settings and Mirrors off I get in SP 40-60 FPS and in MP 30-40 FPS\n- If you buy it from the website or steam you can still play with eachother\n\nCons:\n- It has a big learning curve\n- There are only a few tutorial missions for standalone modules, there is no Tutorials on FC3, F-86F, Hawk only to name a few.\n- SP missions do tend to bug out sometimes not all the time\n- In the same sense that it is cheap it is also expensive with each module going for about $40+\n- not all of the modules are on Steam, the ones on the DCS website are available on there for a while before it gets released on Steam. For example 14 out of the 17 available modules are available on Steam not including terrains or campaigns.\n- You need Rudder pedals for rotary aircraft I tried and wasn't able to fly without them\n\nSo in short this is a great simulator it has its cons but its so worth it for the pros of the game. Some advice if you are thinking about spending $500 on a HOTAS Warthog, ask your self this are you going to make Simming a hobby or is it going to sit on your desk and collect dust? Simming is a expensive hobby so unless your going to use it dont bother. If you want to try the game out use a cheap joystick like the 3D Pro, if you are going to play moderately grab yourself a X55 Rhino it has HOTAS Functionality and so I have heard its a good joystick, if you know you are going to sim a fair bit at least 3-4 times a week and put hours into the game get the HOTAS Warthog and some rudderpedals. Also if you see the modules F-15C, SU-27, SU-25 and A-10A for DCS dont bother they are $10 each they are all included in Flamming Cliffs 3 Module as well as the MIG-29A, MIG-29S and SU-33.\n\nSo do I recommend the game to everyone? Yes give it a try you may like it\nFor aviation enthusiasts? Why haven't you already installed this\nFor people who want to make simming a hobby? Go buy a HOTAS and modules to your liking\n\nI absolutely love this Simiulator and if you love Military Aircraft you will too, I hoped this long ♥♥♥ essay helped in your desicion.","February 24, 2015","true","139.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The detail in the planes is so amazing! The one plane that I instantly fell inlove with was the A-10 Worthog. I really like this plane because you have to turn on the engines like if you would on the actual plane and thats not all. You also need to learn how to use the weapons system and radar systems just that are exactly how the plane is used in realy life!\n\nAnyways this game is a really fun game if you are into combat simulators.","April 18","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The advanced flight model aircraft with fully functional cockpits are about as close to the real thing as you can get without actual military sim equipment. And ED along with other 3rd party devs are continually releasing new aircraft to build more possibilities for the game and it's multiplayer. And having this single platform bring all previous and upcoming sims into one environment is genius.\n\nAnd the base platform comes with two free sims, a Su-25T (rivals A-10 Warthog with it's massive arsenal, it's powerful and easily capable to be able to hop right into multiplayer without spending a dime) and a trainer version of the P-51D, for aerobatic fun.\n\nNote that this pretty much expects you to have a joystick, don't expect to play on a keyboard, unless you buy the Combined Arms pack that lets you take control of vehicles and fight it out on the ground.\n\nAbsolutely no reason not to give it a try.

Been playing it for about 2-3 years, just recently got it on Steam. I recommend most people to at least try this game, as its free and you get the SU-25 to start with, which is actually really fun to fly after you learn it. If your not a big, "Flight - Simmer", you can always get the Flaming Cliff 3 pack, which is more arcadey. This is by far on my top 3 favorite simulators list. Always a joy to play and have fun in.\n\nIf you end up trying the game, I highly recommend a joystick, or else it wont be as fun. Track IR as well, but only invest in that stuff if you really enjoy the sim.\n\n10/10, Excellent Simulator!","May 2, 2014","true","42.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This sim is the best i've played in a long time, it has alot of Tutorials and some great AI to fight and compete with.

Many thanks to the developers for making the base game available for free on Steam. There's a lot included in DCS World to appeal to both the hardcore flight simulation crowd and to educators.\n\nThere are some minor omissions and simplifications from DCS World's default aircraft model, the Su-25, compared to its DLC packages in terms of the compexity of the cockpit's controls and graphical complexity, but what is available is so impressive to me I can't complain. Even this simplified model is more complex than many flight sims I've experienced in the past.\n\nIt's a good sign that some of the original companies which designed aircraft featured in this series are assisting with the development of the game/simulator, alongside the usual industry veterans. The sound design, user interface design, controls, mission editor and scripting system all seem to be quite well-executed. The game supports flightsticks, HOTAS and TrackIR, as well as (a rather inappropriate method of control in my opinion) the Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller alongside a mouse and keyboard.\n\nI've not yet completely explored what the game has to offer in terms of difficulty levels, or rather, aircraft simulation settings, but my advice is that people who are looking for a casual, pick-up-and-go flight simulator should do their research or probably look elsewhere, as the game may be far more complex than expected.\n\nThat said, you can't beat the price, so I would insist that you test the game out and see what you think of it first. There's plenty of tutorials in-game as well as available on the Internet to help you become accustomed to the Su-25's basic startup/taxi/takeoff/landing procedures and usage in combat.\n\nIf you are interested in online multiplayer, there is a thriving community of DCS World players online these days. I bet there's a wingman available to help you out.\n\nOverall, at a first impression I consider DCS World and its expansions to be an excellent value for its cost. I look forward to buying the expansions.","February 19, 2014","true","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This isn't DLC even though Steam lists it as DLC. If you go to the website you will see them being called modules. They are each their own game but you need the base of DCS World to use them. Don't call them overpriced because for 50 USD each you can get an A-10c, Huey, FW-190, MI-8, Bf-109, MiG-21, MiG-15, or an F-86F Sabre. These are all modeled to the exact detail as the real plane. This means the buttons, switches, levers, and everything else can be used.\n\nOne thing that bugs me about other reviews are the ones that get mad over the modules or the people that say the game is too realistic. Don't buy this game if you aren't willing to learn. It took me forever to understand this game and frankly I still don't. This simulator is not an arcade game.\n\nPros\n-Great graphics after the update\n-Runs well\n-Extremely realistic\n-Satisfying\n-Fun\n\nCons\n-Slightly unstable\n-Takes a while to load but this doesn't really matter\n","May 25","true","69.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Many hours need to be put in to master combat flight, as quite often new players to Eagle Dynamics' games will be destroyed by the AI before they can even see them.

The platform started as Lock on: modern air combat in 2003. Since then, the developer decided to part ways with Ubisoft and successfully made a niche for themselves. DCS world is the "World of tanks" for modern flight simulation. Its still in its infancy with the scope. Things are constantly being updated/added and it has become a premier flight simulation. The graphics engine is dated with more CPU intensive processes, but the engine is due for a change with a revolutionary new EDGE (Eagle Dynamics Graphic Engine) that should be released this year.\n\nThe planes are represented in painstaking detail. The physics for each plane is the most accurate representation in any flight simulation, including military trainers.\n\nThe base game is free and allows you to fly the Su-25T and TF-51D. But the others can be purchased through addons. There are two lines of DCS addons:\n\nDCS: xxxx  :: Fully detailed aircraft including clickable cockpits. You need to spend 3-5 min just starting up the aircraft. Just like pilots in real life.\n\nDCS: xxxx Flaming cliffs :: A study simulation. There are easy one button presses to get the systems/avionics going, but the aircraft physics is still modelled very much like the DCS counterparts.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is one of those MUST PLAY SIMULATIONS if you like flying aircraft.

If you have ever thought about wanting to fly a plane or helo, this is as real as it gets. This Sim will take time to master but it is all worth it in the end. The SU-25T Frogfoot is a great starter plane with simplified inputs. If you are looking for something a little more complicated the A-10C, Black Shark 2, MI-8, UH-1H and P-51 allow you to touch every button in the cockpit. I would highly recommend all of them.","August 4, 2013","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However it does have a huge learning curve, for those who like the hard core sim where every buttion and switch is modeled in the aircraft look no further! lucky for people who aren't so hard core there is the Flaming cliffs 3 module although this module still takes a bit to figure out how to use the planes some you tube vids and some button mapping to a good quality joystick and dogfighting is a blast! FC3 adds the f15C, su-27, these planes are pretty easy to fly (you dont have to pull 20 switches to fire a cannon).\n\nAfter playing a bit in FC3 and finally getting the hang of radar and beyond vis fighting I found DCS FC3 to be and enjoyable and challanging sim, dodging Heat seekers by dropping flares and pulling hard 7-9G turns only to have the missile pass beneath the belly of the aircraft by a factor of meters is such a rush, and then winning your first airvictory and then your first combat sortie is somthing that instills a sort of pride in you.\n\nTL;DR: DCS world modules like A-10C,BLACK SHARK 2, and other stand alone planes are more suited to the hard core players (even though there is a game mode it's not very well explained) FC3 with a small amount of learning can be a rewarding and fun module for the Sim junkie.\n\n(ps look up youtube tutorials as they tend to explain how to use the systems better i found this one helped alot with the F-15 http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=koa4MRGj41M however don't try to learn it all at once, you won't reamember and become frustrated!)","February 23, 2014","true","45.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For example if you play this game through Steam, it only records your game time whilst you are in the main menu.\n\nIn my opinion to get the full experience from DCS World, you should definately start looking into buying some of the DLC, they may look expensive but there are regular sales which can discount up to 75%!\n\nEagle Dynamics are constantly adding new highly detailed aircraft and are hopefully going to be releasing DCS World 2 sometime soon which will get a major graphics update, inproved flight models and much more!\n\nAt least give DCS World a try or play/watch tutorials for the aircraft that you would like to fly before disliking it, even if flight simulation is not your favourite type of genre, you may be suprised!\n\nAs I said at the start, DCS World is easily my favourite sim ever and I think its great!","February 22, 2015","true","268.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It by far outclasses others due to excellent flight models, a multiplayer that makes sense, easy-to-learn mission editor, and a large amount of detail. Even Flaming Cliffs 3 aircraft have more detail than something like War Thunder.\n\nActually, DCS excels at detail; for instance, the A-10C. It is the epitome of PC-based simulators, with most if not all of the real plane's functionality and flight characteristics. Another example is the Ka-50, and really any of the rotorcraft. They basically are the best in their class, with the full range of aerodynamic effects you'd get from the real thing- retreating blade stall, translational lift, "oh ♥♥♥♥ my blades just up and left me" (hopefully not IRL), etc.\n\nAnother thing is Nevada Test and Training Range. It is a huge map; most of Nevada, in fact. Even some parts of California. The entire Las Vegas city and suburbs are present and amazing. Even though it's not out for steam yet (as of updating), I'll leave this here.","August 10, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So all you get from the free download is the P-51 and Su-25. Fun, but not super content-rich,\n2)Do not buy this game if you want to jump in a cockpit and go blastin'. You will be disappointed.\n\nAside from that, I love this game. I was a big Ace Combat fan as a kid and always wanted something more technically challenging. It did take me a few months to gain a firm grasp of the controls, mission editor and combat tactics, but if you want to pretend to be a real fighter pilot, this is the one. Who knew trapping on a carrier or just even successfully flying a CAP would be so fun? Tons of official (Nevada map coming next month) and user made content (lockonfiles) and a really fun mission editor. Where else can you attack a US Navy carrier group with an armada of Backfire bombers and simulate how that would really happen? Plus, the first time you spot a target, evade his missile in a cloud of flares, then bang a Sidewinder or R-73 up his tailpipe is just really something.\n\ntl;dr- Its a bit of a serious game (DCS is to other combat flight sims what ArmA III is to most tactical shooters.

This was a huge learning curve from the arcade and realistic battles of warthunder but it was made easier from my time with the older sims such as Apache vs Havoc, Commanche vs Hokum and Mig alley all really old games but sims nontheless. I love this game already, it has aircraft I really wanted to fly and although the graphics show their age it is a wonderful sim, A Joystick is a must in this game as well as TrackIr which I am jerryrigging up as we speak. Now for those who say you cannot get into combat easily or whine that it's too hard just do all the training missions twice, grab a friend and make a custom mission with low threats (watch a tutorial on how to make a mission it is easier when the buttons make sense) and fart around for a few hours. I personally went from being whaaaaat when I started to hey all this makes sense and now I can take out 80% of the things I fire at in under 4 hours of playing this game. As of right now I am waiting for funds to get Flaming cliffs due to the volume of aircraft it gives and then combined arms. So if you are looking at this game do give it a try the learning curve may be steep but I have had fun figuring it out.

This was a huge learning curve from the arcade and realistic battles of warthunder but it was made easier from my time with the older sims such as Apache vs Havoc, Commanche vs Hokum and Mig alley all really old games but sims nontheless. I love this game already, it has aircraft I really wanted to fly and although the graphics show their age it is a wonderful sim, A Joystick is a must in this game as well as TrackIr which I am jerryrigging up as we speak. Now for those who say you cannot get into combat easily or whine that it's too hard just do all the training missions twice, grab a friend and make a custom mission with low threats (watch a tutorial on how to make a mission it is easier when the buttons make sense) and fart around for a few hours. I personally went from being whaaaaat when I started to hey all this makes sense and now I can take out 80% of the things I fire at in under 4 hours of playing this game. As of right now I am waiting for funds to get Flaming cliffs due to the volume of aircraft it gives and then combined arms. So if you are looking at this game do give it a try the learning curve may be steep but I have had fun figuring it out.

They must have read my mind, because a couple of years later, this game showed up. Back then it was Black Shark (World and helo in one, later they sepperated everything).\n\nThis game is  awesome and relatively perfect. This comming from a man that would love to fly a jet in real life. DCS World is free and comes with one non fully clickable cockpit SU-25T. The rest of the modules, wich holds one fully clickable cockpit aircraft, you need to buy sepperately. This is kind of ideal. Why? Because you don't have to buy the airplanes that are incrdibly ugly to you. If there is an airplane you absolutely love, buy ther module. If there is an airplane you absolutely hate, let it be and don't buy the module.\n\nWhat I don't like is that the modules are so expensive. And with expensive I mean that every module, wich means one airplane or one new map, are all priced like a full, brand new, well liked and antissipated game. wich menas 50-60 euro's. No Idea what it would be in Dollars. The airplane modules I can understand, but a map? Well, that is a bit much in my opinion.\n\nHowever I do love the game very much. Beautifull graphics wich you don't see much in games. Super realistic aircraft where you have to use the cockpit buttons to set up weapons, navigation systems, radio's etc. This is the game for all of us who can never realize our dreams of becomming real pilots.","December 13, 2015","true","118.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

I currently have all but four of the modules for DCS and find the ammount of detail put into the systems of each aircraft amazing. I find it awesome that I can get into my MI-8 and start it up per the actual aircraft's checklist and then operate it like the real thing. The graphics are great, especially the aircraft textures, considering that the game is growing in age. Hopefully we will see the release of the new EDGE engine soon and the graphics will be back up to par. I highly recommend this simulator for flight enthusiasts, combat flight enthusiasts, or even casual gamers, because you can tweak the options to suit that style of play.

If you want to get into air-to-air engagments, then go for the F-15C. If you want to get in to air-to-ground engagments, then go for the A-10A, but if you wan to fly a plane almost exactly as it is flown in real life, then go for the A-10C.\n\nThe main difference in modules like the A-10C and the F-15C (besides them being two completely different aircraft) is the interactive cockpit. This means that the A-10C has a cockpit with buttons that are almost all clickable and all carry out the same function as the real life counterpart. Other than that the modules all have the same realism level meaning that they handle and behave very realistically both in combat and free flight missions.\n\nI give this game a 9.5/10 rating because you have a somewhat limited selection of planes to fly, but this isn't an immediate problem because by the time you learn how to utilize a plane's capabilities effectively in combat,  you won't want to instantly jump into another because you probably won't be interested in making yourself commit suicide.\n\nWarning:\nDCS is not a game, it's a simulator. You can't just load it up and play with no learning period. If you want a game like that, then play Ace Combat. This game is very serious, so don't think you'll be the one to just hop on and instantly be good at it, because if you do, you'll loose all confidence you had in yourself as a gamer.","August 29, 2015","true","143.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

So all you get from the free download is the P-51 and Su-25. Fun, but not super content-rich,\n2)Do not buy this game if you want to jump in a cockpit and go blastin'. You will be disappointed.\n\nAside from that, I love this game. I was a big Ace Combat fan as a kid and always wanted something more technically challenging. It did take me a few months to gain a firm grasp of the controls, mission editor and combat tactics, but if you want to pretend to be a real fighter pilot, this is the one. Who knew trapping on a carrier or just even successfully flying a CAP would be so fun? Tons of official (Nevada map coming next month) and user made content (lockonfiles) and a really fun mission editor. Where else can you attack a US Navy carrier group with an armada of Backfire bombers and simulate how that would really happen? Plus, the first time you spot a target, evade his missile in a cloud of flares, then bang a Sidewinder or R-73 up his tailpipe is just really something.\n\ntl;dr- Its a bit of a serious game (DCS is to other combat flight sims what ArmA III is to most tactical shooters.

For example if you play this game through Steam, it only records your game time whilst you are in the main menu.\n\nIn my opinion to get the full experience from DCS World, you should definately start looking into buying some of the DLC, they may look expensive but there are regular sales which can discount up to 75%!\n\nEagle Dynamics are constantly adding new highly detailed aircraft and are hopefully going to be releasing DCS World 2 sometime soon which will get a major graphics update, inproved flight models and much more!\n\nAt least give DCS World a try or play/watch tutorials for the aircraft that you would like to fly before disliking it, even if flight simulation is not your favourite type of genre, you may be suprised!\n\nAs I said at the start, DCS World is easily my favourite sim ever and I think its great!","February 22, 2015","true","268.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It by far outclasses others due to excellent flight models, a multiplayer that makes sense, easy-to-learn mission editor, and a large amount of detail. Even Flaming Cliffs 3 aircraft have more detail than something like War Thunder.\n\nActually, DCS excels at detail; for instance, the A-10C. It is the epitome of PC-based simulators, with most if not all of the real plane's functionality and flight characteristics. Another example is the Ka-50, and really any of the rotorcraft. They basically are the best in their class, with the full range of aerodynamic effects you'd get from the real thing- retreating blade stall, translational lift, "oh ♥♥♥♥ my blades just up and left me" (hopefully not IRL), etc.\n\nAnother thing is Nevada Test and Training Range.

If youre looking for the best experience with crafts like A-10, SU-25, MIGs, F-15, others, + variety of choppers - it's your choice. Specifically For F-18, F-16, F-14 look elsewhere, VRS things for Flight Simulator X, falcon BMS and others.\nMUST HAVE, before even thinking of purchasing this one:\n- TrackIR (absolute MUST);\n- joystick and throttle (best if Thrustmaster H.O.T.A.S);\n- rudder pedals (many would argue,  but thats a MUST, cuz you'll never get to use wheel brakes and yaw axis correctly  with else);\n- capable PC (stronger the better cuz performance in this is a question of life and death sometimes);\n- touchscreen monitor as wide and big as possible (optional, but VERY recommended, rids you of constant mouse  usage. anoying when right hand always on stick then mouse then back);\n- voice recognition softwere and mic (useful for issuing radio comands and requests)\n- persistence and patience;\n\nExpences are high, and be ready for it. Be ready to spend hours, months and years learning and practising everything, and youll be very surprised of the result, it's like nothing else in PC gaming on my experience. Its not even a game, sometimes it's a hard brain work but that very rewarding when the mission is 100 % complete","January 10","true","142.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For example if you play this game through Steam, it only records your game time whilst you are in the main menu.\n\nIn my opinion to get the full experience from DCS World, you should definately start looking into buying some of the DLC, they may look expensive but there are regular sales which can discount up to 75%!\n\nEagle Dynamics are constantly adding new highly detailed aircraft and are hopefully going to be releasing DCS World 2 sometime soon which will get a major graphics update, inproved flight models and much more!\n\nAt least give DCS World a try or play/watch tutorials for the aircraft that you would like to fly before disliking it, even if flight simulation is not your favourite type of genre, you may be suprised!\n\nAs I said at the start, DCS World is easily my favourite sim ever and I think its great!","February 22, 2015","true","268.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

When exactly will this happnen? I know people think that it would not work but have you playde Time Machine? The motion controllers work fine with it. The left controller is your flight stick, im sure it can be programed easily for DCS. The right stick can be many things, has anyone tried Universe Sandbox? With a key press on left stick where the grip is, you can open up a display on top of the left stick without giving up control of the flight and select menus or selections using your right controller. The right controller can also be used to virtually touch the switches and turn knobs all by holding down the trigger and using the motion of turning or pushing. It can also be your throttle, hold down trigger, move forward for thrust or backwards for cutting engines. ♥♥♥♥, if I could code, I would be all over this in a heart beat.\n\nThanks for listening and please let me know if this is possible?\n\n","May 10","true","7.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You are able to fly certain planes in a simulated environment in military missions. There are many planes available though most are extra dlc's, you only get the soviet SU-25T for free, which is still very fun to play. Generally you should have a joystick with thrust and use either TrackIR or something like FaceTrackNoIR to control your head movement in the cockpit. Also important to mention is that the different dlc's (also called modules) with their planes have different simulation difficulty, some have a non-clickable 3D cockpit with simplyfied flight model and some like the A-10C require you to basically learn how to start up and fly the plane in a way you would do in reality with all it's buttons, switches and so on. Overall it is a great game, not the most accesible but the free plane is great to explore whether you like this game and you can always decide to go more hardcore with other planes or difficult missions. Aaaaand you also get the free mission editor/campaign editor which allows you to create your own content.\nSo all summed up, you like flight simulation and fighting jets?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vetron/recommended/223750/","vetron","Vetron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vetron/","732 products in account","DCS World is flight simulator first and throughout with a steep learning curve. However its free-to-play model does make it accessible to trying it before investing in expensive add-ons.\n\nPerformance and PlayabilityPerformance wise the game runs really well on my medium-high machine, was able to easily max out most of the settings and with no obvious issues, and it can be quite visually nice to look at. The game also runs without issue on Windows 10 for me.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=678767699\nAircraftThe game comes with two aircraft; a TF-51D "Mustang" WW2 Fighter, and a Su-25T "Frogfoot" Attack Jet. Both are modeled with considerable detail and offer realistic flight models. The aircraft can be modified with different payload / weapon options. Aircraft addons you buy may offer even more realistic flight behavior depending on what you buy.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=678767496\nNOTE: Because this game caters towards relatively hardcore flight mechanics,  I would recommend if you are a new pilot to flight simulation (i.e. never flown at all in other simulators) start out with more accessible titles (such as Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition[ http] or X-Plane 10 Global[ http] as of writing this) until you have the grasp of the very basics of flight, and then come back and work through the training missions included. Jumping right in might just lead to frustration if you don’t really have a handle on the basics of flight, as its easier to learn from the point of how to fly the specific aircraft, rather than how to fly a plane in general. At least in my opinion anyway (and no means a dig at the game).\n\nFree to play limitsThere are no obvious limits or restrictions in place that I could see. You are really only limited by what aircraft you can fly, most of which you have to purchase separate.\n\nFree Flight (Instant Action and Fast Missions)DCS World comes with both pre-set instant action scenarios, as well as fast missions. The fast missions allow you to select the aircraft you wish to fly, then set the start location and enemy difficulty – and generate a combat scenario where you can put your aircraft to the test.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=678767304\nMissions & CampaignIncluded with the free-to-play portion of the game is several stand-alone missions for the SU-25T, as-well as a scripted campaign. There is also several training missions as-well. There is likely several hours’ worth here, and you can of course just install user created missions or create your own.\n\nConclusionIf you want a combat flight simulator, with emphasis on the simulation then the free-to-play DCS World is recommended.\n\nGood\nPair of detailed aircraft (with many more to buy)\nRealistic Flight models\nSelection of available missions and campaign\nFree-to-play\n\nNot so good\nNot as wide selection of content as other games\nLimited scenery","May 4","true","21.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Due to the nonresponsive keyboard, I wasn't even able to exit the game.  I eventually managed to force quit the game with some fancy mousing, and discovered that DCS had actually disabled my keyboard completely, which would explain why even Ctrl-Alt-Del wouldn't work.\n\nFrom the reviews I've seen I'm sure DCS World is playable and possibly even enjoyable, but it certainly didn't give me the opportunity to experience that first-hand.","May 30","false","0.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","1"

The flight dynamic models are very accurate and simulate the real-life aircraft very well indeed. In my opinion, the A-10C Warthog Module is well worth the price, simulating all the instruments and flight controls (from the ejector seat to the climate control), providing an extremely detailed level of gameplay\n\nHowever, the game isn't very beginner friendly and takes a while to familiarize with the controls, keybinds and aircraft operation. The game can also consume performance at times. Despite this, DCS: World (providing the SU-25T and the TF-51D aircraft for free) is definitely worth the download, regardless of which modules you additionally purchase. In terms of simulation, this is the best of the best. 10/10","June 20, 2014","true","92.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This one seemed very realistic from what I could tell (I've never flown a plane before). Me and my friend had a blast trying to learn this game. I found DCS World to be very entertaining and sometimes comical mostly because we were SO terrible at it. I do highly recommend it and one day want to come back to it, maybe if I get a joystick or just have more time. This is a game that definitely takes practice. There are dozens of control keys and combinations that you have to remember just to fly and land a plane, and another couple dozen for combat. That's like a memorization game in itself! Me and my friend joked that if we could successfully fly this plane then we could head over to the local airport and probably fly a real plane.

I had that originally with some DLC before Steam offered it.)\n\nAs far as I know Digital Combat Systems is the only software company that is dedicated to making true to life simulations.  If your into flight simulators, and you love the military planes, this is a must have!  The DLC that you buy for this is well worth it.  These are not your run of the mill games, the learning curve is quite high.  But if you dedicate the time to learning the sims you will know what it feels like to be a combat pilot.  Hell it took me multiple nights of playing just to learn how to start up the A-10!  And you think that it's easy to take off in a P-51 Mustang, that's what I thought too until I went turning to the left on the runway smack dab into a building.  I didn't know that you need to compensate for P factor.  Hell, didn't know what P factor was until started playing this simulator.  What I'm trying to say is that when it comes to simulators for the PC, it don't get any closer to the real thing than it does with DCS simulators.","August 2, 2013","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didnt even screw around with the hundreds of key combos and macros, I just mapped them to my Nostromo, which a took an hour in of its self, and even after that, I foolishly jumped into a instant action mission, thinking that I could "wing" it (see what I did there?). How wrong I was. Seriously, everything you would have to do in a real jet has to be done here, and honestly, that's not a bad thing. Every blown up tank tastes just that much sweeter, but be prepared to put in hours of training before you have the compentency to fly any combat missions; this is about as real as it gets.","February 24, 2014","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

DCS World is seperated into two types of modules: 'DCS' level and 'Flaming Cliffs' level. DCS level aircraft such as the A-10C, the KA-50, and the UH-1 require an understanding of aircraft avionics to operate them. Most procedures are 80-90% accurate. Flaming Cliffs level modules have the the same quality of flight modeling, but they have simplified avionics. This means it requires a single button press to start the engines for example. I highly recommend this title if you have an interest in military aircraft simulations.","August 2, 2013","true","43.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It will appeal to a very small target market. I'll give it one more hour before i uninstall. Would not play regulary enough to justify the cost of the DLC content. What i would like to see is an even more dumbed down version for newbies to flight sims and a magic button to setup joystick controls, even loading a named controller from a database would be good.\n\n((it needs a BF3 mode - switch on, login, join game, shoot stuff otherwise its just a flightsim)(There are no three week training courses to teach all the details of this game, so many will not bother. the guides are good, but if you cant grasp the basics after ten minutes EPIC FAIL))\n\nVote yes/no    eer.. uumh..

The first thing you need to ask yourself is 'Can you fly a SU25t frogfoot?' if the answere is no then don't worry because there is a tutorial in place with DCS world that talks you thru the take off and landing procedures etc. So now you need to ask your self 'can you fly any plane whatoever?' if the answere is still no then here begins your problem because there are no tutorials available in game except a few videos showing you whats what which are next to useless if you haven't ever flown for example an F15 eagle or a P51 mustang then you will need to do your own research on how to fly them. I started the A10 campaign and managed to take off as the engine was already running but once I did I found that I was just a piece of metal in the sky because I couldn't operate any of the systems to use my weapons and even if I could I didnt have the first clue about how to effectively use them anyway.\nSo why does this game get a 'thumbs up'? because it is a good creation so much effort has been put into this that it deserves nothing less, a 'thumbs down' would suggest a bad game which is unfair and I can imagine that when you take off in multiplayer with your buddy and fly in formation that this on it's own would be extremely satisfying let alone completing missions from the hangar to take off to battle and back to landing...I'm just totally incapable of learning how to fly an acutal plane without having actually gone to flight school first. This is a good game but requires a lot of work just to be able to do the basics.","January 18, 2015","true","25.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

DCS is for the other 2 types .\n\nif you love flying but don't want to go too deep into anything other than basic flight mechanics , then you're in the right place. DCS has "non-clickable cockpits" in different planes where you don't have to know what every single switch does. you just have to memorize a few keyboard shortcuts and have a basic knowledge of reading the instruments which is really easy if you're willing to do so . you will get to feel how a real plane flies without having to dig into books to be able to start your aircraft. BUT here is the thing. you can by FC3 and get so many planes at a decent price . if you go for DCS you will have to buy each plane separately (expect for the 2 included in the free version) . the choice is up to you. but KEEP reading .\n\nFinally if you are from the last type , then you just have to grab your stick , hop in a plane and start your journey. there are clickable cockpits in the game where  you actually NEED to know what every single switch does in order to be able to start up , take off , navigate ...etc. its pretty much like knowing how to fly a real plane and believe me , there's an ocean of details that you can enjoy messing with. look no further because DCS not only brings you a realistic experience , but it has better graphics and in-game physics than all the other flying simulators on the market right now. go look for yourself and compare this gem to FSX or FG and see the difference.\n\n\n\n\nAs a final note , some say the planes are expensive. I believe for the amount of detail that the planes provide you with the prices are decent . but before purchasing any , make sure you look for teh frequent sales on the DCS' website. usually you can by all planes for %70 off (and more if you purchase multiple planes) so then you won't have to cry over your empty wallet . just keep an eye open for sales and you will get a really good deal . I say again , if you're from the second type , consider going with DCS:FC3 . you will get pretty much all the planes in one package instead of having to buy them separately.","August 26, 2015","true","132.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Free Su-25T alone will keep you occupied for many hours as you learn the ins and outs of flying like a real pilot.  Every switch, every knob, every lever can be operated in some way.  Everything visible in the cockpit works and every dial is accurate.  On very high-end machines, in screenshots, it's hard to tell it's a simulator and not real at first glance at the cockpit detail.\n\nRecently, I purchased the Flaming Cliffs 3 DLC package as well, as the F-15C is amazingly more fun than the Su-25T.  Haven't even had a chance to try out the various MiGs or even roll out the A-10A.\n\nIf you even remotely like games involving flight, this is one you should try out.  Play the training missions, make a couple practice ones, and practice, practice, practice.  It's an incredibly fun and challenging experience learning how to fly these aircraft.\n\nDCS World is amazing.","November 22, 2014","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Decided to give up within 3 days of purchase.\n\nEventually I began to sit down, listen to the tutorials, take notes, view videos and check out the eagledynamics forum for beginner's tips.\n\nTook me a month before I was able to employ the guided munitions on ground targets, another month to practise taking out multiple targets in a single pass, and yet another month to effectively use the GAU-8 gun and CBUs. All that done with a trusty gamepad and the good 'ol keyboard. Picked up a Saitek x52 after a while and it's the only game that I enjoy besides Total War.\n\nAfter a year, and I'm dodging SAM missles in an A-10C and started larning to fly the F-15, SU-27, SU-25 and MIG-29.

One thing i DO NOT like about this game would be the variety of planes that are actually free... Of all the DLC planes, theres several others that cannot be used by the player at all! For people like me who reap the freebies when it comes to military games, I am kinda disappointed. A few more planes to choose from would spice the game up; im not saying make every single player-restricted plane free here. I just dont agree that the Frogfoot is enough for the big leap (pun intended). It gets boring flying in the same planes over and over again. I want to also see some "bigger" planes being given to the players as DLC or free. In conclusion, even though my laptop cannot actually handle this game with ease, it's a wonderful game that just needs more planes to crash into the ground.","November 9, 2014","true","43.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

You will need to have at least a proper Joystick for this to be enjoyable. I let a friend borrow mine and I tried to play without it... That didn't go so weary well)\n\nOkey, for god sake Steam, put in a button so I can have between like and disslike... So I don't have to sit and have this dilemma to thumb up or down. After 15min I gave it up\n\nThe entire simulator itself is just... Magic, I never knew that a aircraft simulator when I can look around in the cockpit and and pull, press, and switch on everything and it actually DO SOMETHING, existed!!! I'm not sure you can find anything better then this that both looks good, sound good, and with so much details, and the feel when I fly... Words can not describe how wonderfull this is.\n\n\nI only have one problem, and I both understand and not undstand why. And that is the price to buy the other aircrafts. Fine, if we say this newly released MiG for 44,99£ that's acceptable for my part.\n\nBut when this 3 year old airplane cost as much, just no. Put down the price a little Plz. Maybe put down the price on one jet would be fine so those that is new to this and can actually put in maybe 25£ or even 30£ to give this Simualtor a try out for something different would be really nice. If they really enjoy it, I don't doupt they will buy the rest after. I will get the Huey later that's for sure when I can already see how wonderfull this simulator is with details, but that's me, don't be so sure if other will think the same. I think that could help.\n\n\nOther thing I hope will happen, but it doesn't bother me, but could be a nice thing:\n\n-See my body in the airplane and he stretch his arm to press or switch (and i'm talking about an option you can turn on and off to have this) (PS. I just found that it's a thing, don't know how I missed that)\n\n-The ground people and my pilot when he bail out to have some proper animations when they walk, I mean, the animation is really awkward.\n\n-when I turn the camera when I see from the pilot view when I bail out that he to move his head, I don't think that should be much of a problem to fix, by the thought of how many other things they done.\n\n-It could be fun if the aircraft didn't just turn into a pile of nothing when it crash hard, it could just be fun for the enjoyment to be in the big crash when the aircraft flips around and slide over the ground when you make that enormous crash to the ground. Specially if I fly a jet in high speed and slowly get the belly of the plane closer and closer to the ground, and then just BOOM! I turn into nothing on the ground but smoke.\n\n-Maybe the things that is stationed on the ground could have some physics to? First time I tried to start from the ground, my right wing hit the stationed Helicopter, and that Heli was hard as a mountain. I don't ask for something super advanced, just that it maybe could move or something.\n\n\nI have some more, but eeh, getting to long now, those are the most "important" if I can name it so when it comes to those details. It might see as nitpicking, but it could make this simulator more immersive if you know what I mean.\n\n\nOther then that, it's free for god sake, you get a nice propeller plane free to mess around in. And a Su-25T if I remeber correct now, but in the Su-25T you can only fly it, not press any buttons and so in the cockpit. But you can do that with the other plane.\n\nSo if you looking for a nice simulator, look no further.","January 22","true","7.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

There is no dynamic campagin\n\nIf you wana to have fun with formation flying things like that buy it.\nIf you count that you  can play complicated missions, capturing towns, airfields, something like battlefield or ARMA but on simulation level (what would be nice), dont buy it. Because nobody has not made such a mission on campagin but it is posible to make-devs dont care about it\n\nIts a good game, nice looking, phisics is also on very good level you need to spend some teens of hours to learn how to fly and fight that is realy nice. Almost everything is very good here except of one thing.\nDigital Combat Simulator can not simulate big military operations, MMO etc. It offers tanks, artilaery, planes, helicopters, ships, AWACS, EWR, AA and many many more + posibility to take comand over vehicles/groups or even drive them but for what? there is no dynamic campagin. In multipalyer guys has crafted some good missions but they are concentrated mostly on PVPing on air than on gound that cooperation (but it should be opposite because it real planes only support military operations but the most important ground forces are). DCS has few misions built in, if you want more you have mission editor, then everything you have to built self!!!  If you got bored of PVPing or formation flying then you have to become a GAME DEVELOPER and spend thousends of hours to create good mission/campagin to play (like me, I spend more time in editor than in air/ground). To built something good on good level you need to spend houndreds of hours to create mission, I will not tell about dynamic campagin (some thousends hours).\nDeveloppers dont planing to make online dynamic campagin (join/leave when you want and choose automaticly generated mission to do in online campagin) but it is posible to create it but they prefer to create new modules for $ then something what is missing for years here. just look here:\nover 100 pages...answer from ED? IS not posible due to overstress of PC. It is posible when you make deactivating object witch are not necesery now (players are far). I have implemented over 200 groups and over 4100 objects. Its working. 4200 is unstable.\nIn my opinion, Its beter for devs to produce more modules for not finished " DCS wrold", because its easier and faster to do, than realy needed stuff like dynamic campagin.\n\nP.S dont tell devs that DCS has not been thought throught well...you will get BANNED :D","March 16","false","108.2"," 11 of 42 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","11","42","0","11"

You were meant to move your head so that it enters your field of view.\n\nThe game itself is completely unplayable in VR. Everything has its own complicated keybinding ( Ctrl + Shift + Del = turn on power, F5 + num9 + roll your face on the left half of the keyboard is turn power off)\nI'm sure plenty of basement dwellers enjoy that kind of immersion but it is COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE while you are wearing a VR headset.\nWhy?\nBecause you cannot see the keyboard to execute the overly complicated commands.\nDuh.\n\nMaybe this is a revolution in gaming.

For example the menu music is very load for headset user. You go to audio and lower it and nothing then lower other audios and nothing and finnaly turn all sound off and still no change. Seem you have to restart the game to get it to notice you changed the game volume.\n\nThe next issue I had was the game hung. no biggie not the first game to hang. I closed it but now steam believes the game is running so I have to launch the game from the game folder. there is nothning in my task manager that shows and thing like DCS or run.exe. I am sure a reboot wil fix it but I just want to play.\n\nSo wierd things like this happening and forcing me to restart the game to see if the change to things like volume will stick.\n\nThe final one was my Joystick. I have the X-55 Rhino and DCS fresh install does not recognise the throttle. At first I thought it was my setup so I tested it in windows devices and printers it works just fine. I then fired off War Thunder and it worled just fine as it did with elite dangerous. I did research and followed 3 different "fixes" none of them work.

"it worked on my computer". that just show the indifferance of the developers to bugs in the game.\nTo bad because what could have been maybe the best flight simulator for PC is complitly unplayable due to inefficent QA and bug solving.\n\nAll in all - potentially a great game, unplayble due to bugs, long loading times, and bad UX.\nI give it 3 out 10 (beacuse of the bugs otherwise it would get an 8 or 9)","October 16, 2014","false","2.9"," 15 of 60 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","15","60","0","4"

I've played complicated sims before like Kamov Hokum, but each has it's own level of detail for targeting/controls so you pretty much need to learn each sim.\n\nThe problem is the tutorials are broken.  The spacebar is used to proceed through the tutorial, but even with the default key mapping I enver changed, it does not work.  Googling found lots of other people with same problem.  I finally found a key mapping that managed to get the tutorial to start, but then later it froze again and nothing I did would get it to proceed.  Seems like the tutorial, something that is very linear, should be easily testable with default control settings, but apperently even after numerous reports from users, they haven't bothered fixing it.","November 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 34 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","4","34","0","3"

War Thunder is better for both the beginner and expert. It also has some awesome areal dog fighting.\n\nPROS:\n-Nice graphics\n-It does the job as a flight sim\n\nCONS:\n-Greed. I could never endorse a game which charges over $600 for DLC. I understand the base game is free. However, lets say you purchase the P-51D Mustang. $29.99 invested in the game. Not bad for a flight sim. But for you $30 you can fly 3 planes. Thats it. Pretty poor for a flight sim. Say you want to fly a MIG 21. The game is now an $80 investment. This is simply not good enough. If you want dogfighting go play War Thunder. If you want a better flight sim experience go play FSX or even better...X-Plane.","February 27","false","0.0"," 4 of 34 people (12%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","12","4","34","6","8"

However, after the long wait, i was ready to play the game i had wanted for quite a while, but never had a good enough computer to play, this christmas i bought an NVIDIA GTX 750 TI so that i could run more games on PC, i was excited to play and opened DCS world for the first time, straight away, a small black window, a console window, appeared, after a few seconds it vanished and the game booted up, i adjusted the resolution and put the game onto highest settings, loaded up the free flight mode and then, i was kicked out of the game onto the desktop, after a while it loaded back up and loaded free flight, it kept doing the same thing, once i decided to wait and eventually, free flight loaded.\n\ni couldn't wait to play, i tried to turn the plane, and it went spiralling out of control into the poorly designed, two-dimensional, badly rendered textures of the ground, the plane then exploded. i waited, the game never respawned me, instead i was taken to an airport ingame, and forced to watch a random aeroplane sit still, i tried moving the mouse, pressing keys etc. but nothing would happen, i pressed on Esc and clicked on quit, i was kicked out of the game again for a while, then my entire desktop went black for 5 minutes, i pressed Ctrl+Alt+Delete but DCS would not close, it eventually loaded the game again, and it crashed instantly.\n\nI rate this game 7.5/10, not enough black screens","December 27, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 27 people (4%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","4","1","27","5","4"
