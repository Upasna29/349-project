A game that touches something profoundly deep in you and perhaps parallels your own life in many ways. I haven't found a lot of these games. In fact they can be counted on one hand, but The Cat Lady is among those few.\n\nWhat I am about to write will be a somewhat biased review of this magnificent work of art. Biased because the game touches upon emotions and experiences all too real and haunting to me personally. But I will try to maintain some objectivity towards the game from a more general gameplay perspective as well. So a quick warning to you, dear reader, I may get quite sentimental and soppy writing this.\n\nThe Cat Lady is a 2D story driven psuedo-psychological horror adventure puzzle rooted in borderline depression, chronic loneliness and suicide. It puts you in control of Susan Ashworth, a 30-something year old woman who has taken her own life to end her emotional suffering. But instead of death's cold embrace she so longs for, a twisted fate has her waking up in a windswept corn field in Limbo, where she is forced into a mysterious pact with the Queen of Maggots; Susan must return to life and kill five evil psychopaths before she herself is allowed to finally die. Until then, she is gifted with immortality - much to her distress - for that is the last thing a suicidee could have wished for.\n\nThe bleak noir graphics and bone-chilling eerie music will plunge you into a dark and foreboding atmosphere with grotesque and nauseating visuals at every corner. Much of the game is portrayed in a borderline black-and-white style, and there is an everpresent gloom shrouding nearly every aspect of the game. It is unnerving and bizarre from start to finish. The bulk of the gameplay is done through ”find X and use on Y” type puzzles, most of which aren't too difficult to figure out.\n\nThe controls are a bit clunky and odd, and the volume on voiced dialogue and effects suffer from poor balancing. Although there are a few game-altering choices along the way, most of the story is very liniar and easy to complete. The real staying power of the game is its dialogues, character development and the exciting way the story unfolds. It draws you in and makes you want to continue onwards. The game dazzles you with its intense atmosphere, engaging social interactions and excellent writing. It is never boring; an interactive and gripping tale of fear, angst and a fair share of violence and gore with even some humor and laughs in the mix.\n\nWhat strikes me the deepest about The Cat Lady is the gradual development of Susan's struggle against her depressive life. As the story progresses, she grows and develops so profoundly. More and more you begin to realize that beneath the haunting artstyle and horror, this is not just a story about monsters and murder; it is a story about conquering fear and negativity, a tale about heartfelt friendship and love. It is inspiring. It is empowering. And it is so vivid and genuine. Even if you have not been through the dark recesses of suicide and depression yourself, Susan's journey will still be a tear-wrenching tale of victory and self-enlightenment.\n\nThe Cat Lady is a hauntingly beautiful game that can be very scary to play. Not just because of its creepy visuals, atmosphere and effects - but moreso due to its brutal and genuine delving into the sickness of a broken human psyche. It is real. It is profound. I almost could not get past the first two chapters of the game for these reasons. But I am ecstatic that I pressed past my angst and stuck with it, because Susan's story unfolds into just a mindblowingly amazing telling of loneliness and tragedy turned to life and strength, love and friendship. She becomes an angel of vengeance, sent to kill demons in human disguise, but ultimately conquers her own demons as well.\n\nThank you, Harvester Games. You are gaming angels in disguise <3","August 6, 2014","true","11.7"," 243 of 257 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","243","257","2","21"

She swallows a whole lot of pills and here is where the journey really begins, when you wake up in a dreamlike field to the protagonists confusion. The main story, if you look outside of characters and their interactions and how they end up, is not the most logical or devoid of plotholes, but I wouldn't focus completely on where you are and why due to the surreal nature of the game. Instead the focus should be on the characters, and really think of them as people, mainly Susan and Mitzi. Perhaps this interaction between cynicism and optimism - the existential crisis - isn't relatable to everybody, but it doesn't have to be, it's a game filled with greatly written dialogues and amazing visuals, interesting story elements with profound symbolism at every corner.\n\n“Bleak, uncertain, beautiful”\nThis is a game where the visuals really mean something, where the artstyle, while bleak and macabre, is still incredibly powerful with salient bright-red blood and shocking aesthetics. The photorealistic nature of the game makes the visuals really speaks to you, it impacts you in a way not many games do. It makes every moment tense and terrifying especially considering how well the visuals are paired with the music. It creates phenomenally thick atmosphere of eery beauty. The characters move in an uncanny and rigid way which really adds to the overall uneasy “feel” of the game. It's a game where you can find the ugly beautiful, or just find it ugly. Although “ugly” would be totally suitable considering the circumstances.\n\nMusic, oh wow-wee!\nThe music in this game goes from heavy distorted riffs with beautiful and powerful vocals to the minimalistic, somber piano pieces. The music is used perfectly in this game. When the piano kicks in during some of the monologues or some of the more laid-back dialogues you are just sat there awe-struck, amazed at how much you are drawn in. The music is overall very fitting and wonderful, matching each moment more or less brilliantly.\n\nUh oh, characters!\nThe characters in this game are remarkably fleshed-out. Especially the main character and her relations. The way they talk to each other, they way they seem like they have some real connection on a personal level. How they argue about some of our protagonists more cynical ways of seeing the world, of how she look at other people, it felt very believable, it was written amazingly. From the “parasites”(the main plot impetus) we get some quite cool performances with some of the voice acting really convincing the player of how twisted, cruel and weird they are. How despite not being able to die we have reason to fear these people solely because of what they might do to us while we're still alive. I could write for hours on the relationship between Mitzi and Susan, but I wouldn't want to give much of it away out from its context.\n\n\nConclusiveness!\nThis is one of my favorite games, although that means nothing, it's really a game that I could insert myself in to, to feel like it was talking to me. It was a personal experience for me, which it may not be for everybody. Probably not for most people. But I think most people can enjoy the quirky/creepy characters, the insane visuals and the great music. That most people can enjoy the story which holds up fine just as an adventure. You can view this game from different perspectives and still thoroughly enjoy it for its different characteristics. I played this game almost a year ago and it's still fresh in my memory, it's truly one of the best experiences I've had in gaming. Personal or not. It's a game that is grown up. It's a game, among many others, that shows that this industry have something to it as well. That this is a valid art form. The thing we spend our time on, the things we think about, is also important, this is more than a time sink, our interests have merit. Our tastes can supersede visceral bloodshed. This game is perhaps not best suited for most gamers, but I long for a day where games like this has a bigger place in our medium, where profoundness trumps “fun” for a bigger portion of gamers. I only have one thing to say now, thanks, for everything.","December 4, 2013","true","3.4"," 338 of 387 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","338","387","0","3"

The game deals with dark materials like suicide, death and many more things. But will you want to play it ?\n\nIn The Cat Lady we play as Susan Ashworth, she's a 40 year old woman who lost everything she cared about. She has no friends and she decides to take her own life away. But after committing suicide she is given another chance to make things right. She has to confront 5 people so she can live in peace.\n\nNow I was following the project ever since it first launched on Desura, but I've never got the chance to finish the game until recently I decided to sit down and finish it and let me tell you this game is quite the experience.\n\nThe game is a very dark game and is not suitable for the young audiences and should only be played by adults. The whole time playing I felt unsettled of the very dark nature. The game's script is it's strongest feature which grips you until you finish the game and see how the entire story wraps up.\n\nThe game is a simple adventure game. You can go to two sides either to left or right and you can collect items and interact with the environment. The game is fairly simple and there's not much else I can say about the gameplay since it is fairly simple.\n\nThe graphics might not look great, but they're really good. I loved the whole black and white art style and it really settles the mood and makes you feel uneasy the entire time playing. The graphics are accompanied by a great soundtrack. While it's not the best soundtrack it helps build the atmosphere.\n\nThe voice acting is this games weakest part. The entire game has different audio quality ranging from pretty good to abysmal. But that's not that big of a problem.\n\nThe game ran incredibly smoothly from start to finish, until chapter 4 where there is a massive frame drop for a certain sequence, but it only happened in that part.\n\nThe entire game took me 7 hours to finish and I loved every minute of it.  The game does have a bit of replay value because this game has some player choices that do affect the outcome of the story, but it's pretty minor stuff.\n\nSome of the puzzles might seem hard, but for the most part it's really simple stuff nothing really cryptic.\n\nOverall if you're not easily disturbed, I highly suggest giving The Cat Lady a chance as it's one of the best games I've played as of recent. The incredible story and characters will grip you till the end credits and you will love every single moment of it.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9/10 A must own\n\nIf you liked this review please give it a like and if you disliked please post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 6, 2015","true","8.7"," 171 of 181 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","171","181","7","2"

Some of these topics are, but not limited to: death, depression, suicide, cancer, and homicide.\nStoryYou play as Susan Ashworth, a middle-aged woman who has just attempted suicide by swallowing a large amount of sleeping pills. She leaves a note with a simple “thanks for nothing” at the end, showing she has nothing really left to live for. Hoping to be released by death, she is instead offered another proposition, perhaps one she cannot refuse. From that offer, Susan’s tale begins. The story itself is one that can be a real tear jerker. The plot was interesting, with a few plot twists to keep it engaging and interesting, without making it too confusing. The story, though it is a bit linear, does have quite few choices that can affect the ending to an extent. The characters are all unique in their own respects, with their roles being portrayed in a very realistic way. Such as Susan, where she portrays the role of someone who is depressed very well, and does not make it seem over the top.\nGameplayThe gameplay is simple to learn, including a few puzzles to progress through the story; most are fairly simple, but some may require a bit more thought and effort. You can move left and right in the 2D environment and interact with objects, making the mechanics very simple to learn and will allow for easier immersion into the story. Paying attention to your environment and dialogues can help with these puzzles, helping to make sure you pay attention to what is happening.\nAesthetics/AudioThe art-style is very interesting, being mostly in black in white, with a few scenes and objects being in color. Considering the topics that the game deals with, the black and white scheme fits it very well, but does so in a way that is not too cliché. The weakest part of this game is the voices for the characters. Though the dialogues from the characters are well put, the audio itself has varying qualities. This can catch one off-guard at first, but if you can ignore the quality of some of the voices, this will hardly be something distracting. The soundtrack on the other hand is spectacular, and fits well with the current mood of the story, plus some of the songs are absolutely great! Perfect for each scene it plays in, setting the mood just right.\n\nVerdict: 9/10\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, please feel free to follow our curator here.","March 11","true","7.6"," 133 of 137 people (97%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","97","133","137","12","1"

The story of Susan Ashworth, a failed suicide forced to take a different path, will cause you pain and a degree of mental anguish - and that's okay, because there are some things that *should* hurt when you experience them, even through the proxy of a video game.\n\nThe game can be thought of as having two halves that intertwine with each other throughout.  One half deals with Susan Ashworth's confrontation with five "parasites" - serial killers whose exploits are depicted with unsparing detail.  This portion of the game is suspenseful, gory, horrifying, and ultimately not all that interesting; the shocks and surprises are so over-the-top that they're easily dismissable as something that only happens in the world of make-believe.\n\nThe power of "The Cat Lady" comes from its other half.  This part of the story is far more personal, dealing with the past trauma that led to Susan's suicide attempt; her growing friendship with a young boarder named Mitzi with a haunted past of her own; and their efforts to save each other from the inner darkness that threatens to consume them.  Their stories are dark, but the game wisely introduces a lot of humor in their relationship as well ("think of a vegetable") that occasionally descends into outright farce (the babysitter scene comes to mind).  This balance, along with the excellent dialogue and voice acting, make Susan and Mitzi seem very real, and that makes it impossible not to emphasize with them both.\n\nAnd that makes the game's soul crushing scenes all the more devastating.  The one that hit me the hardest involves an argument between a husband and wife, one that begins with petty accusations and descends into shouted accusations that visibly bludgeon the characters.  There's no physical violence or over-dramatized threats, and the scene is all the more terrifying because of it.  The situation is understated and real, as are the tragic consequences, and I was unable to shake the uneasy feeling that I was watching the lives of two real people fall apart.\n\n"The Cat Lady" allows the players to make choices along the way that decide Susan and Mitzi's ultimate fate: whether they conquer their pain or fall prey to it.  I'm oddly proud that I managed to achieve a measure of peace for them both.  When I was done, I briefly thought about playing through the game again to view the other endings - but I quickly decided not to.  It is wrong to play with human lives and cause idle grief, and by the time the credits for "The Cat Lady" rolled I was unable to think of Susan and Mitzi as anything other than real.","October 23, 2014","true","7.8"," 135 of 146 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","135","146","0","0"

The entire game is controlled with the keyboard – left and right arrow keys to move, up to examine objects and areas of interest, down to select items in your inventory, and enter to select an option. The interface is minimal as well, with just a bar across the bottom of the screen to display items you’ve collected.\n\nI really enjoyed that this game was side-scrolling. The ability to actually control Susan, rather than scanning a cursor all around the screen as in traditional, point-and-click adventure games, made the game a much more engaging, organic experience. This isn’t ♥♥♥♥-talking point-and-clicks in any way – the ability to navigate Susan through the nightmarish environments just made the game feel a lot more personal, and less zoomed-out, which works since The Cat Lady is more about your interaction with others than solving elaborate puzzles.\n\nThe Cat Lady is not a game about ridding the world of evil. It’s about accepting that sometimes ♥♥♥♥’s rough, but you have to find your happiness in spite of it all. It’s about learning to smile in the face of horror, and realizing that your fear of others is just a result of your own weakness.\n\nI don’t have much of a conclusion other than GO GET THE CAT LADY. It’s a unique and engaging experience that I would hate to see fly under the radar. It’s definitely in my top games that I've played this year. If you like adventure games, cats, horror, good writing, and stuff with explicit content warnings at the beginning, this is the game for you!","December 17, 2013","true","11.5"," 151 of 170 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","151","170","0","7"

Wow.\n\nArt, original music, and writing are all superb. Graphics could have been more detailed, but the art style makes the graphical detail (resolution) not as important, and even more fitting in a way for the darker and grainier feel to the game. Voice acting is some of the best I've heard in a game making all the characters believable and worthy of your investment in them. Especially the main female protagonist, who is very unique for the gaming world and isn't constrained by the typical gaming tropes.\n\nThe writing and character dialogue is by far the most mature and believable for any game I have played. You are getting adult level dialogue and script writing here with very few, if any instances of the kind of cheesy video game writing we have grown to expect from video game writers.\n\nThis story will present some very dark themes. Depression, suicide, murder, and any other dark thoughts you could have. It's not technically a horror game, but it is psychologically creepy enough to feel like it at times. Something that most of us who no longer feel any fear from the "horror" genre are more likely to find unnerving in parts due to it being much more about the emotional level of the characters and their mental state rather than just seeing a ton of  gore. This game does have several  strange and gory scenes in it, but that isn't really what makes it great. The depth of the characters' thoughts and emotional upheaval is what makes it shine in the end.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game as well as all the set designs capture the mood of the story and the characters perfectly. The grainy sadness of the entire game keeps you in a perfect mood to enjoy the tale you are presented with.\n\nFor anyone that has experienced sadness, or depression on a deep level, this game will be relateable to you in many ways I'm sure. Living with the inability to properly address negative emotions that keep you in a state of sadness is perfectly presented here. Living with depression has never been shown better in a video game that I have played. You feel like you really know the main character, and you feel like the writer has a deep understanding of why she is the way she is.\n\nThere are well designed puzzles along the way that adventure fans expect. It is definitely possible to get a bit stuck and not be able to figure out a puzzle as some are a bit unorthodox, but if you look hard enough and think about all the interactable items in every stage eventually you can figure it out. Nothing too difficult, however.\n\nThis game deserves far more recognition than it gets. It is a truly great work of art, and it is quite apparent that the developer put a lot of deep thought into making this game. It absolutely had to have come from personal experience with the things presented. I don't think you could make a game like this unless you understand, or have studied many of these themes in depth.\n\n10/10\n\n---------------------------------------\nEDIT: All this below is for completionists/replays and Achievement hunters. NO SPOILERS are here other than very minor ones about early game decisions in the first few minutes.\n---------------------------------------\n\nI completed all the Achievements in this game now so I can give a bit more description on how much choices you can make change the game.\n\nIf you want to make sure you get the "Best" ending you have to pay really close attention to what you do from the very first choice in the game as any mistake will give you one of the normal endings instead. You should look at the achievements guide to be sure and follow the 'A Flower That Bends Towards the Sun' description to get you this ending.\n\nHERE is the Guide to use:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=201219437\n\nWARNING: the engine this game uses doesn't allow you to overwrite saves, and the save limit is 50. That may seem like a lot, but I DID hit it, so you may need to cut some of your saves and put them into another folder for later if you need more room. The save folder for this game is located in:\n\nC:\Users\<yourPCName>\Saved Games\Cat Lady\n\nAs far as I can tell there are 5 endings, but there are many choices along the way that can change dialogue for the section that it is in.  Ch. 2 for example has several different pieces of artwork based on the answers you give to questions asked of you. This section probably has the most alternative story element in it so saving here is worth doing to allow you a pk at as many as you can see. These aren't things that will impact the ending necessarily, but worthwhile for small little flashback scenes that are quite good. Achievement, or not. Th eCh. 1 decision I wonder about for the ending as one side (perfect ending) does require it, but not sure if the other does.\n\nEDIT #2: I have played with the Ch. 1 decision taking the side that doesn't get the perfect ending all the way through to the en, and I can confirm that taking this choice does not change the ending other than making it impossible to get the perfect ending. All the normal endings will basically the same if you take the choice that gives you the other Achievement for Ch. 1.","June 21, 2014","true","40.9"," 137 of 152 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","137","152","0","23"

It's a noir adventure game with a unique and distinguished identity. At least I haven't played anything quite like this before.  It is an interesting blend of genres and themes that makes for a novel and stimulating gaming experience that doesn't feel played out.\n\nIt really pushes the envelope with some twisted, demented scenes that are eerily enjoyable, and easy to become immersed in... even if you aren't usually a fan of adventure games.  If you want something creepy, thrilling, and well-written: then I think you will like this game.\n\nThe writing is amazing in my opinion; it has some of the deepest, trippiest, creepiest scenes I have seen in a game like this. And the voice acting is extremely solid for the most part, which reinforces the excellent writing.  It takes really good writing and solid acting to be able to create an immersive atmosphere in a simple side-scrolling adventure game, but The Cat Lady delivers and then some.  I'll admit, the story gets a little ridiculous and/or confusing at moments, but that is fitting of the eerie atmosphere.\n\nConsidering The Cat Lady is a 2D game with mediocre graphics, it is actually amazing how nice of a presentation there is. The noir art style works well; even though the graphics are simple, it just somehow fits well with the tone of the game.  The visuals won’t floor you with detail, but they paint an excellent picture and perfectly depict the ambiance of the game.\n\nAs far as the actual puzzle solving goes, it's a pretty simple game.  There’s really more of a focus on the story and the eerie atmosphere then there is on solving puzzles... but there is some thinking to be done in order to progress through the campaign.\n\nAnd so if you would be interested in a creepy, story-driven adventure game, then look no further than The Cat Lady. It has a very unique identity and is well worth the experience for fans of the genre looking for something fresh and novel.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","September 28, 2014","true","8.6"," 116 of 127 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","116","127","0","3"

They don't want me there." - Susan Ashworth\n\nNearly all my friends were pestering me to play this game for a year now, and the title being my only clue to its content, I was expecting a somewhat sarcastic, maybe semi-realistic satire. Oh, have I ever been so wrong? The Cat Lady is a brilliant display of pure symbolism on the gravity of one notion: self - and also one of the most striking games that I've ever played. It is bold, brutal and unconventional. It is a downer and a punch to your gut that you'd be glad to have. Ironic, isn't it?\n\nThe Cat Lady is the story of Susan Ashworth. Susan is a 40 year old woman, who lives alone in an apartment in the forsaken part of town. Her one joy in life is playing the piano. That's also how neighborhood cats know that it is feeding time and rush towards Susan's balcony, to her neighbors' distress. The story starts with a radical decision on Susan's part: she decides to die and swallows a truckload of pills to put a point to the story of her life. As you may have guessed so far, our main character is suicidally depressed and unbeknownst to her, her suicide attempt is the exact moment that her life takes a turn for the creepy and the unexpected. Within the timeframe of a single night, Susan will be invited to take an offer and witness events unfitting even to her most morbid nightmares...\n\nLet's start with a fair warning: The Cat Lady isn't suitable for all audiences. It doesn't only contain; it is based on themes such as suicide, depression, guilt, cancer, gravity of choice and of course, the value of life. The game is also highly graphic and even brutal, when displaying certain notions or psychotic conditions, using gore, sexuality and disturbing symbolic imagery to its advantage. Mind that, language would be the least of a fragile person's concern in this long list. You are warned. Lovers of the weird, the obscure and the surreal; please keep reading!\n\nNow we are done with our warning, we can take a closer look on the game itself. Graphic wise, one would say there is nothing extraordinary. We have two dimensional environments in dark colors and somewhat dark figures drawn in a Vertigo Comics style walking on this linear environment, is that it? Nope. I think that the artwork is a major part of the atmosphere by establishing a sense of hopelessness, a darkness: a sense of being lost without a glimpse of hope for being found. We constantly witness the potential towards evil within human soul just by observing the environment and scenes of the story. Everything is pictured in shades of black and gray, with only dreamlike symbolic imageries possessing vibrant, even alarming colors to predict a shocking revelation.\n\nThe reality that we are presented seems to justify the gloomy perception of our heroine. I'd love to present some more solid examples in imagery, but that would be presenting spoilers, sorry. Suffice to say that the artwork in this game is chosen to be in synch with the main theme masterfully, and I also believe all that we observe presents Susan's perception of reality aside what would be actually real. Combined with a soundtrack medium to channel appropriate feelings such as sorrow, panic, serenity, humor, rage or hope; the game manages to create a striking atmosphere with so little in display.\n\nGameplay is deadly simplistic: I present you arrow keys to move or manage your inventory, and enter to interact. That's it. Oh, and if you are impatient or replaying a scene to hunt for an achievement, there is always space key to skip dialogue. But if it is your first playthrough, you'll want to pay attention to every single word! If you carefully observe the environment and all on-goings, you are in a symbolic feast and given some clues to the backstage of events. You are also given a couple of under-toned choices which may change the ending of the game - yup, the game has 3 different endings and some replay value.\n\nBy the end of the day, The Cat Lady is more of an artistic statement with a story to tell rather than a game. When I come across either games or other media claiming to try and deal with depression, their selling slogan is usually "life is good; here is some sunshine and flowers, and unicorns puking rainbows!" Come on, that ♥♥♥♥ is cheesy, insincere and lacks any kind of insight to the actual problem. The Cat Lady presents a solid view point and taps to the reality of a problem brutally. Without exploring the perception, no one would be able to claim holding a solution, right? Here is the glimpse of the problem wrapped in a brilliant empathy simulation: an actual story crowned with the aphorisms of human mind.\n\nIn short, The Cat Lady is a must have for anyone that enjoys strong narrative and genuine symbolism; and mostly for the lover of the obscure. You'll remember this one, I promise you.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","December 8, 2015","true","13.3"," 89 of 95 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","89","95","5","14"

She has no family, no friends and no hope for a better future. One day she discovers that five strangers will come along and change everything..."\n\nBefore I go any further, I will give you probably the most important detail since this alone is a deal breaker for some: This game is story driven. There is a LOT of dialog and cut scenes. What action there is consists of solving problems.\n\nThat out of the way, this game is AMAZING. It might be one of my favorite games ever. If you like dark, morbid games; this will be perfect for you. I don't think I've ever seen a game as morbid as this one. In this game, it's safe to assume that the worst will happen. Insanely creepy with haunting music, this game does not disappoint.\n\nI will admit one thing, however. There were times when I couldn't play this for more than ten minutes. You have to be in a certain frame of mind for this one, and if you are a highly depressed person, this game may not be for you as the main character longs to die for most of the game. There are seven chapters and in my opinion the game really kicks off towards the end of chapter two. That's when your mind is blown and the game's true colors really shine.\n\nThis game is not very long. The dialog is what takes up the bulk of the time played. The achievements are not difficult at all. There are guides in the community hub and you should have absolutely no problem in this regard. There are multiple endings for this game. Without giving too much away, I HIGHLY suggest you save right before you are given a shoe box. Trust me on this one.\n\nThe graphics may be throwing you off as you consider this game. Trust me, I'm not a big fan of games like this where the graphics are old school and unrealistic. But you will soon appreciate the art and realize this game was made perfectly when it comes to graphics, music, and voice acting.\n\nIf you do love this game, check out Downfall in the Greenlight area. It is a remake of an older game made by the people who made The Cat Lady. I haven't played it yet, but I have read quotes from the creators that say they think the remake might even turn out better than this game. I'm so excited! It's supposed to come out this year. It HAS been greenlit.\n\nOne last piece of advice. One I give for every horror game. Play this alone, in the dark. Even better, with headphones.\n\nHappy gaming!","January 18, 2015","true","49.0"," 81 of 86 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","81","86","2","2"

Frankly, depending on what tickles your fancy, it may not even be the best choice for those looking for a gruesome, horror tinged experience. The Cat Lady is Harvester Game's entry into the genre boasting a distinct aesthetic and a narrative that handles heavy psychological themes and obsesses with some of the more morbid aspects of existence. With such a benign sounding title, The Cat Lady may come as a surprise to unassuming players but the question remains, is The Cat Lady the pinnacle of recent horror themed adventure games or should it be buried at the bottom of the litter box?\n\nThe Cat Lady opens with eponymous Susan Ashworth succumbing to her loneliness and the ghosts of her past by gorging herself on a last supper of sleeping pills. Instead of stepping into the black void that she assumed would be her end, Susan finds herself in Limbo where she encounters a mysterious old woman who offers her a chance at life and happiness. The phlegmatic Susan doesn't exactly jump at the woman's offer but reluctantly takes it upon herself to seek out people that the old lady refers to as parasites in exchange for happiness. In order to help Susan with her new burden, the lady renders Susan immortal before sending her back to the world of the living. Throughout the course of the game Susan encounters the aforementioned parasites who happen to be serial killers who employ some of the most perverse methods and rituals when taking the lives of others.\n\nThemes of depression, suicide and hopelessness pervade The Cat Lady but thankfully Susan's sardonic tone keeps her from become too overbearing and irritating. Such subject matter could easily devolve into the whining melancholic drivel that characterizes a Hot Topic playlist. The focus on Susan's psyche and the focus on her road to depression  makes The Cat Lady feel more like Silent Hill than the past several entries in Konami's acclaimed survival horror franchise. Like the critically extolled Silent Hill 2,  the Parasites that Susan faces are often allegorical. Unfortunately, much of the voice acting can be flat, and in the case of the wife of one of the parasites that Susan must dispatch, it can be rather silly, disrupting the tone of the game. Some characters sound like their dialogue was recorded with a webcam and these inconsistencies can irritate. Despite the underwhelming vocal production the soundtrack is great. With a mix of industrial music, jazzy compositions, string arrangements and piano pieces it easily shifts the tone of the game from tense and unnerving to melancholy and lonely. Some tracks with lyrics interject in key moments and give this simple indie release an almost cinematic quality.\n\nWhile The Cat Lady employs a unique aesthetic it isn't exactly cohesive or pretty. Characters are rendered like early 90's digitized graphics and move like marionettes. Backgrounds appear to be composed of still photos that are desaturated. Much of the game is monochrome with splashes of color which does a great job of communicating Susan's mental state. Some of the colorized elements are of some significance while others are just random highlights. Some areas are fully colored. With so many different varying elements and shifts in style the visuals are a bit of a mess but the imagery employed by The Cat Lady is effective, channeling a mix of slasher film gore, industrial props, grime and decay.\n\nWhile many more recent popular adventure games don't really have much in the gameplay department aside from dialogue choices and a few quicktime events, The Cat Lady contains traditional puzzles. These puzzles commendably balance logic and a sense of reward, meaning that not much time is spent guessing what combination of items will allow players to progress. Using cloths to unscrew hot light bulbs, finding a knife to losen a brick which is later used to smash a window and finding ways to coax hostile NPCs from important items are some of the ways in which your gray matter is tested. Also your actions and interactions with others can affect the outcome of the game. It's immensely satisfying in a way that Tell Tale's immensely popular games are not.\n\nDespite its course edges, The Cat Lady is a tremendously engaging adventure game. It fills the hole left by Silent Hill when it comes to psychological horror and provides a glimpse of hat sever depression can look like. The narrative is engaging and slowly uncovering Susan's past is engrossing and the dark imagery is unnerving. It would take more than the flat, low production voice work and a cluster♥♥♥♥ of a visual style to make The Cat Lady unplayable because it gets the things that matter the most right. The puzzles are rewarding while not bogging down the experience with obtuse and inane gags that pretentiously preoccupy themselves with stumping players than making progression meaningful. Adventure game fans and horror game fans take note, The Cat Lady is a worthwhile experience that should be on your radar.","February 10, 2014","true","12.2"," 94 of 107 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","94","107","0","8"

The story deals with Susan Ashworth a 40 year old woman who tries to commit suicide but fails and then has to struggle to find the will to live.\n\nThere's very much a horror element but not without reason or for shock value. Everything has a reason, a purpose and a meaning and while the game can be very dark and graphic I felt that fit with Susan's view of the world and other people in general.\n\nI'm normally not interested in horror stories at all, but I feel that this is an emotional journey with a necessary horror backdrop to bring you into Susan's dark world of despair. I also felt that the unique art style of the game, which seems almost like an animated paper diorama, and the surreal nature of the game in general for me did help mitigate the horror aspect a bit. For those avoiding this game due to the horror factor I urge you to reconsider and push through it even in the areas that are disturbing. The ultimate experience I feel is very much worth it.\n\nIn spite of some very unrealistic situations, I found Susan to be one of the most realistically portrayed characters I've ever encountered in a video game. The dynamic between Susan and Mitzi, a young girl she encounters and assists her on her journey, was also excellent and a great contrast.\n\nThe game is voice acted and the cast on the whole is excellent, particularly Susan. With every tone of her voice you really do feel her pain and her struggle.\n\nThe ending for me was very satisfying, realistic and even uplifting. It was a great closure to a moving experience. Though note that there are multiple endings and even one extra special one that feels like a gift if you work to get it.\n\nI would recommend anyone who is interested in non-standard video game experiences that really make you think, feel and see different points of view to play The Cat Lady and to please stick with it and not be put off by the horror. The experience of the game taken as a whole is very much worth it.","December 15, 2013","true","17.2"," 92 of 106 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","92","106","0","1"

It deals with problems like depression, loneliness, social and moral decay of society, problems that became stronger in Modern times. "Time is Money", isn’t that one of those sentences everybody hears or even says every day? If I ask you, whether or not you can tell me what the name of your neighbor is, how many of you could answer that question? And not to mention that sweet anonymity the internet has to offer, literally forcing millions of people to present their point of view to others, even if they haven’t been asked for.\n\nSo what is this all about? Meet Susan Ashworth, middle-aged, cynical, depressive, cat-loving and about to commit suicide. Spending her last breaths with her beloved Tomcat, Teacup, Susan finds herself in another world, not knowing if this is life, death or even something worse. A woman, calling herself “Queen of the maggots”, is waiting there, offering Susan something that will bring her in touch with five different strangers. And it seems like they don’t want to hold a tea party at all.\n\nI won’t and simply can’t spoil more information about the plot right here because it might alter your whole experience while playing, so let`s have a look at the game’s execution instead. The Cat Lady aims to be a psychological horror adventure, that is divided into different chapters and presented with side scrolling 2D-graphics. Although people seem to look strange, undefined and even ugly sometimes I can’t imagine a better setting for this game, especially in combination with the well drawn and often animated backgrounds. Items will get highlighted if they can be used, clicked or interacted with, some can be stored in a small inventory. Puzzles aren’t very hard at all, the plot is all that matters. Most of the time you have to find Object A, combine it with Object B or interact with Object C, but still there are some really special interactions while playing the game that I will never forget, may they be offensive or simply unique. You will also encounter many dialogues that may have a huge impact on your game or even ending so be aware of what to choose in the conversation trees.\n\nThis game is rated 18 and that for some reasons. Violence, murder, suicide, anger, rage, ♥♥♥♥ and psychological terror are only the tip of the iceberg of what this game has to offer. Since these themes only refer to human behaviour that has been like this for ages, there is nothing to feel offended about. It is illustrated gruesomely, but never without an aspect of art, like there is even a reference to a certain book of Stephen King that I don’t want to spoil here. Besides that, people who aren’t at least 18 yet may lack some experience in life. Understanding or feeling what this game wants to show can be hard for those who have never felt what living a life can imply sometimes.\n\nBefore I start to summarize the points I mentioned above, I want to bring up the amazing soundtrack. It manages to walk the line between honeymoon daylife and the feeling one might get, right before getting engulfed into the abyss of depression and psychotic horror.\n\nBig Text, Quick Facts:\nPro:\nA mature plot one can hardly forget - realistic core meets terrifying fiction. Or the other way around?\nAlthough depressing and cynical to the core - Susan is credible and pleasant!\nWonderful artwork (just look at chapter 5)\nWell written dialogues\nSome unique mechanics the player must use to proceed\nUgly, disgusting or unkind - but interesting side characters\nMultiple Endings\nFitting, engaging and enjoyable Soundtrack\nCats\nCon:\nTopics might offend people\nSome puzzles won’t challenge experienced adventure players\n\nSummary:\nI know I wrote a lot above but words cannot describe what playing and finishing this game made me feel. This is easily one my most beloved stories a game could offer, including all its violence and hate. You don`t have to suffer any mental problems to understand how Susan could get into all this but you might need some morbid interest and a big package of black humour to help her through it. I call it an indie masterpiece with great artwork, sound and plot.\n\n9/10","May 14, 2015","true","12.9"," 77 of 86 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","77","86","0","9"

It's a low-res adventure game, made in AGS, it's almost entirely B&W and the animations are really strange. In fact, the whole graphical style is an acquired taste. It took me some time to get accustomed to it, at least.\n\nSo what is it about? You're a lonely, very depressed woman, called Susan Ashworth, and on one especially difficult day, you decided to end it all and swallow a bunch of sleeping pills. But you don't end up in heaven. Instead, you're sent back with the mission to rid the world of "parasites", bad people that delight in the pain of others. The game is divided into 7 chapters. The narrative consists in part of Susan dealing with the parasites, but it also tells of recovery from depression, finding new meanings in things and the importance of social relationships.\n\nBut The Cat Lady is not just an emotional trip. It's also a boldly horrific one, mixing "realistic" horrors (serial killers and such) and surreally gruesome scenes. It's more disturbing than frightening so it probably won't keep you up at night, shivering with the lights on, but the creepy imagery will stay with you.\n\nAs far as mechanisms are concerned, the most particular feature is that the game is played entirely with the keyboard. It works, but it takes some time to get used to. Items of interest are highlighted when you pass them by, so no pixel hunting is ever necessary. The puzzles are logical and I never really stayed stuck or needed a walkthrough, but they're still real puzzles: it's more of an "actual" game than, say, recent TellTale efforts. Speaking of which, there are many occasions where choices have to be made, but aside from two of them in the end, and another in the middle of the game, I don't think any of them had any impact on the story, not even shallowly. They're mostly there to fill a bit of background in the way you choose.\n\nThe first half of the game is reasonably good, but I found the narrative achieved its best rhythm in the second half, with less endless ramblings (or maybe I got more interested into the characters and I was less bothered by slow passages). The puzzles in the second half are definitely better too. So if after a couple of hours, you're still hesitant to continue, I'd advise against quitting the game.\n\nI have to mention the music which is stunning, both the few songs that punctuate important moments and the instrumental pieces. There were some relatively frequent audio glitches, something I've seen mentioned in other reviews, so it's not just me. The voice acting was competently handled, with a few odd exceptions that thankfully don't concern the main characters.\n\nOverall, The Cat Lady offers a very good story supported by nice adventure mechanisms. If you can get past its look (which is OK but takes time getting used to) and the few moments it drags for too long, you'll be rewarded with a memorable experience, one with a satisfying ending..","June 8, 2014","true","10.0"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","49","56","0","0"

Whether you will love it depends on what you're looking for in a game.\n\nThe characterization in this game is outstanding. Susan is relatable, and her situation is intriguing, as are the other characters. The portrayal of depression doesn't resort to making Susan a stereotype. The gore is not cheap, but is used to evoke emotions including disgust and dread. There were times when I knew what was needed to progress but had to steel my nerves to actually do it. If you're in the market for a story driven and methodically building sort of personal horror, then this game is your genre.\n\nNow, this game has things that will put some people off. It's not a cheerful game. There's a lot of gore and some very dark themes. There is a strong age warning on it, and there should probably be some trigger warnings as well. Additionally the game is slow building, has a very simple interface, and the art/animation, though it has a very well chosen aesthetic that worked for me, runs the risk of looking inexpensive or unpolished. These things might be ok or even a plus for you, or it might put you off the game entirely.\n\nFor me, the choice of whether to recommend this title comes down to this. The Cat Lady will prompt you and give you a choice to feel a certain series of reactions, including fear, disgust, sadness, anger, dread, hopelessness and occasionally hope. If that is what you're looking for, then this story is worth your time.\n\nNote: This review based on a single playthrough of the Desura version.

It's typically referred to as a point and click game although it plays without using the mouse.\n\nThe premise of The Cat Lady follows Susan Ashworth. A very lonely 40 year old woman who cares only for her cats, who decides to commit suicide. What follows is a very surreal descent as the story progresses.\n\nWhat I like the most about the Cat Lady was it's self awareness and it's message. The protagonist Susan comes across as extremely believable as a depressed suicidal woman. She's not particularly attractive, she often talks to herself, she's prone to outbursts and she genuinely comes across like someone you wouldn't catch a second glance at on the street. However her character is still extremely likeable, and her story is very well paced. Which keeps you invested until it's conclusion.\n\nThe game deals with very complex themes following suicide, grief, remorse, guilt and suffering. Stylistically the game is generally colorless, with high contrast splashes of color following very specific moments in the game. The game has a very peculiar art style where the characters look like very realistic sketches overlayed onto environments. It paints a very depressed picture where the world that the protagonist sees blends in together. Almost like it's all a distraction to her.\n\nBut the biggest thing I like about the Cat Lady is it's message. One of hope and perserverance, where one should involve themselves in the lives of others to truly feel any sort of happiness. Every objective in the game almost feels like a step in the main character's redemption. It's very engaging to see her undergo a character arc where she starts out completely hopeless and apathetic, to heroic and selfless.\n\nThe Cat Lady tells a story and most importantly tells it very well, and I dearly recommend it to fans of adventure games.","November 15, 2015","true","7.6"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","27","29","2","0"

So here's a more upbeat review for a game about suicide, torture, ♥♥♥♥, murder, cancer, and just general unpleasantness. Ahem.\n\nIn The Cat Lady, you play as Susan, who has been through a lot, but is about to embark on a journey through all of the above, including her own death.  Repeatedly.  It is a thoroughly grim story, every character in it has something terribly wrong with them, and kittens are cute.\n\nThis is one of my all time favorite games, partly because it is such a horrid tale, but also because it is the story of someone who is faced with horror after horror, but still goes on living.  Well, except for the times she kills herself, but who's counting.\n\nI think The Cat Lady has a lesson to teach us all, which is that everyone dies, sometimes because we kill them, but generally you should just be patient and wait your turn.  Don't go looking for death.  It will find you.\n\nChocolate cake is very tasty.","May 8","true","8.7"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","26","28","7","0"

Most games, and media outlets in general, wouldn’t get near the plot of this adventure with a 10 foot pole; covering depression, suicide, drug and alcohol use, tragic deaths and psychological disorders in a way which does not sensationalize the issues but instead is able to put you inside the life of someone surrounded by them.\nGripping is one of the best words I have to describe my experience with The Cat Lady. After every play session I was left on edge and more than a little introspective about the issues in my own life.

The game starts out with you committing suicide and ending up in what I can best describe as a purgatory of sorts. In order to save your soul you're tasked with taking those of deranged and depraved lunatics in trade. Each and every chapter is somber and more than just a little depressing. For anyone who knows what it's like to suffer such things it really hits the mark. The endings (for there are about three or so of them) really make an impact when you take the game as a whole into account.

Meaningful beyond words. To some players the contents might be very disturbing, as it includes suicide, death, depression, cancer, a ton of swearing, and a lot more. If you're easily disturbed, or a young player, I would not recommend you getting this, as it's not fit for young players at all. I felt creeped out through most of the gameplay. I would recommend this to MATURE players only.\n\nThe gamplay is simple, fun, and nothing tricky required. The graphics might not seem so amazing, but they are. They fit perfectly with the game, especially considering what it's about. The soundtrack is pretty awesome, aswell. Together with the graphics, the soundtrack gives it that.. uneasy feeling, making it seem dark but amazing at the same time. I wasn't too thrilled with the voice acting. At some parts it sounded terrible, some parts being too soft, or too loud. One thing that really bothered me though, was somewhere in chapter 4 I think, there's a scene with some fog. My frame rates dropped down to 1/2 for that entire scene. I'm not sure if others have had this problem, but everything ran smoothly through the rest of the game.\n\nThe puzzles are quite simple, and easy to work around if you stop for a moment or two to think. I got stuck more times than I'd like to admit, some parts can be tricky, but the answer to the puzzle is always obvious. Or so it seemed. If you get stuck, there are some guides offering help.\n\nThis is one of those games where what you do, what you decide, will affect your ending. I tried my best to go after the golden ending, and I can honestly say I was happy with what I found. The ending I got made me feel sad, but happy at the same time, and that's just what this game will do to you. It makes the player feel something. Playing through this you'll get a hint of what depression is like, but at the same time you'll see what true happiness is. The game perfectly captures emotions.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes. Overall I think if you're a fan of adventure/horror type games then this is for you. This is one of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing recently, and I think if you give it a go, you'd agree! So, prepare to be hit right in the feels.\n\nSusan/10","December 9, 2015","true","13.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","20","23","4","0"

Like it was pandering to your own sensibilities and sense of humor?"\n\nYeah...\n\nThe Cat Lady is a 2D sidescrolling adventure title that features dark, macabre settings and situations. If you're sensitive about suicide or think mental illness is merely matter of willpower, you might not enjoy or understand this game.\n\nIf you want to know enough about the story, I'll talk about it here, but it'll be blacked out for those who wish to skip this part of the review.\n\nThe story starts with a 40-year-old lady named Susan Ashworth, who abruptly ends her life at the beginning of the game, but instead of being brought to a traditional afterlife, she's brought to some strange place in between life and death where she meets a mysterious old woman who explains that Susan has a job to do back in the world of the living: Kill "parasites". After convincing Susan that she should give this life a chance Susan revives in a hospital wondering if she just had a really awful coma experience or if what she experienced while dead really happened.\n\nThe voice acting usually hits the mark and I feel like a lot of the characters are actually having a conversation instead of reading lines. There's a few actors who felt phoned in (two, in fact), but they're so minor it didn't really bother me.\n\nThe puzzles aren't really difficult, but sometimes finding the right item or information to progress can be frustrating. Exhausting all of the game mechanics will help you out though, as you can grab, use and examine objects, and the adventure game pro in you should always do all these things. Sometimes though you will have to just mess around with fussy positioning of your character.\n\nThere is a problem with some of the layering taking up massive amount of resources while in the highest "resolution". The resolution is probably actually 800x600, but there is some texture options that the setup offers that allow you to make the game look as it was intended with crisp background. The character models suffer a little and look a bit pixelly, but I didn't think that detracted too much from this title being that it didn't require mechanics that revolved around precision.\n\nThere are multiple endings, but I just played through it once and the ending was really emotionally satisfying.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that I really, really enjoyed my time with The Cat Lady and I think people who have similar dark tastes as I do would as well.","May 17, 2015","true","9.1"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","2"

I randomly bought this game because it was very cheap (sale) and because the theme looked interesting to me. I normally never play games like this, but I can say I was positively surprised.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, its subjects are dark: depression, suicide, murder, cancer ... It's for people who want to enjoy a good story about these kind of things. Even if you've never been in contact with them, the game is very good at explaining how a depressed person goes through life. The game can be quite confronting towards people who've suffered from any of the topics above, but it's still an interesting experience.\n\nSTORY: really good. At chapter 1 I was interested, but I wasn't blown away or anything. At the end of chapter 2 I was completely hooked though. I thought this game was going to give me a nice, regular story about depression, but I was wrong. It throws things at you you wouldn't expect. Well the game is tagged "horror", so I guess I should've expected the story would become even darker & sicker than it already was ... Quite linear story, but you can make some choices that change the plot a little bit.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Oddly satisfying. You play through each of the 7 chapters and have to explore your environment to gather items and to find out more about the characters. This game works with a kind of puzzle system: find X, so you can get to Y, so you can finally do Z. Quite obvious puzzles, but here and there you might have to think. Also, there's a good balance between watching dialogues (that you can alter; really fun) and getting to play yourself.\n\nART: I honestly love the art of this game. The game often presents itself in a white/black-ish style, which I guess is quite logical regarding the subjects of this game. Now and then, there's also some colour to be found which emphasizes certain items/events in the game. There are some areas that could've been made better, but the most important areas in the game look really good, so no problem.\n\nSOUNDTRACK: Just absolutely fantastic. Really makes the game a much better experience. The music changes from pretty calm, to eerie, to sometimes even agressive ... all depending on the situation you find yourself in. Also, pretty cool  (and eerie!) sounds/noises are used, like cracking stairs and doors, screaming women, the typical jumpscare sounds you'll fall victim to everytime (or maybe the total opposite).\n\nATMOSPHERE: By far the most amazing thing about this game. Nothing much to say about it, you really just have to play it yourself to feel it.\n\nSo yeah, really good game. Love it a lot, despite not expecting it would be this good. Again, not for everyone, but if you want to give this game a fair chance and open yourself up to it, you'll find yourself dragged into this game and just want to keep playing. At the end credits, you'll just find yourself staring at the screen, asking yourself what the ♥♥♥♥ you have been playing (and most of all; why you enjoyed it so much).\n\nP.S: some people have unanswered questions after playing the game. Apperently playing "downfall" would answer some of these questions (though I can't confirm as I have not played it myself).","January 7, 2015","true","11.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","3"

Every single character does an excellent and convincing job.\n- Despite the low resolution, visually striking.\n- Very original altogether. I haven't played anything really like it.\n\nCons\n- Controls are simple, yet still unintuitive and inconvenient. Would have been better to bind more keys for specific action (e.g. browse inventory using different keys than the ones used for walking).\n- Resolution is too low for this day and age. You can use GeDoSaToTool to make the game look better\n- Some puzzles are too difficult or don't make much sense. I had to check a walkthrough several times. The biggest problem for most (including me) seems to be chapter 2 (the hospital). I created a thread in the forum with low-spoiler hints to help those stuck in it.\n- Save game system is limited to 50 saves. There is a workaround to save more, but you only learn that you need to use workarounds after discovering that many of your latest saves are not there. There is also no Cloud save for those using multiple computers, but there is a related workaround to share the Saved Games folder over the network.\n\nOverall: The pros far outweigh the cons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/recommended/253110/","celtic7guardian","Celtic7Guardian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/","1158 products in account","Not for the faint of heart, but a tremendously rewarding experience!\nI first began using Steam during the 2015 summer sale. I found a bunch of games for dirt-cheap prices that looked great. One of those games was The Cat Lady. I got it for less than $3 on a whim. The name attracted me, and after seeing it had a lot of positive reviews, I figured it was worth a try. Normally I don't play horror games, as I prefer watching other people play them due to getting scared too easily.\n\nI am not sure what caused me to look past the horror label for this one, but I am so glad that I did. What I got for those measly three dollars was one of the best games I have ever played. For fifteen hours, I was utterly hooked to the tragic story and amazing characters. I suffer from depression, though not to the extent of the protagonist (I have never seriously considered suicide, for instance.) To say it is portrayed well is an understatement. If you suffer from depression, or knows somebody who does, my guess is that you will be stunned at how accurately it is shown here. That played a big role in why I was totally absorbed. However, there are many more positives to be spoken of, as shown below.\n\nPros:\nThe story. I cannot stress how much the story works. It seems to have supernatural elements, though how many are truly supernatural is up to interpretation. Whichever the case might be, it does not take away from the many realistic parts of it. This game portrays serious matters, such as depression, cancer, and suicide. It does this respectfully and accurately. The developer did his research, including working at a hospital, and it shows.\nA good story cannot exist without good characters, and this game delivers in spades. Susan Ashworth, the protagonist, is one of my favorite characters ever. The others that get development are also fascinating. A lot of the characters are not looked deeply into, but it hardly matters. This is Susan's story, and the people important to her get the development they need. They easily carry the tale by themselves.\nThe dialogue is very well written. I could quote several parts that were beautifully pieced together. The ending line remains the best ending line I have ever heard in a game.\nMajor props for the voice acting. I thought all of the voice actors were excellent. The Queen of Maggots gets a special mention from me. Her voice acting is absolutely perfect for her character.\nThe graphics create an atmosphere all on their own. Much of it is gray, black, and white, with the colors splashed in making prominent statements. The characters look great. There are some shifts in art style at times, and they are striking in all the right ways.\nThe music also makes for great atmosphere. You get the basic soundtrack for free by purchasing the game. An additional soundtrack is up for a quite reasonable $3.99 pricetag. I bought it just for the ending song, but all twelve tracks on it are worth having.\nThe gameplay is simple to learn and effective in use. It's a fine game for a keyboard and mouse. Point and click is the main deal here, with puzzles being scattered throughout. I never found the puzzles to be frustrating. There are subtle hints scattered throughout the game that make them all reasonable to solve.\nA game with dark subject matter has to have some humor present, or the audience will be apathetic to how the story unfolds. Susan is a master at dry sarcasm that adds a bit of levity to the situations she encounters. Some black humor is present, and it works well.\nOne of the main gimmicks here (which you learn quickly, so I don't feel this is a spoiler) is that you cannot die. Most horror games would lose suspense without the character's life being in danger. The Cat Lady keeps that suspense despite Susan's immortality. This might not seem like a huge positive, but given how difficult that is to do, it really deserves recognition for that.\nMultiple save files are present, which is nice for keeping tabs on sections you might want to jump back to. It comes with a large amount. There is a negative side to this, though, and that is listed below.\nThere are a lot of choices to make throughout the story. The effects might not be as big as in some games, but they are there, and that is a nice element.\nThe gameplay has some changes in different chapters. It keeps the gameplay from becoming stale while still remaining similar overall.\nMost of The Cat Lady's achievements are reasonable to obtain and a nice bonus overall. I liked getting them. Some of the names are pretty amusing, too.\nThere is a cat named Teacup. Teacup is one of the most adorable names for a cat ever.\nNeutral:\nOne part of The Cat Lady has a homage to Downfall. On one hand, the tone fits, and it advertises Downfall existing (which I did not know until I saw that part.) On the other, it comes out of nowhere and is ultimately unnecessary.\nThe five endings provide some variety. They are similar to one another, though, and could have used a little more diversity.\nWhile you get to decide Susan's backstory to an extent, it does not play much of a role later on. I enjoyed making those decisions on what happened in her early years. I just wish they mattered more in the long run.\nSusan cannot sprint. Some sections might seem tedious for people since they cannot quickly get past long areas. I found that it added to the atmosphere, but I can understand other people being frustrated at that.\nThere are trading cards for this game. I personally like the art, but I have to question why some characters showed up in them and others didn't. They're a nice addition for those who care about cards.\nCons:\nThere is one section in the game where Susan has to walk through a foggy area. My computer lagged horrifically during this part. Fortunately, it is a small area, and it never lagged again.\nSave files are limited to 50, and they cannot be overwritten. Moving the files to another location on your computer is not difficult. I would have preferred being able to overwrite them, though. I'm the type of gamer who saves a lot, so this stood out to me. Other players might not be affected as much, depending on their play style.\nOne of the achievements relies on the random movements of a character. Save scumming makes it possible, but it is a tedious and luck-based achievement that isn't much fun.\nOne of the characters could have used foreshadowing, as he appears to come out of nowhere.\nThere are some spelling errors sprinkled throughout. It could be much worse, but a bit more proofreading would not have gone amiss.\nOverall experience:\n\nI still can't believe how much The Cat Lady affected me. It is a tragic and beautiful tale that is conveyed brilliantly through the characterization, dialogue, and gameplay. I have so much respect for it that I made up for my sin of not buying it at full price by getting the remake of Downfall the moment it came out on Steam, rather than waiting for it to go on a big sale (which I do for most games.) I think I heard that physical copies exist of The Cat Lady, and if so, I will go buy it just to say I have it. That is how much I love it.\n\nRating:\n\n10/10. This is a very rare score for me to give. No game is perfect, but The Cat Lady comes so close to it. Its positives vastly outweigh its negatives, and its story and characters are among the best I have ever had the privilege of experiencing. If you believe you can handle the mature tone and the many serious topics it brings up, I urge you to play it. The payoff is completely worth it.\n\nLooking for more great indie games?

Still, I'd like to say it's one of the most original games I've played and really quite thought provoking.\n\nIt's a pretty simple point and click style game that's heavily dialogue based. The main appeal from it is the unique focus and subject matter. Middle aged depressed women are hardly prominent in gaming and the focus on death, what hapiness means, what the afterlife is and how people interact with each other is highly original.\n\nIt has a very downbeat tone and art style. The game is in black and white for the most part and the music is oppressive, which helps forment the depressing tone of the game. The game makes you feel down, yet I still feel the need to play it. Which is an impressive accomplishment I think.\n\nThe visual style is a real treat. It's hard to describe but it's very morbid and macabre, with a surreal atmosphere. It's rather unsettling and dramatic but also uses subtle effects like lighting to set the scence.\n\nIf I have any complaint, it's that I feel some of the puzzles are far too obtuse. In a story focused game, it's annoying to have these overly complicated puzzles that due to the surreal nature of the game, tend to defy all logic. It breaks the pace of the game a fair bit at times, which is annoying.\n\nReading this back, it all seems very pretentious. It's well worth a buy when it goes on sale though, for the unique exeperience if anything. It's amazing to see a horror game that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares to be truly scary, but moreso a sense of foreboding, tension and things that are actually scary: the thought of what happens when we die and if reality is really what we think it is.","September 7, 2014","true","5.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/recommended/253110/","zeroxxx","zeroxxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/","2762 products in account","This game's not for everyone. It features violence, nudity and gore to some extent - despite the graphic design, it's still rather extreme. Use caution when playing with kids or underaged teen.\n\nThat said, the game also is good at presenting story, helped by good voice actors (notably Susan Asworth - our protagonist, and Mitzi) that perform and convey emotion of the characters they portray very well. The Cat Lady brings a good plot from the start and it revolves over time the deeper you go.\n\nGameplay is simple as it's a basically a point and click game. Some puzzles, however, made me scratch my head. With the ultimate weapon called walkthrough it's not a big deal though. :)\n\nIf you're going to do full achievements, do note that basically it's almost impossible getting everything in one playthrough, especially since you have to choose the dialoges/options at the correct time at the correct order.\n\nAlso there's an annoying bug as this time of writing: The caption is not complete. After Chapter 5 ends, there's no more English sub. If you're not an English native speaker like me this can be troublesome, as the main point of playing is following the story. Being unable to read what the characters have to say can be irksome as you'll be unable to understand the story. I hope this will be fixed with patch.\n\nEdit: It's confirmed that pressing 'T' disables/enables subs. I am yet to check as I already uninstalled the game so can't confirm with my Chapter 6 saves - will check back later.\n\nReplayability... almost none. Unless you want to see different outcome at the end of the game or, as I said, get achievements. Even then, only last chapters that matter. The game's quite fast with saves, so use this for your advantage: save as many times as possible, so you can quickly revert to the old saves if you want.\n\nThe game would've been taking benefit from full controller support. What's better than sit back and relax with controller in your hands and play the game? The Cat Lady is just perfect to be played that way. Sadly, there's no controller support, but you can utilize Joy2Key which is fairly simple to setup and get you controller support in game. You only need to setup directional buttons, confirm and cancel. That's all.\n\nAll in all, this is a niche game. As I said, not for everyone (kids included). But if you want a deep, engaging story, with good characters development game, this one is for you.","December 24, 2013","true","26.9"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","23","34","0","1"

Never thought i could find the protagonist Susan Ashworth interesting at all. Who is she? she is a crazy cat lady who is depressed and tries to do suicide and awakens up in a hospital and then some extremely disturbing stuff happens that leaves you wondering what is real and what is not.  Not exactly the normal big busted heroinne right? Susan is the polar opposite to not one but a whole load of design decisions that are so normal in games since day 0.  Just for that, one must applaud the daring decision to make susan as she is and not make her 'dark' and 'emo' just to make her more easily approachable.\n\nOpening 20minutes of the game is not impressive at all. Character literally looks as one would expect someone who wants to die right now looks like. Everything is gray and awfull.  It easily kills of the interest in the game early but keep on playing and you start to understand why all looks so terrible. Story gets good. and really, really disturbing. Lots of blood, entrails, sick psychos and death in various forms.  Susan is also just a mortal woman. (well almost) - No special moves or ways to hurt bad people unless the story give a specific way to do that.\n\n8.8/10 horror game done right. Even better as Amnesia or Anna as this one opens up little at a time w/chapters and doesnt leave it all to the end.\n\nSome small bad things to mention: Achievement collection could have been better. i won't be bothered to collect them all as they are mostly hidden achievements or something you get for selecting an alternate dialog.  Load/Save system does not allow overwriting of saves for some reason.  But these are all small things compared to how well this little indie game performed.\n\nThis game is another indie gem that has come out in later years to beef up the stagnating horror game scene that has been too fixed on dumb jump scares/zombies and for that i love it.","December 16, 2014","true","8.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

With regards to The Cat Lady, one could even argue that familiarisation with certain issues is an added prerequisite – but one needn’t have been suicidal or depressed in any of its varying shades to take away something from this game.\n\nMost of us will experience moments in our lives where disappointment, inner-stagnation, regret, setbacks, and unfulfillment are going to outweigh the hopefulness and eagerness of getting out of bed to greet yet another day. No matter how you’re feeling or what you’re going through when you play The Cat Lady to its epiphanic end, it will challenge you to examine your own life and, if you’re lucky, graciously leave you with a renewed appreciation for living… we all have a day with no tomorrow.\n\nThe Cat Lady is an experience, not merely a game. Everything about it is superb: the story, artwork, character depth, dialogue, gameplay, mood, music, and voice acting. I cannot recommend this game enough, for the right player – as hinted previously, a certain degree of maturity is crucial to possess in getting the most out of this game.\n\nThe choices made in-game will basically give players a similar experience, but it’s a singularly individual, emotional aftermath you will be left with. It’s no good, me telling you anything more about the game than what the developer’s own synopsis states; and the less you know, the better. True, you are largely playing a 40-year old woman, but anyone can play Ms. Ashworth - young or old, male or female - and find some kinship. Susan’s (and Mitzi’s) strengths and weaknesses will (re)familiarise you with the human condition; the Parasites will forcibly remind you that monsters can and do exist among us; and the Queen of Maggots will give you enough food for thought to last some time to come.\n\nDo you feel apprehensive or too intimidated to try The Cat Lady? Well, that’s a great start. I, myself, did not play this game for some time after first purchase (via GOG.com in 2013) because the possibility of being unsettled was something I had wanted to avoid. I then played it, of course, and knew it would be a game I’d want to experience again. I am still aware of the thoughts and feelings The Cat Lady instilled within me two years ago – for me, the experience was positive, thought-provoking, and time very well spent.\n\nReadying myself for a second go at The Cat Lady, I felt compelled to write this review. The Steam version has achievements, but please play it through naturally, the first time; make obtaining the achievements secondary for the sake of the experience that awaits you… and what an experience it is.\n\n11/10","June 19, 2015","true","10.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The interface of making decisions is much like real life, in that there is no one "right" answer, but there is a "better" one.

The recent Steam sale had it for a ridiculously cheap $1.99.\n\nI was almost immediately drawn in. Nearly everything was done right for this sort of game; atmosphere, plot, dialogue, music, the art. The only thing I didn't care for initially was the character art.\n\nCat Lady is brillant for a while but slows down for part of the mid and later chapters....too much filler. I also didn't like the sound quality of Mitzi's voice, especially compared to how crisp Susan's was. I found the climax disappointing, thought the epilogue was good. Late in the game even the dialogue, so good for most of the game, started to feel forced and no longer "real".\n\nSo while I did have some qualms, overall this is a worthy title for those who like these kinds of games.

While the paramedics are fighting to keep her alive, she meets "The Queen of Maggots" on another world, who prevents her from dying and tasks her with killing "parasites" who would try to harm her. To help her with this endeavor, The Queen of Maggots grants her the power of immortality, much to the suicidal lady's dismay.\n\nThe art style initially threw me off. I realize that it is by design that the game tries to keep you uncomfortable, but it's off-putting nonetheless especially since the game doesn't even run on 1080p. The sound design is also noticeably cheap as you hear the static when voice actors talk. I'm not going to lie, this is a terrible game when judging on technical merits.\n\nOnce you get to the end of the first chapter, however, you will understand that this is not your regular point-and-click adventure game and why you need to forgive it for its shortcomings.\n\nIt focuses on dark themes that is very rarely explored in other media. Video games, movies and books included. Themes on suicide, depression, dementia, ♥♥♥♥, and cannibalism are prevalent and it's all wrapped under the most unsuspecting game name ever. Would you expect any of that when you first hear the title "The Cat Lady"?\n\nThe gameplay is your standard point-and-click, except you're actually controlling a person's movements. There are puzzles that are basically "think-like-the-developer" puzzles where you "bang two sticks together and hope something happens" but none of them are too out of this world that it would take you more than a few seconds. That's one of the major problems I have with adventure game "puzzles", but I didn't find that while playing this game. If you do get stuck, I'd encourage the use of a spoiler-free walkthrough. You'd understand while you're playing it that the game is worth seeing through the very end anyway.\n\nOh, and you play as a cat for a few minutes. YOU PLAY AS A CAT!\n\nThis is a game you NEED to play if you love a good story. It resonated with me almost closely to the way To The Moon did. I've always been more of a fan of story in video games. I'd forgive gameplay as long as the story is up to par. The story of this game, however, is not just up to par. It's a hole-in-one.\n\nThe Cat Lady is beautiful.

(I think Mr. Michalsky may be one of the few people in the industry able to pull off a stunt like this).\n\nChapter 3, where you return from the hospital as a "recovering suicide victim", and slowly, hesitantly, almost painfully resettle in your own life is one of the best bits I played in a  very  long time.\n\nAlso, I found refreshing its new take on horror. At its heart it is a game about depression and grieving and learning to deal with loss and other true to life themes, only presented in a horror setting. Horror is nothing more here then a subtle setting for the story it wants to tell. Usually in horror stories the protagonist is taken out of his everyday life and put to deal with some exterior intrusive unconceivable thing that threatens to kill him horribly. In The Cat Lady the horror comes from within and poor Susan Ashworth has no way of escaping it other then slowly learning to live with herself. The horror here is the form depression and self hating takes in a poor soul dealing with it every day, year after year, as life silently and hopelessly goes on. A story about what it takes for a soul to leave the darkness it cast itself into and re-learn to slowly bend itself towards the sun.","January 13, 2014","true","13.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","3"

I like cats, and I joke about becoming a cat lady one day.  It was supposed to be strange and dark which i'm never opposed to, and the graphics were at the level I needed them to be so I figured why not?  What started out as a half-joke became one of the best gaming experiences i've ever had.\n\nIf you are used to high end graphics you might initially be put off by the visuals of the game, but trust me when I say you will get over that very quickly.  I, in fact, became fond of the dark 2D visuals.  The voice acting was of a quality that is difficult to find in even blockbuster games; very believable and genuine.  I was honestly impressed with the way they were able to make these characters come to life and provide authenticity to the story.\nThe soundtrack was immersive and lulled you into the events appropriately.  It was never jarring or detracted from the experience, but in fact enhanced it (i'm one of those gamers who is sensitive to soundtracks, the music chosen for a game is very important to me to fully realize the experience so this is a big plus).\nThe gameplay involved the expected puzzle solving sequences and other tasks (like performing investigative jobs, eliminating subjects and completing day-to-day activities), but it also involved a lot of decision making, often relating to some very powerful subject matter.  Life, death, depression, abuse, suicide, and more.  I found myself completely wrapped up with the impactful dialogue and accompanying visuals, this was truly the highlight of the game.  Although it was satisfying to take out the "parasites" in this game, I was much more concerned with the welfare and communications of the main protagonists, and very curious about the introduced supporting characters.\nYou will care about Susan and Mitzi.  You will actually want these 2D images to survive, to get stronger, to get better.  You will wonder who Joe Davis is and what his story and motivations are.  You will want to adopt a cat.  Most importantly, you will be given some powerful insight into the nature of depression and how isolating it can be.  It truly is a very unique experience.  Highly recommended, even to the most hardened headshot-junkie gamer.","January 5, 2015","true","34.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It can take maybe 20 mins. You can skip them with space key, also no worries.\nBut If you will listen to Susan's story, you will really like her more and more. Also after a while, a presence of another character is more than refreshing and story gets a drive.\nExcept listening to dialogues, you have to solve puzzles or do many actions to reach your goal.\nThe graphic design is very special and perfectly fits into the game atmosphere.\nIf you love storytelling games - it worths no matter what price!\n\nPros:\nAwesome story\nUnique graphic design\nGreat soundtrack and sounds used\nGood voice narrating\nBreathtaking atmosphere in the game\nReally scary and shocking time by time\nYour choices matter\n\nCons\nYou can't save the game anytime you like when there is ongoing a dialogue.

When I first saw it, I debated buying it for awhile (until it went on discount that is) since I assumed there would be lots of cats in the game. There are kitties thankfully, but the real focus is on the CAT LADY you play as. Cats, cats, cats.\n\n\nGraphics are a bit grainy but this is fine since it reminds me of older detective style games on computers, but with killers being killed instead. The cutscenes looked great and some the backgrounds and background things were creepy good. Really nice to see small details make things a lot better. Funny how the walls outside of every Flat though are seemingly decaying and yet no one has ever bothered to paint and fix it up.\n\nThe audio vaired for me. Susan's voice fell flat most of the time but that's alright since she's getting over having just killed herself and depression as well. Then some of the other voice actors either had popping sounds with their microphone setups or there was static hanging in the background as they spoke their lines. Seeing David Firth of Salad Fingers fame do voices in this game was also pretty cool.\n\nThe dialogue was kind of all over the place. A lot of misspelling of words (intentional or not) and it sometimes overlapped with audio. I noticed with the Nurse that sometimes her lines would repeat when the subtitles changed to the next set of subtitles. I also noticed (either due to how often I saved or just the game itself) that from Chapter 4 onwards that the subtitles stopped appearing EVEN WHEN the subtitles are turned on.\n\nThe music was nice, ranging from ambient to grunge rock. Sad to see the soundtrack is not available for purchase on Steam, although it can be purchased from the main site.\n\nThe story itself was very well written and the twists and turns were nice. Although the plot with Joe and his wife is not mentioned after showing them in a hidden room... Just listening to the story each character has to tell makes the game a lot of just standing around listening though.\n\n8.5/10","October 4, 2014","true","11.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

At 1st Susan thought it was a dream but in chapter 2 your talking to the psychiatrist about your miserable life or whatever dialogue you choose to show Susan's childhood, you try to leave the doctor's office after your done with your session with the doc but Susan noticed that the Doc's door was locked & then the doc stabs her to death so after you go through the underworld again you try to kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who stabbed you to death (The game gives you 2 choices you can either kill The psychotic Doctor or you can leave the madman's lair forever.\n\nIn Chapter 3 you just came home looking like ♥♥♥♥ after you had to experience the horrors from chapter 2 & you try to relax (In chapter 3 the devs decided to put in a calm meter & angry meter so whatever meter gets the highest it affects the way Susan sleeps) but I understand what this part of the game is telling me because I used to have serious depression so I understood why Susan was struggling with stuff like cooking a burger perfectly for example (I forgot to mention that chapter 3 tells a poem while you're doing Susan's home life). So after you go through Susan's Home Life you then meet a random woman named Mitzi Hunt who tells you that she is the reason why your alive (That's why I was in the hospital so a part of me wanted to punch her but Susan didn't) & she wants to stay in your apartment, Susan tries to convince Mitzi that her home looks like ♥♥♥♥ but Mitzi is too enthusiastic to the point of Susan giving up on excuses but what happens next is that Susan gets really cautious when she sees that strange woman again right next to Mitzi which lead to Mitzi explaining that she has a brain tumor so her final wish was to find a horrible person that caused her extreme pain (If you must know Mitzi was dying & she wanted to meet an important person).\n\nAlright I just got through 2 paragraphs so I will try to explain what happens next, Alright so after The Big C happened you suddenly get transported to a Pest Control Guy's house (I don't how it happened to be honest) where he plays with the tied up Susan but then a nurse comes in getting all ♥♥♥♥♥y because her husband the pest control guy was playing with Susan's ♥♥♥♥♥ so the nurse poured the strongest bleach in Susan's face (That ♥♥♥♥♥ Is Going To Die For That). So what happens next is that one of Susan's cats Teacup tries to release the blind Susan from her trap so after Teacup releases Susan she tries to find a gun since she is blind, She finds a gun and she ended up shooting herself but the weird thing is your transported back to your own apartment where you talk to Mitzi again, Mitzi then asks Susan To get some Wine because Mitzi wanted to bond with Susan better which lead up to Mitzi explaining the name of her Brain Tumor which is called Glioblastoma (She also explains that she doesn't have much time left to live), She explains why she wants to find that horrible person (The Horrible person's name is The Eye Of Adam, He is a Suicide Preacher who convinced Mitzi's boyfriend to kill himself) & after your done talking to Mitzi the cats start crying for help so Susan goes outside to see what is going on but then the pest control guy shows up & Susan is suddenly transported back to the house where she got the Bleach Treatment (If you must know Susan kills both The Pest Control Guy & The evil nurse with deadly gases & a shotgun, All of this ♥♥♥♥ I told you happens in Chapter 4).\n\nIn chapter 5 Susan & Mitzi are having coffee & pancakes together so Mitzi decided to ask Susan how she got depression in the 1st place & Susan gets really defensive about the subject so Susan walks away from the conversation, What happens next is some random person starts knocking on the door & *Drum Roll* the 4th stranger the flower delivery guy tries to murder both Susan & Mitzi (After Susan gets murdered by the random stranger she is teleported back to the underworld to solve some puzzles so she can return to her apartment) so what happens next is Mitzi & Susan are both in the bathtub taped up so They both try to struggle free but nothing works so before they are both dead Susan tells Mitzi her depressing & abusive relationship with her husband but what really triggered her issues was the death of her baby daughter (It's really sad but I think the 4th murderer is Susan's secret admirer from her past). Alright so after Susan discusses her horrible past with Mitzi the murderer comes back to take Mitzi away but he releases Susan then Susan discovers that Mitzi is being hung to death but Susan manages to save Mitzi & the cats are murderers this time (They ate the 4th murderer).\n\nAlright I'm almost done so bear with me here & I'll try to explain the last 2 chapters, Alright so in chapter 6 after the incident in chapter 5 both Susan & Mitzi adventure out to find The Eye Of Adam so they end up talking to a single mother, talking to an old woman who likes dogs, Susan tells a story about a dead woman called The Cat Widow, talking to an old man & yeah it was a lot of exploring (I can't explain all of it). Alright so Mitzi & Susan think they hit a dead end when they couldn't find a clue but when they return to their own home they notice a note on the door by The Eye Of Adam to meet them at the Old Man's Place at midnight so they were both surprised that the old man was hiding something. Alright In Chapter 7 both Susan & Mitzi go to the old man's house to finally see who The Eye Of Adam is, but it is delayed because Adam releases a deadly gas to kill everyone (The old man gives Susan a shoebox but inside that box is one gas mask so you the player either save your immortal self or you save Mitzi, next Susan goes to the underworld one more time to confront the strange woman who I believe is one of Susan's demons that caused self hatred & other horrible feelings & you decide whether to follow what the strange woman says or you refuse her orders) but depending on what you choose you then face the final stranger who is a sadistic internet troll who sits on his wheelchair paralyzed but I liked how the devs explained how bad internet trolls are because Adam was encouraging Mitzi (Well Susan too if you decide not to save Mitzi from the gas) to kill him but his final act of cruelty was to kill himself while taking a soul with him & it encouraged the player to convince Mitzi that revenge is not the answer because Adam will get a bigger punishment which is a nursing home without a PC (Without a PC Adam will not preach Suicide anymore).\n\nPros:\n\n1. Good Story\n\n2. Good Puzzles\n\n3. Interesting characters\n\n4. Good Message At The End\n\n5. Good Music\n\n6. Good Art\n\n7. Simple Controls\n\nCons:\n\nThere are no cons I can think of (Well there are a few programming issues but the devs fixed them) so I think this adventure game is perfect and overall I highly recommend this game (Damn this review was long but I hope I explained the game perfectly). Before I go there is a fun fact about this game, one of the achievements is a reference to one of Jeff Buckley's songs so I thought that was cool of the devs. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRNeGC7k5J8","December 15, 2013","true","19.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The first screen warns that the game is intended for a mature audience of 18+ and boy do they deliver.\n\nDefinitely not the for the faint of heart, as it deals with such adult issues like depression, suicide, abduction, torture, cannibilism, substance abuse, murder, the loss of a child, assault.. pretty much a laundry list of every dark list that you can think of. While the game is very gorey, dark and scary at times -- they didn't overdo it. The game is presented in such a way that the mix goes well together and presents incredibly well.\n\nThe story is interesting, and the gameplay is really the selling point and what held my attention so well. It's an adventure game with simple controls, and features many branching choices and dialogue to give the player more control over the protagonist's destiny. It takes place over 7 chapters, making the game a perfect length without feeling too long or too short. Each chapter was very unique, featuring different environments, characters, it's own story within the story and it's own set of challenges. Although the gameplay is similar in each chapter, the way in which it's presented almost make it feel like a new game with each chapter you play.\n\nIt has a likeable protagonist, great characters (and villains), great artwork, a good sound track, and the characters are all also fully voiced. Although simplistic, it feels like a lot of care and thought process went into the making of this game and it really shows.\n\nIt features several branching paths and endings, so the replayability is high. It's also possible to make saves in certain spots to easily reload and make an alternative choice instead of playing through the entire game again. It also features trading cards, and relatively easy achievements to obtain a 100% rating, if that's something that you're into. Would recommend to anybody, assuming that they can handle the dark and mature content the game has to offer.","March 22","true","8.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Its story and array of characters are extremely well thought out, with only minor conflicting elements here and there that one could easily look over.\n\nI think one of my favorite things about this game is that the protagonist, Susan, is extremely relatable in most aspects, especially if you are someone suffering from depression. The game handles it very well, and doesn't dare sugarcoat the negative aspects of the illness. It's in your face, along with many other uncomfortable themes people never really want to think about when playing a game, but that, I think, makes it all the more fun.\n\nThe puzzles in the cat lady are moderately difficult. There were times where I was stuck and had to pull up a walkthrough because I missed one tiny detail, but other than that - it was very enjoyable. You may get frustrated playing the cat lady, but rest assured, you are not the only one that screams "What the hell is your moms name?!?!" repeatedly at the screen until you manage to figure it out.\n\nAll in all, a magnificent game with incredible artwork that works perfectly with the story and overall theme of the game.\n\nBut wait, you ask yourself, why is she giving it a 9 out of 10 if she likes it so much?\n\nWell, that's very easy to answer:\n\nThere  was a severe lack of cat puns through the course of the game. Not once did I hear "How do you like meow?" or "Are you kitten me?" not even a "Purrfect"! and for that greatly missed opportunity I'm going to have to deduct a point. If you're looking for cat puns in a game called the cat lady, you're going to be terribly disappointed.","November 24, 2014","true","11.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","6","7","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cajun_ramble/recommended/253110/","cajun_ramble","Mammon's Ultramontane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cajun_ramble/","137 products in account","The Cat Lady begins with the suicide of one feline-friendly middle-aged Susan Ashworth, who is spirited into the sepulchral embrace of a woman named the Queen of Maggots, who offers Susan a second chance if she agrees to channel her desperation into a horrifying man hunt for psychotic killers back in the world of the living. During this time, per their agreement, Susan is unable to die, so she straps in to a rollercoaster through a world of such extremes that we're essentially looking at a Hotline Miami-ish hellplain wherein there's a strong possibility some random person from out of the blue will knock on your door, come inside, and without saying a word beat you in the face with a hammer and hold you and your roommate hostage in the bath tub before bashing your brains in for good.\n\nMuch of what we see in this game doesn't make a great deal of sense, but like Lars Von Trier's film Melancholia, I'll argue that it all serves the interior logic in a captivating way. A great deal of it is very well conceived, and while some of its more ragged elements hamper its accessibility, it is a thoughtful and deliriously enjoyable fusion of classic point-and-click inventory mania and an earthy, grim visual novel with a story to tell about survival and the monstrous costs we pay for the choices we make.\n\nThis game is intended for adults, though its early moments beleager the point with eccentric choices of music and at-times juvenile narrative dips, but the pacing is unshakably solid, with moments of cool mundanity swinging into admittedly gorgeous vistas of excruciating depravity. The game is really at its best at either extreme, and some of its quieter moments are the most emotionally impactful and entertaining.\n\nThe story's successes and failures can be tracked back to its scripting and direction--it's very easy to stumble through dialogue trees that end up contradicting themselves, and the voice work gravitates between creeping all up and down your spine and falling flat on its anemic face. It often appears the only coaching the actors got was the placement of ALL CAPS in the script. Story-wise, things are much the same--around 85% surprising and exhilerating, 15% convenient, manipulative, and occasionally, in terms of its depiction of mental health, groan-inducing. The mysteries are never very mysterious and are never allowed room to unravel in unexpected ways. But really, if you grew up with the SCUMM system and seasons of severe depression, there's something for you here, and I'll go ahead and balloon it out to say that if you're just fooling around, trying to disrupt the game's mise-en-scene, even then you're going to have a hell of a lot of fun, sticking a spear through your shrink's neck and going home to feed the cats at close of day.\n\nThis game is a strong alternative to the fast-paced whizz-bang world of hard-as-nails can-you-survive-it-breh video gaming, and I happily oblige you to give it a shot if you've been lately mired in a spell of complicated grief or at least vying to spend a little time with a low-fi punk-rock labor of love.","April 22","true","10.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game offers a bizarre yet emotional story line with puzzles (that are mostly straight foward) and randomness with lots of dialogue. The more you play the more you start to paint of a picture of the main character, Susan Ashowrth (The Cat Lady) is a deeply despressed, troubled, suicidal and lonely indivudal who gets hurled into a world of madness, make believe and death.\n\nIt took me just over 9 hours to complete my first play through and I believe I would play it again in the future. My playthrough was personal and depended on answers that I opted for during the game. Though for the most part the story is the same there are times that the story changes depending on your answers and replies, this makes for great individual gaming though being similar enough to follow a walk through if needed. Also depending on which way you go you have the opportunity to unlock special hidden achievements.\n\nWhile this may not be the most active game and patience is a virtue I believe this game makes wonderful weekend playing or in-between games. For some you can feel free to sit back as though you are watching a film, with the odd click here or there as to your dialogue choices. Other times your solving puzzles and walking back and forth trying to deal with Susans new found crazy life. I woulc recommend this game to anyone that is interested in heart felt, moving games that doesn't mind dealing with a lot of dialogue. For such a cheap price I'm sure you will find it worth the chance of playing something worth while.","December 16, 2013","true","10.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sheriffess/recommended/253110/","Sheriffess","Sheriffess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sheriffess/","123 products in account","Hey there,\n\nWriting a review for a game is ridiculously hard, as this is my first. But for an unbelievable game like this, it’s extremely hard. Why? Because this game, to me, is amazing. Why? Because it addresses, explains and deals with real life issues; such as depression, suicide, loneliness, illnesses and hope. I will state now that it’s NOT a game for the light-hearted, and NOT for everyone.\n\nThe Cat Lady, to give you a very small back stage info session, is developed by Remigiusz Michalski, and is an indie game made by using the ol’ Adventure Game Studio.\n\nSummary:\nYou are Susan Ashworth, a depressed... let’s actually state, a chronically depressed middle-aged woman. Susan is very depressed, sadly enough, depressed enough to attempt to take her life by overdose. Fortunately for the audience, Susan’s attempt leads her to a purgatory place, where she encounters the Queen 0f Maggots. The Queen makes her immortal and will only grant Susan peace providing she completes the task of eliminating the world of five psychopaths (aka The Parasites).\n\nGameplay:\nMovement is based on the four dimensional key pad of Left, Up, Right, Down, and also Enter. Basically you move left or right on screen. When you can interact with an object or scenario, the game will give you the exact prompt that you need to implement. Anyone with “first person dizziness”, this will not affect you. :-) Funnily enough, my Mum suffers from first person dizziness; like travel sickness and I have told her often that this game is very much for her. The Cat Lady controls like the old side-scrolling Maniac Mansion directions (apart from the “Look At” “Pick Up” options). The game has many puzzles, most are slightly challenging, but a few encourage lateral thinking. As of the time I played it, I did not encounter all glitches, crashes, bugs or freezes.\n\nSound:\nWow, the soundtrack to The Cat Lady is amazing! The Credits list Warmer, 5iah and Tears of Mars. To be completely honest, after completion of this game, I went out and bought both the Official The Cat Lady Soundtrack, and the regular soundtrack from the creator, is just mesmerising. The sound effects, scenarios, background music, and credit scrolling background music.... everything is relative. It just creates this feeling of abandonment and melancholy when you play through the game, all the way through to the final credits. The voice acting is performed to a high standard, the actors expressing all emotions, conversations and voice-over narratives convincingly. Susan’s voice actress is excellent, as is Mitzi’s.\n\nGraphics:\nWell, I have been playing games for a very, very, long time. Perhaps 24 years now? Anyway, I really appreciate the hand drawn artwork of The Cat Lady. Each screen frame is carefully, and richly, hand produced to explain and detail the journey of Susan Ashworth. Suicide; from being reborn by The Maggot Queen and the lonesomeness from being alone, to sudden confrontations with serial killers and mentally challenged. Meticulous backgrounds and animations in 2D create a unique dreary, bleak and melancholy element to the game. Susan, you really feel her plight.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game will stay with you for a long time. I’m not sure what more I can say, but I will be keenly anticipating the next title from Harvester Games because The Cat Lady is wonderful. It has one of the best, undervalued, stories for 2012 (or shall I say 2014 when I played it!).\n\nI highly recommend this game. 9.5/10\n","July 24, 2014","true","11.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Murderers, rapists, arsonists… They’re the real beasts… So far from humanity they’re no longer capable of feeling compassion or guilt. They’re the ones we should really be afraid of. But whether they’re lurking in the woods… or fog… or the darkness of our cellars… Its all irrelevant. You can’t predict what happens. You can’t do anything to stop it.

In The Cat Lady we face different reasons to leave everything, to change our game. They may be shocking, but believe me - it's nothing compared with Susan's suffering and loneliness.\nDuring the whole gameplay we can decide about Susan's choices. Does she want to hurt somebody, help or just ignore? This is our own decision. We can play The Cat Lady like we live - really interesting and somewhat "healing" way of beating the game, when answering some questions about her existence.\nEasy controls - arrow keys to do everything, no mouse - and various plot changes or endings let you feel that despite having finished all, there is always more.

Later I asked my boyfriend if he had seen or played it. He didn't say much, but recommended The Cat Lady to me. That was a good recommendation! First time of playing brought many unpleasant feelings. In The Cat Lady we face different reasons to leave everything, to change our game. They may be shocking, but believe me - it's nothing compared with Susan's suffering and loneliness.\nDuring the whole gameplay we can decide about Susan's choices. Does she want to hurt somebody, help or just ignore? This is our own decision. We can play The Cat Lady like we live - really interesting and somewhat "healing" way of beating the game, when answering some questions about her existence.\nEasy controls - arrow keys to do everything, no mouse - and various plot changes or endings let you feel that despite having finished all, there is always more. The characters are brilliantly created. You will love them or hate them. Just remember: white is not always white.

It’s hard to explain how a game with 2D characters makes you reflect your life and decisions and takes you to a journey that leaves you deeply grieved. And as simple as its gameplay is, the story is breath-taking enough to not mind it at all. You choose your fate yourself and you fear to trust people, since your life depends on it. The amazing soundtrack creates a unique atmosphere. It’s one of a kind that gives you chills while it’s matching the story and animations perfectly fine. The developers created an amazing work of art with this game. I take my hat off to them and thank them for this incredible journey through the life(s) of Susan Ashworth a.k.a. The Cat Lady.

Superb story and voice acting with lots of interesting and challenging puzzles that never get frustrating, plus you can always look up a guide if you're stuck - I did. The attention to detail is spectacular, and the art style is like a mix between David Lynch's Eraserhead, a Tool video from the 90's and Monolith's Condemned Criminal Origins. It's quite lo-fi, so if you want nice graphics this may not be it, plus the whole game is controlled with just the direcitonal keys. This is a bonus for people who can only play with one hand, or even just one finger, making Cat Lady very accessible.\n\nPlus the soundtrack is great and the moral of the story is touching, though I didn't try all possible endings.

I need to agree with everyone that this is a game for mature audience only. Not just because it's creepy and disturbing as f, but because the dialogue is heavy and not really fit for younger people.\n\nOh and nevermind the age, if you're triggered by pretty much anything, this is not the game for you. :)\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, you don't need good reactions for this. Just need to follow the story and figure out how to move forward. The puzzles shouldn't be too hard, but sure I found myself stuck a few times. I also found it pleasant that you can do small choices, to play the game as you as Susan. The pace is slowish, but it fits the game just fine. You're going to play the game for hours, but you won't regret it. Hopefully.\n\nSome lag, especially at chapter 4, probably due to my computer not being made for gaming, but I really didn't expect it to affect in this kind of game. Damn fog particles. Hear me groan.\n\nAt first I wasn't so excited about the graphics of the game, now I wouldn't have it any other way. And the sound, I found the quality very poor at the beginning, and well, it didn't really change, but that turned out to be my favorite thing of the game. The voices are unique and they fit the characters really well. I wished they never stopped talking. The music is cool too, it was a bit surpring at the beginning, but it actually fits the game. All these fit together well and make a good, fitting atmosphere for this game.\n\nThe story is simple. What am I even saying, it's not simple at all. It's a story of hope, disguised in depression and other depressing stuff. It is not a happy game, it won't make you feel good about the world. But it's a good interpretation of how life can get better, you just need to go through some utterly disturbing stuff first. :)\n\nNow I'm not a fan of horror games, but for me it's not a reason to turn down a game that's appealing in other aspects. In this game, the horror is bearable: there's really no jump scares, though I was very spooked at times! And since good reactions are not needed in this game, I didn't need to panic either! (I totally did though.)\n\nTo end this novel I started writing, let me just say that if you enjoy meaningful dialogue based games, like puzzles, and well I guess most of all: are not bothered by the disturbing, dark themes and stuff, I highly recommend checking this one out.","March 28","true","19.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The only friends she has are cats. Susan feels that she is worthless, and so she determines to commit suicide through a pill overdose.\n\nSimply put, The Cat Lady is an emotional roller coaster. The story deals with the darkest reaches of the human psyche and approaches them in a grotesque and artistic manner.\n\nThe game is dialogue and story heavy. So get your beverage of choice ready while you follow along with the story.\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite simplistic - you don't even use a mouse. You simply use the arrow keys or the "wasd" keys to move around and Enter to select. You can use space bar to speed up dialogue (some of the dialogue in this game can take a while to get through but it's well done and worth following).\n\nOverall, The Cat Lady is a truly unique experience. Don't be fooled by the simple interface and graphics - The Cat Lady is a powerful, impactful, and mind rending experience.\n\nThe Cat Lady takes about 8 hours to complete.\n\n9.5/10","May 31","true","10.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Issues such as depression, mental health, loneliness, mortality.\n+ The main character is not your typical conventional character and that in itself is refreshing\n\n+ The overall story is good and filled with many different horror elements.\n\n+ Most of the dialogue is good however there were a few times when I found it unbelievable.\n\n+ I found the puzzles to be very well designed and for the most part made sense  and fit the narrative nicely. It can at times be a bit easy especially if you are a novice of the genre\n\n+ Depending on how you respond to people, it alters the story in a slight way\n\n+ I am not a big fan of heavy metal/rock but the music fit perfectly in this game\n\n+ Easy 100% achievements\n\n\nThe Average\n\nLack of mouse support is a bit odd.\n\nWalking is a bit slow and the animation leaves something to be desired.\n\nThe game fails to explain the actions/motivations of certain characters\n\nSome of the dialogue is a bit cringe worthy\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game is very sick and twisted. If you love this genre and horror then this is a good game to check out. The fact that it was made by a handful of people should also be commended. If you know someone with mental illness or suffered yourself this could be a game that will resonate with you as it touches upon a lot of issues that many people face and can relate to what the main character is going through to a degree.

This game accurately shows you what depression and desperation feels like, and also, other ♥♥♥♥ed up human beings.\n\nIt's also eye-opening. We should really look out for each other more and make sure people have someone who they can trust even in their darkest times, whether it be just a day, a week, a month, maybe even years. And the saddest thing is that we hear stories similiar to the tragedies presented in The Cat Lady and we know they happen, but we are just happy that it didn't happen to us. I'm sad that the story had it's lows, just like us, wow that's deep but also surprised how much I loved it despite that, even though I usually can't stand playing these type of adventure games, but that probably didn't bother me because of the very minimal gameplay this game has.\n\nIt's a strong piece of psychological horror, something that makes you think, and if you have met depression, you build sympathy quickly.\n\nLastly, find someone to hug each day, it's worth more than you think.","January 21","true","8.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Absolutely fantastic voice acting, fabulous dialogue writing, great plot, astonishing scenery which at the same time is seriously morbid - this game contains the most insane and disturbing scenes I have ever seen in games. Sure, you can find a lot of blood and gore in games, but in The Cat Lady theese scenes have something more to them, something that makes them more thrilling, than some random blood and guts on the screen.\nThere are some minor flaws, like in every adventure game there are some puzzles that seem not very logical and few scenes that are not very convincing (like inside Pauline's flat when three persons spend far too much time deciding who's gonna open the door and who goes to bathroom with Mitzi), but theese things are not game braking in any way, just somewhat annoying. The last flaw that needs mentioning is animation of the characters (especially Susan and Mitzi). While the whole graphics beeing raw and ugly makes it at the same time very in place and atmosphere amplifying, animation of characters is very shaky and causes eye fatigue.\nNevertheless I highly recommend playing The Cat Lady for all those who are bored with naive and trivial game stories which we face in great majority of other games and seek something more convincing and interesting.

The plot, theme, visual style, music and sounds add up for a thrilling adventure that walks the thin line between life and death, sanity and paranoia. And it does a very good job.\nThis game feels somehow handcrafted. It feels like a very personal project, done with more passion than resurces. The story, the rythm, the passion this game oozes makes it up for the lack of technical polishing here and there.\nThe gameplay is very simple and straightforward. No mouse needed, just keyboard. Honestly, it's the first time I've played a "horizontal scrolling adventure" game, and it works. It focuses on the story, without taking the player away with complicated or absurd puzzles. You won't spend hours trying your inventory items on whatever other elements. In this matter, it's closer to a graphic novel. Still, it has the adventure experience and it feels rewarding.\nThis game is not for the faint of heart, but it's not all about the blood and gore. It all fits naturally in the story.\nI can't recommend this game enough, just take a look at the forums, check the people who wants to contact the author to thank him for creating a game that appeals directly to our most deep feelings and fears.\nI specially recommend this game to all those who are a bit disappointed with the shallow, stereotypical characters and plots and lack of risk and passion of the gaming industry today.

It's got gore, nudity, and moral gray all over it.\n\nIt's unlike almost any adventure game in subject and style with some great surprises, characters, and music. But in parts the dialog feels overlong and cliche. The voice acting is generally good, but very inconsistent. Some characters were done with poor recording quality or change accents from line to line. The art is interesting, especially how they animate characters breathing, but the image constantly jumps from sharp to blurry in unintentional ways because of the tech used.\n\nI'm really excited to see what these developers do next. With a little more polish this game could have been amazingly good, but the craftsmanship doesn't quite match the ambition.

Can't tell how far it goes yet as I've done one playthrough only, but from the looks of it there are at least two different endings)\n+ Great ambiance\n+ Nice music (louder and more calmer tunes)\n+ Good puzzles\n+ Interesting style and design (I especially liked the thoughtful use of colored objects in contrast to otherwise gray ones, possibly working as a symbol for the darker and brighter sides of life and how the protagonist may see them)\n+ Easy controls: WASD or arrow keys and ENTER. Objects of interested are highlighted when you get close to them. I prefer this over tediously examinating every pixel on the screen with a mouse as it otherwise often works in adventure games.\n\n- Minor bugs and design overlooks (voice acting and text not always being identical word for word, voice acting in a few instances repeating the same lines even though the text is farther, voice acting sometimes cutting off prematurely, one or two lines the game skipped even though I didn't want to, a few text misspellings, voice acting sometimes including atmospheric recording noise - couldn't tell how to avoid it though, I'm no sound engineer, but it's sometimes easily noticeable especially since the game itself has little sounds, for most parts its walking sounds and random ambiance sounds mixed in and put on loop).\n\n- One severe bug/technical oddity: You cannot save more than 50 savegames. If you try to save more slots the game will tell you saving was successful, but it actually isn't. Overwriting older files isn't possible (the game will simply create duplicate files, shown in the game with same naming). And since the game has many dialogue options and some critical point choices one is encouraged to save, load and test around with his possibilites unless one knows very sure he is gonna do multiple playthroughs. Could be fatal if someone decides to do a one-night walkthrough and only notices very late that his +50 savegames don't actually exist. Can be avoided by simply deleting/moving some of the savefiles one has (C -> Users -> Your Name -> Saved Games -> The Cat Lady)\n\n? The game is about depression. Those who suffer from it may struggle with some aspects shown to it though, because some of the situations and happenings in the game will hardly ever happen this or in a similar way in the real life. It's not totally far-fetched, but it could be seen as an overdramatization of the otherwise rather sober and to the outside world unspectacular hardships to overcome it. Ultimatively I think there is no way it could have turned out the great adventure game it is had it sticked too close to dry facts of reality though. If one wanted to he could break the whole game apart arguing this way, but what good would that do? For a game I think it did very well in showing some aspects of depression and how to possibly deal with it.\n\n? The violent situations in the game are possibly morally questionable. The game tries hard to make you not sympathize with any of the people that die by your hand and to drive you with your back to the wall (expect for one situation where you can apparently kill someone for "minor" reasons), but in the end even the worst sociopaths in our society have a history and there are reasons why they become who they are. Criminals are not born. They are made. Every man and woman once starts as an adorable child everyone wants to hug and cherish. One must ask at which roads in life things turn as wrong as they do that people turn into mass murderers, rapists and egomaniacs. No one starts his life with the "goal" in mind to become a criminal. Of course the game can't overindulge in these aspects without drifting away massively from it's narration, I guess, but there were instances where it possibly would have served enough to simply knock out someone rather than kill him.","August 26, 2014","true","12.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Blood and the colour red really standout to give a sense of dread and psychological fear.\n\nThe psychological horror in this game is done extremely well. It's been a long time since I've actually got so immersed into the game that the psychological sections have really either shocked me or surprised me.\n\nPuzzles are really good, most of them are logical, the puzzles are easy but not too easy, could give a challenge to some. However there was only one puzzle that doesn't really make any sense and I had to use a guide for.  Hospital scene\n\nHowever it isn't all good, the audio quality is fairly dodgy when it comes to dialogue. One moment the voice actor is mumbling something, so you turn the volume up to hear and then the quality will just spike and then you'll be deafened. There seems to be some sort of static effect when the VA's recorded their lines, possibly due to a low quality microphone. Fortunately the game does have subtitles, which do their job for the most part, unfortunately the subtitles can be in a colour that is hard to read at times.\n\nHowever the soundtrack is fantastic, the guys that worked on the music for the game have done a really good job with that, it's odd that they didn't spend nearly as much time making sure the dialogue was clear. The ingame music sounds like it was inspired by the movie 28 Days later. At least the music always reminded me of that film.\n\nI also felt that the controls were kind of 'meh' is well, maybe that's just me being fussy but I didn't enjoy the control scheme all that much.\n\nThere was also a scene *slight spoilers*  That was kind of stupid. You and your friend end up being tied up due to this guy barging into your apartment and threatens you with a small blunt weapon. Anyway he ties you up and tries to kill your friend but and this part is absolute nonsense. A couple of cats climb in through the open window and claw him to death without any sort of a fight from the guy. How he managed to tie two women up with just a hammer is besides me. There aren't really many of these bad scenes but it detracts from the experience.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience, cheap as well. Definetly worth the money, I completed it in around 6 or 7 hours with more time spent getting different endings and achiements.\n","March 24, 2015","true","14.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In fact, it was so well written that I actually got the same feeling as if I had just read a really good book, and after playing Skyrim for the last couple of weeks, I was very glad for it.\nI really enjoyed the art work of the game, but the sound was occasionally a little below par, with the character voices either being mixed too high or low, or being distored for no reason.

She is a deeply flawed person and can be grating at times, but watching her steadily dig herself out of the hole and take control in the face of unspeakable horrors can be immensely satisfying. This extends to the ensemble cast of secondary characters that include some of the most intriguing—and disturbing—villains in games. While the real life demon "parasites" provide the device to drive the game's main story, it is Susan's own growth as a character that provides the hook to keep you so invested emotionally in the story.\n\nThis is an unapologetically adult game that deals with mature themes; in fact, the game opens with a blood red warning about the horrific scenes, sexual content, and violence that await within. Torture, cannibalism, attempted ♥♥♥♥, mutilation; they’re all here in abundance. But the violence is certainly not the point of the game. Yes, gallons of virtual blood, viscera, melted faces, and more are splashed across the screen. And there are genuine scares and tension served up throughout the game. But that is really only the vehicle for telling the story of a woman literally and metaphysically fighting for her life.\n\nThe backdrop to these journeys is a jagged-edged, multi-layered aesthetic that revels in the use of color to set the mood. The designer’s color palette is one of death, blood, and miasma. Michalski uses colors to increase tension and then release it. Early on, Susan moves out of the burnt autumn colors of sienna, wine, and harvest yellow and into a black and white underground garage dominated by a blood red car. Color is used so well to evoke horror that I swear I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw a blue sky filled with white fluffy clouds.\n\nBut despite all the trappings of death and madness, The Cat Lady  is ultimately the story of one woman who wants to die but must go on living and another woman who wants to live even in the shadow of tragedy. Death in the midst of life, and life in the midst of death. There are so many more things I could write about what the game means, but the experience may touch you in a totally different way, and that is the beauty of it. At times it seems an embarrassment of riches, and a bit more focus, a bit less gore would have earned this game my highest possible praise. Given the game’s grisly subject matter and unflinching brutality, I can’t recommend it to everyone, but the emotional issues explored here are more raw and real than any I’ve ever encountered in a game. I defy you to play it and not be moved. But do play it.

So this might add as a bonus. I didn't think much of this game before I purchased it, but I saw a recommendation for it online and bought it on a sale. It took a while before I was browsing through my library and started playing out of boredom.\nI got completely hooked.\nThe eerie atmosphere and psycological journey that takes place in the main character(as well as in some of the players as well I believe) is telling us about a dark world which we all encounter some time in our lives. Of depression, of sadness, of hopelessness. And to find out that you actually can move on to something better.\nThe dark atmosphere is creepy and some of the gore is even more so. But it all reflects back to a perfect balance between despair and madness(if you like that sort of thing, which I do).\nThere's also a heroine-feeling to it, to try make something better and to punish the ones responsible.\n\nThe story is dark, but quite genious. I once got asked a question; "What game would you like to forget and play for the first time again?" I would say "The Cat Lady", "Braid" and "Bioshock". (not choosing one, sorry :) )\n\nSo hats off for the developer, as I played this game somewhere in May 2015 and I'm still thinking about it now, wanting to play it again for the first time, Januari 16th, 2016.","January 16","true","16.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As far as I can tell you can't lose this game but depending on what choices you make, the outcome of the story will change... somewhat.  The ultimate end of the story does not change, but I think the ending (in all of its versions) is a message in itself to the player.  I won't say more to avoid spoilers but if you play this game you can expect to feel something... especially if you have had a real world event similar to something in the game.\n\nWhile the graphics are crude I think that gives it a charm of its own.

I wasn't expecting much, but I really enjoyed it. The story is amazing and it's like a good book that you can't put away, I've finished the game in just two sittings. It is not so much as horror, there's a lot of disturbing content and you have to make some tough decisions, but I can't say I was scared. The style is amazing, I was worried I'd be off put by the graphics, but it works really good with the story and overall design. The puzzles are also very satisfying: they are not hard at all and it doesn't feel like game holds your hand, but they are all very logical and I've never felt I need to consult walkthrough (apart from one of them with the code to the lock, that one just flew over my head completely). And although there were some technical difficulties and controls feel sluggish at times, it's all not really important for the game of that style.\nI would recommend this game to people who want to dive in story rich adventure with some tough themes, such as suicide, depression, mortality and horrors of human nature.\nThe story does good exploring all that and depending on your choices, you can fight those demons and come out of the other end somewhat victorious.\nI'm really looking forward to any games this developer will release next. I know they are working on the Downfall remake and I'm very excited to try it out.","November 16, 2015","true","7.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

She is a deeply flawed person and can be grating at times, but watching her steadily dig herself out of the hole and take control in the face of unspeakable horrors can be immensely satisfying. This extends to the ensemble cast of secondary characters that include some of the most intriguing—and disturbing—villains in games. While the real life demon "parasites" provide the device to drive the game's main story, it is Susan's own growth as a character that provides the hook to keep you so invested emotionally in the story.\n\nThis is an unapologetically adult game that deals with mature themes; in fact, the game opens with a blood red warning about the horrific scenes, sexual content, and violence that await within. Torture, cannibalism, attempted ♥♥♥♥, mutilation; they’re all here in abundance. But the violence is certainly not the point of the game. Yes, gallons of virtual blood, viscera, melted faces, and more are splashed across the screen. And there are genuine scares and tension served up throughout the game. But that is really only the vehicle for telling the story of a woman literally and metaphysically fighting for her life.\n\nThe backdrop to these journeys is a jagged-edged, multi-layered aesthetic that revels in the use of color to set the mood. The designer’s color palette is one of death, blood, and miasma. Michalski uses colors to increase tension and then release it. Early on, Susan moves out of the burnt autumn colors of sienna, wine, and harvest yellow and into a black and white underground garage dominated by a blood red car. Color is used so well to evoke horror that I swear I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw a blue sky filled with white fluffy clouds.\n\nBut despite all the trappings of death and madness, The Cat Lady  is ultimately the story of one woman who wants to die but must go on living and another woman who wants to live even in the shadow of tragedy. Death in the midst of life, and life in the midst of death. There are so many more things I could write about what the game means, but the experience may touch you in a totally different way, and that is the beauty of it. At times it seems an embarrassment of riches, and a bit more focus, a bit less gore would have earned this game my highest possible praise. Given the game’s grisly subject matter and unflinching brutality, I can’t recommend it to everyone, but the emotional issues explored here are more raw and real than any I’ve ever encountered in a game. I defy you to play it and not be moved. But do play it.

I could rave for hours about this game, but I'll do what I can to rein things in a bit.\n\nAs Susan Ashworth, a depressed and suicidal middle-aged woman nicknamed for her friendliness to local felines, you find yourself thrust into a nightmare world upon attempting to end your life. (This is basically the intro of the game, so don't yell at me about spoilers.) That life ends up carrying on, but not without some dark tasks to complete and some new looks into the shadows that lurk behind Susan's everyday reality.\n\nFirst things first, this game is -dark-. Content/trigger warnings include suicide, ♥♥♥♥, murder, gore... it goes on and on. However, none of this content feels particularly gratuitous. There's a reason for everything horrible that's occurring, and it's all addressed as just that: horrible. Adding to the unsettling nature of the content is its presentation, as Susan and the other characters all move kind of jankily and stiffly. At first glance, it may come off as lazy or inept animation, but overall, it adds to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThere's also a subtext of consequence running through things, but most of these consequences aren't spelled out for the player. Actions here and there, some of which seem not to matter, can change elements of the game further down the line. Similarly, there are some actions that seem important that end up not meaning much of anything when all's said and done. If anything, I'd recommend just going with your instincts the first time around, and then coming back to see what you might be able to change on later playthroughs.\n\nOn top of everything else, The Cat Lady has a fantastic soundtrack, which is utilized very effectively in regards to timing and complementing the action (or lack thereof) whenever it creeps and/or kicks in. I recommend tracking it down for yourself once the game's finished.\n\nBut please, if you can handle the content?

Some of them (graphics) are easy, some are harder (poor audio quality), and others are very difficult (pacing, dialogue), but I can do it because it does so much so well. Really, the only issue I don't think it quite redeems is the fact that the last two (and a half) chapters (of seven) are quite clearly the weakest of the bunch, and considering how impressive the rest of the game is, it feels like it lets itself down a little towards the end.\n\nThat said, there's still lots in that last third or so that's excellent, and overall I don't have much to say against it. It's an exceedingly thoughtful game that manages to be alternatingly horrifying and human to a remarkable degree. It tackles subjects like depression, morality, and mortality in fairly nuanced and complex ways, sometimes surprisingly so.\n\nIn the end, this game is not perfect. Not by a long shot. In some respects, it's sometimes not even all that good.\nBut!\nThere is no doubt in my mind that it is great!\n\nPro/con breakdown:\nCons:\n-Uneven pacing\n-Uneven writing\n-Shoddy audio recording and mixing\n-Mixed bag of good and weak voice acting\n-Doesn't quite know where to go at the end\n-Single resolution of 800x600 that can't be changed\n\nPros:\n-Great narrative\n-Amazing aesthetic\n-Pitch-perfect soundtrack\n-Very intuitive and simple controls (arrow keys and 'enter', that's it)\n-Very atmospheric\n-Has a lot to say, and says it well\n\nTotal score: 8.5/10\n\nDespite this, I recommend it as if it were a perfect 10.

The Cat Lady was a beautiful and eerie journey of a woman trying to make ammends with her life.\nThe story begins with 40-something Susan Ashwood ending her life with a handful of pills, only to wind up in a strange place where she meets an old lady who gives her a choice- wander lost and confused in limbo forever or help to eliminate five "parasites" in her life. However, she has also been gifted/cursed with immortality, which is essentailly the dead opposite of what a truely suicidal person wants.\nThe story itself is quite beautiful, as Susan slowly heals and builds relationships for the first time in years, as well as directly confronting the issues which drew herself into her depression in the first place. We watch her grow as a person and develop, right until the moment where she realizes that the Queen of Maggots from the first chapter is an embodiment of her own depression. The other people she encounters are fully fleshed with fascinating backstories. Susan herself is fairly likable- being reclusive and yet very clever. Her allies are sympathetic and yet very strong, her eventual roommate in particular. The Queen of Maggots is enigmatic and unnverving. Each of the parasites sends shivers down your spine. When I encountered the first parasite, I knew something was off about him right away, and talking to him made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.\nAs for the artistic style, it takes a while to get used to the flow of the graphics, but it fits the style of the game well. The blend of more realistic graphics with the pixelation of other elements is unusual but lovely and eerie. The music is light enough where it isn't distracting but instead adds to the atmosphere. At first I didn't like the voice acting, but it quickly grew on me.\nAll in all, The Cat Lady is a beautiful and eerie game and a lovely artistic experience. I highly recommend it.","September 28, 2014","true","14.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are some genuine chills, some honest stomach churners, and the voice overs are superb.  Ok, mostly superb, there's some groaners occasionally.  But the VO for Susan and Mitsy is phenomenal!  And who doesn't need a little more David Firth in their lives?  If you are worried that it's going to be yet another experimental art piece light on actual gaming and heavy on the angst, do not fear.  It's far more a traditional point-and-click adventure game in play mechanics.  The puzzles are often simplistic (find the key, find the door, unlock the door with the key) but there's a few you'll have to think about.  The story is engaging, the voice work is wonderful, and the art style is superb.

Its emotional and tragic story hits very close to home, and its characters deep and relateable.\n\nThe gameplay itself looks awful. But when you actually play it, its inspirations become clear. Gameplay elements and even whole set pieces and characters are an homage to Maniac Mansion, IMO one of the greatest games ever made. The character's voice actors went to the school of Silent Hill 2 where they seem force, stilted and unnerved on purpose.\n\nThe story itself is about a middle aged woman, alone and surrounded by cats, who kills herself and is forced into immortality by a mysterious force. Living forever being the last thing she would ever want, she is told that she can die again once she kills "parasitic" people who during the course of the game will come for her and others. The topic and execution of suicide is a constant theme in the game. But unlike a lot of media these days, it's never done wrong once. The characters are real, depressed people who just want it to be over. Whatever it is.\nDuring one sequence, the player must guide the main character through avoiding a breakdown. This is pretty much impossible on the first go, for obvious and intentiona reasons. A game that uses the subject of mental illness and suicide without being brash about it is incredibly rare, but it's here.\n\nIt's disturbing, saddening and most of all... Actually scary for a horror game.\n\nThe story isn't just about depression and suicide either. It's about forgiveness, moving on from the past and friendship. All of which it does better than most games have ever tried.\n\nIt looks low budget, janky and rough around the edges. Because it is. Give it a try, it will surprise you.","December 27, 2014","true","7.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After that I just had to finish it lol\n\nI'm not a big fan of scary games, mostly because I'm usually scared senseless of them >.< I mean, I'm curious but frightened at the same time. Anyway, this game isn't all that scary, people like me can manage just fine. Yes there are some creepy scenes and sounds that will raise the hair in the back of your neck and you might get some goosebumps but you will still be able to carry on without having to take breaks or quit the game altogether.\n\nThe gameplay is quite simple and while some parts aren't very intuitive, they are still quite doable after you really put your brain to work and pay attention to details that aren't there just to make the scene look 'nice'. I won't talk about the story behind the game because you can read it in the game store page. I will just tell you that for me, this game is just about choices. Some don't influence the game, at all, while others do. If you don't care about doing all the achievements, then just pick the ones you think are best.\n\nThere are sad parts and there are moments of morbid humor (at least there were for me) and there were, also, parts where I didn't find a bit of 'logic' in them and made me think they were thrown in there just so the devs could continue with the story. Regardless, I think people should give this game a try.\n\nUPDATE: I forgot to mention that the soundtrack for this game is amazing. It is truly one of the best I have ever heard.","October 2, 2014","true","14.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

It's much like the classic point and click adventure games, but instead of employing mouse controls it uses an intuitive keyboard control scheme, which gets a lot less in the way of immersion than the de facto hotspot swiping scheme. When I say it stands out though, I mostly think of the story and its atmosphere. I've seldom felt myself so fully absorbed by an adventure game as I did with The Cat Lady, and that's not bad for a game I approached with apprehension, not being a fan of horror in games.\n\nIf this game is a horror though it's the kind of horror you might feel at the thought of something bad happening to someone you care about. It's not a game that goes all out trying to scare the living daylights out of you, but instead does an excellent job of making you care about its protagonist, Susan. I'm not sure how it manages to do it so efficiently, but in part it must be due a great amount of well written dialogue and the frightening situations Susan unwillingly ends up in. All backed up by a simplistic, yet atmospheric visual style and a really good soundtrack.\n\nOne thing that really struck a chord with me is how most conversations have dialogue options where you can select the response that resonates the most with you, the player. Often being completely throwaway branches that doesn't change the outcome but still provides a chance for you to connect with the protagonist and her sufferings. And you can't go back and exhaust every option to see what might have happened, like in the classics, unless you reload a previous save. To me this made the story feel more genuine.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are for the most part relatively straight forward if you have some proficiency with these kinds of games. Still, many of the puzzles are rather complex and requires several steps to solve, so there's that good sense of accomplishment at solving them. They are also for the most part logical in a real world sense, so if you don't like the absurd puzzles of standard point and click adventures, you might the puzzles in The Cat Lady more to your liking.\n\nOverall this game is a very fulfilling experience and I'd recommend it over most modern point and click adventures. In my opinion it even stands comparison with the classics of yore.","May 22, 2014","true","10.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The environment is bleak, mostly black and white, never shades of grey. There is suffering and misery, never anything else. Although Susan has chosen to end her life, it would seem that she cannot die, and she must suffer through her tasks to be granted her rest.\nSusan is a woman with little joy and more misery than you would think any one person would be able to bear. Alone in the world, struggling to get by. An unexpected stranger becomes a friend. Maybe life isn't all bad. Day by day, task by task, the clouds lift little by little.\nThis game definitely lends insight into the mindset of someone that suffers through depression. The hopelessness, the apathy, where you are always looking for a way out. It is not a game that I would recommend to anyone that currently suffers from depression and the 18+ warning is warranted in my opinion. There is not a great deal of nudity or even gore for that matter, but the emotional content is not appropriate for a younger gaming audience.\nThe gameplay is not complex, it is only a keyboard based game. There is puzzle solving, but not to the point of being overly frustrating. The story is engaging, almost like playing a choose your own adventure book. It's a charming game, but in the way that a car accident is.

It deals with some really heavy stuff... cancer, depression, suicide and of course... death, but what's really impressive is that while also doing all that it manages to remain a really a gripping game, that keeps your attention until the very end. The Cat Lady is all about interpretation, there are dream sequences, some storylines remain completely open and overall a lot of weird ♥♥♥♥, where the explonations aren't fed to the player, and that's the beauty of the whole thing.\nThe Cat Lady is an adventure game, although not of the point&click type, you control everything whit the keyboard (just a few buttons actually), it seemed weird at first, but it worked perfectly here. The puzzles are mostly easy, so the game is basically closer to an interactive movie like The Walking Dead game, but since the story is as good as it is, I don't see a problem with that. The atmosphere is... Silent Hill-esque... rain, darkness, thick fog combined with misery, torture and lots of gore. I wouldn't exactly call this game horror, but there are quite a few scary moments, mostly achieved by the fantastic sound effects and music.\nIf it wasn't too obvious until now, I say it here: I was blown away by this game.

Rather, it is set up in 2D scrolling fashion with interactive objects along the way.\n\nAlso, there is an in game disclaimer stating tha you should be at least 18 years old to play this. I would say that is mostly accurate. Consider it to be similar to a rated R horror/suspense flick. If you would watch one or allow your kids to watch one, then this game should be fine.\n\nThe visual style of the game is jarring, graphic, and quite lush in a minimalistic fashion. The images can really evoke a strong reaction from the player. It was truly effective in setting the dark, oppressive, and downright shocking (at times) atmosphere that the game relies on to get its point across.\nThe actual story is all of those things...dark, jarring, oppressive, shocking, hopeful, sad....a roller coaster of emotion....which is appropriate since the protagonist, Susan Ashworth, starts the game by commiting suicide via sleeping pills. She is cast into a sort of underworld where she finds that she will not be allowed to die until she performs five tasks...namely the execution of five "parasites" (aka serial killers). So begins her journey of self discovery  and as she progresses, she slowly unchains the shackles of mental illness (in her case, clinical depression).\n\nAs sick and twisted as the game can be, it also carries an underlying beauty to it, as seeing the worst humanity has to offer and overcoming that also helps Susan in overcoming her depression and start seeing the world in a hopeful light.\n\nAll told, I think the game took me about 5 hours to conclude, and I would recommend saving often if you intend to get all the achievements in one playthrough, as many of the scenarios have two possible outcomes that each come with an achievement. I kept forgetting to do so, but if it's important to you, the 100% achievements is very easy to come by. Speaking of which, there is some replay value here due to the fact that there can be more than one outcome to vaious parts of the game (or rather, more than one way to get the same outcome).\n\nI would also note that chapters 5 and 6 in particular did drag out a bit too much in my opinion, but the pacing, while slow overall, was still pretty stellar in my opinion.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, but not if you are squeamish or particularly sensitive to tense and dark scenarios.","July 5, 2014","true","13.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Going into the game I wasn't a fan of 2D scroller/adventure games but, the story of Susan Ashworth just grabbed me. At times I had to remind myself it was just a game. The story is a good length, however it all depends on how quickly you figure out some of the puzzles. Sometimes I would be stuck on a part for a while trying to figure out how to advance, but figuring it out added a rewarding side to the game.\n\nThe balance of gameplay was great, even while you were playing it would feel like you were watching a movie at times.

I have first of all heard alot about the saves. People saves the game and when they enter the game next time it disappears. I tried it myself aswell. 3. Screenshoots and opening Steam Tab. I am not able to open Steam Tab or take screenshoots while i am playing this game that makes it impossible to respond to messages. These three things is something that would make it much better if it was working "For Me".

You play as Susan Ashworth, a forty something dreary apartment flat owner who wants to kill herself. From there, nothing is off limits as you explore the deep recesses of Susan's mind. Through her out of body experience, she is given the task to murder five vile denizen of the world who seek to cause harm to others in the most disturbing of ways.\n\nThe Cat Lady is a heavy dialogue - point n' cli---well actually you just use the arrow keys on your keyboard so it is more like a press n'...uhh press game. The mechanics are very simple, having you solve typical puzzles with no chance of permanent failure (for the most part). You'll rarely have any trouble progressing through the game on the gameplay level. The graphic story is the true cat's meow to be had here.\n\nThe story frequently drifts into the realm of surrealism and with it, so does your grip on what is normal. You'll soon start to question what actually transpires in the game and what is just a hellish dreamstate of the progenitor by our over-the-hill protagonist. Speaking of protagonists, Susan is likeable because she isn't trying to vanquish evil, only trying to figure out herself at the core. Every piece of PC/NPC dialogue is voice acted with some better than others. I never had an issue with any of the voices and it's quite an atmosphere amplifier to have it fully voiced.\n\nThe game will take you anywhere from 3-10 hours depending on if you do not skip dialogue and examine your surroundings.

Perhaps you've wanted to make friends, not as long as they're alive. They are beasts.\n\n\nStunning, definitely stunning. You're put into surreal situations, and the ambiguity of it all produces the eerie feeling the player receives during the whole game. The player will meet several people throughout The Cat Lady, all of which you were instructed to kill and left to suffer, with the exception of one, which the player themselves will select the fate of. It feels almost...rewarding to get rid of The Parasites.The voice acting is fantastic, surely one of the best I've heard. Each story is unique and very well-written, while the locations of items the player is told to find are rather linear, the events leading up to the final moments of each chapter are divine, and surely replace every small flaw this game may have. The ending of the game? Perhaps a bit cliché, but satisfying to sum up all the experiences the protagonist, Susan Ashworth, had to go through to finally lead a normal life.","November 17, 2014","true","16.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

She has no family, no friends and no hope for a better future.\n\nThe Cat Lady is more a "psychological novel" than a game. I couldn't stop to play, like diving in a book and impatient to see the evolution of the story. It's very emotive. Susan Ashworth shows us the dark side of the human soul, tortured, violent, desperate... Heavy consequences of our choices, suicide, madness... We play with life to finally catch a little hope, a light after this endless darkness... Our heroine is moving, endearing.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are a bit confusing at first but it's a very particular style that fits with the atmosphere of the game : dark, disturbing, insane... I also enjoyed the music.\n\nGameplay\nHorizontal scrolling Point n' Click with fairly simple puzzles.\nIf I had to give a negative point : I wish the story lasts longer!","January 10, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's one of the most atmospheric games I've played, and its uncommon graphics style and approach to Death should at least be checked out, if not admired. It's like Kafka went bloodthirsty.\nThe music is essential for the setting and I really enjoyed it, even though the more rocking parts did the game no good imho.The story telling as well as the character depth is outstanding in The Cat Lady, I could really bond with some of the people in the game. I feel the game missed some great opportunities, though. I'm kind of sad that neither Liz nor Mitzi, whom I grew to like, turned out to be Parasites. Having to kill them would have been a nice play with the players feelings.\nThe game itself is sadly not very well coded: Every time you save you have to create a new file, there is no overwriting. Changing resolutions is not possible and I happened to accidentally skip a few important text parts a few times. Skipping spoken dialogue is not possible which drags the game out a bit and gets bothersome if you have to talk to someone for a second time or you just want to end the conversation. Good heavens, that phone call to the police was annoying as hell. Some of the voice actors Especially Liz blew into the microphone whilst speaking, which is also a big minus. The graphics - a mixture between pixel art and high contrast photographs - are weird at first, but once you get used to the style they really shine.\nThe technical deficits this game has are overshadowed a great deal by its content. I finished it in two sessions and fell in love with the rainy balcony on which Susan enjoys her coffe while she smokes as well as the melody she plays for the cats. I also really liked Mitzi, but in the end I accidentally killed her - what made the ending better than if I would've saved her, I feel. A happy ending would just not have fit to the game.\n\nNOT FOR DOG PEOPLE.\n\nThis game tells a tale about confrontation with Death and as such it expresses views not everyone might share and is quite graphic. Murder, suicide and violence are approved agenda. If you are easily disturbed and don't like to be, don't play The Cat Lady. If you look for a perfectly coded game, don't play The Cat Lady. If you want to play a game in which you can really sink in, that is unique and highly enjoyable and if you like cats and morbid stories, do play The Cat Lady.","February 17, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/namgrim/recommended/253110/","namgrim","namgrim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/namgrim/","226 products in account","It is the story that makes The Cat Lady outstanding. It is an original horror story that had me in its grip for the whole time to complete the game. The main protagonist is Susan Asworth, a 40-year-old woman who in the beginning of the game swallows a whole bunch of sleeping pills to end her life. Her suicide attempt hurls her into a world of supernatural, darkness, madness, violence and perversion. A lot of disturbing situations and imagery goes on throughout the game. The story also deals with themes like depression and terminal illness — themes that rarely are a subject in video games. Somehow the game reminds me of the 90's cult classic adventure games Harvester and Sanitarium.\n\nEven though The Cat Lady feels like a descendant of the nineties point and click adventure games, the controls aren't actually "point and click" style, because the player uses a keyboard instead of a mouse. It can feel a bit clunky at first, but it's not something that the player can't get used to. Also, the characters can only move left and right on the screen — the areas are not "pseudo 3D" like in the classic adventure games.\n\nThe graphics might be a turn-off for some of the contemporary gamers. It's pixelated, and I couldn't find a way to change the resolution or the aspect ratio, and was stuck with 800 x 600 resolution and 4:3 ratio. I didn't mind that. The graphics and overall visual style of the game appeal to me a lot. Also the sound design is enjoyable. The music fits the twisted and horrific tone of The Cat Lady. Voice actors are doing a great job.\n\nThe puzzles aren't too frustrating and there's not much backtracking. The game's rather easy and it took me approximately seven hours to beat it. There is an annoying "feature" that won't allow you to make more than 50 game saves and you can't delete the saved games in-game to make more room for new saves. You have to do it manually in the saved games folder. Other than that, the game worked flawlessly.\n\nI loved the whole gaming experience and The Cat Lady surely is going to be a cult classic of the future.","October 30, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as Susan Ashworth, a forty something dreary apartment flat owner who wants to kill herself. From there, nothing is off limits as you explore the deep recesses of Susan's mind. Through her out of body experience, she is given the task to murder five vile denizen of the world who seek to cause harm to others in the most disturbing of ways.\n\nThe Cat Lady is a heavy dialogue - point n' cli---well actually you just use the arrow keys on your keyboard so it is more like a press n'...uhh press game. The mechanics are very simple, having you solve typical puzzles with no chance of permanent failure (for the most part). You'll rarely have any trouble progressing through the game on the gameplay level. The graphic story is the true cat's meow to be had here.\n\nThe story frequently drifts into the realm of surrealism and with it, so does your grip on what is normal. You'll soon start to question what actually transpires in the game and what is just a hellish dreamstate of the progenitor by our over-the-hill protagonist. Speaking of protagonists, Susan is likeable because she isn't trying to vanquish evil, only trying to figure out herself at the core. Every piece of PC/NPC dialogue is voice acted with some better than others. I never had an issue with any of the voices and it's quite an atmosphere amplifier to have it fully voiced.\n\nThe game will take you anywhere from 3-10 hours depending on if you do not skip dialogue and examine your surroundings. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a rich story set in the horror theme that is the macabre. Easily worth the full asking price.","February 1, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Actually, this game does has some dark humor, but overall, it is very dramatic. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under 18 as it has some very adult themes. That aside, the storyline is very rich and unique. It really dwelves into a lonely woman who has some psychiatric issues and she must deal with them so to speak. Yes, the graphics are two-dimensional, but this game is more of an art-form with a story line attached. I also commend the music in it is very well paired with the storyline. The endings do vary depending on your chioces made in this game. I think more of these indie games like this one really needs more hype. As you can see from my gameplay, it wasn't a long play, but worth the money. I also read the same company is coming out with another similar game somtime in the future.

Mature, modern, original, this is a work of art.  And it's not pretentious, pandering "art", either; it's an entertaining game with an appealing, paper cutout aesthetic and a great eclectic soundtrack.  It's (depressingly) worth noting that this is, in fact, A GAME.  I was weary The Cat Lady would be a walking simulator/barely interactive screensaver with it's head up it's own ♥♥♥ just judging by screenshots and current trends, but no... it can best be described as a 2-D Silent Hill mashed up with a Telltale game with heavier adventure game elements.  Yes, it is story heavy and can be a slow burn, but the excellent exposition always has a suitable payoff.  You are given choices that affect the story and ending, but I was more than happy with the ending I recieved and wouldn't want to ruin it by cheating it and going back to see what the alternatives would have produced.  The only minor sorespots I have are some longish stretches of the game where you aren't allowed to pause/save (and you won't want to skip any story, so you're kind of locked in) and one major character's dialouge, Mitzi, sounds extremely tinny.  Again, these are minor complaints in a truly fantastic game.  If you want some surreal psychological horror with depressing (though quite often humorous) social commentary on the isolated modern world, you have to play this.","July 17, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It isn't a high-anxiety game like Outlast, but rather builds a creeping, uncomfortable dread over the course of the game.\n\nOne thing I really liked about this adventure is that the solutions to the puzzles were unusually pragmatic (most of the time). I'm used to adventure games that require you to string together entirely nonsensical chains of actions to solve puzzles and there wasn't any of that in this game. Typically, the things that 'made sense to do' worked for solving the puzzles. This might make the puzzle side of the game 'too easy' for some, but for me it was refreshing to not have to hit a walk through every few minutes to see what kind of ridiculous conclusion the puzzle designer expected me to make.\n\nThe story is definitely for a mature audience and the subjects touched upon are certainly grimdark, but I felt that they were generally handled in a respectful way rather than going for 'shock' value.","February 28","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The story is about Susan Ashworth. A 40-year old woman on the verge of suicide. After swallowing a bunch of pills she suddenly finds herself in a field. She wanders about and encounters the queen of maggots. Is she a god? THE god? The devil? Something in between? That's never really explained, but not really important anyway. The point is that you're dead and the queen is interested in Susan to do something for her and by extension give her another chance at life. Susan is then tasked by her with finding five so-called parasites. They're basically awful, terrible human beings and you have to bring them to justice.... by killing them.\n\nI have to admit. I wasn't digging this game at first. The game didn't really ease me into the puzzles in the first 20 minutes or so, but after finding the queen of maggots, things begin to really pick up. It's incredibly engaging to say to least. There are seven chapters in the game and only really four focus on the parasites which I have to say is a bit dissapointing, but that doesn't mean the other ones are filler. Susan Ashworth is a great character. She acts very realistic, she's sympathetic, and uses all of her wits against the parasites. It's very refreshing to see a strong female character without resorting to making her a complete mass murder like say Lara Croft. She's incredibly badass, but still feels like a human being. She doesn't have any special powers or is even especially physically strong. Her only advantage over all the obstacles she has to face are immortality granted by the Queen of Maggots, her wits and the element of surprise.\n\nSo yeah, the story is great. The characters are mostly great and very well fleshed out. There's also a few nice subplots, twists and sometimes the story or ending will change through your actions encouraging multiple playthroughs.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty good all things considered, but I do have two complaints: one minor and one not-that-major-but-certainly-more-annoying. The minor one is about the main character herself. I don't think the performance is bad, but she sounds like Lara Croft from the 2013 reboot while she's supposed to be a middle-aged woman. That's not how it's supposed to be, right? It didn't bother me too much. The one that really annoyed me was Susans ex-husband. He isn't there for long, but he was really bad. All he did was spout "GIVE ME A SANDVICH" or something. Everyone else is great.  The parasites especially who manage to be scary even with some overacting, but it never goes overboard and is certainly not funny in a good kind of way. Some have an obvious accent like how the Queen of Maggots sports an Austrian accent, but it really isn't that distracting from the actual experience and so overall I'd say the voice acting is a succes.\n\nThe gameplay is actually very strong here. The puzzles are well thought out, but never impossible to figure out on your own with the only exception being the very beginning, because you aren't really thinking with the mindset the game wants you to be. An example, there's a crow somewhere and you're expected to follow it. If you do it right, you'll end up at a different place. Come on, how am I supposed to know that that thing isn't there as decoration? Granted, I thought it was weird how you had to stood still and let the crow fly to either the left or the right side of the screen, but I think my point still stands. The game is entirely in 2D and doesn't use the mouse a lot which I thought was a bit weird for a point and click game, but it works pretty well.\n\nThere's also a minor annoyance about saving. You can save wherever and whenever you want, but you can't seem to overwrite or delete save files in-game. Seeing all those files stack up and take up space was a bit frustrating, but something I can live without.  You do have to wonder why they didn't add this feature in. Was it too complicated to program?\n\nThe music was strangely refreshing to me. It felt like how a video game soundtrack should sound. It's very catchy, but it also conveys a lot of emotions. It's a very thrilling, creepy score. The composer deserves a lot of credit.\n\nThe graphics are probably the worst aspect of this game. Sometimes, it's hard to make out what exactly you're looking at on the screen. All the characters are in profile view which isn't very interesting and to top it all off they're not animated very well. However this didn't stop me from enjoying and this also shouldn't stop you from buying it either. This game is great. It gave me a very satisfying feeling after I finished it which not a lot of video games do for me. If you're in the mood for some horror, a depression or just pointing and clicking then I can't recommend this game enough.","August 13, 2014","true","6.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

But this game... Dear god, it is amazing. From the diverse cast of characters, to the cleverly crafted riddles all the way to it's sick and disturbing story and atmosphere, this game will grab and hold on to you untill you finish it. If you do not like the Adventure genre, do not be afraid. This is more of a Heavy Rain type of game, like an interactive story but will puzzles and riddles that, although not always easy, only require to use logic to solve. Kudos to the creator for bringing something different in terms of story and visuals to the genre.\n\nThe Cat Lady is a Mystery/Horror Adventure game. I will not go into much detail about the story, but i must warn you that there is a lot of violent and disturbing imagery that you rarely find in a video game, but there is a reason for all of it, and it is so expertly crafted that your heart will keep pounding until the next chapter, and will keep you wanting for more.\n\nThe visuals have a unique personality, a good blend of black and white and various other colors to flesh out specific images. They do an extremely good job at giving you a sense of depression and decay, adding a great deal to the atmosphere of the game. The characters and, especialy, the backrounds are well drawn, however the animation could have been alot better. But it is understandable, since this game is the work of one man for the most part, and animations are very hard to do.\n\nThe music and sound effects are also excellent, creepy and eerie, keeping you on guard constantly. From creeking doors to footsteps from the floor above, they create a feeling of constant danger, never letting the player rest.\n\nI highly recommend this game. Even if you do not like the genre you should definetly take a look at this, since the gameplay and story are unique and can be played by everyone, not just hardcore adventure fans. Give it a shot and i am sure you will be pleasantly surprised.\n","December 16, 2013","true","8.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My thoughts about the game spooky and crazy at times. I loved the story its a dark one for the most part and the art style is great and creepy. I did enjoy the ending. I loved the sound effects and soundtrack that I bought from another site where I bought this game from and later got a steam key. However its not all rosy the game does have a few weak spots in it. The one thing I did not like about this game was the resolution was limite to 800*600 on my monitor that is 1680*1060 so it did not look good as it could have. You could try changing it but  my video card did not support the 1600*1200 resolution.\n\nThe game is not long about 8 hours maybe without a guide at all. The voices in the game were for the most voiced well however mic hiss was in effect on some of the voices. Towards the end you do get to make different choices about how you want it to end so thats a bonus. There is some swearing and some mild nudity.

This game is not for everyone. It has a very complicated and deep message to tell in it's story, and the "game" is all about the story. This is more of an interactive novel than a "game" which is not a bad thing at all - in fact I love those types of games (999, Ace Attourney, Corpse Party). This story is very dark and dreary, but it really pulls through in the end. There are some unanswered questions left over, but nothing that would really change anything. The game can be a bit misleading for any alternate "paths," but the story pulls through, along with a solid soundtrack. The game has some technical issues, as it was made by a lower-budget indie studio, but given what they had available they do manage to pull off a great experience. I would love to see what this team could do with a full budget and some real team backing behind it. If you want a dark and dreary story with an uplifting message, stick through this. As I said, it's not for everyone, but it can be powerful if you let it sink in.","December 30, 2013","true","15.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story is based around a suicidal woman who has been overpowered by depression for years. Some reviewes have criticised the game for being depressing, which I would suggest is unfair considering that is the focal point of the story, and as described in the game literature. Rather, this game will appeal to those who enjoy dark and surreal stories. Surreal is the best adjective here as the path the Cat Lady is taken on is by no means ordinary, and the situations and characters she engages with are saturated in a dark surrealism which I found very pleasing.\n\nThe second bone of contention may be the format of the game. You control the Cat Lady by using the arrow keys and she moves in 2-dimensional fashion across the screen. For me, this was a perfect choice to represent the flatness of  her dark and depressed world and adds also to the creepy ambience. It is therefore not the same as a conventional point-and-click. In the same comparison, while there is a fair amount of acquiring items and using them to progress, it is not as heavy as the average adventure game, and is far more logical and functional than some games of this genre. That is not to say that solutions are immediately obvious, in fact as the atmosphere is mysterious and quite scary, it was enjoyable to feel fear just walking around to find an item.\n\nThe story is very good and the introduction a fantasic way to become accustomed to the game and to be made to feel a little jumpy. The story is surreal as I have said, and is also mysterious. Without risking spoilers, the main story is taken to a satisfying conclusion, however some of the characters, the first one you meet in particular, remain mysterious and give you just enough to hint at what they really are. This is definitely a story and you have to want to absorb it. If you prefer fairly shallow gameplay where you don't have to deeply engage with the story then this is not for you and you will find it unsatisfying - you have to concentrate to join the dots sometimes - and you have to interpret the events and dialogue in the depressed, dark and surreal context intended. It is also dark and adult, the Cat Lady finds herself in several truly horriffic situations. The voice acting is good and I did not feel it ever pulled me out of the game.\n\nA final issue that annoyed some reviewes is that the game does not run in a full widescreen resolution. I do not defend the creators decsion but likewise I did not find it had any negative impact on my immersion or enjoyment.\n\nFor me this game was an engaging, dark, and adult creation which I really enjoyed playing. It made a refresing change from token 'comedy' adventure games, or games trying to be 'dark' and completely failing. There are few well made dark adventure games and I think it is just as important to experience dark mature games as light and happy. If you're a little dark yourself and have the depth of character and intelligence to enjoy this kind of story, then you are likely to enjoy this game.","January 23, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/balaamsass/recommended/253110/","balaamsass","Balaam's ass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/balaamsass/","452 products in account","This game is pretty dark for an almost pure animation: suicide is the baseline of the game, as the female protagonist is a depressed, suicidal, resident at a mental facility right from go.  After wandering around in an apocalypse-like between-life kind of place and making a deal with someone called "The Queen of Maggots."\n\nIt gets only darker from there, since your quest is to "visit" several "parasites" in the world with the touch of the Queen.  This happens in several chapters in a basic click-explore environment where problem solving is not always straighforward or logical until after the fact.\n\nAll in all it's a very good story, better than the medium of this game in my opinion, though game play is on the level and acceptable.  The 'worst' thing in my view is the sometimes slightly long hesitation between dialogue; while this is often to set the mood (reluctance to talk about something; thinking before saying something; pacing around a little, etc), and while there is a way to skip past most of it (spacebar), you risk missing something pertinent and valuable to the current quest.\n\nThat said, this is very much a save-and-reload game in some ways, especially if you're an achievement junkie (suffice to say that there are several endings, some of which rely on elements of the game that are encountered fairly early... and there is good guide support for these places if you get frustrated).  Much as the old Choose Your Path books kept my fingers in eight or ten pages at the same time, this game did the same.\n\nGame play is linear, and you often do not have a chance to go back to prior areas; save early, save often.\n\nThere is dark humor here, as well as morbid, Devil's Rejects themes in some places, and it's set to some very good music both in terms of ambiance and mood-setting at key plot points.  Chapters tend to flow well, too - you're never really left wondering, "OK, how did I get here again?" except for flashback type moments which are quickly explained.\n\nThis isn't quite a 'find the hidden object' game as much as it is a fuzzy-linear novel that you can fail to complete.  Not exactly fun in a gamey sense, but worthy of the time invested to see what the game is about, rather like a novel.\n\nIf you're fast and free, you might play for 10 hours or less, but I think most people who complete the game will spend about double that in finding out what other paths can be found.\n\nNSFW, suggest adult only play (language, nudity, visceral carnage, torture, violent themes) but it's rather artful, if dark, in most of this portrayal.","January 2","true","21.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hachach19/recommended/253110/","hachach19","Alex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hachach19/","236 products in account","Okay, here's the deal with The Cat Lady. The story evolves around the depressed and suicidal Susan Ashworth who must deal with supernatural and disturbing events happening to her ever since she tried to commit suicide. It's a puzzle horror game about finding a purpose in life, finding one's self, getting revenge, and forgetting about the past. The unique thing about this game is that it discusses certain topics that are, apparently, considered taboo in other games. We're talking about suicide, torture, mild nudity etc. While the topics seem harsh, they are used in such way that they only enhance the already well-written story that successfully uses the topics well in conjunction with the story as it progresses. The fact that the developers choose to handle these topics is not only very exciting and new, but also shows how mature and down-to-earth the developers in fact are. By not censoring out offensive words and disturbing events, it only boosts the realism of the game further, as this is how all games should do to begin with.\n\nHowever, the game is not only horror, as it has humor and happy moment from time to time which, in my opinion, is to be taken as the progress Susan is (or isn't) making throughout the story. This also helps the player relax after certain events. The mix of horror and relaxing events appears to be well balanced throughout the story. The puzzles vary in difficulty and can be tricky from time to time, but overall very enjoyable. The game also rewards the players who remember details about certain conversations and story elements.\n\nThe game has multiple endings based on certain decisions throughout the game, which adds replay value. It also has achievements.\n\nOverall very recommendable and very different from other games.\n\nCons:\n- As I'm writing this, the current Steam version crashes a lot which requires the player to save a lot. The crashes can be delayed by allowing more memory for the game in its setup settings, but it will still crash. They're aware of the problem.\n- There are only 50 save slots that I managed to use up fairly quickly because of the frequent saves. Furthermore the game won't tell you that you've run out of save slots, it will tell you it has saved the game when it, in fact, hasn't. Saves can be deleted manually by deleting the files in the save game folder.\n- The resolution is a bit of a pain to setup because it won't run if you choose a too big resolution and it doesn't have many options. Apparently an engine limitation.\n- While the voice acting is good, the quality varies a bit. Sometimes you notice volume differences in voice lines, and I've heard scratching a few times.","December 20, 2013","true","11.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Certain aspects of the game will haunt you and really stay with you, even after you're done playing. The themes introduced in this game are heavy and highly mature. Never before have a seen a game which deals with suicide and depression in such a personal and well-informed way, without being exploitative, either. This game doesn't need a huge budget or fancy graphics to convey its message properly; it has a powerful style that shifts between surrealistic art and dreary black and white photography. The voice acting is well done (most notably with Susan and Mitzi), which is a big positive considering the game itself is very dialogue-based. The puzzles are challenging, while fitting naturally into the flow of the gameplay. Can't recommend it enough, and I'm looking forward to what comes next from Harvester Games!","December 20, 2013","true","8.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The developers solved the problem in just a few days, and for that I would like to thank them. You do not often see such diligent support from devs, but in this case they have done right by everyone, so that is awesome.\n\nSo the cat lady is indeed an amazing game. It is a story driven 2D point and click style game. The puzzles I have encountered so far are not too difficult, and if you do happen to get stuck there are many resources online that you can get hints and tips from. So in that sense the game is not frustrating.\n\nThe real emphasis of this title is on the story, and damn is it an interesting one. Let me say this, if you have ever experienced a deep depression you will almost instantaneously relate and connect to the games main character. It is clear the writer or writers of this game know what they are talking about. They have crafted a deep, dark, and in many ways outright creepy story. Hands down one of the best stories in gaming I have yet seen.\n\nI supported this title on green light and I am very happy to see it on Steam.

May have good points, but its bad ones bring it down.\n\nDon't get me wrong, just because I don't recommend it means it's a bad game. It's just that it's not a game for everyone. The premise is great, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThere are many scenes that take too long and there is no option to skip them. Which isn't that bad the first time you played it, but oh god does it show in a second playthrough. For the save option to appear you need to press ESC, but it will NOT work during a cutscene or dialog (which, you know, the game is full of). So you may have pressed it at some point and, since nothing came up, thought it didn't serve a purpose. My first time playing the game I made it to Chapter 4, and since I didn't see the save option nor the game told me about it, I supposed it autosaved. Playing everything again was a chore.\n\nChapter 3 introduces mechanics that you won't see ever again. And the way they work, it's almost a guarantee that you will "fail" it the first time. Chapter 4 has a particular scene where the game slows down a LOT making the game unplayable. I thought it was a glitch so I had to load another save file only to have the same results.\n\nAnd it seem that at the end the creator forgot what the game was about. Let me put it like this: You play a game where the objective is to find your 5 cows that escaped from the barn. When looking for the first one you travel through the mountains, fight wolves and swim through a lake. And you think "Well, so far it's good. I wonder if it gets better". But then you find the next 4 cows all in the same place just eating grass. And then you turn arounds and see a duck and scream "Johnson! There you are, I've been looking for you for years." So you take your duck back to your barn where he uncovers the hidden gold of Mr. McNugget... And you just wonder, wasn't this game supposed to be about something else?\n\nNow, as I said before, the premise of the game is very interesting. At the beginning of Chapter 4 a new character will be introduce that makes the game feel less depressing, even the main character will act different and make the game more enjoyable. It's definitely an experience, I'm glad I played it, but it could have been better.","November 1, 2015","false","6.0"," 34 of 65 people (52%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","52","34","65","9","0"

The Five People You Meet in Hell\n\nTL;DR -> Well worth the cost (and probaly even a few dollars more)\n\nAs someone who has gone through several of the situations that the protagonist goes through, as well as being extremely introverted, let me just say that the story really hits close to home. It is a truly emotional journey that can easily drudge up the past and really force you to connect with Susan on several levels.\nPlaying the game won't make you depressed, on the contrary, it will almost make you feel epowered in a way.\n\nFor those of you who haven't gone through any such events, you should still play this game. The gritty, dark and quite realistic (with the exception of several key factors) story is just a real heart-felt journey that will occasionally cause you to stop and think about the trials in life that several people have to deal with. TL;DR? -> Sometimes you'll feel sad for the characters and sometimes you'll feel downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at others.\n\nAs for the game itself? Each aspect seems to compliment eachother. What I mean is for those of you who have seen the GRAPHICS and immediately thought that the designers were just lazy, let me just say that the art would NOT have worked any other way. This particular style of art works extremely well with the story that is being told. It's not lack of ambition or design resources, it's intentional and rightfully so.\n\nThe SOUND was something that I struggled with to accept. Some of the voice-acting was very well done, but quite a few of the characters seemed really forced, such as Doctor X. Often times you can hear that it was just a case of standing too close to the microphone while other times the dialogue just didn't really sound convincing. Sometimes I felt this worked to their advantage as it added a more realistic tone, but it was quite situational. Overall, I didn't feel like this really took anything away from the game.\nThe MUSIC, however, I found to be really enjoyable all the way through.\n\nThe CONTROLS? Not much to be said on that point since you only use the arrow-keys and Enter. Very easy to play and drink coffee at the same time with is a wonderful little bonus.\n\nThe PUZZLES in the game aren't of the Myst-type calibre, but are enough to keep it from feeling more like a visual novel. Some of them you will just end up solving without even realizing it's a puzzle while others might take you awhile to piece together. I, personally, found none of them to be truly frustrating.\n\nThe REPLAY VALUE is there, but unless you didn't save very often or didn't focus on nailing each achievement, you might cap it off with 2 playthroughs.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. Well worth the couple bucks.","January 9, 2015","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't think I was supposed to complete the game and get 100% achievements in one sitting, but I accidentally did. The Cat Lady has definitely stolen a spot in my heart as one of my favorite games of all time and I don't even usually play this genre.\n\nPositivePrepare yourselves, the positives heavily outweigh the negatives.\n→ The protagonist is not like one you'd usually see. She's a depressed, middle aged woman who hates people and loves cats. Throughout most of the game, she remains depressed but manages to develope quite a bit in many different ways. You get to choose how to react to the events she goes through, possibly affecting the entire story, as she learns what it means to trust others, fight to live, and possibly, how to overcome the depression that's consumed her for 10 years.\n→ This entire game will definitely make you feel torn at times. It throws in characters and decisions that appeal to your human emotions, making it unlike many other games in that it's extremely difficult to go through the entire story being a ruthless, immoral character for the fun of it.\n→ There are several plot outcomes! You should save your game often so you can reload in case you want to change your mind later, since there are several places where you can change your story.\n→ The game is story driven. Some people like this, others don't. A large percentage of this game is cutscenes or dialogue and it has great gameplay when you get to it.\n→ There are many different kinds of puzzles. The game never gets repetitive and offers challenges of all difficulties, making it pretty suitable for new and veteran puzzle players alike.\n→ The art style is unique. I can't think of any other game like this one. Even though a 2D seemingly low quality game might turn one away at first, it actually fits the game incredibly well. It is so well done that you barely even notice and when you get used to playing, you will notice how detailed it is.\n→ The soundtrack is pretty cool.\n→ It's a decent length. I didn't think it was too long or too short and I was entirely satisfied when I finished the game.\n\n\nNegativeThe negatives are most definitely worth suffering for in this game. There are very few flaws and most of them are pretty easy to ignore. However, you should read some of these warnings.\n→ The game is very plot driven? Some people like this, others don't. A large percentage of this game is cutscenes or dialogue, but the gameplay itself is very immersive when you get to it.\n→ The game starts out slowly. I stopped playing after chapter 1 once, then started up again and decided to push through it. As it turns out, I just had to get through the boring intro and the game immediately picked up.\n→ While most of the voice acting is done well, some of it isn't believable and becomes quickly disinteresting.\n→ Not a lot of replay value once you've seen all the endings, unless you miss the story. It's very linear.\n→ The art style seems unappealing at first but as you continue to play, you'll realize that it fits the game's style perfectly.\n→ BE CAREFUL if you are depressed or suffer from some other mental illness, as this game contains quite a few dark themes such as gore, violence, death, some extreme language, and mental and physical illnesses. The main protagonist spends a majority of the game in a deep depression and has to go through many horrifying events, which could easily trigger emotional reactions from the player. Use caution when playing and know when to quit or take a break.\n\nI'm picky about my games, but I give this one 9.5/10. While it did have some things that could have been smoothed out, it was wonderfully written and executed and I'm extremely happy that I got to play this game, as well as recommend it to my friends. If you're still unsure whether you should buy The Cat Lady or not, put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale. It's well worth it, especially for the $3 I got it for. I would've happily paid the full price after seeing how wonderful this game is. Trust me, try it.","January 18, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harvpo/recommended/253110/","Harvpo","Harvpo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harvpo/","306 products in account","The Cat Lady is a psychological horror/adventure game where the player takes up the mantle of Susan Ashworth-- a forty-year-old manic depressive who commits suicide only to find herself returned to life (and with immortality to boot) so that she can enact the wishes of an apparitional old woman dubbed the Queen of Maggots. Susan is tasked with finding five 'parasites' (murderers) and killing them; only THEN will she be granted death. Through the course of the game, the player learns about Susan's dark history, and is introduced to a cast of deliciously flawed and fleshed-out characters. It's a somewhat inconsistent game, but it's also one of the most memorable horror titles I've ever played-- matched only by Silent Hill 2.\n\n+ The artwork is beautiful; dark, gritty, and wholly original. You'll often find yourself pausing and taking in everything the game has to offer. It's all very visceral and surreal.\n+ The music is fitting and helps maintain a consistent tone throughout the game. Most of the soundtrack is dark and ambient, but there are a few vocalized tracks by indie musicians that are well suited to their particular cutscenes.\n+ The story is engaging and refreshingly honest about adult themes.\n+ The voice acting is stellar.\n+ The puzzles aren't arbitrary, and they're neither too hard nor too easy to solve.\n+ The protagonists are well written and tragic, and you'll be invested in their stories.\n+ The controls are simple and suit the game well.\n+ No two chapters have the same gameplay.\n+ The endings are all appealing in one way or another, and there's high replay value.\n\n- The writing can be juvenile at times (particularly in Chapter 5, when Susan is taking a bath, and Chapter 2, where there's some cringeworthy dialogue about depression).\n- The gore approaches splatterhouse levels on some occasions, and it comes off as arbitrary.\n- Everything after Chapter 4 seems a bit rushed.\n- Chapter 5 feels like it was shoehorned into the game, and would be a complete throwaway if not for the section dealing with the genesis of Susan's depression.\n- The voiceover recording is a bit shoddy. Mic pops and static are pervasive.","January 3, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wouldn't risk buying it without at least watching a tiny bit of a playthrough. Cause the game is... different. For me, it's a good different, but for someone else it might not be.\n\nFirst thing's first - the artstyle. That's the thing that will hit you in the face the moment you turn the game on. It's almost completely black and white, with small coloured accents, like blood, obviously. It's 2D, kind of creepy, kind of dark and really strange.\n\nThen, there's the music. Now the music in this game is absolutely amazing. Most of it are songs by a music project named Warmer. After playing the game, I actually fell in love with Warmer and got addicted to songs like "Inside", "I have no heart", "The Will".\n\nAnd now, the most important thing - the story. That's what makes this game special. That's why it's worth trying.\n\nYou play as Susan Ashworth, a deeply depressed, lonely, suicidal cat lady. After an odd series of events you are given a brutal, dangerous mission and immortality. But does that change how unhappy Susan is? How much she hates her life? Well, you need to help Susan find a way through the mission, and decide for yourself, what is really important to her.\n\nEven though I'm sure you could call this game a horror game, it's not at all about scares. Really, it's not scary at all. This game is more about depression and loneliness than it is about murder (but it's there), blood (lot's of that too) and mystery (yup, got a bunch of that). Plus, it's filled with little puzzles.\n\nOn the downside, the story does drag out sometimes, the dialogues can be a bit too long and filled with long pauses, and well... it's different. So you have been warned.\n\nBut if you feel like playing something interesting, with a great story, amazing music and an original take on graphics and gameplay - you should try "The Cat Lady".","May 22, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are going to play the part of Susan Ashworth, The Cat Lady, who committed suicide right at the start of the visual novel. Definitely a gripping point of entry. From there on, Susan's world flirts with surrealism of life, death, and everything in between. Not convinced? Explore the human desires at their filthiest. Events that happened to Susan testify the capability and culpability of the most heinous of criminal minds. And you could only watch in horror as they happen to Susan. Is there any room to breathe at all? Yes. Susan's sarcastic wit and serendipitous friend's positivity gave some light to the darkness of Susan's world. You could feel, no, you WOULD feel for them and for the rest of humanity as well at the end of the day. The art concept is a brilliant work of noir. The blends of black and white with distinctive colours were well-executed. I thought that the juxtaposing of illustrations with real life photographs aided that surreal effect. The soundtracks and sound effects were on point. What about cats? Well, just when you think they play no greater part than to fluff up Susan's poignancy as a character, you will be surprised. The game mechanics are simple. You interact with the environment using arrow keys and the 'Enter' key. No use for the mouse at all. I do have a little beef with the save system. It does not allow you to overwrite nor delete your saves. However, it may prove to be useful that way as you may want to try different options to unlock hidden achievements or end up with different reactions/results. The choices you make matters... sometimes.","June 7, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Out of curiosity, and because there was a great sale, I picked it up....\n\n...and couldn't stop playing for hours.\n\nThis is not going to be for everyone for a few reasons:\n\n1. The psychological darkness of the game won't appeal to people looking for upbeat, shiny, unicorns and flowers.  It may resonate more with those of us that have suffered from some of the subject matter (i.e. severe depression).  There are a lot of disturbing events and imagery which I feel is essential to the story but again, if you're more butterflies-and-puppies, you may not love it.\n2. The art style is extremely unique and not traditionally "pretty" but I feel it's done well and draws the player into the scene. However, it's untraditional enough that some people might find it off-putting.\n3. The protagonist is likewise not the normal, cookie-cutter heroine and it's extremely refreshing in my opinion.  But if you're looking for a game with more eye candy, this isn't it.\n4.  The side-scrolling gameplay takes some getting used to in terms of exploration.  If you're used to playing more standard point-and-click adventure and exploration games, it will take even more getting used to.  The mouse is not used at all in the game, just arrow keys.  Nothing but arrow keys.  Even after a second playthrough to nab some achievements I missed the first time, I still bobbled the key selection once in a while.  It wasn't a problem for me, but it might turn some players off.\n\nThe game isn't expensive on a normal day, and is even better on sale, so I feel it's worth giving it a chance if you're waffling on whether to get it or not.

The game centers in Susan Ashworth, a young woman suffering from depression due to several losses in her life, her condition worsens to the point that she is about to commit suicide, and there the game unfolds.\n\nCat Lady relies on a strong absctract narrative with several noir elements. The gameplay is basically a point n' click where you use the mouse to interact with the ambient and NPC, while solving some (progressively difficult) puzzles. It is separated in a few chapters where you will get to know more and more about Susan and how she developed to become what she is now. The game story and the (awkward) characters are engaging (in their on right), as I stated is engaging, however there isn´t much exploration to do which could be a bad point for those who seek lore about the game world.\n\nWhile there is more than one ending, there isn't much to be considered between them so it can be considered an one shot game (there isn´t much things to be done in a different fashion to deserve another replay), so I recommend getting it when on sale.\n\nIt is more a philosophical experince than an adventure that might make you rethink about yourself and your values, in a positive light (or at least I hope so).\n\nI give the game a 7,5/10 due to the strong narrative and character building but the somewhat limited gameworld and interaction, therefore I recommend this game.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nLycan","April 20, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some choices which effect some of the gameplay but in the most part it is a linear story.\n\nI enjoyed the game to it's fullest and left me thinking a lot about choices I make in my own life and how it effects the people around me.\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys horror, gore and  dark stories with a passionate mystery and meaning behind them.","October 8, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is engaging and unfolds at a perfect pace.  Every piece of dialogue (and there is a lot of it) is voiced [0] and the actors give strong performances without being over the top.  All of this is tied together with a really dark atmosphere.  Every asset in this game has a detailed grittiness that sets the bleak tone.\n~puzzles\n* Not much variety.  There were two times that I got stuck because I failed to explore a particular corner of the area.  If you get frustrated, just look up a guide so that you can keep going and not this sour your playthrough.\n~audio quality\n* Most of the sound is good enough, but some of the voiceovers are staticy.\n-replayability\n* The choices you make in this game do matter and there are a few of them.

I played once and looked up the other story variations online.\n\n[0] - There was exactly one sentence that was not voiced.

There are also a few unresolved things at the end (c'mon, we KNOW Teacup isn't a normal cat), but given the nature of the story, it sort of makes sense... life isn't something you "resolve" and there's always going to be loose ends.\n\nI still wanna know more about Teacup, though.","March 10, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only issue I see is that this isn't much of a game... its much more of a conversation viewing app, where you mostly just click the very lengthy conversations along. As bad as that sounds, the voicing, ambient music, musical score, cinematography, and plot are so well done, you hardly notice.\n\nKudos to making a truly creepy game albeit a sick one :P\n\nHighly recommend to adventure fans that like a deep background story and can stomach some rough subject matter and content. The visuals look bad in walkthroughs and screenshots, but they actually serve to help deliver a great presentation for this particular game.","May 18, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harvpo/recommended/253110/","Harvpo","Harvpo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harvpo/","306 products in account","The Cat Lady is a psychological horror/adventure game where the player takes up the mantle of Susan Ashworth-- a forty-year-old manic depressive who commits suicide only to find herself returned to life (and with immortality to boot) so that she can enact the wishes of an apparitional old woman dubbed the Queen of Maggots. Susan is tasked with finding five 'parasites' (murderers) and killing them; only THEN will she be granted death. Through the course of the game, the player learns about Susan's dark history, and is introduced to a cast of deliciously flawed and fleshed-out characters. It's a somewhat inconsistent game, but it's also one of the most memorable horror titles I've ever played-- matched only by Silent Hill 2.\n\n+ The artwork is beautiful; dark, gritty, and wholly original. You'll often find yourself pausing and taking in everything the game has to offer. It's all very visceral and surreal.\n+ The music is fitting and helps maintain a consistent tone throughout the game. Most of the soundtrack is dark and ambient, but there are a few vocalized tracks by indie musicians that are well suited to their particular cutscenes.\n+ The story is engaging and refreshingly honest about adult themes.\n+ The voice acting is stellar.\n+ The puzzles aren't arbitrary, and they're neither too hard nor too easy to solve.\n+ The protagonists are well written and tragic, and you'll be invested in their stories.\n+ The controls are simple and suit the game well.\n+ No two chapters have the same gameplay.\n+ The endings are all appealing in one way or another, and there's high replay value.\n\n- The writing can be juvenile at times (particularly in Chapter 5, when Susan is taking a bath, and Chapter 2, where there's some cringeworthy dialogue about depression).\n- The gore approaches splatterhouse levels on some occasions, and it comes off as arbitrary.\n- Everything after Chapter 4 seems a bit rushed.\n- Chapter 5 feels like it was shoehorned into the game, and would be a complete throwaway if not for the section dealing with the genesis of Susan's depression.\n- The voiceover recording is a bit shoddy. Mic pops and static are pervasive.","January 3, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot is driven by emotion all wrapped up in gorey horror wrapping paper. The gameplay is fairly boring: directional keys + enter to select.

Susan moves pretty slow and you'll be doing a lot of back and forth to solve puzzles, so if you aren't patient it can be a little maddening.

It's just enough to make you quiver in fear that something is going to happen, while at the same time staying tame enough for those who might be less well suited for horror games.\n\nThis game also makes you think, and toys with your emotions. The entire game, right from the get go, focuses heavily on the concepts of suicide, life and death, and their moral and emotional implications. It tells a wonderful story, though admittedly the voice acting does leave a little bit to be desired (with a handful of the soundclips being downright grating to the ears.) However, the entire game is also captioned as well, so this is easily forgivable, at least for me.\n\nThe puzzles are entertaining and challenging enough to keep you occupied and hold your attention, while staying simple enough where you're very rarely stuck trying to figure out what to do or having to do the infamous adventure game tactic of "Use everything with everything". I myself only got stuck once or twice, and I can admittedly get pretty bad at puzzle games.\n\nThe fact that I'm even writing this review at ALL is a statement to this game's merits. I very rarely review games, let alone in such great lengths as this, unless I TRULY feel they are worth it.

I'm going to continue playing and will post with final thoughts.\n-----------------Previous impressions.\n\nSo far here is my opinion of 'The Cat Lady',\nit feels very incomplete and in many cases broken. Its hard for me to get into the story with the many technical difficulties surrounding the game, and I even disagree with the art style as it seems lazy since everything is prerendered including facial movements and actions. This is a 2d side scrolling action adventure game where you use the keyboard arrows to cycle through available options and actions.

I don't think I was supposed to complete the game and get 100% achievements in one sitting, but I accidentally did. The Cat Lady has definitely stolen a spot in my heart as one of my favorite games of all time and I don't even usually play this genre.\n\nPositivePrepare yourselves, the positives heavily outweigh the negatives.\n→ The protagonist is not like one you'd usually see. She's a depressed, middle aged woman who hates people and loves cats. Throughout most of the game, she remains depressed but manages to develope quite a bit in many different ways. You get to choose how to react to the events she goes through, possibly affecting the entire story, as she learns what it means to trust others, fight to live, and possibly, how to overcome the depression that's consumed her for 10 years.\n→ This entire game will definitely make you feel torn at times. It throws in characters and decisions that appeal to your human emotions, making it unlike many other games in that it's extremely difficult to go through the entire story being a ruthless, immoral character for the fun of it.\n→ There are several plot outcomes! You should save your game often so you can reload in case you want to change your mind later, since there are several places where you can change your story.\n→ The game is story driven. Some people like this, others don't. A large percentage of this game is cutscenes or dialogue and it has great gameplay when you get to it.\n→ There are many different kinds of puzzles. The game never gets repetitive and offers challenges of all difficulties, making it pretty suitable for new and veteran puzzle players alike.\n→ The art style is unique. I can't think of any other game like this one. Even though a 2D seemingly low quality game might turn one away at first, it actually fits the game incredibly well. It is so well done that you barely even notice and when you get used to playing, you will notice how detailed it is.\n→ The soundtrack is pretty cool.\n→ It's a decent length. I didn't think it was too long or too short and I was entirely satisfied when I finished the game.\n\n\nNegativeThe negatives are most definitely worth suffering for in this game. There are very few flaws and most of them are pretty easy to ignore. However, you should read some of these warnings.\n→ The game is very plot driven? Some people like this, others don't. A large percentage of this game is cutscenes or dialogue, but the gameplay itself is very immersive when you get to it.\n→ The game starts out slowly. I stopped playing after chapter 1 once, then started up again and decided to push through it. As it turns out, I just had to get through the boring intro and the game immediately picked up.\n→ While most of the voice acting is done well, some of it isn't believable and becomes quickly disinteresting.\n→ Not a lot of replay value once you've seen all the endings, unless you miss the story. It's very linear.\n→ The art style seems unappealing at first but as you continue to play, you'll realize that it fits the game's style perfectly.\n→ BE CAREFUL if you are depressed or suffer from some other mental illness, as this game contains quite a few dark themes such as gore, violence, death, some extreme language, and mental and physical illnesses. The main protagonist spends a majority of the game in a deep depression and has to go through many horrifying events, which could easily trigger emotional reactions from the player. Use caution when playing and know when to quit or take a break.\n\nI'm picky about my games, but I give this one 9.5/10. While it did have some things that could have been smoothed out, it was wonderfully written and executed and I'm extremely happy that I got to play this game, as well as recommend it to my friends. If you're still unsure whether you should buy The Cat Lady or not, put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale. It's well worth it, especially for the $3 I got it for. I would've happily paid the full price after seeing how wonderful this game is. Trust me, try it.","January 18, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only issue I see is that this isn't much of a game... its much more of a conversation viewing app, where you mostly just click the very lengthy conversations along. As bad as that sounds, the voicing, ambient music, musical score, cinematography, and plot are so well done, you hardly notice.\n\nKudos to making a truly creepy game albeit a sick one :P\n\nHighly recommend to adventure fans that like a deep background story and can stomach some rough subject matter and content. The visuals look bad in walkthroughs and screenshots, but they actually serve to help deliver a great presentation for this particular game.","May 18, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is also quite original and keeps you guessing til the end.\nThe atmosphere is often as surreal as are some of the situations the main character finds herself in.\nNo doubt the noir-ish style of the art work and animation which at first seemed to me to be a little um, rubbish or cheap at first soon proved its worth in this respect.\n\nIt is by design a fairly adult themed (suicide, depression, mutilation etc) point and click style game with excellent voice work but the other element that really stood out for me was the control interface. It is simple yet feels natural in its elegance - even for this type of game standard things like inventory management, movement and interaction became quite fluid after a few minutes play time. And that is using a keyboard.\n\nSimilar to the way an arcade racer feels when played with a gamepad in that you can become more absorbed in experiencing the game because there are no complex controls in the way that would take your mind away from the atmosphere as you take moments to wrestle as much with an awkward camera view or an evil unchangeable control method.\n\nThis game does not suffer with terrilble controls. Quite the opposite. Personally I sometimes try to persist or adapt if I really want to try and enjoy a paticular game, but in some cases, the occasional unchangeable control method or camera angle spawned from the depths of Hades can be  the greatest enemy encountered of all by the player and so the entire experience is destroyed, the story unfinished. (rant over lol)\n\nEven for this fairly basic style of game, the control method here should receive as much credit as any moody art assets, music or voice work.\nIf you be a fan of the genre, and like the type of game, its a definate win - win scenario.\nTry it, you wont be dissapointed.","January 29, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Murderers, rapists, arsonists… They’re the real beasts… So far from humanity they’re no longer capable of feeling compassion or guilt. They’re the ones we should really be afraid of. But whether they’re lurking in the woods… or fog… or the darkness of our cellars… Its all irrelevant. You can’t predict what happens. You can’t do anything to stop it. There is only one way… To turn into a beast yourself… And, like them, show no mercy…"\n\n"If there's one thing that Mitzi taught me, it's that you have to pick yourself up and carry on.

Instead of talking about the storyline (which is phenomenal) or the character development (you're going to love Susan Ashworth and Mitzi Hunt more and more as the game goes on) like so many other reviewers have, I'm going to talk about the impact my first playthrough had on me.\n\nI've been struggling with suicidal ideations these past couple months. Now, I don't think I would ever actually go through with it, but just being alive has felt like a huge dead when my anxiety and cynicism have been getting in the way of moving forward. Things in your head can get kind of cloudy when that happens, you know? Trying to root myself in escapism as I tend to do, I decided to try and find a decent horror game on Steam for less than $10.. and then I stumbled across this. Finding a horror game with a suicidal protagonist isn't exactly a one-in-a-million chance but when I read the synopsis it immediately stood out to me, so I bought it.\n\nThe beginning seemed pretty typical at first. Some supernatural stuff, a creepy old woman who may or may not be the Devil, a bit of subliminal messianic imagery. You know, Silent Hill kind of stuff. I thought it was interesting, but not spectacular.\n\nThen Chapter 2 happened.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, I'll mention that a good half of Chapter 2 involves filling in (most of) the blanks about Susan Ashworth's past. Stuff like her relationship with her mother and father, how she starts her mornings, what she does when she needs comfort after a difficult day, etc. Thinking nothing of it, I decided to match the answers as closely as I could to my own personality. As I did, the game proceeded to slap me right across the face with relatable feelings and put my misery into perspective. It made me stop to consider what I thought about myself, and how I had ended up in such a sorry state.\n\nPretty much every chapter of the game wound up being like this. I don't know if Remigiusz's intent was for people struggling with depression to see themselves in Susan, in fact I kind of doubt it after writing this out, but that's what happened to me. As her mood started improving my mood started improving. The game never quite stops being morose, but at the end of it all I'd re-evaluated my own outlook on life and realized that hey, I should care about myself. Even the biggest tragedies are only temporary if you work towards that light at the end of the tunnel. I'm still not the most upbeat person in the world, but after playing this game I honestly do feel like there's a point to it all.\n\nI don't mean to come off as so dramatic, I just really like this game.\n\nTL;DR: Clogged a toilet and yelled at a nurse. Also that guy who made Salad Fingers is married to himself. ALSO giant zombie cat.\n\n","April 16, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the amount of blood might be upsetting and down right morbid, it adds to the game's dark atmosphere. The story is depressing but there's light at the end of the tunnel, you just need to find it.\n\nThe things I liked most about this game are the story and the characters. The story is original and the characters have personality. Susan does not follow some stereotype but is her own person. Neither does Mitzi or any of the other characters now that I think about it. The creators were not afraid to use heavy subjects in the plot. They did so without making the game into a soap or a horror/slasher.\n\nI wouldn't go as far as saying I disliked anything because if I did I wouldn't have bought the game (I'm a bit picky). Though the visuals are not of the highest quality, they're simple but serve to add to the overall mood of the game.\n\nMy final rating is 8.5/10 for the visuals aren't high quality and the game isn't very long but it more than makes up for these things with its brilliant story and awesome characters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lotsofnope/recommended/253110/","lotsofnope","Septemus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lotsofnope/","185 products in account","Before I start writing, let me just say that this review may will get a bit emotional. Instead of talking about the storyline (which is phenomenal) or the character development (you're going to love Susan Ashworth and Mitzi Hunt more and more as the game goes on) like so many other reviewers have, I'm going to talk about the impact my first playthrough had on me.\n\nI've been struggling with suicidal ideations these past couple months. Now, I don't think I would ever actually go through with it, but just being alive has felt like a huge dead when my anxiety and cynicism have been getting in the way of moving forward. Things in your head can get kind of cloudy when that happens, you know? Trying to root myself in escapism as I tend to do, I decided to try and find a decent horror game on Steam for less than $10.. and then I stumbled across this. Finding a horror game with a suicidal protagonist isn't exactly a one-in-a-million chance but when I read the synopsis it immediately stood out to me, so I bought it.\n\nThe beginning seemed pretty typical at first. Some supernatural stuff, a creepy old woman who may or may not be the Devil, a bit of subliminal messianic imagery. You know, Silent Hill kind of stuff. I thought it was interesting, but not spectacular.\n\nThen Chapter 2 happened.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, I'll mention that a good half of Chapter 2 involves filling in (most of) the blanks about Susan Ashworth's past. Stuff like her relationship with her mother and father, how she starts her mornings, what she does when she needs comfort after a difficult day, etc. Thinking nothing of it, I decided to match the answers as closely as I could to my own personality. As I did, the game proceeded to slap me right across the face with relatable feelings and put my misery into perspective. It made me stop to consider what I thought about myself, and how I had ended up in such a sorry state.\n\nPretty much every chapter of the game wound up being like this. I don't know if Remigiusz's intent was for people struggling with depression to see themselves in Susan, in fact I kind of doubt it after writing this out, but that's what happened to me. As her mood started improving my mood started improving. The game never quite stops being morose, but at the end of it all I'd re-evaluated my own outlook on life and realized that hey, I should care about myself. Even the biggest tragedies are only temporary if you work towards that light at the end of the tunnel. I'm still not the most upbeat person in the world, but after playing this game I honestly do feel like there's a point to it all.\n\nI don't mean to come off as so dramatic, I just really like this game.\n\nTL;DR: Clogged a toilet and yelled at a nurse. Also that guy who made Salad Fingers is married to himself. ALSO giant zombie cat.\n\n","April 16, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At least, not the cheap pop-scare kind, nor the "creature is hunting you and you're alone and defenseless" kind. I never finished Amnesia, and I stay far away from games like Outlast or Slender. The Cat Lady is certainly a horror adventure: it's creepy throughout, and there's plenty of blood and gore and body horror. But the *point* of the game isn't to scare you. The horror is secondary to the story; and what a fantastic story it is. You could think of it as a sort of paranormal Kill Bill. You start the game committing suicide and getting caught in limbo. A creepy old lady says you can't die just yet, gives you immortality, and sends you back to the world of the living to murder five very evil people. It's more nuanced than it might first seem though. It's a story about depression and suicide, but also of friendship and hope. The characters are very well written and the voice acting is generally decent (the main character is thankfully very well voice-acted). If you like dark, interesting stories and don't mind some blood and guts, I would highly recommend The Cat Lady.","October 4, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here you will see how to run the game at1920x180 resolution.\n\nFrom a very long time I haven't been absorbed by adventure game. The last time was, when I played The Longest Journey. Not that I didn't play other good adventure games, but there is always one some that just suck you in and don't let you go until the end credits. I know this sounds cliché, but it's the truth. The Cat Lady is phenomenal!!! Bloody, gory, moody, brutal, but with a lot of heart and it tackles sensitive and mature subjects.\n\nI have problems with the technical side of the game. All options are in a launcher. The problem lies with the resolution – it doesn't supports 1920x1080. It stretches everything. There is a solution (link in the description), but makes the game with black side bars. That's more like it. And also the game runs with 40 FPS. All this is probably related to the engine, that was used – Adventure Game Studios.\n\nAbout the gameplay I can't say much. Typical for adventure games. Find items, solve puzzle. Here instead the mouse, you will use the keyboard. It was kinda strange at first. The thing I liked here is all puzzle have common sense, they don't have any weird soltuions. There isn't a moment that I said “How should I solve it without a guide ”!? There is one exception – the puzzle in the hospital. They are intuitive and that is why I find them kinda easy\n\nThe game starts dramatically. Our main character Susan Ashworth, decide to take her own life with bunch of pills. But this is not the end of her. She finds herself into a limbo- like place and after few puzzles, Susan reach wooden house with old lady (Queen of Maggots) sitting on the porch. She gives you second chance and grants you immortality, but in return she wants the souls of 5 “parasytes”. They are really bad people. I'm stoping here with the story, because it's the highlight of the game. Do you know that feeling, when you read a good book and you just can't put it down until you reach the final page, then you realized, that you are breathless? This is how I felt through the whole game. I “devour” greedily every scene, every word. This bizzare and sad world kept me going, I wanted to know more. The story is captivating. But without the great writing, this wouldn't be possible.\n\nMain characters are well develop. They have interesting and tragic past. You get to know them by playing through some of their memories or through dialogs. I sometimes sympathize them, other hate them. You see how their decisions to lead them to where there are now. I hope you like conversations. The game involved a lot of talking. Again the great writting helped a lot.\n\nIn a horror game the sound is maybe the most important. Here it's awesome. Oh, the sweet music. It's phenomenal! Yeah, I say that a lot, but really it is. Every single track fits great in the situation you hear it. They make me nervous, they make me calm, they make me even more invested in this grimm world.\n\nVoice acting is almost perfect. The problem is the quality of the recording. It's obvious, especially some characters, that they used regular microphone. The lines are delivered so well, just sometmes this got me out of the immersion. It's not that big deal, because most of the characters sound great.\n\nThe envoirments are great and the game oozes with atmosphere. Dark, suppressants and depressing, just like The Cat Lady and the main colors here are black, white and gray. The places you visit are really creepy. You will see a lot of disturbing and gory images. To be honest I was expecting more, but I think they were enough. I liked a lot the design of dream-like-places. Dark, surreal and they are like mirror image stuff happening “real” world of the game.\n\n“The Parasytes” you have to deal with are frightening and sick human beings. Pure psychopaths. I don't want to talk too much about them, because they are essential part of the story and saying more is a crime. You have to experience the first time meeting with them. Lastly I'll just say, they got what they deserve.\n\nGraphics are great. I can't imagine them done in a different way. Not everybody will like them. Different people, different tastes. The characters are like cardboard cutouts, mixed with real photo or pre-render backgrounds. Remind a little of graphic novel. The movement is not great, but this is part of the charm of the game. The main colors are black,white and grey, which is understandable from the leading characters point. At certain places colors will appear to emphasize and strengthen feelings, situations, mood.\n\nIf you are not into gory games, you may pass the game, but you will miss phenomenal adventure game. There are some brutal scenes, that I wasn't expecting and they shock me. I'm not against gore, but when it's done well, not just for sake of being gory. Here they are fine. The game is not about that. It's about human emotions. This is what gets me. When you are in your lowest point, you have to stand up, climb and see the world is not black, white and gray, there is other colors too. There is alwayse a reason to live and to feel alive Go now and buy it. It's wonderful piece of art. I highly recommend it.","October 14, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first time I knew it, I though this game will be a horror game. And personally, I don't too like much horror games. So, I didn't hope much from this game.\n\nBut, I gave a chance to this game and I found this game is really different than I had though. The story is (personally) good for me. The gameplay itself is decent because you need to find clues all over the places and solve the puzzle. This game is not a horror game anymore; you won't find any ghost of something else, just some strange (and a bit supernatural) events.\n\nThe graphic is doing the job right. It succeed to bring the atmosphere; you'll only find black-white color scheme will rarely other color along the game. But, there is something I dissapointed for. The graphic option isn't give me much costumization. Your graphic option will be depents on your resolution. For low-end computer, you can play it on smaller resolution only, because your graphic quality is bigger following your resolution (i.e. bigger resolution, you'll get more AA). If this game can separate the resolution and graphic quality options, then I'll be pleased.\n\nFinally, this game is recommended for you, since you are tired of other games and want to find some unoccassional game.\n\nScore: 9/10","December 11, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, some main differences: 1- there are no arbitrary puzzles. All the solutions seem to make sense, so you don't wrack your brain trying to just randomly combine any item to hopefully advance the story. And that leads us to our second main difference: the story.\n\nThe Cat Lady is a horror game that is all about creepy atmosphere, pop-up scares, and a very depressing tone of the life of a failed suicide victim, Susan Ashworth. She has been blessed (or cursed) with the inability to die, so she goes through a story of personal loathing, and getting through the pointlessness of life in general.\n\nThis title can be thought of like a mini-series about themes not often explored in media. It is thoughtful, thought-provoking, and ultimately satisfying to experience.\n\n7/10 "Good"","February 18","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The writing for the characters make them so much more real. Both Susan and her friend and roommate are such likable characters. I love that Susan is an older woman and very relatable. The environments in this game are eerie, and the music only solidifies that. Susan's voice actor is what makes the game and the Susan Ashworth character complete.\n\nIf you liked Downfall, you will love this game.

The Cat Lady deals with ideas about life in a direct fashion, and refuses to beat around the bush when it questions what it means to be alive. As I followed along with the story, which is told through an animated, interactive film, the sometimes messy dialogue [and voice acting] seemed to fade away. The writing is simply stunning. Though there are moments that I felt I had seen coming, there are far more scenarios where I couldn't have possibly thought of what happened. Remigiusz Michalski snuck some very subtle humour in the way certain characters act, and when it worked, it really worked.\n\nPraise aside, the game is not without its flaws. The controls feel clunky at times, as you browse the game's interface (and that's all you do in this game, aside from walk and listen). On top of that, the art style, though gorgeous, sometimes popped so that a bike would look like a wall, for an instance. And, as previously mentioned, the voice acting suffers from certain characters being ridiculously overreacted.\n\nThat being said, the game is $10 ($8 on sale). I more than got my moneys worth for the story told here, and would gladly play it again to make different choices when the times came.","February 11","true","36.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story presents itself as part mystery, part horror, and part LSD trip, but at its heart, it is about the steady decline of the human spirit.  The characters are broken people, trying desperately to find something worth while in their lives.  The settings are all grim crumbling areas, almost looking like low grade war zones.  The general atmosphere of *everything* feels like something old and abandoned, in various stages of decay.  However, it should be noted that the game doesn't fall victim to its own dreariness.  Much like in life, even in the worst of situations, it still manages to summon up a bit of gallows humor.  The character design may repel some people.  They look like something you would find from late 90's PC games, but I found the antiquated appearance to be a part of the charm of the whole experience.\n\nFinal verdict:  If you enjoy story based point-and-click adventure games with a bleak outlook on life, then give this a try.

It's just enough to make you quiver in fear that something is going to happen, while at the same time staying tame enough for those who might be less well suited for horror games.\n\nThis game also makes you think, and toys with your emotions. The entire game, right from the get go, focuses heavily on the concepts of suicide, life and death, and their moral and emotional implications. It tells a wonderful story, though admittedly the voice acting does leave a little bit to be desired (with a handful of the soundclips being downright grating to the ears.) However, the entire game is also captioned as well, so this is easily forgivable, at least for me.\n\nThe puzzles are entertaining and challenging enough to keep you occupied and hold your attention, while staying simple enough where you're very rarely stuck trying to figure out what to do or having to do the infamous adventure game tactic of "Use everything with everything". I myself only got stuck once or twice, and I can admittedly get pretty bad at puzzle games.\n\nThe fact that I'm even writing this review at ALL is a statement to this game's merits. I very rarely review games, let alone in such great lengths as this, unless I TRULY feel they are worth it.

I'm going to continue playing and will post with final thoughts.\n-----------------Previous impressions.\n\nSo far here is my opinion of 'The Cat Lady',\nit feels very incomplete and in many cases broken. Its hard for me to get into the story with the many technical difficulties surrounding the game, and I even disagree with the art style as it seems lazy since everything is prerendered including facial movements and actions. This is a 2d side scrolling action adventure game where you use the keyboard arrows to cycle through available options and actions.

And not in the "let's play the harp now, dear" kind of way. More like in the "This f@#king harp!!! I'll rip your strings out!!!" kind of way. It can be brutal.\n\n2) Themes: This game touches on all kinds of dark, twisted, and disturbing themes, from being turned into art, psychological torture, mutilation, poisoning, dying of cancer, and the main theme of suicide, this game has it all. Everything necessary to make you go "oh my gawd..." and remain speechless throughout.\n\n3) Replayability: There is a good amount of replayability in this game, as the longer you play into it, the more invested you absolutely will become. Decisions you make towards the end shape the entire ending in ways that will make you cry. I mean that, whole heartedly. You will cry. Even you, Mountain Man with the big biceps eating a woodchuck. Tears will fall.\n\n4) Graphics: The graphics are amazing.

It's got some fantastic ideas in there, I was skeptical about the main character however, but it may be me being a bit picky because of the range of quality in the voice acting that sometimes hit or missed for me. A couple of scenes or conversations made me think that maybe some lines needed re-writing but in truth, that's my only problem with the writing here. Susan Ashworth, as a character, as much as it pains me to say this, was not someone I as rooting for but I'm being picky. I did on a few occassions say outloud to my laptop "Why aren't you saying this?!" I'll refrine from plot spoilers but, as it is with every adventure game with a dialouge option, they won't say the bleeding obvious. A lot of hard work has gone into this and I can see that in the characters and level design. I just wish the quality of mics were even across the board, it sounds like some people did either their lines over skype or right before they went to bed.\n\nThe game play is around puzzles and logical/lateral thinking and there were a few I were stuck on but as I don't play a lot of them, I was surprised that the puzzles were fresh, solvable and quite original which made me want to see the next puzzle there, the next thing I had to do. All in all, the game has its moments where you feel tense and excited and it was a good experience. It's full of ideas, it's full of life, funnily enough, for a game about death. For me this is why I kept coming back, your experience with the character may vary but she wasn't totally unbearable to me but never had her moments where I laughed.\n\nThe sound design on this game is an incredibly mixed bag. The music is great and you'll want to listen to more of it, it'll build and it'll be effective but then just cut out when they need it to and it abruptly stops. There's one sound that plays for multiple effects, but hey, you don't play this for the sound do you? The sound is a mixed bag but the graphics and attention to the levels and story is where the most focus has gone I feel. Although hard work must have been made to record and mix all those lines of dialouge, I don't feel like it's on par at times with the game world they've created.\n\nAll in all, this is a good game, buy it. Even though I have a few negative points about it, there more production points than gameplay points. The way the game plays is solid and it never gets boring or repeats the same idea over and over again.","December 11, 2013","true","11.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art is amazing and mixes a couple styles together very well, and the music and sound is also very very well done and gets you in the mood. The story is just fantastic, alot of things that needed to be well talked about that normally arn't, or are taken lightly or made fun of (IE raape, mental illness, suicide ect) Many people find these things as butts of jokes but this story takes it serious, and shows that susan is strong and does have purpose, it is very conflicting. You feel for her and you want to be her friend, you want to show her she does have power and can do things right. It plays with the mystery of death, and self hate and also the loneliness, in some ways it makes some people probably feel better, it gives you a understanding how people with major mental problems think, and it lets you relate. Everyone at one point just has felt, well like nothing is right, but sadly some people are just built this way or just ignored and they go for death. This story helps a bit I am sure for power, it shows and helps you relate with such a good character that you get motivated that , yes you do have power and you can get through this type of feeling. To me this game just hit home for so many things, I love that it hit notes with not talked about things that really happen and stuff, but also just the understanding and non mocking form of story, it is serious and not for the faint of heart or someone that does not nor doesn't wish to understand others thinking. I love that is supernatural, but also down to earth it just is so unique and amazing nothing comes close to this, it is by far my favorite story game I ever touched, and it was moving and thoughtful and I would say buy it to anyone who loves stories, and even learning a bit, or understanding. Do not buy if you don't understand things and the seriousness of mental illness, ♥♥♥♥, or anything that isn't happy you will hate this. Because this is to me the most serious story I ever really "read or played" in my eyes, becasue of the story and characters and even the music. This is a 10/10 Good job HG I hope to see something great like this again. Not that it can get much better.","March 27, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timtreachery/recommended/253110/","timtreachery","Dontfeedthecode","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timtreachery/","223 products in account","The Cat Lady succeeds in engrossing you where so many AAA titles have failed in the past in a way in which baffles and confuses me even an hour after finishing the game. It's one of those rare experiences akin to Gone Home that has a snowball effect when it comes to character and plot development, taking you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions that seems to only build on itself faster by the minute as it comes to what I considered a timely conclusion.\n\nAnother aspect of this game that reminded me of Gone Home was how it managed to make me somehow relate and feel connected to the protagonist, even though I myself am a 27 year old male with a fairly positive outlook on life and the character is a middle aged woman with rather sad case of depression (for good reason as you will find out later in the game). Adding to its ambiance is an exceptional soundtrack, that while being a bit rough around the edges is so in such a way that lends itself to the art style of the game.\n\nThe way in which the plot revealed her background story kept me intrigued, and is delivered in such a way that you are thrown into a situation wondering "what the hell just happened" but don't have to wait too long to fill in the gaps and arrive at the "Aha!" moment.\n\nThe game is obviously not without its quirks, many times I was presented with duplicated voice loops and the setup utility/screen resolution options are largely useless, however none of these problems ruined the atmosphere for me. I personally would have like the use of the mouse in the save menu and did have the game crash once during my play through.\n\nIn summary I would recommend this game to anyone that considers a great video game experience to be more than just a sum of its parts, what the developers have managed to do with an outdated game engine, low res graphics and a keyboard only control scheme has somehow evolved into one of the best gaming experiences I've had in my life.","December 22, 2013","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/majidae/recommended/253110/","majidae","oh shit whaddup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/majidae/","161 products in account","The Cat Lady tells the tale of Susan Ashworth, a woman pushed to suicide by the events of her life. However, once dead, she meets up with a mysterious figure called the Queen of Maggots who has bigger plans for Susan... namely, pitting her against five serial killers, aka Parasites. Susan really has no choice in the matter: in fact, she cannot die until she kills all of the Parasites. With that, The Cat Lady begins, a macabre little game that is surprisingly touching while still being spooky.\n\nAbove all else, The Cat Lady's art style is one of its best features. Objects are put together in a collage-like style, with color used to set the mood (and often effectively). Combined with the soundtrack, which ranges from death metal(?) to eerie creaking, breathing and heartbeats, it's all too easy to set the average player on edge for some of the scarier scenes. Make no mistake, this game doesn't rely on jumpscares to get your pulse racing. Rather, your own unsettled nature becomes your own worst enemy. For a game with an unkillable protagonist, still making a player scared is quite an accomplishment.\n\nStill, those worried about the scariness shouldn't pass up this game. Underneath the 'horror' aspect is a moving story about death, depression, and the various ways of coping with both. Both Susan and sidekick Mitzi are highly empathetic characters and it won't take most players long to get attached to both of them. The game does suffer from a few moments of melodrama, but they're short and easily forgotten.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a story driven game with plenty of the macabre, and you don't mind a little horror mixed in, The Cat Lady might just be for you. And if not... pick it up anyways.","December 23, 2013","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It’s that creeping kind of horror that manages to crawl into your veins uninvited, residing in your head rather than jumping out of the shadows, flailing its limbs. It’s ruthlessly grim; it knows how to turn your stomach, to dread your next discovery. It stirs up human misery and then presents you with the grime that settles at the bottom. Then, in the midst of melancholy, it touches on unexpected friendship, of escaping the gloom. It has Susan claw and scratch and struggle towards normalcy once though unobtainable. It slowly bends her towards the light.\n\nFull review - http://www.honestgamers.com/12153/pc/the-cat-lady/review.html","December 31, 2013","true","16.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When I first heard of it, I identified a few primary adjectives that applied to it: dark, horror, atmospheric, indie, adventure, interesting.  The "interesting" bit was why I decided to torrent it out of a casual curiosity.  I bought it after having completed it, because it absolutely deserves it.\n\nIf you have not yet watched the game's trailer, then I highly recommned it before proceeding in this review in order to really get a feel for the game's style and theme.  After having seen the trailer, I was immediately interested, but the game's tremendously heavy tone was a little worrisome at first.  Of course, it was one of things that drew me to it in the first place, but at the same time one of my greatest fears for the game was that it would end up being an overly grimdark puddle of emo for emo's sake.  Thankfully, my concerns were completely unfounded as the game surprised me with the depth and dynamic qualities of its story and characters.  The quality of the game's protagonists is incredible.  They feel tremendously real despite their extreme circumstances and their growth and development as characters is one of my very favourite things about the game.\n\nThe art and music are also both consistently top-rate.  Some may find the paper-cutout animation style a bit off-putting, thinking it primitive, but I could not disagree more.  Its brilliance lies in how beautifully it expresses the game's core themes.  The player character, Susan Ashworth, is a sufferer of chronic, even suicidal, depression.  To her, the world is a dark, colourless place and people are hated reminders of her own prison of sorrow and alienation.  The game's bleak depictions of environments and unnatural, eerily-jerking character animations express this perfectly.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is simply superb and the game does an incredible job of using music to convey emotion and intensity within the narrative.  It doesn't serve as a backdrop to fill dead air as it so often does in other games, but really, truly contributes to the strength of the narrative in wonderful ways.\n\nThe only area I honestly think the game could be improved is the audio-recording quality for one or two of the minor characters.  If you have read other reviews, this issue will surely have caught your attention, but don't let its significance become overstated.  The main characters are voiced and recorded expertly and the overall game really isn't detracted from by these few technical failings.  Once you have played the game, you will think back on the wonderfully realized characters, moving story and consistently powerful conveyance of theme and emotion, not the odd technical hiccup of inadequate recording equipment.\n","June 27, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The trailer really sold me and I was not in the least disappointed. The story is artful and dark, with bouts of heavy gore, prepare yourself for that; sometimes SO dark I had to push away for a little break during play. I pretty much played on and off for hours on end, the game does not bore. The only real labor, I suppose, was the pacing...characters walk slow, react slow, and  there are many cut scenes, etc. You get used to it, I felt like it immersed me more in the world-forced me to slow down and take notice, pay attention to the story. I wasn't expecting that. To get so involved. There is a definite chance you will get caught up and not be able to stop til you reach the end. And the end, she was a beauty.\nReplay value may be somewhat low, at least for me. Due to the depth of story, I don't think I can just pick it up and put it down whenever...its not say a mindless, good times kinda game. Missing achievements may warrant play from saved sections of the game, but chance of full play through (at least more than twice-for varying endings) may be slim. Proud to have played and experienced it, recommend it highly. Also, the soundtrack is badass.\n","June 30, 2014","true","26.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Make no mistake though, this game does *not* hold back, and this confronting nature is what makes it so memorable.\n\nOn the one hand, The Cat Lady is one of the most disturbing games I have ever played.

For all of the horrific things in this game's world, the game is surprisingly at its most powerful during its quiet moments. The plot, characters, dialogue and visuals all tie together to explore serious topics: depression, suicide, loss, loneliness.\n\nYou'll feel your character grow as you make choices throughout this game,  and you'll witness your character's growth take centre stage for the story- and that is a very rare thing indeed.

They managed to draw you in and be creepy without resorting to jump scares and other lame tactics. If I were to give it one criticism it would be some of the voice acting was not so great. Also some of vocal recording sounded odd, like they were recording in a bathtub. I definitely think this is worth getting if you are into being creeped out now and then.","December 21, 2013","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timtreachery/recommended/253110/","timtreachery","Dontfeedthecode","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timtreachery/","223 products in account","The Cat Lady succeeds in engrossing you where so many AAA titles have failed in the past in a way in which baffles and confuses me even an hour after finishing the game. It's one of those rare experiences akin to Gone Home that has a snowball effect when it comes to character and plot development, taking you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions that seems to only build on itself faster by the minute as it comes to what I considered a timely conclusion.\n\nAnother aspect of this game that reminded me of Gone Home was how it managed to make me somehow relate and feel connected to the protagonist, even though I myself am a 27 year old male with a fairly positive outlook on life and the character is a middle aged woman with rather sad case of depression (for good reason as you will find out later in the game). Adding to its ambiance is an exceptional soundtrack, that while being a bit rough around the edges is so in such a way that lends itself to the art style of the game.\n\nThe way in which the plot revealed her background story kept me intrigued, and is delivered in such a way that you are thrown into a situation wondering "what the hell just happened" but don't have to wait too long to fill in the gaps and arrive at the "Aha!" moment.\n\nThe game is obviously not without its quirks, many times I was presented with duplicated voice loops and the setup utility/screen resolution options are largely useless, however none of these problems ruined the atmosphere for me. I personally would have like the use of the mouse in the save menu and did have the game crash once during my play through.\n\nIn summary I would recommend this game to anyone that considers a great video game experience to be more than just a sum of its parts, what the developers have managed to do with an outdated game engine, low res graphics and a keyboard only control scheme has somehow evolved into one of the best gaming experiences I've had in my life.","December 22, 2013","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/majidae/recommended/253110/","majidae","oh shit whaddup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/majidae/","161 products in account","The Cat Lady tells the tale of Susan Ashworth, a woman pushed to suicide by the events of her life. However, once dead, she meets up with a mysterious figure called the Queen of Maggots who has bigger plans for Susan... namely, pitting her against five serial killers, aka Parasites. Susan really has no choice in the matter: in fact, she cannot die until she kills all of the Parasites. With that, The Cat Lady begins, a macabre little game that is surprisingly touching while still being spooky.\n\nAbove all else, The Cat Lady's art style is one of its best features. Objects are put together in a collage-like style, with color used to set the mood (and often effectively). Combined with the soundtrack, which ranges from death metal(?) to eerie creaking, breathing and heartbeats, it's all too easy to set the average player on edge for some of the scarier scenes. Make no mistake, this game doesn't rely on jumpscares to get your pulse racing. Rather, your own unsettled nature becomes your own worst enemy. For a game with an unkillable protagonist, still making a player scared is quite an accomplishment.\n\nStill, those worried about the scariness shouldn't pass up this game. Underneath the 'horror' aspect is a moving story about death, depression, and the various ways of coping with both. Both Susan and sidekick Mitzi are highly empathetic characters and it won't take most players long to get attached to both of them. The game does suffer from a few moments of melodrama, but they're short and easily forgotten.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a story driven game with plenty of the macabre, and you don't mind a little horror mixed in, The Cat Lady might just be for you. And if not... pick it up anyways.","December 23, 2013","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It’s that creeping kind of horror that manages to crawl into your veins uninvited, residing in your head rather than jumping out of the shadows, flailing its limbs. It’s ruthlessly grim; it knows how to turn your stomach, to dread your next discovery. It stirs up human misery and then presents you with the grime that settles at the bottom. Then, in the midst of melancholy, it touches on unexpected friendship, of escaping the gloom. It has Susan claw and scratch and struggle towards normalcy once though unobtainable.

The game has a mature and well-written story with a genuinely likeable (and in some cases despicable) cast of characters, and the majority of the voice acting is excellent. The Cat Lady also features an unusual and refreshing visual style which uses a sparse colour palette and even though it sometimes doesn't look very nice I believe this is intentional choice by the artist. The game also has an excellent soundtrack that perfect compliments they different areas of the game.\n\nThe game, however, is not perfect. For some reason every save creates a new save slot, preventing one playthrough from using just one save slot. The game also lags slightly and occasionally crashes, although this may just be because my computer isn't very very strong. There are a few minor typos throughout, but nothing that detracts from the experience.\n\nOverall, I would recommend The Cat Lady for anyone look for a good story or horror experience in a game, or who just wants to try something different.","December 7, 2013","true","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Story, Characters, Music. And even the art style is beyond that of most games today. For a game that was cheaper to make compared to something like Beyond: two souls (which can't be compared fully) The Cat Lady is a becon of hope that games can be 2d and have an extreame amount of deep story and characters. Not to mention humor.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who is into such deep storylines and has a love for loveable characters, because you won't be disappointed.\n\nIt has a few scares along the way but if you can brave through them. The experience its self is breath taking. It yields such a great feeling of accomplishment when a puzzle is completed and progress to the main story.  I personaly did not think i would grow to love it as i do now. But you have to play it or watch it on youtube to fully grasp how great it is. However i do believe playing it is just as good as watching it.\n\nAnd those who continue to play through it will be rewarded by a special secret morle of the story which i think everyone on the internet can honestly relate to :) i won't spoil that but its worth the play to hear it :).\n\nSo i will end my review saying i would give the cat lady 10/10\n\nThere has been noting i have liked more then this for such a long time, its weird, warming, creepy and even disturbing.

Most people had heard about this game once big youtubers played it and with the sudden interest, it gained enough attention to get greenlit on steam. One thing that bothered me watching them play is that I feel they didn't take the game seriously.\n\nThe Cat Lady is about Susan Ashworth, a woman suffering from depression who has decided to commit suicide. Susan is given a second chance (and immortality at that) to find a reason to live, but along the way she will meet "parasites", people who pretty much make you lose faith in humanity and are the most disgusting individuals. It is Susan's job to eliminate those parasites.\n\nThe game is made by a developer known for dark and twisted games. That style fits perfectly here. A word of caution if you did not look at the rating, there are very mature themes and sensetive material which may trigger some people. Please keep that in mind before purchasing. At times it can be hard.\n\nThe gameplay is basic like a lot of adventure games for the pc along with puzzles.\n\nNow as for the story, it really hit home for me. As one who has struggled with depression and suicide before, I really synced with Susan and was absorbed with her tale. I wanted the best for her and I shared in her hatred of the parasites. I didn't want to stop playing until the very end. The game takes maybe 5-7 hours to finish, but keep in mind there are multiple endings and multiple choises for most situations. I have replayed several times.\n\nI have recommended this game before to friends who didn't understand depression and how it affects someone to give them an idea. You see the suffering, the negativity, the toll it takes on someone and how it can affect their life. It can be an eye opening experience.\n\nAnd I must say at the end at the final screen, I cried. I will not spoil it, but it really resonates and the end made the entire experience worth it.

In a dream-like world, it's quite the long grass sways in the wind. You see a pile up of crashed vehicles, you head towards it, go to the ambulance, open the door. It's you. You're in the ambulance. You start to panic, and lift the key on a necklace off your own neck. You approach a woman sitting on a porch, and at this point, I think it's up to you to\nfind out what happens next!\n\nIt's an amazing horror game, and I'm sure everyone has heard of it. I highly recommend it to anyone who ever feels that they have nothing to live for, this will show you what people will go through to help others. Pick up this game, play it, love it. Enjoy the story. Enjoy your life.","November 13, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Mitzi is a ray of sunshine, and I  ship them. Susan and Mitzi, that is. While Susan is living and can't stop thinking about death, Mitzi, on the other hand, is dying and dreams about life. They complete each other.\nI am not a fan of horror, since I'm not brave enough. But I wanted to play this beaut so badly, and now I'm proud of myself that I didn't give up on this masterpiece. This game is really inspiring. It doesn't tell you the beautiful lies about oh-so-sweet-life. The story tells you the sad truth about life. How life can break people. How it can twist their minds. It's easy to go insane, lose all your hope and push people away because you're scared of trusting them. I have trust issues and I bet that I'm not the only one who can relate. I was so suspicious of Mitzi before. I'm glad she wasn't one of the maggots. People take chances every time they decide to trust somebody. If Susan wasn't ready to take that risk, she wouldn't have learned anything from this. The ending is as real as it might get, so I'm not sad about it at all. After all, it's not just a tale. Susan is smart, she won't lose herself again. Not after she was lucky to meet such a great friend as Mitzi. Now, I'm not saying that she'll live in happiness till the end of her days. It's only the beginning. She has become stronger and she stopped running away from her past. She accepted the fact that the future is in her hands.\nI really like the music, by the way.","October 2, 2014","true","29.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Suicide is not the end.\n\n\nImagine your life in it's darkest moments, trapped in a bleak, meaningless circle of dead ends and false hope. You wake up every day, only to realize it will be the same as yesterday. Only to realize that the life you have been living for the last ten years means nothing anymore. You have no friends, you have nothing to motivate you, and you have no one to care about you. Happiness now seems like a dark puddle you sometimes see your face in on a rainy day, stripped of any emotion.\n\nYou think to yourself:  This is it. I am not worth anything to this world. Thanks for nothing. Goodbye.	  So, that evening, as you prepare for your last night on this planet, you reflect on your past - who you've hurt, what you regret, the mistakes you made and wanted to change. You come to the conclusion that the world is not meant for you. You are not meant for it. Dying is now your only friend. It tempts you, haunts you, sings to you. You give in once you see the sleeping pills. All thirty four of them. Swallowed. In moments you can no longer see the dim lights of your apartment. You fade, in a blur, out of reality. A moment later, you vanish. You have killed yourself. No one will miss you. No one will care...\n\n\n\n. . .But. What if you were offered a second chance? A chance, not to exact revenge on the people you hate most, but to change your very life and it's purpose. What if someone offered you the keys to fulfill what's been missing in your life. To truly find the happiness you once held, long ago, in those brighter, long forgotten days.  What if your most darkest, ugliest hatred gave you immortality? In exchange for death?\n\nYou think this over. Question the morality of the offer. What have you got to live for anyway? Why would this... "person", so to speak, even give this type of chance to someone as pathetic as you? As worthless and miserable and unforgiving as you? After all, YOU were the one who took those pills to end the torment and suffering, to be free of the hostile pain that has swelled inside you for so long. Why even bother? Considering the fact that you are already dead, and that you probably won't be given another chance like this, you don't have a choice. Immortality does have it's price. But that's not why you accept. You hunger to kill these five people, to end their reign of terror upon the mortal realm, to make them pay for the horror they have caused others... People like you.\n\nYou accept this strange woman's offer, doubting everything she even says, but somehow knowing that killing those five people will somehow solve everything that has plagued your life. You feel eagerness tingling inside you for the first time in years - a yearning to actually do something good, something that will help the world and regain your sense of purpose. You feel reborn again. Finally, you have a purpose. A reason to continue living. A call to action.\n\nNow it is time to find those five people. To confront them for who they really are.

The engine is absurdly antiquated, clunky and unstable. The sound mixing is at times amateurish.  It's a point-and-click adventure without the point and clicking, as all interactions are done using the keyboard's arrow keys and space bar.  The game also runs at 800x600.\n\nCreatively, though—artistically—The Cat Lady is wonderful.  Well, wonderful may be the wrong word.  This is grindhouse horror.  Bloody imagery, rusted machinery and deprecated rooms accompany its muted tones and grim environment.  Nothing's 'wonderful' in Susan Ashworth's world, a fact that leads the protagonist to her suicide attempt in the game's introduction.\n\nNo, the Cat Lady isn't wonderful, per se.  It's captivating, provocative and memorable.  It's also dark, unrelenting and austere.  That's usually how it is for sufferers of depression.  That's how it is for Susan.  But as she drifts throughout her despair, the story provides her with the ability to put matters into her own hands—whether she likes it or not.\n\nThe Cat Lady is a worthwhile, fantastic experience if story-driven horror/adventure calls out to you.  Though its design is decidedly rough around the edges, its vision and its story do make up for it.  Those rough edges are nevertheless a shame, as they diminish what I feel could have otherwise been a masterpiece of its genre.","December 12, 2013","true","7.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Going into this I didn't really know what to expect. The Indie/horror tags sort of... drew me in. I'm very interested in atmospheric games and independent developers tend to either hit the ball out of the park or make a jump scare induced piece of crap. This game was not only satisfying, but very deep and thought provoking at times which is something I don't often expect in games that aren't made by well-known people. The atmosphere is great, the art style is a nice change and it's so simple. The puzzles are odd at times but it's nothing that is impossible to solve. Just search everything twice and attempt an item on everything and you'll do just fine. My only critique would be that, for a game that seems to center around making your own choices (seen throughout the achievements and conflicts in game), your choices don't seem to have any real consequences or impact. Which is a real shame because it made the game seem a lot less like I had control and more like it was playing itself at times.

You're playing as Susan Ashworth, a depressed middle-aged woman who tries to commit suicide by swallowing a bunch of pills...

It is kinda gory and it has a depressing and a very.. very dark and morbid atmosphere.\nYou may have to get used to the visuals and controls at the beginning but it fits the game perfectly.\nThe story is strong. But what really made me love and appreciate this game is how accurately and perfectly it describes how it feels to suffer from depression. If you have ever experienced depression this game and Susan's character will probably bring back some memories and make you tear up. The story had me crying so many times, it's a rare thing when a game can actually touch your heart and emotions.\nIt is a horror game but without relying on jumpscares or monsters. The horror comes in pure story form.\nWith that being said, this won't be a game I would recommend to everyone. It doesn't have much gameplay and there is A LOT of reading involved. If you're not into that kinda stuff you will not enjoy this game.\nBut like I said..

An emotional exploration of depression. 8/10.\n\nThe Cat Lady is an introspective adventure game that follows a suicidal woman given the burden of immortality by an eldritch queen of maggots. The protagonist, Susan Ashworth, is forced to rid England of an array of serial killers, herein referred to as "parasites," so that she can be given the opportunity to die. The journey to end their lives has our heroine interacting with a constellation of characters who embody philosophical insight on the human condition, and the plight of the chronically, fatally, and/or mentally ill. The puzzles range from boringly simple, such as showing the player a pattern and asking them to repeat it, to artificially confusing, as in the infamous tornado summoning ritual from Castlevania II. Still, many puzzles balance level design and game mechanics well enough to produce a fun challenge. The art is good; although I may have my issues with the way the director chose to balance monochrome with color, the game overall encapsulates a memorable, pretty aesthetic.\n\nThe cast is effectively written and admirably layered. In The Cat Lady, we see various aspects of Susan and a handful of supporting characters. Even the parasites, who are disappointingly one-dimensional, offer iconic personalities and well-constructed allegory.\n\nHowever, the one-dimensionality of the parasites brings me to a critical flaw of this game's rhetoric: in order to achieve sympathy for depressed people, the director throws psychotic people under the bus. Instead of purporting the validity of mentally ill lives, the game separates mental illnesses into good (potentially self-destructive) and bad (potentially externally destructive), suggesting that people with mood disorders belong to the former category, and that people with violent psychosis belong to the latter. Bear in mind the ableist demeanor of the game should you choose to buy it.\n\nAll things considered, I recommend this game. It may have its flaws, but its pros do outweigh its cons. If you suffer from depression or a similar affliction, I doubly recommend it.","October 25, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You get to play Susan, a woman who attempted suicide and through some bizzare event got the superpower of immortality as she goes on to kill serial killers.\n\nWhile the plot in itself might not sound that strong, the level of detail with which the events are detailed is amazing and truly realistic. The characters are quite believable in what they do and make you either love or hate them according to their actions and what they say, so the game does a fantastic job in immersing the player in it. In the end, due to this level of detail the story is saved and becomes rather interesting. The element of danger and the plot twists really complete this experience.\n\nThe graphics are not amazing, but this is a more of a 2d horror game after all. There is gore however and some nudity, so be prepared. Especially for gore, which is all over the place. So the game is 18+ (though we know you won't care about this even if you were under 18, isn't that right?)\nIn terms of sounds and music, I belive they fit with the theme of the story and the music usually starts at the right time and only helps you get into the story even more.\n\nOverall, The Cat Lady shows an attention to details and an interesting story due to said details. This makes it a good game worth buying.\n","December 26, 2013","true","8.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A dreamworld mechanic similar to the beloved "The Longest Journey" and other similar 2D puzzle story games with a unique setting and amazing soundtrack. Mature audiences recommended only. At first you may question the games ability to draw you in with the simplified design but the more you play the more you will want to see the outcome. There are a few multiple ending variations for the completionist players out there. There are no obvious bugs or issues and the interface is simple but does not detract from the gameplay.","January 5, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/remsyk/recommended/253110/","remsyk","Remsyk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/remsyk/","221 products in account","This game is dark. Really, really dark, and I love it.\n\nThe Cat Lady follows the story of Susan Ashworth, a woman who lives alone in an old, rundown flat. Right from the beginning, this game takes a dark turn. The game begins with Susan committing suicide, and as far as you're know, she succeeds. She does survive the attempt, but from that point on, nothing really seems to go her way.\n\nThe game follows Susan as she tries to cope with her seemingly crushing depression and hopelessness. There are many times when it's hard to differentiate between what's real and what's a seeming dream state. Time and time again she is faced against people who embody the worst of humanity, whether it's someone's insane idea of art, cannibalism, beauty, power over another's life, or how life just isn't fair. There were times when I felt uncomfortable or squeamish. Even with the slightly twisted and not-quite-right art style, I found it to be a bad idea to eat while playing this game. The brightest part of the game is easily Mitzi, but even that is too short.\n\nThe art style and music only emphasize the psychological effect of the game. The game is primarily black and grey and most colors are muted at best, if present at all. The colors are bright only to emphasize some horror or gruesome scene, such as blood, a person's eyes, or to highlight an important decision. The music intensifies the atmosphere, and like any good horror/suspense game, emphasizes events or actions with appropriate songs. The stranger the event, the more demented and twisted the music becomes; complete a puzzle or unlock a door, the music seems to become more uplifting and bright; assemble a weapon to punish the ones who have hurt you, and the music takes a sinister tone.\n\nOverall, this is a dark game that focuses on mature themes that may put off a few people. I would heed the 18+ warning at the beginning of the game. There are lots of rather disturbing scenes involving killing, many forms of mutilated corpses, disturbing images, and torture. However, it is definitely worth a play through, if only to get a glimpse into the psyche of the insane.\n","January 21, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My first impression was horrible.. it has that really gloomy dark air about it, the main character is not very attractive (both physically and mentally). Then there's this mysterious old lady called Queen of Maggots appearing out of nowhere and offered something too hard for reason to accept.

It has it's minor flaws and I would not say it's for everybody but it's most definately still great.\n\nThe music is ordinary and the interface is below average at best. The art is mediocre and the animations are just plain laughable. However, rising out of this morass are a story and central character so good that you start to see this game as a glittering diamond from a dull bit of coal.\n\nSusan Ashworth struggles with depression, isolation and is recovering from a suicide attempt.  While in a limbo/bardo state of consciousness, she meets a harbinger-of-woe type figure that warns her of coming tribulations. She returns to life to face these obstacles with a very unique power; she cannot die. The game then unfolds as she meets these adversities as she struggles with ongoing depression and the dark events that somehow plague her. Susan also eventually befriends another character, Mitzi. Mitzi has her own crosses to bear and their two destinies dramatically entwine as they share a part of each others burden.\n\nYou may think that being unable to die would make a central character seem omnipotent and render a game unchallenging but this is NOT the case. It's true that the puzzles in this game aren't particularly taxing but it's unlikely you'll play the game perfectly the first time and Susan will still suffer. Oh, she'll suffer. Likewise, you may think that a game which deals with such topics as murder, isolation, bitterness, loss, domestic disputes, sadism, addiction etc would be a downer. Again, it's NOT. This game deftly walks such a fine line.\n\nMuch of this game entails a lot of storytelling, flashbacks and lots and lots of dialogue. This, coupled with Susan's occasional forays into deathless states, results in some very non-linear story and gameplay. This is why I would warn some players off this game. Some gamers just want constant action and thrills and spills. They should avoid this one as they'll find it slow and uninteresting (it's their loss).\n\nUltimately, this is a game that examines some of the darkest aspects of humanity yet leaves us feeling optimistic. It tackles difficult subjects such as depression and it's ramifications hopefully and realistically. It's refreshing to play a character that's so flawed and heavily burdened. It's also rewarding to play such a character who's capable of learning and positive growth; friendship can overcome isolation and hope can trump despair. It's no wonder that so many people (those who suffer depression/isolation and those who don't) have responded to this game so positively. I am full of admiration for its creator and regard this game as something of a groundbreaking achievement.","January 5, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is dark and twisted. The humor is twisted also. It's got all of the classic horror elements... Moths, bare light bulbs dangling from fixtures, black and white/noir environments, maggots, etc. The dialogue is pretty varied, but always interesting. The puzzles and events are not annoying or tedious, and are entertaining enough as well. The story seems pretty linear. Choices don't seem to lead to long-lasting changes, they just trigger different cutscenes and replies that shortly follow, but it's fine.\n\nOverall it's a really good game. The art style is... Interesting, a mix of photos/photomanipulation/drawing. It does a good job of creating environments that look both real (because of photos of real objects) and fake (due to odd arrangements and manipulation) at the same time, which is often disturbing.\n\nThe only major weak point is the character animation, which is a bit odd at times - sort of contorted cardboard puppet-like stuff going on. Usually it's pretty good and this is not too noticeable, but during long dialogue scenes with lots of back and fourth it can be a bit much. The UI is also a little weak, limited to up down left right and enter, which usually gets the job done. However, character movement sometimes interferes with item selection, which can be annoying.","January 7, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/recommended/253110/","Luna_Nyx","♥ Gia ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/","398 products in account","Wow. This game, is just amazing. It's one of those games that takes you for a ride on the emotional rollercoaster. What is "The Cat Lady" exactly? When I first got this game, I wasn't really surprised, even the name was kinda plain for me, didn't really catch my attention. I was expecting some kind of survival horror 2-D game like The Lone Survivor, but I was wrong. It's more like....It feels like Clock Tower, for example.\n\nThe cat lady is like one of those old point and click games, minus the pointing and clicking, because you move around and interact with stuff using your keyboard. It's not quite a survival horror game like I thought, it's got it's scary parts, but I wouldn't go as far to call it like that. It feels more like a psychological kind of game. And man, it doesn't fail at that.\n\nYou are Susan Ashworth, a lonely, severely depressed woman who tried to commit suicide at the beggining of the game. As you progress, you'll find out why, and what made her feel like she did.\n\nNow, let's talk about the points of this game.\n\n+ The visuals. The graphics are gritty, almost comic like, they are pretty good, and most of the time, the atmosphere and the backgrounds are haunting, dark and scary, or just plain depresing with lots of gray and black. That's something I love!\n\n+ The music is amazing. You get both instrumental songs, and songs with lyrics that are haunting and sorrowful. The whole soundtrack of this game is definitely worth it, you should give it a try even if you don't play the game.\n\n+ The plot, characters, and character development. As I said before, it's one of those emotional rollercoaster kind of games, sometimes you can even feel the depression and loneliness of the main character, it makes you think about suicide, not as in killing yourself, it makes you think about suicide as in why it happens, what drives somebody to try to take his or her own life, and what makes somebody cling to life with a smile on their face. I don't wanna spoil anything, but I just wanna say that this was top notch.\n\n+ Voice Acting. It's pretty damn good, or at least, so I think. It's quite soothing at times, emotional at others.\n\n+ The endings. Powerful enough, even if they were mostly text based in the form of a last narration.\n\n- To be fair, I encountered a few technical issues now and then. For example, (correct me if I'm wrong), you can't overwrite save files, so, I had saves like "Save 1, Save 2, Save 3", so on, and so on 'til 30 or so. Also, I encountered some kind of issue, I inspected something, snatched a knife, accidentally inspected it again, and it made my game crash. I didn't save, so I had to backtrack all the way to that point again. It isn't really disruptive, if you don't intentionally or accidentally inspect certain items twice.\n\n- It seems like you cannot change the resolution. (Correct me if I'm wrong)\n\n- This game suffers from some framerate issues, that are only worsened by the fog in some parts of the game. Most of the time, it's just mild FPS lag, nothing too bad. BUT, there comes a point where you are outside of your apartment with fog all around it. My god. The framerates dropped so bad, that something that would be like 1 minute long took me like 5 or so. Dead serious. Thank goodness, it only happened at that specific point of the game on chapter 3? If I'm correct?\n\nAll in all, this game is definitely worth it, it's not particularly challenging, other than basic problem solving skills most of the time, and the plot and plot twists are amazing. Try it for yourself, if you are into games like this, perhaps like clock tower, you won't be dissapointed.","March 4, 2015","true","16.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melbee42/recommended/253110/","melbee42","MelBee42","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melbee42/","417 products in account","It's incredibly hard to do this game justice by trying to describe it in a review, but I will say this... this game is amazing. It's original, disturbing, full of sadness and at times, terrifying. I don't think I've ever played anything like it before and in terms of story and experience/emotional connection, it is one of the best I have ever played. And I've played a lot of games.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic as well.\n\nIt's definitely not for everyone though - some won't like the very dark subject matter or the violence. And the graphics are - well, sometimes they work perfectly to create an original, twisted atmosphere - but the animations are not great to say the least. The actual gameplay mechanics are extremely basic - it's kind of a 'point and click' game where you actually can't point and click (it's keyboard only - basically you just use the arrow keys and enter to move, select and interact). I've noticed a few reviews mentioning bugs and crashes but I have to say, I didn't encounter any. The puzzles are OK - definitely logical, and pretty simple (which I guess can be either a good or a bad thing depending on what you want from a game). The voice acting is somewhat hit and miss.\n\nDespite its shortcomings however, the story and characters absolutely carry it through. From the moment I started playing it grabbed my attention with its grim beginning (as it happens right at the very start of the game before you even do anything, I don't think it would be a spoiler to say that it starts with the main character's suicide note) and played, captivated, right through to the end without stopping, It's rare that a game compels me this much. It's rare that a game makes me feel in the way that this did. And I won't forget it.\n\nSo much love has clearly gone into this game. Get it, and experience it.\n\n","July 25, 2015","true","20.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A game that will have a more decisive impact on anyone who has seriously thought about suicide before in their lifetime.)\n\nThe Cat Lady.  It's like the book that cannot be put down, or like the song that needs to be replayed (until the listener is finally content again). The Cat Lady had me snared within 26 seconds of its gloomy and foreboding opening intro.\n\nI generally don't like story-driven games.  The reason for this is because the story always feels so artificial. So fake.  Maybe I am long past that point where I see through the illusion of these fictional worlds put in front of me? Where I'm always so busy looking "for the strings", pulling the puppets, I rarely get any enjoyment .... And, as a result, it almost always feels like a waste of time and a waste of energy, investing myself in characters and story I simply don't care about.  ...or maybe I am too ....stoic in some regards ?\n\nThe Cat Lady is different however.  This game is centered around dark themes such as suicide, crippling and debilitating depressions and murderers, and it never failed to keep my attention.  It truly is different to what I am used to.  A game that scratched an itch in the back of my dark psyche.  And that is EXACTLY what this game does.  It captivates with its dark themes, in such a way that it makes you actually care about the protagonist and the overall story, which of course meant I kept coming back to find out what would happen next !!!!!!!\n\nAnd that's all I dare say actually, for fear of ruining or spoiling the game for anybody! The Cat Lady won't appeal to everybody .... this game is perhaps somewhat of an isoteric experience ....but if it connected with me in such a manner, than surely there are others who are going to love this game just as much !\n\n+ Mature themes (you may have been subconsciously longing for)\n+ The leading Characters!\n+ Graphics that you will find, are perfectly suited to the overall experience! (makes game ...spookier!! Think of that old snes game Clock Tower, but better)\n+ Great music (again, perfectly suited)\n+ Atmospheric\n+ Excellent voice acting\n+ The mind-bending & intriguing way the story unfolds\n+ That feeling that the game developers knew exactly what they wanted to do, how to execute, and succeeded! Very well-crafted game.\n\n- You will not want it to be over\n- The fact there is no Cat Lady movie (but you will want there to be!)\n\nThe Cat Lady is the very first game I have written a review for.  I was so impressed with it, I felt compelled to do so :)\n\n10/10.\n\n","January 14, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This is a depressive horror adventure game. It's very dark and mature. Interesting story and amazing soundtrack. The gameplay is not completely linear, there're some choices to make, the puzzles are not very hard and there's only few of them, the game mainly consists from dialogs. The graphics are simple but very nice.\nThe game has some flaws like there's no 1080p resolution(only 800x600) but there's much higher resolutions than 1080p such as 4000x something. No controller support, it would be much more comfortable to play game like this with a controller. And it has some sound problems. The main character sounds good, but some other characters sound different, like dialogs would be recorded with 2$ microphone while sitting on the toilet in the bathroom.\nIn short i recommend this game if you like horror and dark gloomy atmosphere.","February 14, 2014","true","12.9"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

But the voice acting was just too spotty (sometimes excellent, sometimes recorded on a very terrble mic). It was distracting pretty much 100% of the time. The art was also hit or miss, with some backgrounds and little details being beautiful,but the different expressions of the protagonist looking the like they were drawn by different people and were meant to convey every different stage of her life.\nThere were some moments that were enjoyable (like telling a guy where to shove it after he yells about you playing the piano), but a lot of the time the story drags. It often felt like it was edgy for the sake of being edgy, rather than for a point. Usually the next step was intuitive, but then there were times where I had to pull up a guide because the next step made little sense or something was broken (such as having to follow a raven, only the raven didn't spawn so instead I walked in circles for ten minutes).\nTl;dr: cool idea, fell short in storytelling and often times tried to achieve something greater technically than the creators were capable of.","January 18","false","4.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","0"

I got The Cat Lady as a gift from a sibling. Upon first playing the game I didn't expect much out of it- in terms of looks, the character design sometimes has an odd, unpolished look (proportions are often unabashedly off) and speaking animations are often odd South Park-esque head waggling. (I'm not sure if these issues were intentional, and meant to make them puppet-like, or not.) The titular cats look like their running/jumping animations were done by an alien who never saw a cat, and was just guessing.\nAdditionally, some of the 'missions' can be frustrating- sometimes it can seem less like a puzzle and more like a dull back-and-forth at the beginning of the game. The music with vocals that they got is also eye-rollingly wannabe-APC. It's less annoying than MCR, but takes itself far too seriously- juxtaposed with emotional scenes, it detracts more than it adds. Sounds are often looped poorly, or too quickly, and random lines of subtitle are all-capsed or just ill-fitting to the voice acting, which is pretty good- they had a surprisingly large cast for such a small game.\nOn to the good: I wouldn't be so hard on the game if it wasn't one that I really liked, and this game has one of the most honest portrayals of depression that I've ever witnessed in a game, and a storyline that was refreshing and relatable. It doesn't hit everyone in the same way, but I personally felt invested in the story and sympathetic to Susan, who, though you can play her in several different ways, has a storyline that always makes sense. I felt, despite the supernatural elements, that she was a fairly realistic person and I regard the game fondly enough to get my friends to play it.\nTL;DR, mediocre visuals, good plot. Quick play and definitely worth it.","January 11, 2014","true","26.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game has a different approach to horror; one that creeps slowly into your chest as the world you inhabit becomes increasingly more oppressive and surreal.  The moments of action are brief (par for the course for these kinds of adventure games), but the build-up to each is tense.  The best feature, however, is the story: heartwrenching, engaging, mature, and utterly unforgettable.\n\nThe only complaints are with the presentation: in particular, the sound design and the user interface.  While the music is absolutely brilliant (though I could have done without the lyrical tracks), the transitions between different scene themes don't have any fades or blends, making them quite jarring and sometimes ruining the mood.  The voice actors sound like they were recorded using cheap webcam microphones, and a couple of them sounded like complete amateurs.  The user interface is not the most intuitive, either; you can't delete or overwrite saves, so you end up having dozens of save files in your folder by the end of the game.\n\nApart from these quips, the core of the game - the story - is nonetheless stellar, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an affecting experience.  Just know that it truly does earn its 'M' rating - if you're not mature enough to be interested by the themes explored in this game (depression, suicide, the value of life and the price to save it), then you should pass.","May 4, 2014","true","20.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

May be because of their morbid atmosphere? If it sounds good, you must check out The Cat Lady.

So if you would ask me if I would clean my memory to play this game again - my answer would be yes: 10/10.\n\nYet I have to add a spoon of tar to the barrel of honey: linux port is terrible (1.4 version). I had sound issues (which I was able to fix by changing .cfg file), game crashes right after starting new chapter (because of achievements?) so I had to play without steam.

It was a beautiful, empathetic story that was carefully integrated among gritty, gruesome gameplay. The artwork was very dark, and creepy but served as a perfect atmosphere. It was marvelous that the game made you confront saddness and sorrow, constantly. It felt like you are Susan, not just witnessing an event. Voice acting was so incredible! That and the dialogue evoked such raw emotion. I would hate to spoil the absolute beauty of the moral, so I won't say, but it's something everyone in any stage of their life needs to understand. Anyway, if you like the Edgar Allan Poe type of creepiness and darkness, you should definately buy this game. If you like gruesome murder games, you should definately buy this game. If you like adventure games, then stop reading and buy the game! It is so gothic in the sense that it highlights on the beauty that can only be found in gruesome subjects, like depression or death.","June 9, 2014","true","16.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is very uplifting if you play to be a good person, there isn't really a moral choice system but rather a work hard system. This looks at the crippling pain those who live with depression suffer from, and does the job very well. This game is well made only irritating me once or twice because it thought i wanted to interact with someone a foot in the other direction but they were very much the minority. The game does also suffer from adventure game logic meaning you can go back and forth for a screwdriver because a knife won't work for prying something open. This did irritate me but really I ordered an adventure game so maybe I should have expected that. It did ruin the flow of the game on occassion however and that I was not happy with.\n\nThe game's story is a double edged sword. It is deep, dark and very open. Most of the time I would wander through the game marvelling at the level art, I was terrified and shocked in some scenes when you see the depravity and horror that the Cat Lady works on. Other times however the dialogue goes on forever, you can't pause during the dialogue and it feels completely disconnected from the story that you are currently working towards. I had a scene that lasted for twenty minutes and couldn't pause, luckily my gf was able to answer the door and phone that both needed attention during this time. The game would be well served from warning you.\n\nSeriouly though. The story is fantastic. It honestly shocked me deep down with a wonderfully written story. The story and the aesthetic make up for everything else that I have been really petty in complaining about. This is fantastic, the level design is awesome, the otherworldiness of the design is reminscent of Giger without being all sexual and creepy. Awesome game for those who want some complexity in their gaming time.\n\nGet this game, it is very exciting. I recently played Wolfenstein: The New Order, The Amazing Spiderman 2, Dark Souls and Thief alongside this. I only enjoyed this and Dark Souls so infinitely more worth your time despite it being a 2-D adventure game.\n\nRun down for those who care about scores\n\n-1 for adventure game logic running the flow\n-1 for long dialogue\n-.5 for not having pause always available.","July 3, 2014","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Susan Ashworth is The Cat Lady with a very deep seated rage which has created her morbid depression. Her own depression saves her in a strange way when she commits suicide but comes back to life.\nFacing her deep rage she confronts the most wicked people in the world, those with a sheer hatred of all things good, and engorging themselves on the destruction of the most precious in life, people (in fact, literally in some cases). In this point-and-click adventure game, solving puzzles to deal learn about the truth of life and the truth of evil, Susan grows and becomes a stronger person, until she finally finds her calling in the world, which redeems her and finally gives her hope to live... a thought she was entirely convinced could not be possible.\nThis game doesn't deal with evil in the ways most other pieces of their genres do. Most games have ruthless villaines that do more than just be an irritating jaugernaut. Rather, it deals more in depth with what evil truly is. The people she must face are true bona fide psychopaths.\nThe gore of this game makes sense. I wouldn't ordinarily play a gory game, but because of the philosophical nature, it's excusable. It's rather shocking however, throughout almost the entire game. A user only gets a brief relief from the horror.","June 23, 2014","true","23.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game has a different approach to horror; one that creeps slowly into your chest as the world you inhabit becomes increasingly more oppressive and surreal.  The moments of action are brief (par for the course for these kinds of adventure games), but the build-up to each is tense.  The best feature, however, is the story: heartwrenching, engaging, mature, and utterly unforgettable.\n\nThe only complaints are with the presentation: in particular, the sound design and the user interface.  While the music is absolutely brilliant (though I could have done without the lyrical tracks), the transitions between different scene themes don't have any fades or blends, making them quite jarring and sometimes ruining the mood.  The voice actors sound like they were recorded using cheap webcam microphones, and a couple of them sounded like complete amateurs.  The user interface is not the most intuitive, either; you can't delete or overwrite saves, so you end up having dozens of save files in your folder by the end of the game.\n\nApart from these quips, the core of the game - the story - is nonetheless stellar, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an affecting experience.  Just know that it truly does earn its 'M' rating - if you're not mature enough to be interested by the themes explored in this game (depression, suicide, the value of life and the price to save it), then you should pass.","May 4, 2014","true","20.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

May be because of their morbid atmosphere? If it sounds good, you must check out The Cat Lady. Just like Downfall, it's an obscure masterpice which won't allow you to stop playing until you'll reach the end and understand everything. So if you would ask me if I would clean my memory to play this game again - my answer would be yes: 10/10.\n\nYet I have to add a spoon of tar to the barrel of honey: linux port is terrible (1.4 version). I had sound issues (which I was able to fix by changing .cfg file), game crashes right after starting new chapter (because of achievements?) so I had to play without steam.

It was a beautiful, empathetic story that was carefully integrated among gritty, gruesome gameplay. The artwork was very dark, and creepy but served as a perfect atmosphere. It was marvelous that the game made you confront saddness and sorrow, constantly. It felt like you are Susan, not just witnessing an event. Voice acting was so incredible! That and the dialogue evoked such raw emotion. I would hate to spoil the absolute beauty of the moral, so I won't say, but it's something everyone in any stage of their life needs to understand. Anyway, if you like the Edgar Allan Poe type of creepiness and darkness, you should definately buy this game. If you like gruesome murder games, you should definately buy this game. If you like adventure games, then stop reading and buy the game! It is so gothic in the sense that it highlights on the beauty that can only be found in gruesome subjects, like depression or death.","June 9, 2014","true","16.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I saw some screenshots, I read a few reveiws, and I came away feeling like it was just an overhyped indie game. I caught it on sale and thought, why not. Once I finally started it up I found I had severely misjudged the game.\n\nThe art style I originally thought looked clunky and awkward in screenshots actually does wonders to setting, the tone and mood for the game and looks much smoother in motion. Everything feels dark and grimy and unpleasent, and highlights the ending quite well. that said the game also does a fantastic job of being unsettling and creepy.\n\nThe story is intriguing, but the charcters are the most interesting. The depiction of people. their struggles and lives, and the way they form interactions is really the meat of what makes this game fun. Walking in the shoes of a woman who's lost everything she loved in life and severed herself from the world, seeing neighbors and life through her eyes. It's very well portrayed, and they don't ham fist any 'lessons' into it really.\n\nThe game's puzzles are also a plus. While it follows the traditional formula of 'find x item and use on y thing' they're pretty simple to figure out and don't require you to preform huge logical leaps to solve them. They give you very clearly defined goals, and logic can carry you through how to accomplish them. The game is forgiving in that sense too, there's no puzzles you can just screw up and be unable to finish the game. No items you needed to grab in a room before you left because you can't get back into it later either. They devs developed the puzzles with the idea that they wanted you to actually progress it seems.\n\nThe downside is it's essentially a point and click adventure. Lots of moving around clicking on things, and listening to dialogue. There's some places you can make multiple choices, but alot of it is set on a specific plot line. This means you won't find alot of heavy mechanics in this game, and you don't have any real form of combat.\n\nI was a tad unimpressed with the end of the game, but that is forgivable.\n\nHowever if you're looking for an interesting, horror, point and click adventure with some really unique art I'd reccomend checking it out.","July 6, 2014","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Giving that solving puzzles is at the core of the game, it's good to see that although they vary widely in difficulty, and are well integrated into the game's progression.\nThe world of The Cat Lady is highly immersive. The use of sound effects and a top-notch soundtrack really create a sense of dread, but also of distance and detachment, which reduces as the game progresses. Coupled with a distinct art style, one truly feels that one is exploring the dark underworld of everyday society.

The game would be well served from warning you.\n\nSeriouly though. The story is fantastic. It honestly shocked me deep down with a wonderfully written story. The story and the aesthetic make up for everything else that I have been really petty in complaining about. This is fantastic, the level design is awesome, the otherworldiness of the design is reminscent of Giger without being all sexual and creepy. Awesome game for those who want some complexity in their gaming time.\n\nGet this game, it is very exciting. I recently played Wolfenstein: The New Order, The Amazing Spiderman 2, Dark Souls and Thief alongside this. I only enjoyed this and Dark Souls so infinitely more worth your time despite it being a 2-D adventure game.\n\nRun down for those who care about scores\n\n-1 for adventure game logic running the flow\n-1 for long dialogue\n-.5 for not having pause always available.","July 3, 2014","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I saw some screenshots, I read a few reveiws, and I came away feeling like it was just an overhyped indie game. I caught it on sale and thought, why not. Once I finally started it up I found I had severely misjudged the game.\n\nThe art style I originally thought looked clunky and awkward in screenshots actually does wonders to setting, the tone and mood for the game and looks much smoother in motion. Everything feels dark and grimy and unpleasent, and highlights the ending quite well. that said the game also does a fantastic job of being unsettling and creepy.\n\nThe story is intriguing, but the charcters are the most interesting. The depiction of people. their struggles and lives, and the way they form interactions is really the meat of what makes this game fun. Walking in the shoes of a woman who's lost everything she loved in life and severed herself from the world, seeing neighbors and life through her eyes. It's very well portrayed, and they don't ham fist any 'lessons' into it really.\n\nThe game's puzzles are also a plus. While it follows the traditional formula of 'find x item and use on y thing' they're pretty simple to figure out and don't require you to preform huge logical leaps to solve them. They give you very clearly defined goals, and logic can carry you through how to accomplish them. The game is forgiving in that sense too, there's no puzzles you can just screw up and be unable to finish the game. No items you needed to grab in a room before you left because you can't get back into it later either. They devs developed the puzzles with the idea that they wanted you to actually progress it seems.\n\nThe downside is it's essentially a point and click adventure. Lots of moving around clicking on things, and listening to dialogue. There's some places you can make multiple choices, but alot of it is set on a specific plot line. This means you won't find alot of heavy mechanics in this game, and you don't have any real form of combat.\n\nI was a tad unimpressed with the end of the game, but that is forgivable.\n\nHowever if you're looking for an interesting, horror, point and click adventure with some really unique art I'd reccomend checking it out.","July 6, 2014","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Giving that solving puzzles is at the core of the game, it's good to see that although they vary widely in difficulty, and are well integrated into the game's progression.\nThe world of The Cat Lady is highly immersive. The use of sound effects and a top-notch soundtrack really create a sense of dread, but also of distance and detachment, which reduces as the game progresses. Coupled with a distinct art style, one truly feels that one is exploring the dark underworld of everyday society. Many envirnments are almost entirely black and white, reflecting the drepression of the protagonist, but occassionally the colour-pallete shifts to immense saturation, representing hope.\n8/10","July 8, 2014","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Cat Lady follows a woman named Susan who's recently, successfully, committed suicide. She makes a deal with "The Queen of Maggots" in which she has to kill these people called "Parasites". They're horrendous people who purposely intend to harm others without regret.\n\nThe game has a good atmosphere, and an interesting plot (although I have noticed there are some mistakes in time/plotholes while playing it). The voice acting, I'll be honest, is bad. The best character, in my opinion, was probably the Pest Control Man, and he was only temporarily introduced in the game. I may be making an issue out of nothing, but when the characters don't sound genuine, it almost takes you out of it a little bit. Mitzi sounds like Lindsey Lohan as the British twin from The Parent Trap.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, the puzzles are challenging, and the overall message of the game is worth getting to know. I would recommend it, but with this tip in mind: Once you're done reading the subtitles of the character's dialogue, press the space bar. It skips the actual voice part.","June 20, 2014","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Without too much budget (I guess) and without too much 'technology' (The game is made with the AGS engine whose style is of the old-classic adventure games), the developers created a fascinating world, with interesting characters, bizzare storyline, and creepy atmosphere which would easily humiliate some mediocre horror video games.\n\nI found the story a bit complicated, you can't always tell what's 'real' and what's in Susan's (the main character) head, you can't fully understand all the details and their meaning (or at least I didn't on my first playthrough) but that made it all the more interesting, and would make me play the game again sometime, just to experience it again.\n\nI found the voice acting not so good at times, but considering the rest of the game's aspects, it's forgivable and doesn't hurt much the experience.\n\nI was quite content with the gameplay, at first it seemed too simple, but the puzzles were good enough to keep you busy for a while (they weren't hard, but also weren't that obvious). Unlike other classic adventure\AGS games, it's not the same old point-n'-click interface, but a bit different (and well explained in the game), and completely cancels the pixel-hunting which I really don't like in adventure games.\n\nThere were only two things which REALLY annoyed me in the game:\n1)Illusion of choices, at some points in the game's dialogues you have different options to choose, so different that you'd imagine it could affect the outcome of your actions and the way the game continues. That's not true, and it could be a very nice addition to the game. The only point where your choices does matter is in the last chapter of the game, where you can get a couple of slightly different ending depending on what you chose earlier.\n\n2)A technical problem - you have limitation for 50 saves only. Maybe some people wouldn't need so much slots anyway, but I did save quite often. And then suddenly, without any warning, you can't save anymore, with no explanation in the game itself! I had to google around to find out what's the problem. And in addition, you cannot delete you saved game in the game itself (I found no way to do that), you'll have to manually locate the saved games in your computer and delete some or most of them. That's a serious problem, which I assume won't be fixed.\n\nSummary:\n+Bizzare, interesting, deep story about human feelings and depression, with great conclusion and a message\n+Simple yet great atmosphere, great psychological horror environment\n+Good graphics and soundtrack\n+Good gameplay mechanics, no need to pixel-hunt that missing object\n+Interesting characters\n+Nice puzzles\n+More than one ending\n\n-You may not get the entire story on the first time\n-Very linear although it seems like it isn't\n-Mediocre voice acting at time\n-Some minor graphical glitches (very few)\n-50 saves limitation, no option to delete saved game in-game","August 29, 2014","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really liked the writing. If nothing else this is worth buying for the writing alone. Add to it that the soundtrack is simply amazing and you have a really good adventure game experience. I found myself thinking about the plot lines and what the plot brought up during the day. This game did what a good game like it should do. It got me engaged in the story.\n\nIt's not perfect though. The puzzles aren't challenging at all. Also the game is just about one of the ugliest games I've seen. I fooled myself into thinking that the game was purposefully artsy ugly for all of about ten seconds before I decided that it was just straight up ugly. Especially the character models. It sort of works with the type of story that it is and the subject matter, but that doesnt' really make it any better to look at.\n\nThere is some middle ground too. The voice acting is odd. Some of it is stellar, some of it is awful. The quality of the voice recordings varies pretty greatly too. Some people seem to have done their dialogue through a tin can while others must have had a legit recording set-up.\n\nThe flaws are pretty minor in comparisson with what is a great story. If you love to read, love coffee, love cats, love thinking about the sad things in life, love questioning what's in it all, and just in general love a good bit of game writing try this out.","August 28, 2014","true","10.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I highly suggest playing it this way - it is literally like a different experience.\n\nThe Cat Lady is a highly stylistic and atmospheric adventure game that is very dark and has some disturbing imagery and themes. It's not quite a horror game - I was never really scared - no jump scares - but rather, the game is creepy. Creepy music, creepy art, creepy story.\n\nMost of the game you sort of walk about environments as the 40-year-old-woman protagonist, Susan. She has tried to commit suicide and.... it sends her on quite the journey.\n\nGameplay consists of walking around as Susan solving various puzzles and a lot of cutscenes/dialogue. The game is very much story-driven - I think of it more as a sort of interactive story than a "game" really. The game has multiple endings and your decisions and dialogue determine what happens and clocks in at around 8-10 hours.\n\nIf you're into good, dark stories and can bear playing a game that isn't really "game-y", I really think The Cat Lady is quite the experience. The best adventure game I've ever played, by a long-shot. The story is a dark drama - there are dramatic moments to be had. Wouldn't be hard to shed a tear during the game in quite a few spots, but especially the end. Not a lot of games can make me feel that way.","April 22, 2015","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each person is a piece in this life, as every character in this game has a point of being in it.\n\nSome may complain about the graphics, audio, or physical gameplay. I, myself however, believe it adds to the charm of it. Pops of colour are surprising and comforting, as well as they can be disturbing. The Cat Lady has many elements which make it a worth while game to devote some time to. 8 Chapters can be completed in roughly 8 hours, making this game easy to complete.

Some of the imagery used is pretty unsettling, and the subject matter is more mature than a lot of games handle.\n\nThat said, it's amatuerish on more or less every level. The dialogue is clunky and incredibly badly delivered. Mitzi in particularly might be the worst voice acting performance I've ever heard. The gameplay is very crude and feels like a free Flash game rather than something you pay money for. There's pretty much no animation, even for the main characters, beyond "walk" and "look horrified".\n\nAll in all, this would be pretty impressive for a student project, but as a full retail product it falls flat on it's face.","February 14, 2015","false","8.2"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

The notion that, very broadly speaking, the traits and characteristics that are most beneficial are the ones that stick and are built and improved upon, while the ones that are unhelpful or detrimental generally tend to die out. That's more or less the gist of it, give or take... isn't it? Well, the same is true not only in biological terms, but also in gaming... Bear with me here, I'm going somewhere with this, I promise!\n\nThe gaming landscape as it is now is pretty different from what it was ten or fifteen years ago, and not only because of technological advances or general trends and preferences, but also in design and what we've all learned demonstrably does and doesn't work. Now, this is where this game throws me for a loop so much. It feels like a relic of sorts, like a living fossil that has somehow been untouched by the evolution of gaming over the past decade or two. If someone told me this was a lost game from 1990 I'd easily believe them, and I don't mean in an entirely charming, retro way either, but in a bizarrely obtuse and restrictive way. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself here, let me go back a bit.\n\nThe Cat Lady is a side scrolling, point-and-click style adventure (but minus the pointing and clicking) where you'll follow the life - and subsequent death - of Susan Ashworth in a strange and maddening tale into the afterlife, back to the land of the living, and occasionally through the dark and twisted recesses of her own tortured mind. Shortly after her own suicide, Susan is coerced by the "Queen of Maggots" into being resurrected and made immortal then tracking down and destroy five people who are manifestly evil and can no longer be allowed to hurt anyone. Given little choice, Susan takes on the task and one by one finds herself (and later on, her partner in crime, Mitzi) placed in exceptional circumstances where she must thwart the vile machinations of murderers, torturers and psychopaths, all while trying to deal with her own grief and depression. So as you can already guess, it's a laugh a minute!\n\nWhat isn't quite so much fun, though, and where it feels so anachronistic, is in the way you interact with the game. There's no mouse support whatsoever. Whether moving the character or navigating the menus, everything is done with arrow keys (or WASD if you'd prefer) and confirmed with Enter. So you'll move left or right, wait for an Up Arrow prompt to appear over the thing you're walking by, then select one of any number of options to interact with it. I honestly don't know why this is a thing. It just makes everything feel so unnecessarily awkward and clunky. And that can be applied for a lot of the game. There's no options to change the resolution, playing it in full screen makes some of the artwork look ugly as sin and more or less forces you to play it windowed, save file management is essentially non-existent as you can't delete or overwrite files but only create a continuous stream of saves that each have to be manually named (and, oddly, can all have identical names if you choose), and that's before you even start talking about the moment to moment issues of the game itself.\n\nLet me get the biggest offender out of the way first... the voice-over audio is f*cking awful. I'm not exaggerating here to say it's probably the worst I've ever heard. The volume levels are all over the place, there's pops aplenty throughout and it sounds like half of the performances were literally phoned in. Either that or they just couldn't afford better recording equipment and everything's really low quality as a result. The actual voice-over work itself is incredibly hit and miss. The delivery of the two leads is rock solid and I'd love to hear them in other games, but several of the other cast are downright embarrassing to listen to. Some of the voices actually sound completely out of place for the character they're playing, with the main character being a 40-year-old women but sounding like someone almost half her age. As for the graphics and art style, it's a mix of hand drawn art, real world photography and horrible animation where every character has these sort of floaty, paper craft limbs where the joints are detached and pivot independent of one another. Sometimes this stuff works, but far too often if doesn't. Whether all these designs are by choice or down to budgetary limitations or technical inability, I couldn't say, but all they continually serve to do is put up barriers between yourself and any kind of immersion within the game and constantly pull you out of the moment.\n\nI know I'm berating the game pretty heavily and sounding like I hated it, but I actually enjoyed a fair bit of it. When it's being completely batsh*t crazy I absolutely adored it (the Chapter 1 outro was a particular favourite moment of mine) and I really wish it had've doubled down on being so gloriously macabre as it sometimes is rather than some of the more mundane moments it falls into. Though maybe it felt it needed that balance and couldn't constantly assault the player with crazy sh*t for hours. It rather admirably deals with many dark subjects that aren't frequently touched upon in games, too, like mental health, suicide, depression, infant death, cancer and a host of more disturbing horror elements like cannibalism, mutilation and implied sexual threat, but as with so much else of the game, some of these topics are dealt with better than others. Though, to its credit, none of the more serious issues ever really feel like they're being treated glibly or for shock value, but rather like they're trying to handle them with genuine sincerity and respect.\n\nWhen it comes to slapping a final verdict on the game, I have to defer to what's being asked of me at the bottom of the page as I write this review - "Do you recommend this game?" - and, unfortunately, based on that question, I would have to say no. I wish there was something I could mark it between yes and no, but so much of the game makes it so much harder on itself and the player than it ever needed to be, that I can't say yes, or at least I couldn't without heavy warning to any potential players. If we were given resolution options, a better save system, better quality art, audio and animation, and if we were allowed more intuitive controls, I think I'd probably love this game for the most part. But as much as I hate to say it, as it is right now, too much got in the way far too often for me to love it the way I really wanted, and better executed products made me fall for them much more.","January 15","false","8.8"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

After progressing into the middle of Chapter 2, I am rather disappointed and don't want to spend more time playing it.\n\nIt is hard to immerse in the game as the main character Susan. The game is a point-and-click adventure, in which one has to collect objects in the surroundings and to talk to NPCs in order to move forward in the plot. However, with Susan being presented as depressed and suicidal, I find it difficult to justify why she's collecting seemingly irrelevant items and initiating conversations like an avid detective. Granted there are not that many objects to begin with, but still... that feels weird. The problem is less obvious in Chapter 1, but in Chapter 2 it starts to be intrusive.\n\nAfter detaching myself from the story, I noticed that this game has other shortcomings.\n* Resolution stuck with 800x600 (on linux), hence texts are small.\n* Crashes\n* Unnaturally slow game pace\n\nMaybe it would work better as an interactive novel. However, the crashes will still break immersion.","December 17, 2015","false","2.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

However, after 4 chapters of Cat Lady, it's obvious that it does not merit great praise because, no matter how great the ending might be, the middle is so poorly written that, much like its suicidal protagonist, nothing could save it.\n\nChapter 1 does a great job by first pulling in the audience with impeccable pacing, score, and cinematography.  Although the narrative is weak; dialogue is used sparingly enough to allow for the other pieces to be at the foreground of the gaming experience.\n\nChapter 2, things change.  The visual and auditorial aspects of the game get pushed aside to make way for the disinteresting, uncomplex, and seemingly endless dialogue.  With narration coming to the foreground, the game shifts from a pleasurable experience to a very tedious one filled with boring conversations for any audience member whose spent more than a few seconds thinking about life, whatsoever.\n\nChapter 3 puts further emphasis on the narrative and, once again, to the detriment of the game.  Character development is stereotypical and the narrative is contorted, at times, just to keep the story going in a particular direction.  For example, although we saw the character go through some emotional breakthroughs in the previous chapters, she somehow instantly slips back into severe depression over the most miniscule of inconveniences.  In Chapter 3, she has a complete emotional breakdown which escalates into suicidal thoughts.  What for?  Bad coffee, a burnt meal, and criticism from her neighbor for deciding to play the piano at 2am in the morning...  That's all it takes, apparently.  So, despite any judgements regarding the protagonists emotional realism, she just comes across as immature, inconsiderate, and selfish.  And I have a hard time sympathizing with that...\n\nChapter 4.  The protagonist continues to complain with same incoherent thoughts and the game basically goes nowhere.\n\n\nSo, all in all, is this game a good game?  Well, in my opinion, after 4 chapters played, it's a complete disaster as far as writing is concerned.","January 17","false","7.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Voice acting is fantastic, especially between our main character and her room mate (Mitsi) It feels like I'm watching a really good thriller but I'm controlling the actions.\n\nThe art direction is really good, the music is great (I especially like the main menu music when you first boot up the game)\n\nThe story is really what grabs you, whilst most games revolve around the gameplay whilst there story is lacking, The Cat Lady is the opposite in that it is the story that takes the front seat, This isn't to say the gameplay is bad, the gameplay is similiar to a point and click although you use the keyboard keys to move your character in a 2d fashion (WASD being the main keys)\nThis is where my one complaint comes in, and the reason I scored this Masterpiece a 9 rather than a straight up 10. The controls do feel clunky, pressing down (or S) brings up your inventory, this feels sluggish and not as snappy as it should be.\nI really wanted to sit back in my chair with my nice hot coffee and play this using my pad... The game should be perfectly suited to a pad, move left and right, select objects, open inventory, but whats this? No controller support?\n\nI'm sure it would of been a simple thing to implement partial controller support, even a slight vibration feature on the pad when something jumps out (or even to reflect your characters heartbeat in the more tense sections)\nI know there is 3rd party software out there to be able to map keys to the pad but this would of been a nice inclusion from the start.\n\nBut enough of my grumbling because that minor complaint is the only thing I can think of, This is one of the finest adventure games I have had the joy of playing since Grim Fandango & I look forward to future releases from this developer\n\n+ Fantastic Story\n+ Dark moody atmosphere\n+ Great Voice acting & music\n\n- Lack of controller support\n- Slightly clunky Keyboard controlls\n\nOverall\n9/10","July 6, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

When I saw 5 more, I nearly vomited blood. Compounded with all the 5-star reviews, I could only wonder if I played an entirely different game that also happened to be called The Cat Lady.\nLike 99% of people who buy this, I was attracted by the visual and thematic grittiness. Unlike 99% of people who then reviewed it, I was unimpressed after seeing that the grit was nothing more than a veneer, obscuring unconvincingly delivered acting and an utterly shallow treatment of the themes of depression and suicide, which act as little more than vehicles for plot progression rather than subjects explored in ANY depth or commented upon meaningfully.\nEven the plodding monotone in which the protagonist speaks screams shallowness. Depressed people aren't husks, incapable of voice modulation. The monotone should have been used where it made sense and not as a constant and incredibly tactless means of perpetuating some half-baked atmosphere.\nThe writing was barely serviceable in some parts and immersion-breakingly full of exposition in others. Susan's evolution as a character is definitely told and not shown, making changes feel forced and unexpected. Showing without telling is one of the top things that distinguishes good writing from bad.\nThe puzzles were, for the most part, so straight forward, they may as well have prompted you to "click around on the screen while we artificially and meaninglessly extend your play time".\nThe art style was reminiscent of that found in Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The individual pieces were, for the most part, well done, but often assembled somewhat thoughtlessly.\nClearly the majority is content to just be fed "dark subject matter" even if it's at the most superficial level. If you're looking for some depth, there isn't any to plumb here.","December 13, 2015","false","4.5"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","8","21","0","0"

TLDR at the end.\n\nPROS:\n\nGritty and atmospheric at times (Con - one note in others)\n\nSome of the characters are voiced really well, and lend some much needed life to the drab and mostly colorless world.\n\nSome of the writing in the game is excellent, and evokes a sense of understanding and connectivity to humanity itself.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe other characters that are voiced range from uninteresting to downright jarring and hideous (especially when it's in the case of one of the main characters in the story arch).\n\nThe rest of the writing ranges from uninspired filler to something you might receive at the end of a fourth grade literacy examination.\n\nTerrible save system. Often you have no option to save (during cutscenes and conversations, which run through the majority of the game). At one point (luckily early in the game) I quit because I thought it would autosave, based on seeing no hint of a save menu. Only I found upon rebooting the game, that I had to restart from the beginning. For reference, in case you choose to get this game despite my warnings, it's the esc key. You can only use it during sections where you can move your character around.\n\nNo skipping cutscenes/conversations. You must (space key) skip through the dialogue one piece at a time. For other things, such as scripted character movements, you must simply wait. Issues like these simply should not exist within games these days. There's no excuse.\n\nTLDR:\n\nThe more I played, the more I realized I was wasting my time with something that would inevitably just continue to dissapoint me even further. If you're into self-pity and adolescent tantrum states, as well as a system which does not allow for adaptability to real-life eventualities (such as having to stop playing without advance notice) play this game. As someone who values his time, and wishes to save the time of other gamers, I cannot recommend this title.","January 4","false","5.5"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/253110/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The Cat Lady is a psychological horror game developed by Harvester Games, placing you in the role of a 40 year old woman named Susan Ashworth. Susan is suicidal, and succeeded in killing herself by taking too many pills. She soon discovers that she has a special gift, which must be used to confront five specific people who will change her life. I won’t go into too much more detail, as it will spoil the game, but it’s a very compelling story. The way it is presented to you through the extensive dialogue in-game just draws you deeper and deeper into it. Buckle up for a dark and gory experience.\n\nGameplay is extremely simple: you can only move Susan left or right, and interact with various objects and people in her environment. Often times, you can pick up and use items throughout each chapter at certain points. Many of these items are required to progress within the narrative and the story. There are many characters to meet and interact with, and depending on your choices, different outcomes and dialogue options.\n\n\nEvery single line of dialogue is fully voiced, and very well done. You can actually feel the emotions of each character through their voices, adding to the immersion factor and connecting the player to Susan on an empathetic level.\n\nThe music is very engaging as well, always setting the right mood and tone for each scene. The game is filled with chilling atmospheric tracks done by featured artists such as micAmic, Warmer, 5iah, and Tears of Mars. The soundtrack really fits the game well in every single scene. The developers did a wonderful job with this title, and you will find yourself even more drawn in thanks to the fantastic music and atmospheric sound effects.\n\nThe game is of decent length, requiring only about 7-10 hours of play to complete, but oh…what an experience that 7-10 hours is! If you ever get the opportunity to purchase this game, give it a try.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","June 2, 2014","true","38.2"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","10","26","2","0"

I would like to recommend Cat Lady, I really would. I appreciate what the game is trying to accomplish and tell; A story that takes you into the mindset of a depressive, suicidal woman with nothing keeping her in this world. Something different, mature and hard to behold. And that part of the game is  really good.\n\n...but the gameplay is so horrible. The arrow keys are used to move in the one-dimensional world and use stuff in the game, but it is clunky and does not work well. The UI feels like it was modelled after an old adventure game and still screwed up.\n\nThe gameplay fluctuates. Most of the time it is a traditional "use key with lock"-adventuring, but sometimes the game introduces new features... and immidiately drops them after the chapter.\n\nAll in all, The Cat Lady would have probably functioned better as a comic or an animation than a game. The art style is neat (even though the graphics feel a bit amateurish at some points), and the story is good, but there is no reason for the game to have a player playing it, apart from some bits of choice. But if you don't fear bad gameplay and are enamoured by the thematics of the game, go ahead and play it.","January 19, 2014","false","8.1"," 98 of 211 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","98","211","0","1"

The slow pacing makes some puzzles tedious. Also the fog area lagged my computer so terribly. There seems to be no fix for it except turning up the settings just to pass that one section.\n\nThe mechanic for using items is a bit cumbersome. I wouldn't recommend this game if you do not have patience.\nIf you like creepy gorey serial killer drama then it's worth a play. Otherwise for the average gamer I don't see this one being much of a hit.\n\nAlso having a mental break down from microwaving a hamburger too long was pretty funny.\n\nEDIT: Finally finished the game and got the good ending.

I know it's more of an interactive novel than a game, so I won't really mention any of the gameplay other than the fact that it sometimes is clunky and that can detract heavily from the game. It's not very well optimized. Other than that, the game does what it is supposed to do very well, which is give you a solid mindset from the point of veiw of a depressed 40-something woman. The main character and her writing are very well done, and the rest of the story reflects that. The only problem with the spectacular writing for story and the main character is that it really points out the flaws and lackluster writing/voice acting in every other character. It really seems like all the characters are secondary thoughts, plot devices to only move the story further. Other than that, it's just a slow moving bummer. The story, like I said, does what it sets out to do very well, which is to show a clear and accurate look at depression. The story moves slow enough that it feels like time is meaningless because you will always have to deal with the troubles in the game. I opted to kill myself (by stopping playing the game) early, so I honestly can't say whether I know if the ending is better than the story and pacing.

I think the idea of a young woman who is so lost that suicide becomes an option and a choice to be reckoned with is interesting for a game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liderc/recommended/253110/","liderc","Aurinko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liderc/","465 products in account","A visually oriented psychological horror adventure game with rather shallow and unrealistic characters, poor dialogue, contrived and easy puzzles, crippled interface and finally; good art, atmosphere and at times sound. As an adventure game this game doesn't cut it. As psychological horror it falls flat on its face due to reasons laid out in more detail below.\n\nI can't recommend this game mainly because it fails at what it seems to strive for: psychological horror and meaningful dialogue. The dialogues are extensive, and they consist mostly of filler back-and-forth bickering and unimaginative small-talk, sometimes attempting to be humorous despite the bleak circumstances and surroundings but practically just managing to break the immersion. There are lengthy pauses in the dialogue that you can't skip, and while I understand they were put there to put emphasis on lines and allow for a few seconds of contemplation, after you realize the dialogue is thoroughly shallow and void of depth they just become an annoying, arbitrary speed bump for advancing in the game. It is of course even more annoying if you go back just to get achievements.\n\nCursing is used with good taste for the most part, i.e. there's not too much of it, and the voice actors mostly manage not to sound ridiculous dropping the F-bombs here and there.\n\nThe interface is terrible. You play the game using WASD (up left down right) and enter. Space (and enter) skips a line of dialogue. Movement is in one dimension; you can either walk left or right. When you come across a hotspot, its name is displayed and you can interact with it by pressing up. This opens a list of possible actions such as "examine", "push", "open" etc., and you use up and down to select your action. To open inventory you press down, then left and right to choose item. Pressing enter on the item brings up an action list again, and you press up and down to select action "examine", "use" etc..\n\nThe problem arises from the context-sensitivity of the direction keys: To interact, you press up. To select action, you move up or down in the menu, and to exit you press left or right. But you enter the inventory by pressing down, and then left or right to select item, then enter, then again up or down to choose action. To exit from this menu and go back to inventory, you again press left or right. To exit from the inventory, you press up or down (left and right are for choosing item now). Then left and right are again for moving [the character] sideways and up and down for interacting and opening inventory. This all makes the interface very unintuitive and inconsistent. I wish they'd just gone with point'n'clicking instead.\n\nThe visuals in this game are very good. I liked the graphics throughout the game and they manage to create a nice atmosphere. All the characters seem to be the same height, which seems a bit strange. Animation is simplistic and a bit jerky but it didn't bother me.\n\nThe sound is up to par for the most part, although I thought some of the music (my apologies to the developer for using this word, but...), namely the "emo rock" sounded a bit out of place for this game. I would much have preferred something more reminiscient of Alexander Scriabin or - if you want to go modern - industrial or aggrotech. Teenage angst rock just doesn't quite cut it for a game revolving around the life and psyche of a suicidal woman in her forties. Voice actors are, in my opinion, surprisingly good and where they fall flat I would blame the director responsible or the dialogue.\n\nPuzzles are few in this game, and didn't really require much thinking. Some of it is very, very contrived. For example, you have to make coffee one step at a time and then it gets spoiled and you start over again. Didn't help me "get into the character" but made me frustrated that the game would bother wasting my time to supposedly make a poor attempt at that.\n\nThe game presents itself as dealing with mature and dark themes, but turns out there's not much dealing here, just putting nasty stuff on the table as a freakshow. There is not much analytical nor deep thought present in the dialogue, and the characters react to events in strikingly unrealistic ways, which is only indicative of poor writing considering how much effort the game puts into being taken seriously on other fronts. The content of the game is more juvenile, feigning maturity, and gets constantly caught for it through the aforementioned poor and unrealistic writing, for example; a 40yo woman who has just attempted suicide, concerned about letting a girl in her 20's see her ♥♥♥♥ and only lets her in the bathroom while she's taking a bath if "she promises she's not a lesbian". There's also a lot of arbitrary sadism in this game that is only mature for its violence. Nothing is really explained in more depth - the sadism, perversion and brutality just are there for people to "enjoy."\n\nI tried to like this game, but entering chapter 4 or 5 I found myself speedstepping through dialogues because they just weren't interesting and felt like filler content purposely slowing me down, and there is a lot of filler dialogue in this game. In the very end I would just skip the dialogue because the character weren't saying anything substantial at all, i.e. there's a lot of "yes", "no", "please", "no" verbal ping-pong that serves no purpose but to supposedly make everything more theatrical - if bad movie cliches are presumed as a good example of theatrics. I didn't find myself growing attached to the shallow characters and when the game ended I just said to myself; "Finally." There are a few OK scares, and I did enjoy the atmosphere briefly in some parts, but I feel the game didn't shine in the areas where it could and in my opinion should have, and deteriorated into a boring interactive gore fest.\n\nThere are also a few bugs and oddities: At least at one point the character seems to comment on something she shouldn't had known yet. A few times the game got stuck during or between cutscenes so that the only way out was to kill the game process. The dialogue options don't show the full text if the line is too long, so you're forced to respond with lines you can't even read before selecting them. Sometimes a character would skip her first line by herself after a pause or a cutscene. Nothing gamebreaking though as far as I can tell.\n\nIf you don't care about the quality of writing, think you can handle the bad interface and contrived puzzles, and just want some nice audio-visual gore and scares, then you might still be enjoying this game. If you're looking for mature handling of heavy subjects or true psychological horror with meaning behind it, or a satisfying adventure gaming experience, I'm afraid this game can't deliver.","November 1, 2014","false","9.5"," 19 of 57 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","19","57","2","0"

The gameplay is just slapped on to it to make it a game instead of an animation. The reason for this is probably that there is more money to make as game than as animation or as ebook and cheaper to produce than as movie. While all these other mediums would be much better suited for it. Because you can just watch the story unfold instead of having to go through the tedious gameplay.\n\nThe controls make the gameplay even more annoying and would be much better as point and click instead of using the arrow keys. It's maybe designed this way too feel the a bit like Susan, but it just pisses you off. The artstyle isn't the best looking, but really fits the mood the game tries to set. The resolution of the game is really low and you can't change it too your native resolution which is always annoying.\n\nIt's just too bad it isn't on a other medium, because the world and the story look interesting.

It's like it was written by a "misunderstood 2deep4u 14 year-old" and I'm not joking when I say that. Further problems include:\nWhat the hell is that resolution?? 800x600 and you cannot change it? I thought we were living in 2015.\nEvery voice actor used their best potato to record their lines. Toaster mics in a dialogue driven game. Nice.\nThe art style is simply ugly. It may look OK on pictures, but when you actually move it's just painful to look at the screen.\nThe dialogue is simply badly written. And slow paced. Even if you hold down space to skip everything there is SO MUCH time between each line, you will still end up waiting WHOLE MINUTES for a scene to end.\nThere are so many things that just don't make sense in the game; this ties back up to the whole "#2deep4u"super tryhard style of the whole game.  Suddenly a murderer appears at your door and he hits you with a hammer? Yeah sure. The pest control guy kidnaps you after he's finished with his job? Yeah sure. Wait, him and his wife are also cannibals and are gonna eat you? Yeah sure.  Seriously these things simply don't make sense and I'm facepalming so much over the fact that a game with SUCH A WEAK STORY could make it to steam and people are actually playing it and some are even enjoying it (???).Now you may ask why I have 12 hours in the game and why I have all the achievements. Let me explain it this way: you know when you ragequit a game when it pisses you off so much, right? Well with me, this was the opposite. I was so angry with myself at the fact that I paid actual money for the game that I thought "god damn everything, if I actually spent my hard earned money on this piece of feces then it may as well contribute to my game completion percentage."\nBut still, with having played so much of the game, I still cannot list any positive things about it. I guess some lines between Mitzi and Susan were OK? Maybe even well written?

The game's summary was very intriguing. It said the game is about a woman who decided to end her life and about her afterlife experience, or something like that, doesn't really matter. I personally enjoy games like that. Drawn-like 2d environment was very nice too, positive reviews were very promising, so I decided to buy this game too.\n\nWhen I played a game for a while, I felt, that I was fooled, so to speak. The first reason for that feeling is this. When you see an intro scene which lasts for 5 minutes, it's OK, but when you see such a scene or even a scene twice as long as an intro after every minute you were in controll of your character, this is really annoying. Also there might be a dialog followed by a cutscene, again followed by a dialog (like half an hour overall). This is really boring.\n\nSusan Ashworth, a character controlled by player, is extremely slow. It might seem that she is not only mentally ill, but also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I do not mean that scene when she took her medication. No, it's her ordinary behaviour to act and move slowly. So gameplay is reduced to this: move from one side of a room to another with speed of a turtle, have a long and boring conversation, watch a long cutscene, repeat again.\n\nActually, there are some tough puzzles in the game, but they are not logical, you just need what they call "non-standard thinking" to solve them. There are also plenty of gameplay elements and puzzles which do not affect the game at all. Like the one with two rooms guarded by dolls or red and blue bars. Sometimes there is a red bar in a corner of the screen, which indicates Susan's mental state. When it overflows, Susan experiences mental breakdown, but no matter if she had a breakdown or not, the game just passes to a new chapter (after 30 min cutscene, of course).\n\nSo I was hoping it's over when the game said "You died" or something like that when Susan shot herself. But, alas, not a chance! After another 5 minutes Susan returned from death, she was "granted with a gift of immortality" at the beginning of the game.  So I thought: this is enough for me and closed the game.\n\nUnless there are some plot twists, it is extremely simple: kill five bad men. That's it.\n\nSo if you do not want to be bored to death, never ever waste your money for this. The game took half a day and I was controlling my character for half an hour or maybe less, so I wanted to spend another half to write this review as a warning to other players. Do not be confused. Do not buy this game.","May 22","false","0.1"," 2 of 19 people (11%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","11","2","19","3","4"

She tries to kill herself and this sends her into a fantasy world, at which point the game starts.\n\nCat lady is a supremely boring game. You may say that I think that due to the type of content alone, but no, the game is just dull. It's completely one dimensional, you can only move left and right. King's quest for DOS allowed for more exploration than this game. Movement is slow as balls, which is very noticable when you're plodding from left to right with nothing much to do. The puzzles are almost non-existant; the game merely tells you to tick off every option on the few interactive objects you come across until you progress, and any time the game does force you to think, the games pace makes it unbearable.\n\nI assume the game was made like this so you could appreciate the backgrounds and environment, which are... relatively good, I suppose. A lot of love has gone into them, but they are nothing extraordinary.\n\nCat Lady gets no reccomendation from me, I'm afraid, there are thousands of other, better adventure games out there.

But i was intrigued to keep playing. An awful, awful first impression. Holy cow it was ugly. I stuck at it, through the walking from one end of the screen, and back again, 100 times. I just stuck at it. It got worse, but i stuck at it.\n\nI couldn't get past it's ugliness. It was just terrible. The music fell flat on so many occasions and made me cringe at some points, it felt very amateur and it just didn't fit right at certain scenes. Some of the voice acting was hilariously bad. Susan's voice wasn't badly acted, but sometimes it didn't quite 'fit'. It felt as though she was trying a little too hard on the sounding dreary and depressed tone that it became very monotone as the game went on. Even when faced with grosteque and terrifying situations, she was sarcastic and dreary.\n\nI liked Mitzi, she was belivable and she was sweet. She was a well rounded character in a game that was otherwise devoid of them (think Pest Control dude, seriously...). Her voice actress was really great.\n\n\nI was moved on a couple of occasions, (without spoiling anything) one involving Liz, and one involving Zoe. The scenes lingered for just the right amount of time for it to sink in, and it was touching. I thought it a huge shame that i felt unable to truly believe in Susan's depression and sadness. I felt that it was just textbook - bad things have happened to this woman, she's ended up miserable and depressed. Why not have it so that she's a woman with good prospects, a nice family life, living in a nice area, and yet she's burderned with depression? A story centered around her struggles with it despite her 'have-it-all' life could have been really interesting. People say 'what have you got to be depressed about?', unknowing that's not how depression works. It seems though that Susan Ashworth has a million and one things to be depressed about, and it's just too easy. Depression is much much deeper than what this game portrays it as. Mitzi asks Susan at one point 'What is depression like?' and Susan answers 'It's feeling as though all i want to do is die...but instead i have to live'. Simple as that apparently. And that is what the entire game is based on, Susan Ashworth being miserable because she is alive.\n\n\nI wanted so much more from a game that looked so gritty and strangely dark. I wasn't expecting the gore and grotesque nature of it. I didn't feel it was justified, it was a little random if anything. It was a game full of bad guys, with Susan being a misery to play, i didn't connect with her as she took on a bunch of fairytale weirdos. Weirdos that i've seen a thousand times before in games and films. There was nothing unique or new about them, some even coming across as silly, rather than frightening. Mitzi was a small ray of light in a really really bleak setting, she brought a feeling of real life to the game (although i must admit her own story and motives were far fetched and not entirely realistic). The ending let me down - it summarised depression as something you just shutup and get on with. Something it seemed Susan HAD been doing up until she killed herself at the very beginning of the game! It was an ending without feeling, without real care for what happened next. You wrapped things up (kinda, i mean, half of it made no sense) and yet despite all of the disturbing and terrible things Susan had experienced, she spoke as though she'd just had a lousy week.\n\nI was left with the question of 'what the hell did i just play?'.\n\nI wish it would have been a game based on my original assumptions - Playing as a lady who lives with and looks after a bunch of cats. At least that would have had a deeper storyline.","October 6, 2014","false","12.8"," 25 of 72 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","25","72","0","0"

But worst of all, if you make the "wrong" choice, you're screwed.  You can't go back in this game if you missed something vital, which means you have to completely restart from the beginning of a chapter, and chapters can be quite long.  No save function, either.

I like the premise of the game, 40-something year old, suicidal woman as a protagonist, you don't see that very often. But that's pretty much where all the good things end in this game.\n\nThe artstyle is pretentious, choppy and ugly. Some might think it's artistic and retro, but it really isn't, it's just plain old ugly. Dialogue is horrible, both voice acting and writing. Every character sounds the same, and every character is very monotone and single-minded. I get that they were going for grim, dark, depressed style of feeling, but it just comes off as boring.\n\nAs for boring, that's what the gameplay is, among other things. All the puzzles are incredibly easy, but at the same time take a lot of work, walking around, looking for arbitrary hints that might be objects you can interact with, or just part of the backround, you can never tell. It's a point and click adventure, without the point, the click or the adventure.\n\nTo top it all off, controls are horrible and clunky, the whole game is unresponsive and unstable, the settings don't seem to do anything and if you try to put it on fullscreen, it just freezes on startup. (Even when run in a window, it took several minutes to go from "is it frozen?" to "Holy ♥♥♥♥, it took that long to launch?!")\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend the game in any way.

Sorry, but it's really too boring. I like story-centric games, but this is simply too slow-paced. The key you will use most, after playing for some hours, is the space key - to skip through the zillion dialogues. You will cry out loud "Will they EVER stop talking?" Additionally, the game has technical issues, which disrupt the immersion, like missing voice-overs and the spelling error-infested subtitles (at least the German ones). The character graphics and animations look a little bit awkward. Also, there's at least one illogical puzzle (the van in chapter 4).

It felt like at least 50% of my play time was spent sitting through slow, slow cut-scenes. It's useful to note that you CAN skip through dialogue by pressing the space bar, but even so, these scenes are long. And for the most part these aren't even  exciting animated cut-away scenes or anything like that. It's just watching two characters in profile, sitting perfectly still, uttering their lines, with the occasional dialogue choice. You also can't save during these cut scenes, nor can you pause (unless you're running the game in a window, in which case it will pause if you click away to another application). Sometimes you'll go 10 or 15 minutes before the game goes back into interactive mode, allowing you to save.\n\nThe game's interface is quite rough and unpolished, which would be forgiveable if it weren't for those dang cut scenes. The art style is similarly rough, but it reminded me pleasantly of the TV show "Metalocalypse", so I can forgive that.\n\nThe subject matter, storyline, and characterization, were all quite interesting. But for me, the slow pace and the interminable cut-scenes made the game almost unplayable, so I can't recommend it.","May 2, 2015","false","24.7"," 6 of 29 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","6","29","0","2"

A quick look at their web site and the list of game creators confirms my suspicion that the team was almost entirely male.) The only thing about this game that is "mature" is the endless gratuitous gore - the adolescent's definition of maturity, really. There is no deeper meaning or insight to be found here. It's just violence, sadism, and long, long, loooooong dialogues with no depth or substance.\n\nThis game feels mysogynistic and I recommend that you steer well away from it if you want a quality game experience.

The game tries to wrap an odd mix of metaphorical demons with real life psychotic criminals and murders. The aspect of the real life nemeses who were out to get Susan were far from realistic or down to Earth. Other than her neighbor, these colorful villians seems like they could have been torn out of a comic book. This strong contrast with what is believable and what is fat'fetched didn't sit well with me.\n\nThe puzzles in the game started to feel less refined as the game went on, and more like they were just placed in there to give the player something to do. Additionally, certain odd choices of background ambience and sound effect also brought me out of the experience;\nSuch as shouting out loud while trying to sneak around, or having background ambience of doors opening and closing when you know there's no one else moving in the entire house. I could go on with a laundry list of events in game, but the larger problem is how the game portrays itself as whole.\n\nWhile these mismatched events would seem to be purposefully comical, it doesn't seem to be done with such intent.\nSuch as that one long drawn out scene being that phone call with an incompetent emegency call handler. Which would have be hilarious if it was framed ever so differently.\nEven the multitude of misfortune that Susan Ashworth runs into seems oddly comical, but yet the game doesn't seem to acknowledge it.\n\nI do have one point where the game stood out for me, it's Chapter 2. It had one scene to establish some missing background of your version of Susan Ashworth while in a session with the psychiatrist Doctor Xaiver. The player has to pick rather personal information Susan would share, from her relationship with her parents and her daily routines. There weren't any options to omit a reply, so it felt much more intimate for to me as the player answering for Susan. It was blurring the lines where I was trying to keep Susan faithful with what has already been established with her character while projecting myself onto her as well.\n\nUltimately, I felt it could have been better polished. It's an okay game but not a memoriable one.","October 11, 2014","false","9.9"," 8 of 34 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","8","34","0","0"

The whole thing so far seems to be trying too hard to be dark, scary and artistic but it comes across more as bland, slow and boring.\n\nThe gameplay is not up to the standard of even the oldest point and click adventures as you can't use the mouse, you simply press the left and right buttons on the keyboard to walk around and press up to interact with things, which makes the puzzles and general gameplay feel tedious.\n\nPerhaps my distaste for the game stems from the fact I am not sympathetic towards the protagonist, in the time I've played it is not explained why she is depressed and wants to commit suicide, for all I know one of her cats died. I'm all in favour for artistic and surreal story telling but in this game a lot of it feels cliche, as though I was inside a highschool kid's art project.\n\nThe music however has been alright, I don't want to say good because I haven't really heard enough of it, but it is definitely carrying the game for me at this point. I will continue to play the game for at least another hour when I can be bothered to sit through it and if there are any improvements I will update this review, but I am not confident that the game will have any significant improvement.
