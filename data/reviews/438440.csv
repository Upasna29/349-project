Those you want to try and try to get the hi-scores and defeat bosses!"\n\n\nIntroduction\nI like platformer games. Reminds me when I was a child and I use to play those retro 8 bits. This is not just a jump and gets the item game. You need to think what to do and be quick. Before starting you can choose the character, weapon and special abilities and skills, that could make a difference while playing. Did I say be quick? Enemies are not the classic turtles, you have to think what to do and use strategy to avoid the enemies.\nThe graphics are really cool, I like the colors, nothing harsh for the eyes and very space(ish) like. Also, I liked the music but turns a little bit repetitive when you are playing.\n\n\n\nGameplay\nYou can pick a weapon of your choice and several skills and abilities. Think well, and I suggest you to try several times the perfect combination. Defeat the enemies in the Spacestation, with randomly generated screens. Some enemies are hidden, there is an ability to avoid that but maybe you want to try something else better like a shield. Or extra defense, or being faster. This is the best of the game, also as I said before you have to act quick.\nYou will pass the next screen once you killed all enemies. Beware of not shooting them so close, or you will receive damage. Who said this game was easy? Ah, you can pick the "hard" way too at the beginning of the game.\nAlso, you can try the challenges with some predetermined settings like extra lives but less shield, etc.\n\n\nPros\n+ Good pixel retro style\n+Chance of creating your own character\n+Good difficulty\n+ Random levels\n+ Easy commands\n+Double and wall jump\n+ Challenge mode\n\nCons\n- Music turns a little bit repetitive\n- Sometimes you enter to a very similar room (not always)\n- Levels turn to be repetitive if you play a lot.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI find this game very enjoyable. Maybe I'd add more levels, sometimes some levels seem to be similar to others. That happens when you play a lot. The first boss is quite complicated. Adding a hidden place would be great. I know the game is in early access and there are plans to add extras. Different music or more variety also would be a pro.\n\nRating:7/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.\n\nGame key provided by Wehrmann Studios.","March 11","true","1.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"
