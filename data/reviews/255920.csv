Six guests were invited one night, their screams the only noise. Blood inside the library, blood right up the hall. Dripping down the attic stairs, hey guests, try not to fall. Nobody came out that night, not one was ever seen. But Old Man Stauf is waiting there, crazy, sick, AND MEAN!\n\nWhen I check the date of development and publication, every little detail that makes this game reveals to be self-explanatory: 1993. Whew! Which means this mindwreckingly hard little puzzle game is 23 years old! Still, The 7th Guest, Trilobyte's one shot wonder puzzle adventure is a hardcore challenge for whom wouldn't mind the prehistoric graphics and overdramatized FMV acting.\n\nThe story is set in 1935, where we observe the story of Henry Stauf, a drifter who kills a young woman and steals her purse. Later, Stauf began receiving strange visions of magnificent toys and interesting puzzles. Guided by those visions, Stauf soon becomes a legendary toymaker. Every household with a child residing would soon know the presence of a Stauf toy. Yet, after a strange disease starting among children that own Stauf toys, the eccentric and not so benevolent genius shuts himself down into his eerie mansion. One night, 6 guests - a former actress, a kindly middle aged couple, another toymaker, a bank manager and a magician - show up before the Stauf Manor, with invitation sent by him. They are all warned about a 7th Guest who'd make an appearance at some point. We explore Stauf's wicked and wondrous mansion, solve his exceedingly hard puzzles. Any desire of one's heart is the prize promised by our host. Let the games begin!\n\nOkay, now let's talk about the game itself. This is a puzzle adventure where you'll keep wondering within the extraordinarily eerie mansion of Stauf, solve puzzles to reveal more of the storyline and eventually be a witness to events occurring amongst the guests. Graphics are really dated, but I must say that they managed to present a disturbing enough atmosphere with decent attention to detail. Lights, shadows, color palette and overall decoration is a great success in combination. Every little details is there to invoke Stauf's particular kind of insanity. Characters are presented in FMV cinematics. I won't present any spoilers here, but considering their condition, old and somewhat blurry character designs are ended up being quite appropriate anyhow. FMV acting in general is really cheesy and overdramatized, but it doesn’t not stand out compared to the tone of the game.\n\nWe were actually talking about puzzles, weren't we? Well, this game contains a selection of the hardest and harshest mind games that I've ever seen! They take attention, memory, logical thinking and patience! Many, many trial and error processes await you if you are to pick this challenge. There is a Microscope Puzzle nearing the end of the game for example - the success of AI is legendary for that one! I tried for 2 hours straight without any possible chance of me winning it. I gave up, AI was actually smarter than me on this one, and I cannot say that for many games. Luckily, if you are not that patient; there is an option of skipping puzzles but you have to visit a specific clue room 3 times straight for the skip to trigger. This game is certainly not in favor of the skipper.\n\nI know I might sound kinda masochistic recommending this game, but I grew up in a generation where graphics in video games weren't that spectacular anyhow. So developers had to invest in narrative, stories and puzzles to keep things interesting. This is a really well-made one for its era and a challenging experience for anyone who'd boast about their IQ levels. Neither ending, nor storyline are that amazing but there is a certain twist in the story that some of you could enjoy. I know that I liked it. So... only one question remains at this point: are you willing to take the challenge that old man Stauf throws in your way?\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 18","true","7.6"," 42 of 43 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","42","43","0","3"

For those who are not old enough to have experienced TGIF sitcoms, Pogs, boybands, teased bangs, Buffy, and dialup modems firsthand, this game may appear to be some Satanic computer vomit you only read of in urban legends.\n\nIn a way, The 7th Guest is just that. It's not a game where you "just have to get over the graphics." The graphics are not as problematic as other aspects of the game. For example, the cutscenes communicate some story behind the house and all the puzzles in it, but they are so bizarre and disjointed. You finish the cutscenes and hope it was a hallucination, because otherwise that would mean that someone (or more accurately, a whole team of people) willingly unleashed this upon humanity. The gameplay is truly a product of its time: clunky.\n\nFortunately, the puzzles (the meat of the game) are very challenging and unique, so no matter your thinking style, there will probably be at least one that you can solve instantly, and several that will leave you scratching your head. I consulted a guide quite a bit to get through several puzzles.\n\nTL;DR Don't do this to yourself unless you really, really like puzzles. Recommended because I really, really do.","July 3, 2014","true","0.9"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","41","47","2","0"

Oh man, fuzzy footage of hammy (but commendably enthusiastic) actors against low-res, ray-traced backgrounds?  How could such mighty wonders be explained outside of the direct intervention of a loving god?!  Yes, those were simpler, more naive times, before even the nerdiest of nerds had dial-up internet, and we took our digital miracles wherever we could find them.  FMV games (many hastily produced) rained down like Mana from Heaven, and we gobbled up each glorious glob without a critical thought.\n\nSadly, most of those once awe-inspiring games from the early CD-ROM era have aged pretty terribly; even if you can manage to get your 21st-century eyeballs beyond their nauseous graphics, the majority of them are simply excruciating to play.  Incredible to my 32 year-old self, however, The 7th Guest is a charming and addictive game even today!  It's got piles of great puzzles (and a few hilariously awful ones for good measure), B-movie charm oozing in yellow rivulets from its ears, some really memorable MIDI courtesy of The Fat Man, and a lot of genuinely interesting art design!  Granted, the appeal will probably be limited to aging weirdos like myself who love puzzles, camp and old things, but those weirdos should have a great time with this delightfully moldy oldie!\n\n(Kid me would think adult me a genius for being able to solve all the puzzles.)","October 10, 2014","true","12.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","22","25","3","1"

I've wanted to finish this game for YEARS. I remember when my pops bought a boxed copy and it wouldn't run because it required upgrades such as a 4X Speed CD-ROM drive. Well after getting all the upgrades we got to play it and well, it ended up being a brutal puzzle game with over the top acting and a molasses interface. Well in 2014 nothing has changed but finishing this game was always a itch I'd wanted to scratch. Now that I've done, I wished I played something else. The good? The house in 7th Guest is nicely realized. Great atmosphere and some of the puzzles are fun. The bad? Well, everything else. The aforementioned acting is even worse now and I'm still not sure what the heck the story was. And some of the puzzles are absolutely brutal diificulty wise (a special screw you to the piano puzzle - memory puzzles are the worst for me). Needless to say, the payoff isn't there and while the pure nostalgia had me smiling at times, I was slapped back to reality as I slowly, SLOWLY moved through the mansion trying to find the next puzzle. So the bottom line is I do not recommend this game unless you remember those early 90s where a couple 100 MBs of storage space or a 4X speed CD-ROM drive was a big deal. Otherwise, move on.\n\nEDIT: I'd be remiss if I didn't add you could skip puzzles. You just have to navigate the mansion SLOWLY to get to a book in the study describing how the puzzle can be solved. Do that three times (THREE) and the puzzle will be solved for you. Not great but better than tearing your hair out.","July 25, 2014","false","5.3"," 43 of 65 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","43","65","0","0"

The game itself is from 1993. and is a adventure/puzzle/horror type of game.You find yourself trapped in a manor with 6 other guests owned by some madman named Stauf.\nThe story of the game is rather confusing and the cutscenes a lot of times don't make a lot of sense and don't really explain the story that well. The goal of the game is to solve all the puzzles in all the rooms and discover a secret of a 7th guest.\n\nThe game has been made using FMV and the rooms are all modeled in 3D which for the time it came out was absolute beauty. Not the case today anymore.Each of the rooms in the house have a puzzle to solve and those really are the game's best trait. The puzzles are quite varied and give a great challenge to anyone willing to invest in this game (although I have to admit I felt the urge to smash my monitor into the wall out of frustration on a couple of occasions).\n\nThe bad thing is the game is really slow, thus making the movement around the house a pain. And sometimes during the puzzles the character will keep saying things every time you restart it and it gets annoying sometimes.There are a couple of disturbing scenes and the music / ambiance is quite good at making you feel uneasy.\n\nSo, to sum it all up:\n\n+ challenging puzzles\n+ great music and sounds\n\n- slow movement\n- dated graphics\n- not the greatest story\n\nI recommend this game to all adventure fans who don't mind slow movement and enjoy great puzzles.

As I remember that version ('multimedia', perhaps) had little introductions on each of the guests which are absent from this version. I never made it thru the original game since it would bug out at the Microscope puzzle and crash.\n\nThe best reason to play 7th Guest is the wonderful music by The Fatman, you might also like to play it to get a glimpse of what gaming was like in the 90s. We were all in awe of the full motion video - the eye candy impressed us all - even if the game did not actually work. Today, the movement with FMV is rather tedious, and the 'content' of navigating the house feels rather annoying - with the chattering teeth possibly showing you an interesting flavour animation, or possibly sending you somewhere else so that you have to clunkily retrace your steps.\n\nThe acting is hammy, but there is fun in that - imagine the game as a hybrid between the horror genre and pantomime.\n\nSome of the puzzles are fiendish if your spatial and chess-like skills are not strong. At times I found the word puzzles obscure and tenuous given the in-game hints. At least one puzzle I found really not enjoyable since it involved a full blown strategy game unlike any I'd seen before, where the AI makes the perfect move every time. Luckily, you can go from a puzzle to the book on the coffee table in the Library for hints, and on the 3rd return the puzzle will be solved for you, so you can bypass it. Unfortunately, even when you're confident that you can solve a puzzle, Stauf's impatient voiceovers and Precious Pup-like giggle will have you racing for the nearest walkthru just to avoid hearing them.\n\nThe game is a historical curiosity, the graphics were ground breaking at the time - I remember playing the animation on the painting at the top of the stairs over and over with a mixture of fascination and revulsion. Wait for it to be on sale for a dollar or two and you won't be disappointed.","January 2, 2015","true","7.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Now a classic of old school logic games.  The graphics on modern computers seem dated and most likely the gamer will have to adjust the frame rate and graphics to compensate.\n\nStoryline: Stauf was a homeless thief and murder before he made a pact with a demon.  After the pact Stauf, became a famous and wealthy toy maker, hand crafting toys and replica dolls (a doll that looks the child).  Then there was plague that killed all the children that had Stauf's toys and dolls.  After the plague, Stauf built a house full of puzzles (at the request of his personal demon).  He invited six guests to his house with the promise they could have anything they wanted if they could solve his puzzles ... and for a price.  Unwittingly a 7th guest arrived, a boy dared to enter the house.  Greed, lust, betrayal and murder follow the arrival of the 7th guest.\n\nThe storyline is revealed in small cutscenes as the gamer explores the house and solves puzzles.  What each character wants and how they end up dead is shown through these cut scenes, as well as Stauf's master plan.\n\nGameplay: Challenging.  Very challenging.  Finding the puzzles to solve is half the challenge as they are scattered thoughout the house and generally on the floor.  There is a puzzle per room and when looking at the map the room color will change once the puzzle is solved.  Also certain rooms will not open until certain puzzles have been solved.  There are no directions to any puzzle, though possibly a clue or two if one listens closely to the dialogue of the main character while trying to solve the puzzle.  There is also a book on a table in the telescope room (library?) that will give clues and hints to solving each puzzle.   Puzzles are revealed by skull with a brain still inside.  A set of wind-up teeth show "short-cut" secret passages.  A tragedy mask shows further cut scenes and animations.\n\nPuzzles include:  There are three classic chess logic puzzles, reverse the location of knights or bishops on a chessboard, and queen's territory (put 8 queens on a chessboard without their movement overlapping).  Two coin puzzles, and a card puzzle.  One 18 note musical "follow the leader" puzzle.  A slider, and several turn based picture puzzles (or crypt lids) And one maze.   (HINT: The maze does have map.  The map is on a rug.)    Also there is a game (found in a microscope) called Ataxx, it is a nasty version of Othello or Go, and from what I understand made especially for 7th Guest. All puzzles are logic puzzles, and all puzzles can be skipped by consulting with the "hint" book, after attempting the puzzle.  (Usually takes twice play puzzle, consult book, play puzzle again, consult book, play puzzle one more time, consult book and it will say puzzle is solved.)\n\nThis a classic, difficult logic puzzle game.  Recommended for those that like a challenge (and a bit of patience testing).  There are solution guides that can be found on the internet.","March 19","true","15.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

At the original release it was groundbreaking and frightening. After roughly 20 years the slow movement system and voice-acting are atrocious. On the positive side, the puzzles are all self contained except one (you don't have to find clues throughout the mansion, just start the puzzle). The downside is there is very little direction or instructions for the puzzles. That difficulty does lend itself to a feeling of accomplishment when you solve one. Some puzzles are very logical and pleasing, some feel randomly difficult and illogical. Also a few are too similar. I still suggest playing through this at least once to see how far gaming has come, and because the atmosphere is still very well set.

Part of me wants to say "NO", but I really feel that - should you find it for quite cheap - The 7th Guest is worth trying at least once.\n\nBack in the 90s this game was rather noteworthy, though some would say that even back then it looked somewhat dated. To me, however, it was a game that I felt quite fondly towards for whatever reason. The music, the interesting way it handled cutscenes and the disjointed way you learned the plot all stuck with me. I actually used to listen to the 20-something audio track on the CD which played through all of the music with an opening and ending song and various voice clips spread throughout.\n\nSo, I haven't actually talked about the game itself, have I? Maybe I've been trying to avoid it. You see, even though I remember quite a lot of the game from my teenage years, the strongest memory I have was of this absolutely awful puzzle involving a microscope and the AI was smarter the better your computer was. When it first came out the contest was likely an even match but on anything more advanced it became virtually impossible unless you won by sheer luck. The game's other puzzles are by no means much better but none of them -stuck- with me after all this time.\n\nI have no idea if my younger self was just more patient or if I went and looked up various solutions online. What I know NOW, however, is that they were either really simple or very frustrating with nothing really in between. Part of me honestly just wants to say it's cause I've finished the game before and simply don't care anymore. Whatever the case, I found most of the actual gameplay quite boring and just wanted to see the next scene.\n\nActually, no, I take that back. There IS another factor in all of this. During puzzles the protagonist and antagonist kept going on and ON constantly. You can't skip any of the disembodied dialogue and if you restart a puzzle you get to hear all of it over again! This, combined with how slowly every single transition was, swiftly got on my nerves to the point where I no longer cared and just wanted to get past the puzzles as quickly as possible. Yes, my apologies. I do have a terrible habit of meandering to my point.\n\nIs the game bad? It honestly is, but it's that weird/cheesy kinda awful you just have to see once for yourself, to know if it's as bad as people claim. In the game's defence, if you can call it that, a lot of its problems lie in all the material that got left on the cutting room floor. The GOG version includes a document explaining how it was supposed to be, with multiple endings and a more coherent plot. If The 7th Guest had been made today it would've likely been a bizarre combination of Professor Layton's "random puzzles" with Resident Evil's "explore a spooky mansion".\n\nI've read there were several Kickstarter/crowdfunding attempts to make a third game in the series which all failed, until a creator-approved fan game came along. All I do know is that, for better or worse, The 7th Guest is one of those games I played and will never really forget. I know some people knock the visuals, but really those are fine. It's the tendency for the voice to drowned out by the music that really hurts the presentation.","November 5, 2015","true","5.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I have, however, played through enough to be able to make my mind up on my overall impression.\n\nThis game was recently gifted to me by a friend with nostalgic ties to a game I'd missed out on owing to being 9 years old and not owning a gaming system that wasn't made by Sega or Nintendo.  Therefore, I guess, he figured I might have the benefit of forming an opinion without "nostalgia goggles."\n\nInitial impression on boot up weren't exactly dazzling, but entirely forgiveable when you factor in that this game is 21 years old and was, at the time, something that would have wowed me.  The opening cinematics featured cheesy and cliche voice acting and pixelised live actors. The story, however, was intriguing enough to press on in spite of pre-emptively deciding that there was no way this game was going to rattle me.  After all, this is an old-school point and click adventure and is in one of my favourite gaming categories.\n\nOn gaining control of the game after the introductions, the rendering of the house is pleasantly surprising and detailed, given that your expectations may have been lowered.  Controlling your orientation feels a little bit clunky and decidedly less interactive than you were expecting.  If, from what I've already said is enough to turn you off of this game, and you absolutely cannot get past the feel of a very dated game, you may as well move on.  However, first impressions can (and more often than not) be wrong.\n\nIf you like games that aren't going to hold your hand and tell you what to do? Read on.\nIf you like games that give you a rewarding hit of dopamine when your big brain figures out a taxing problem?  Read on.\nIf you like atmospheric games that play on your emotional state? Read on.\n\nShortly after I got my bearings, my initial impressions melted off into nothingness.  Clicking around, solving that first puzzle...excellent.  The star of the show, though, is that musical score.  It plays so perfectly as you uncover teasing aspects of the narrative and somehow jangles the ever-loving Hello on your nerves.\nThis game is entirely a creepy experience when played with headphones and dim lighting (for that immersive experience).  My expectations were shattered.\n\nThe only time my nostalgia goggles ever came into play and  tainted my unbiased experience, is that some of the problems within the game harkened me back to the days of playing Myst.\n\nIn summary, I have to admit that the mixed ratings of this game scared me off when I first viewed it.  If not for my friend, I would have shamefully dismissed affording this game the chance it deserves.","November 2, 2014","true","1.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

But, as you read this review, you must know that pacience is needed ! For some puzzles ( like that telescope one ), the SS difficulty galores ! It forces you to do it all over again since... well, I bet you're curious, and spoiler needy, so, I won't tell... Also, those ghosts bring in dat spook once you see 'em ( specially if you're that retro type of gamer ). To be specific, this is a must play. Even if you're a wuss at videogames, play this game, pay the eight bucks 'cause ya do ( are those eight bucks, I don't remember... ) and meet Stauf and his otherworldly ghasts ! ( Pun intended ). So, what are you waiting for ? Do not waste your time !!!! DO IT ! ( But, I do have to tell ya, this is the Alone in the Dark type of horror. It once spooked a full generation of gamers throughout the world in those days, but nowadays, it may not be that terrifying, But, anyways, if you are new to old games, and if you love puzzle games, have a bunch of those in your iPhone, and if ya wanna start with something different, than start with this one ! It may not terrify you, as I told you, but it's worth. Although, if you are a long time gamer, who plays frequently those old fashioned arcade games, hates CoD, Battlefield, Skyrim, Fallout, BioShock and other junk, and if you never palyed this game before, just do it. You may get terrified just ike you once did with that DOS X. )\n","December 26, 2013","true","1.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

The riddles were quite simple, back at that time though they sometimes felt quite awkward - good tip, never booze and play! Later on that game went into oblivion and there were much better riddle game adventures. Nowadays even some of the Nancy Drew Adventures have some harder riddles - or look into most of the modern adventure games.\n\nSo again I am missing a neutral recomendation possibility. The next best thing to neutral is positive, but only slightly so and only for people who knew this game from it's original appearance. The game is old, and you see it at the moment you start playing. The acting is bad, though I have seen even worse acting on other recent computer games. The riddles are simple, at times I pondered what did take us so much time back then, and then I remembered again the bad acting, the moving sequenzes and our plastered mood; those things don't mix well with the riddle solving process. Well, maybe we used it to much as a kind of "party" game.\n\nJust for the nostalgic purpose, the celebration of great times with some great pals. Yeah, this game is still good. But only to a limited degree, not for everybody. People with a low frustration threshold beware this game, you might get enervated by the really bad acting of a good background-story, or hung low with the eternal movement sequences that have no shortcut, the graphics that look like 1993 and 3D-Accerleration never had been invented, a soundtrack that was composed of MIDI Files (Oh my, again an nostalgia is rising with Ad-Lib, SB-Pro or the Yamaha Soundsystem).

However, if you can look past the dated graphics, bad over-acting and slow transitions between screens, then you will enjoy what The 7th Guest has to offer.\n\nWhen you first play the game, you are given little direction of what to do. But as you explore each room you come across a puzzle that needs to solved in order to unlock other rooms in the mansion and ultimately solve the mystery of The 7th Guest.  There are some really clever puzzles that you need to solve, which progressively get harder as you go through the game (the microscope puzzle anyone...).\n\nMy main negatives are the slow transitions when moving from one screen to the next, and the incessant mocking by the antagonist, Stauf, which is quite irritating to listen to over and over when you are stuck on a puzzle.\n\nIf you are a fan of old-school DOS games, then give this one a try.","July 10, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, the 7th Guest is a prime example of a game that has not aged gracefully.\n\nFirst, the game is dreadfully slow. This makes 'trial and error' puzzles like moving a knight around a chessboard dreadfully slow. So slow, that you will likely refer to a walkthrough just so you can accomplish the feat as quickly as possible. I can think of at least three puzzles that fall into this category.\n\nSecond, every time you start a puzzle there are 3 comments by the 'explorer'. This is fine the FIRST time you begin a puzzle, but having it play every time you restart the puzzle is an awful design choice. 90% of the puzzles require no clues  to deduce what needs to be done so hearing things like "So that's how they move" on a chess puzzle is quite tiring.\n\nThird, the UI is frustrating and slow. Yes, it is learnable, but never comfortable. The lack of fast travel between rooms coupled with the fussy cursor placement made navigating the mansion an irksome effort.\n\nI repect those that remember thsi game and think it may be fun to take it for another go, but it isn't worth the time. Unlike Mario and Frogger, this game is rightfully left in the past. If you want a puzzle game, I urge you to go pick up any of the Professor Layton games. Each boasts about 7 times the puzzles contained in the 7th Guest and a much more polished experience. Also, they are only around $16 new compared to this over priced re-release.","November 27, 2013","false","7.5"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liderc/recommended/255920/","liderc","Aurinko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liderc/","465 products in account","Horror-themed puzzle & exploration game with pre-rendered 3D environments, cinematic cutscenes, nice puzzles, and abysmal gameplay and interface.\n\nDespite the strong positive vibes of nostalgia I cannot in good conscience recommend this game in this day and age. This game originally came out in '93 and it hasn't aged that well. While the puzzles are still good and the premise and story bits of the game are alright, the game has too many infuriating flaws for most people to be able to look past them.\n\nBasically you wander around the abandoned mansion of a crazy doll-maker Henry Stauf  and solve puzzles to unlock new cutscenes and rooms with more puzzles. The puzzles themselves are mostly fun, but there are several annoyances that make it difficult to enjoy this game.\n\nFirst of all, the movement happens on rails, i.e. when you click to move forward or to sides, you enter a static animated sequence that turns the camera and/or moves it to the next location, during which the game will not respond to input. The movement sequences are extremely, infuriatingly slow and unskippable. It gets even worse when you click on a random interactive object and the game takes you on a completely unpredictable, surreal trip to another location, and you have to slowly walk back to where you came from. You will learn to hate the gameplay for this alone.\n\nWhile you're solving puzzles, you'll get abruptly interrupted by voice sequences of the main villain mocking you and the protagonist thinking to himself, which make the game unresponsive for their duration. Sometimes Stauf or your character give you clues pertaining to the goal of the puzzle, and mostly these are played back only once (you can retrigger them by exiting from and restarting the puzzle), but there are of course exceptions and it makes you wonder if this game was poorly playtested as it really gets old fast hearing the same lines over and over again if you need to reset a puzzle. Often the interruptions consist of the villain making fun of your inadequate problem solving skills and laughing in your face. For example, there's a chess knight-piece puzzle during which Stauf will say "Don't take all night" every five moves or so, and due to the fact that the puzzle mechanics themselves are so extremely slow that it indeed will take you all night, you will end up muting audio to maintain your sanity.\n\nThe puzzle mechanics themselves mostly consist of clicking on pre-rendered at-the-time spectacular 3D objects which are then moved around sometimes at excruciatingly slow speeds which introduces yet more arbitrary waiting to the gameplay. For most puzzles this wasn't such a big problem but there are instances that are guaranteed to frustrate you because you'll feel that the game is unnecessarily wasting your time by forcing you to wait between actions.\n\nEssentially, everything in this game is slow - even the menus are loyal to this quirkiness by forcing you to wait during unnecessary animations and audio clips. You're also forced to write the name of your savegame by clicking on fancy letters with your mouse - it's not like you'd likely be equipped with a more convenient input device for entering letters after all. If you enter the menu while you're in a larger area- if only to check the map to see which rooms have unsolved puzzles - when you return to the game it will teleport you to a default location, forcing you to manually walk back to where you were when you entered the menu screen.\n\nThe graphics, while being jawdropping when this game came out, of course ain't pretty by today's standards, but I wouldn't say they're unbearable either. Some of the scenes still look fine and obviously a lot of effort went into designing the interiors of the mansion. Goes without saying that we're used to much higher quality graphics rendered in real-time these days, so being forced to navigate this environment via unskippable animated sequences may drive you mad nonetheless.\n\nThe music in this game is actually very good. While the soundtrack consists of MIDI tracks which sound a bit ridiculous and thin, the compositions themselves are noteworthy.\n\nIf you can tolerate the myriad of annoyances this game throws at you, the puzzles are still good after 20 years and even the story and setting hold some intrigue, but be warned that the fundamentals of the gameplay are crippled to a point that would be deemed absolutely unacceptable in today's standards.\n\nOh right, and: Went in through a billiard table pocket.

You'll get to explore the full 3D rendered mansion and see the full motion video that made this game so famous at the time. The game is a no pressure, point and click puzzle game that puts you in a kooky haunted house full of human spirits from the 1930s. I can't call them ghosts, so much as spirits, they aren't scary or spooky so much as eccentric.\n\nEach room in the mansion has its own puzzle to solve. There is a good variety of puzzles here, you won't face the same one twice. Some puzzles are self explanatory such as a sliding tile puzzle, a word jumble on a quilt and a maze where you need to flip doors to get to the end. Others are less obvious, such as arranging cans to spell words where the only vowel is Y. Some are just tedious because of the point and click controls, coupled with voice overs. The voices will give you hints and a villain will taunt you, but each time a voice says something, it will halt the game, killing the pace. If you get stumped on a puzzle, there is a library with a hint book.\n\nAs you navigate the mansion, you'll see things in first person perspective. To turn around, you need only click the side of the screen. There is no slight turning, when you turn, the camera will turn completely around and look at what the game wants to. In a room, you need to hover your mouse cursor until it changes to let you know that you can do something or walk forward. Some doors you can enter, other doors you can't with no sign that you need a key or anything like that. Instead, you need to assume that solving puzzles will unlock doors to new areas. The game won't hold your hand or tell you anything more than a hint in a puzzle. If you see that as a positive, this might be a game for you.\n\nThere game is forgiving. There is no sort of game over. It all just keeps going. If you get stumped on a puzzle, you can restart it. Nothing will kill you. You just keep going. The only real downer is time wasted going the wrong direction or having to listen to voice overs over and over again. You won't find a map except for the basement maze. You can't get lost... except for in the basement maze, where everything is a grey brick wall.\n\nThe game takes its time. Just getting from place to place seems like a chore since movement is so slow even on my modern PC. Hearing voice overs will stop the game and there are plenty of cut scenes full of absurd dialog about their past sins. There are nice touches to the game such as a skull face or hands trying to reach through a painting.\n\nIf you're in the mood for 1993 nostalgia, midi loops and puzzles, this game is for you. The game is a part of history.","October 24, 2014","false","3.4"," 30 of 60 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","30","60","0","7"

I remember watching my grandmother play this game- and telling me to get out of the office when a certain scene was played. ;)\n\nOverall, the game has NOT aged well.  While the game was graphically advanced when it was first released, nowadays it looks terrible in comparison to more recent releases, primarily due to the FMVs used throughout.  One good point, despite the outdated graphics, is that the environment as a whole is pretty well fleshed out.  All the rooms of the mansion were unique, creating different atmospheres.\n\nGameplay-wise, it is slow and clunky.  The protaganist walks incredibly slowly, and talks far more often then he likely should.  This wouldn't be a problem, if the game gave more hints as to where you should go next - as it is, it's a lot more likely that you'll wander around slowly and aimlessly until you accidently find the next cinematic and puzzle.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are either obnoxiously easy, obnoxiously hard, or luck-based - there is even a puzzle that if the randomizer doesn't like you, the puzzle is unsolvable and you need to reset it, possibly several times over before it'll let you solve it.\n\nStory-wise, this game is...special.  The story actually doesn't make much sense overall, and due to the poor quality of the FMV, it can be difficult keeping track of the story and what is actually happening.  There's a character that actually is never explained as far as I could see, though her presence was likely meant to be a badly placed hint.\n\nOverall, this game is great for the dose of nostalgia - outside of that, though, I'd only recommend this if you really, really like puzzles.","August 2, 2014","false","11.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I remember seeing this on store shelves when I was a wee lad. Trying it today, I didn't realize it was intended to be exactly as slow and grainy as it was 20 years ago. Sometimes games run smoother. This one is just painfully slow where it takes forever to move a few rooms down. Transitions and movement is so choppy I was cringing for most of it. For some reason, I was under the impression it was more like Phantasmagoria and more gruesome. Instead it's a 6 year-old's scary story. The puzzles vary in difficulty but all seem very consistent in how irritating they are. The acting is also painful to watch. Not like Snakes on a Plane bad... just really awful. About halfway through I didn't care about solving the puzzles so I just followed a walkthrough so I could watch the inconsistently stupid story and finish it off.

While there are some very good puzzles in it, there's at least one that can spawn without a valid solution, forcing you to retry it.  There's another that is more of a board game than a puzzle, but the AI plays nearly flawlessly.  The story feels pretty weak.  The acting and effects are a bit cheap and cheesy, but that really is part of the charm of the game, so I can't hold that against it.  It does, at least, include a map showing you what rooms still have puzzles to solve, but even with that you can get frustratingly stuck at times until you find just the right place to click at the right time.

It might have been worth it if its UI had been updated for the modern format, but it's not. There is no options menu, meaning no sound controls or windowed mode (which is an immediate annoyance for a multitasker like me). It is also frustrating that if you check the menu, you're taken out of the puzzle and it restarts. Yet I continued on, because it seemed to be a moderately creepy and entertaining game, and one I see praised as an award-winning classic. However, the lag before any action (though I understand part of it is atmospheric!) and the graphic glitches finally drove me to give up on this game.

This way the designer can guide you to key locations, rather than the player wandering around aimlessly.\n\nHowever, the path design is cluttered with unnecessary stops and turns. Rather than being led into the experience of what the designer wanted me to see, I'm more often than not stuck trying to move from one location to another.\n\nThe story is a toymaker named Stauf made a manion filled with puzzles, and for some reason you're just stuck there trying to solve them all... Good enough of a reason as any, I guess.\n\nThe meat of the game comes from its puzzles, which feels more like an assortment of children toys, and old newspaper puzzles. There’s a handful of games which aren’t even puzzles, such as the Ataxx clone, and a memory game, which both were removed from the iOS version.\n\nSolving the puzzles themselves isn’t particularly satisfying. Each puzzle is more or less a standalone game, rather than playing off of any other elements in the game. Additionally solving them won’t serve any purpose to the game as a whole. The only puzzles which played a role with the plot were the puzzles with words. But, what’s worst is the endless taunts in few puzzles, which pauses the game to just play an audio of Stauf’s complaints.\n\nIf you want to play a 90’s adventure puzzle game, I'd suggest playing one in the Myst series instead.","May 14, 2014","false","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boldimpression/recommended/255920/","boldimpression","Bold Impression","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boldimpression/","47 products in account","I’m going to be unusually blunt: overall, I did not enjoy this game. However, especially to those who have studied video game history, The 7th Guest was important for its technological achievements at its time (1993). The graphics were impressive (still are if you consider its age) and Trilobyte genuinely tried to make good use of motion capture, which didn’t work out as well as planned. Many of the puzzles are also some of the most challenging I’ve ever encountered, somewhat of a testament to how some puzzle games today sacrifice challenge for accessibility. There are also some genuinely memorable moments in here, even with the horrendously fuzzy mo-cap. I doubt I will ever forget Stauff screaming for me to “come back” when I would quit the game.\n\nWhile these may be positive traits of The 7th Guest, there are many more negative traits which kept me from liking it. I feel that the main reason I would not recommend a stay in Stauff’s mansion is the whole conception of the game. The 7th Guest suffers from an acute case of identity crisis. It’s almost as if two lukewarm games are smashed together, constantly fighting each other for control. On one hand, we have a horror setting, a haunted house with a creepy--but not scary--past. On the other, we have a ton of semi-pointless puzzles. The plot isn’t strong enough to carry the haunted house idea, and the puzzles’ (all of which, except the infamous microscope puzzle, must be solved to complete the game) only purpose is to string it out, gradually doling out snippets of blurry mocap upon completion. Age is not a legitimate excuse for why these ideas were not blended well.\n\nAnother very awkward design decision is the “shortcuts.” I say “shortcuts” because they’re more like detours: never wanted and rarely helpful. These would not necessarily have turned out poorly, however. If most of them had actually been designed to be shortcuts ( i.e. lead you back to the main part of the house after a puzzle takes you deep into the mansion, so you don’t have to backtrack) or if they led to “secret” areas of the house you couldn’t reach otherwise, they would be just fine. Unfortunately, almost none of them follow these ideas. There’s no way to know if what you’re going to click on is going to be a shortcut or animated scene, so when they do show up and transport you somewhere you do not want to go, they are extremely annoying. It wouldn’t be so bad but it takes a long time for the player to navigate from one area to another, so adding in unexpected “shortcuts” which may make the player waste time travelling back to the desired location is downright unnecessary.\n\nThe 7th Guest is not a terrible game. Those looking for extremely challenging puzzles may have a lot to like here, but there’s not much more the game has to offer. Simply put, if you played The 7th Guest in the 1990’s, there’s no reason to return to Stauff’s mansion now, save perhaps nostalgia (although $10 is a bit much, though not outrageous, to satisfy this). If you didn’t play the game in the 1990’s (my camp) there still isn’t much reason to enter now, either, unless you want to study a piece of video game history or pull your hair out with the puzzles--don’t expect many helpful hints and you might have a good time.\n\nIn the end, I didn’t absolutely hate my time with The 7th Guest, but I never fell in love with it. When Stauff screamed at me to return for the last time, I slammed  the door in his face, locked it, and uninstalled all 700 MB as quickly as possible. I have no good reason to return, and I don’t want to.","January 2, 2015","false","13.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Strange for a game such as this, especially one made in 1993. The puzzles are all self contained, meaning you don't need any outside element to solve them, which is nice. So ends the good things I had to say about the game, let's move on to what makes it bad.\n\nBeing made of a dozen or so self contained puzzles means that the game is a glorified collection of mini-games, strung together with a tissue thin plot. And not good tissue like Kleenex, this is some Walmart-grade sandpaper. The plot is that a vagrant robs and kills a woman. Afterwards, visions of a toy appear to him in his dreams. So he makes the toy and gives it to a child. Everyone loves the toy so much that he becomes the greatest toymaker on earth. Then all the children he gave toys to get sick and die. Then he dies; but not before inviting six increasingly flamboyant guests to his toy maker's murder house and forcing them to LARP a game of Clue.\n\nYou, however, are some bewildered idiot that wakes up in the house with no memories, years to decades afterward. You proceed through the house solving puzzles and watching the ghosts of the LARPers reenact their last night on earth; all the while being hounded by the spirit of the evil toy maker. Most of the puzzles are strait forward but the ones that aren't are mystifyingly obtuse. Word games are a favorite of The 7th Guest, one in particular needs you to construct a thirty three letter phrase where the only vowel available to you is “Y.” Hope your vocabulary is up to snuff. Another favorite of the game is to have a puzzle relating to your inherent ability to play chess, either placing or moving pieces in such a way that the rules of the game aren't violated. Hope you're good at that too. The larger portion of the puzzles are pattern identifying or matching games.\n\nMost of my time wasn't spent with the puzzles but rather wasted doing other inane things like walking and listening to dialog, which brings me to the game's design. Part of what makes me angry that The 7th Guest is only mini-games is that they are littered through an enormous house that your character traverses at a mind numbingly slow pace. True to form for old-school P&C games, you have to click where you want to go and your character will travel there. The game, for reasons best not heard by mortal ears, is rendered in full 3-D. To reiterate: this game was released in 1993. This causes the character to grind forward like a decommissioned theme park ride as he tightly follows the unnecessary elaborate track he is glued to. Leading me to believe you are playing as some horrible hybrid of man and roller coaster, whose head is a detachable camera that zooms in on things in a way that triggers motion sickness. It takes forever to get anywhere even when you know where you're suppose to be going, which you usually don't; causing you to view most of the cut scenes out of order. It is a crapshoot whether clicking on an unknown object will make it do nothing or teleport you across the house like a passive aggressive game of Chutes&Ladders. The dialog is ♥♥♥♥ed as well. In addition to being the pinnacle of 1993 games audio, the game locks your ability to act any time a piece of dialog is heard. While it is useful to listen the first time, by the tenth or so time it gets very, very old. Both you and the toy maker talk incessantly, which is especially frustrating when you've had to restart a puzzle for the Nth time and have to listen to the same dialog each time you make a move; stretching what would only have been a ten minute exercise into thirty minutes of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nI didn't finish The 7th Guest but I'm okay with that. The two most difficult parts of the game aren't even puzzles, surprisingly enough. The first is a part in which you must navigate a maze that would be hard enough without the game's inefficient movement and could take you hours, if not trap you completely, if you didn't happen to find the map of it in another part of the house. The second is the microscope/germ 'puzzle' that finally got me to quit. Rather than be a puzzle for you to solve, it is some kind of game of tic-tac-toe combined with checkers. The point is to move your pieces and fill up the board while capturing your opponents pieces. To make a long story short, the game is purely reactionary, making going first a huge detriment to your ability to win. You must always go first. I watched some people on YouTube play it and win but there is no singular strategy and no way discern how the A.I. will move. It's just you, the fickle computer, and a horribly designed Cracker Barrel store game.","December 5, 2014","false","8.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It was sheer TORTURE. Every puzzle in the game required you to be some type of super computer. With all that in mind I was NOT looking forward to playing this, however I must say that even though this game comes before 11th hr it was considerably a Lot more friendlier and fun to play. First with the exception of a few, the puzzles aren't that difficult. The ones that are, are just vague and you wont know what the hell your suppose to do, but they are all pretty quick to solve. You also don't get insulted with every click, so you wont start to feel manic depressive while playing this.\n\nStory: Stauf after killing someone gets a mysterious vision on how to make beautiful toys. Kids everywhere in the town begin to buy his beautiful dolls only to find out that at a certain time those dolls release something in the air which kills all the children which own one. After this happens Stauf gets a second vision. He is taught how to build an elaborate house on the outskirts of the town filled with diabolical and deadly puzzles. He then invites 6th guests into the house, the person who solves all the puzzles will get their greatest wish granted. This includes finding out what Stauf wants and not just all the puzzles in each room.\n\nYou play as an alternate character set somewhat in the future who is witnessing all these past events by ghostly apparitions each time you solve a puzzle in the house. You are simply known as 'ego'. Eventually the ghostly apparitions reveal that the guests work it out and realize that Stauf needs a child known as 'Tad' who has been dared into the house by other kids, brought to him so he can turn the child into a doll and complete his contract with the devil/alien spirit which he has made. The 6 guests begin turning on each other, some kill each other trying to gain access over the child more than the others, while others are trying to save the child, eventually one woman surviving grabs Tad and brings him to Stauf who is trapped in the attic. She now wants her greatest wish granted, but has she solved all the puzzles? No she hasn't so she is magically turned into bile. You though have solved all the puzzles and your greatest wish is for Stauf to let Tad go and so you break the never ending cycle. Each character then goes there separate ways into greater darkness or white light.\n\nThe problem is that there is a puzzle in this game known as the microscope puzzle it is ridiculously difficult. You have to go against the ai of the game and there is no walk through that will help you. I tried to follow those that solved it on youtube, but the game changes so you wont be able to copy the winning moves of someone else either. Alas after 12 hrs of losing against it I just gave up and watched the ending on you tube.\n\nThe game just narrowly gets a thumbs up from me, it was definitely thumbs up material in comparison to the 11th hr and it was thumbs up being able to play a part of gaming history as this was the first game to EVER use live action video as part of it's game play. It was also interesting to be able to experience the microscope puzzle for myself as I had heard so much about it. Thumbs down in comparison to other interactive puzzles out there. Definitely a wait till this is on special.","December 24, 2014","true","13.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So, when I saw it on sale, I decided to go back and replay it.  Unfortunately, that was a mistake.  It hasn't held up well over the years.  It was always a bit cheesy, but as an adult (especially having played much better and scarier games), it is just unbearably so, while the story is choppy and confusing.  Above all, though, the puzzles are lacking in quality -- a mix of too easy, too hard, too nonsensical, and too tedious.\n\nIn general, I can't recommend this game, because it's just not very good.  But even if you're considering the purchase merely for nostalgia's sake, I still wouldn't recommend it.  I think The 7th Guest is one of those things that's better left as a romanticized memory, with the feelings of the experience more prominent than the concrete details of it.\n\nThe only way I can really recommend the game is if you are solidly in the mood for an over-the-top cheesy, classic 90s puzzle game that wasn't very good to begin with and has aged badly.

I wasn't old enough to be around for the initial hype, although I did later on pick up a very nice copy in the style of a hardback book with "hidden" compartments.\n\nSo.... apparently it was a major reason for people to go out and buy CD-ROM drives and Gravis Ultrasound cards. Well... okay. I guess it looked nice on demonstration computers in fancy stores, but gameplay wise I've always thought it was a bit lacking. To me, it feels very similar to Shadow of the Beast. Not in terms of gameplay or mechanics, but how every effort was made to wow people with the graphics and sound... but then they had no budget left for a game.\n\nFrankly, I don't think it has aged well. The blue-screen is awful, the acting even more so (as was typical for games of this era) and the plot cliched. That really just leaves the underlying game. Which is a series of simple minigames the designers apparently cribbed from a 19th Century puzzle book. Believe it or don't. All you have to do in the game is walk from one puzzle to the next - your "reward" for solving a puzzle is a short cutscene, whereupon another door in the house unlocks and you can go and fund the next puzzle.\n\nActually, never mind Beast. This is more like Myst. Very pretty, but there's nothing much going on as far as the game goes, besides a few sliding puzzles and a "lights out" game played with coffins.\n\nGet it if it's on offer and you want to see what the fuss was all about.

I remember this game coming out and bought it a year or so after that.  I never finished it because I got stuck on a puzzle back then.  I finally decided to finish it up...I love playing old school adventure games especially ones I played back in the day.  I enjoy most of my replays of older games.  This was not one of those games.\n\nAfter completing the game, I have to say, I think with out a doubt, this game pushed the graphics envelope (in a game) but was really a technical demonstration or interactive story more than a game.  The game mechanics and puzzles are so thin by todays measures it would be considered a very casual game.  This doesn't mean puzzles are easy; some are definitely hard...but nearly all puzzles have NOTHING at all to do with anything and in some cases are very illogical/non-sense.\n\nI really wanted to like this game seeing that after all these years, I did hold it in esteem (as others have)....but the game is just not fun.  The general game design is horrendous.\n\n-The icons to represent actions that can be performed are complete rubish and random.  Why does a set of dentures/teeth represent an action to move to a new scene?  Very bad design.  There is no inventory.  The icons used include: directional skeleton hand, eye ball, teeth, mask, and skull+brain.  All those for a game that has one action: left click on hotspot.\n\n-Scene Transitions.....are....so....slow.  It is clear that they only existed to showcase the graphics.  This was one element that Myst got right: quick transitions.  At least 30-40% of my 5 hours playing this were transitions.\n\n-Most Sound FX and music volumes were too loud to even hear the voice acting.\n\n-Too many bad puns....over and over again.\n\n-Story is weak and generally uninteresting.\n\n-Menu design is crap.  "Your game has been saved."  Seriously, I need a voiceover to tell me that my game was saved?  I don't think I've EVER seen something like this in any game.  Very tedious and unneccesary.\n\n-It can be near impossible to determine WHAT you should do next even by using the map.\n\n+Some sound effects were not the best but overall the music was different.\n\n+For the effort and the technology.  Some of the video post effects, blending, and rasterization is pretty cool.  Some of the pictures in the hallways have crazy "ooohhhh" effects to them when you examine them.\n\n\nIf I flash myself back to the early 90s, I had no concept of indie games.  Today, I would classify this as a mediocre/promising indie interactive story.  There are too many missing interactions to even call this an adventure game.  In contrast similar game (like Myst), there is story and puzzles and there is some relationship between the two.  Here there is not.....you just go around solving puzzles (except one where you need a map in another room to solve a maze).  I cannot recommend this game as there is just too much tedium for no real reward.  Instead, spend your time playing the Gabriel Knight or Tex Murphy series.","March 22, 2015","false","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Every click you do on a puzzle is followed by a few seconds of watching the animation roll or a bit of unskipable character monologue. Since most puzzles require quite a bit of trial and error this leads to a lot of waiting around and watching repeating animations, which just isn't very much fun.\n","April 29, 2015","false","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The early success of which has been attributed to The 7th Guest and Myst, a similar-style adventure game.\n\nSigns of age showing like mold in the cracks, some of 7th Guest's aspects remain fun to this day. The FMVs and general setting are cornier than a midwestern farm, boasting ghouls, poltergeists, murder mysteries, and skeletons so unabashedly hammy that they wouldn't be out of place on a badly compressed .gif set plastered all over a post-ironic modern blog.\n\nEvery instance of music in the game is terrific and the story itself, taking you through the journey of 6 guests through non-chronological apparitions and scenes, remains surprisingly engrossing - a "What Happened" to the classic "Whodunnit" as you try to figure out exactly what Stauf had in mind for these victims. The puzzles themselves that you solve to make these apparitions appear (the bulk of the gameplay) are also surprisingly fun - when they tell you what they want from you.\n\nHowever, more often than not the puzzles are deliberately obtuse and do not tell you what they want from you. You're left with several possible "solutions" and trying them out just feels like throwing darts at a wall. One particularly infuriating game of Ataxx aside, which felt more like shoving darts into the base of your own neck.\n\nAs the game nears its end, the story also completely loses you. I could sit you down and try to explain what happened in the final sequence to you with sock puppets and a chalkboard and we'd still be here come morning. It doesn't help that the game has massive audio mixing problems - there several times where I could not hear that characters at all over the music. If the music didn't decide to glitch out again and just not play, leaving you in complete silence for long stretches.\n\nBut none of these are really the root of 7th Guest's problems, so much as being a game second and an animation delivery-system first.\n\n7th guest has that 90s 3D problem of being completely in love with its own animations. Every single action that you perform in this game is accompanied by a 5-30 second drawn out animation of said action. Watch in wonder as the AutoCAD environment is slowly maneuvered at a whopping snail's pace. Be awed as chess pieces slowly inch into the sky, slowly inch across the screen, and slowly inch down again. Boggle your mind at the slow fade ins every time you choose a menu option. Then do that one hundred more times.\n\nIt's not just a chore. It's frustrating. It's infuriating. It made me come within a hair's breadth of just dropping the game with a loud swear and a flipped bird. Accompanied by repeating soundclips, often after every move ("Don't take all night!" and "We'll be dead before you figure this out" being burned into my skull) it manages to sap out every last bit of possible fun I might have had with this title.\n\nWhen dealing with antiquated games I wholeheartedly rebuke the notion that good game design ages and somehow "becomes obsolete". But when your game serves to show off animations and sounds at the cost of gameplay, then it was never well-designed to begin with. It's the icing on top that the animations look like garbage by today's standards.\n\nThe 7th Guest burst into glorious life with the advent of the CD-ROM, and should have died with it. I wouldn't recommend this title to anyone, and you're better off moving on with your life.","September 8, 2015","false","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Unfortunately, The 7th Guest has aged a bit more like milk than a fine wine. The entire game is pretty much one FMV sequence followed by another as you move between areas and the framerate is VERY choppy for such slow movement. Story-wise the game plays out like a bad 80's horror film with all the typical cheesy tropes and nonsensical characters. The puzzles are either so easy you solve them within 5 minutes or so hard you find yourself pulling your hair out (especially the optional microscope puzzle which is more of a competition with the AI). Also a lot of puzzle mechanics are re-used between puzzles making me think they ran out of ideas mid-game. If that isn't aggravating enough, the narrator and stauf will interrupt your moves with unskippable dialogue (really nothing in the game is skippable, if you accidently view a cutscene twice you have to wait until it ends).\n\nI would really only recommend this game to the most patient of players (or those running the game with a speed hack).","August 8, 2015","false","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Released in 1993 as one of the first games ever on CD-ROM, and one of the first FMV games, it recieved mixed reviews upon release, but sold fairly well.\n\nThe puzzles are extremely obscure, the gameplay is rather obnoxious and the SLOW transitions between the pre-rendered screens get very furstrating after a while. The only truly redeeming factor of the game is the music, which is made by the legendary Fat Man, George Sanger.\n\nIt may have been groundbreaking, but it hasn't aged well, not really recommended.","July 24, 2014","false","0.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

It was somewhat revolutionary for the time, as it was one of the first PC games that took advantage of the additional storage space available on CD-ROM. Full motion video sequences abounded... much to its detriment.\n\nThe acting and narration in this game is atrocious. I have seen better acting from children at a kindergarten play. The puzzles are more trial-and-error than actually solved with logic. The long and unskippable animation sequences on some puzzles kills the flow of the game. Worse, when you navigate a maze near the middle of the game, you are constantly bombarded with "Feeling lonely?" from the narrator. By the 30th time you've heard it (no exaggeration if you aren't using a map), you seriously want to punch either the narrator or the game designer.\n\nThis game has not aged well at all, and I do not recommend a purchase unless you have great nostalgia for it. Even then, seeing it today might ruin your opinion of it.\n\nAlso, be aware that this game is run inside the ScummVM virtual machine. Any configuration will need to be performed by hitting Ctrl+F5 and clicking "Return to Launcher".","August 24, 2014","false","5.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

That novelty played a tremendous part in its initial success and popularity. Unfortunately the user interface and prerendered cut scenes that  blew people's minds 20 years ago are crude and primitive compared to today's standards. Those who comment that the game hasn't aged well are correct. It hasn't.\n\nThat's not to say the game is bad. The puzzles still hold up. The vague clues, The lack of even knowing how to go about some puzzles. Replaying the game since I last played it about 15 years ago, some are still quite tricky. Others... Not so much (because I remember the solutions). But for first timers, The 7th Guest retains its mystery and intrigue. At least until they start reaching for on-line guides on how to solve puzzles and figure out the story. In my day, you'd have to buy the guide.\n\nNo, it does not tell you how to solve the microsope puzzle. It tells you the puzzle uses the hardest AI setting from the NES Spot game though! Explains why its so F-ing hard to solve.\n\nThe story itself tends to be campy occasionally on the verge of cheesy without really going off the deep end into kitsch (something 11th Hour does). Believe it or not, 20 years ago this added an unsettling yet off-beat sense of creepiness to the game. Years later, long after the novelty of new tech has worn off, and due to how poorly the effects and video quality have aged, The 7th Guest has virtually been transformed into the equivalent of a low budget horror flick. A lot of what did work 20 years ago now doesn't so its replete with bad acting, bad writing, and bad special effects. Despite this, every once in awhile, The 7th Guest still manages to do something right. Its rare. But it does happen! Not enough to make the game shine however.\n\nIn spite of how antiquated it is, I still recommend The 7th Guest. $6 is a great price. Its basically a bargain bin price for a retail game. In spite of how poorly The 7th Guest has aged, it is still better than the mountain of garbage Steam has to offer at the same price or more.","November 19, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/recommended/255920/","Nawrusi","Nawrusi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/","789 products in account","Here comes the nostalgia hates. I did not grow up with this game, and this is the first time I have played it. Being honest here I am not just going to give it a thumps up just becouse it is nostalgic to a lot of people. This is a opinion rewiev and if you don`t agree with me, you don`t agree with me.\n\nPresentation:\nWhen you start up the game and click on new game, we get to know the story about a toymaker, and how he build the mansion you are in, and the 7 guests he has invited.\n\nThe story aspect was acually very interesting in the begining, but I felt like the game forgot about an important story towards the end.\n\nI had a problem with the game early on. The save feature was broken, and therefore I had to complete the game in one sitting. This was a problem for me, since I never really found the game interesting enough. maybe your save button is not broken, so this is just a personal problem.\n\nGamepaly:\nThis game is a point and click puzzel game, and it is very generic. The walking around is used by clicking at a place, and you have to search the house in order to find all the puzzels to solve. The puzzels veryes for sliding puzzels, maze puzzels, chess puzzels and the list goes on.\n\nSometimes the puzzels can feel a bit samey, but most of the time the puzzels feel very original.\n\nNow I want to talk about defecullty in this game, becouse I think there should be a difficulty setting. Some of the puzzels are really easy, and others are nearly imposible without a guide from my behalf at least. This really ruined the flow of the game for me, that I had to sit with a guide through a couple of the puzzels, when all they could have done, was making a easyer version of that puzzel, for people that don`t want to spent hours on the same puzzel.\n\nI also found out you can skip all puzzels if you want. This blows my mind that you can remove ALL gameplay for youself. That is really a bad thing for me, since the creator thought this button was nessesary. Eather the game was too hard or they just wanted the game too fell easy.\n\nCharecters:\nSo the charecter. What can i say, you see 6 peaople enter the mansion, you know the main villan is the toymaker, and your charecter has forgotten who he is. All the charecters has visions of them all thrughout the mansion, but I never really feel like I made a conection to them.\n\nAll te 6 guest have a dessire, and the toymaker can grant there wish, but they are killed off, in ways that resemble there dessire. For an eksample, there is a woman that wishes she was younger, and she then becomes a baby.\nThere also is a ghost floting around you never get to know about, and that bugged me. Another flaw in my opinion is that you see that events of the mansion, as you find them, meening that you can spoil some of the ending to start with. This can make the story seem pointless, since you already know alot, before you get to the start of the story.\n\nThe charecters were not that interesting to me, and that is a real downside for me.\n\nVisuels:\nThe animation and grapghics in this game are ofc outdated, but they are still very nice to look at, and the overall house looks very good. All charecters are shown with FMV and the lines are very cheesy. The Chessy charecters combined with the bad FMV makes the game very laughabel at times, and that is a shame for a game trying to be horror in a way.\n\nI also need to tlk about the lines that are repeated throughout the game. If you paly a puzzel to long, the toymaker will coment on it with the same line over and over again. Sometimes this is unavoidable since some of the puzzels takes a long time to solve. I wish I could shut him up, but maybe this is another personal problem\n\nSound/Music:\nThe music in this game is pretty good. I liked most of the music throughout the game. Now the voiceacting can be a bit off at times, but there are some good moments too.\n\nStory:\nSo I breifly talked about the story but here`s the deal. A toymaker makes toys that make children sick, then he builds a mansion for himself and invites 7 people. 6 people + you. Every person comes to the mansion with a dessire rather it is wealth youth love etc. The only charecter without is you, since you have no memeorie, and can`t remember why you are there.\n\nThe rest of the game you have to uncover what happend at the mansion through cutscense you find throughout the mansion. This leads to a really....confusing ending that really made no sense to me, but play for youself to find out.\n\nConclution: Ok this game was not for me, but thats just how it is right? I know this game ment a lot for people back then, but from a newcomers perspective, I can say the game has a lot of weaknesses and flaws. It is boring at times, with puzzels there are too hard, easy or random to solve, with uninspireing FMV and a story that never really interested me.","December 20, 2015","false","9.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It was one of the trailblazing horror games, and has a good kid oriented creep factor (keep in mind, most of these games were aiming for broad scope audiences, ages 13 and up).\n\nThe problems though lay in the lack of various options (such as muting the freaking music).\n\nI recommend this only to a select few whose tastes are in line with video based puzzle solving adventure games, and then again only if you enjoy creepy kid based horror.\n\nPart of the problem with this game is that the puzzles are inconsistent.  They aren't like Zork where you have some sort of logical progression, let alone in game hints.  You're thrown into the house and told there are puzzles, then given little to no indication as to how they may be solved.  This is fine... I mean, it's better than Myst and the broken puzzle system where the developers created puzzles that have NO relationship to the hint system implemented by the artists.... but the problem lay in some of the puzzles being just obtusely boring to solve.\n\nThe cupboard puzzle, for instance is a puzzle with no hints and a bunch of letters - boom, word jumble.  Not really a puzzle, and it's just boring when you get down to it.  Why waste your time with an obtuse word jumble whose answer has NOTHING to do with the plot of the game.  In many ways it feels like an activity book.\n\nI enjoy activity books, and so do some others.\n\nSo if you think of it like that, where it's an activity book with puzzles which are disconnected from the plot and natural progression, then go ahead and buy it!  If you detest puzzles where you know the general idea of how to solve the puzzle, but consider solving it to be mindless busy work, then ignore the game.\n\nSeriously, this game is no Zork when you get down to it.","February 1, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

How so? Was it mostly because of its technical merits, with the gameplay actually lacking? Was it not that memorable? My memories of the game are very fond, One of the rare few games that struck me as creepy, and, as a kid, actually somewhat scary, definitely not forgettable. But let's revisit it and see.\n\nFirst off, for a 22-23 year old game, the graphics have aged remarkably well. Thanks to the prerendered backgrounds, which, though obviously and definitely not as flashy now as they most definitely were for 1993, are actually managing not to look bad, and the house is well designed and, hey, makes sense, with plenty of nice little details. The cutscenes / character scenes, though obviously grainy, are still good enough for what this is. The creepiness factor is still there, helped immensely by The Fat Man's very well integrated soundtrack and great sounds, voices, screams, random spooky sounds, the game is still damn atmospheric - I full well remembered the dread I felt as a kid when white noise would start marking the beginning of the sequences - that change in sound texture, likely brought on by techical issues, like the transparence of actors, actually helped the atmosphere. And that's pretty great.\n\nSo yeah, the atmosphere is lovely and delightfully creepy, the game still looks and sounds damn nice for what it is, oh, and the story isn't half bad, though a bit chaotically narrated through randomly triggered cutscenes. But what about the gameplay itself? Honestly, a mixed bag. A major problem and a drag is the lag between the screens while moving, which is "softened", but quite irritating nonetheless. It had its reasons back than, but a faster flow would've been a boon. The game doesn't really hold your hand, at all, which is a plus, but, back in the day, revisiting rooms randomly to find if something new's suddenly unlocked itself actually gave meat to a game you paid good money for and expected to last at least somewhat. Now, it's slightly less appreciated. Which brings us to the puzzles. Honestly - a mixed bag. Simplistic, somewhat varied, but you do see 2 to 3 variations on the theme. The "infection" puzzle is pretty great, with a trickier AI than one would expect, but some, including the last two, actually only function as a challenge by not being immediately understandable. If you like puzzles where most of the puzzle is actually determining what the base rules are, with the goals being far from evident, you will like this. There are apparently hints in the in-game library, but with the screen to screen transitions that slow, it's a chore to go there (and that's actually good). "Ego", your "character", comments on several, and so does Stauf - and it can be really, really effective (especially Stauf's mocking/laughter), but slightly too repetitive in a good percentage of cases.\n\nA major issue with the moving is the fact that whenever you go to the menu, to save for example, when you return, you're dumped back at the "first" screen of a room. While that can function as a shortcut in a few rooms (first hall, upstairs hallway), you really don't want to do that in the maze - as it WILL return you to the beginning - forcing you to start all over and even redo the easy slider puzzle at the very beginning. And that's a major drag. There are shortcuts between floors in several rooms, so that's a plus I guess, though I found I only used one or two.\n\nAnd there you have it, an atmospheric adventure game that has aged somewhat gracefully and manages to tell a fine story in a chaotic manner forcing you to explore its compilation of puzzles, solid in number, of wildly different quality and difficulty using slightly frustrating movement. You can do much worse in the genre, and it's been nice to revisit it. Just remember, it's 22 years old!","November 9, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was one of the trailblazing horror games, and has a good kid oriented creep factor (keep in mind, most of these games were aiming for broad scope audiences, ages 13 and up).\n\nThe problems though lay in the lack of various options (such as muting the freaking music).\n\nI recommend this only to a select few whose tastes are in line with video based puzzle solving adventure games, and then again only if you enjoy creepy kid based horror.\n\nPart of the problem with this game is that the puzzles are inconsistent.  They aren't like Zork where you have some sort of logical progression, let alone in game hints.  You're thrown into the house and told there are puzzles, then given little to no indication as to how they may be solved.  This is fine... I mean, it's better than Myst and the broken puzzle system where the developers created puzzles that have NO relationship to the hint system implemented by the artists.... but the problem lay in some of the puzzles being just obtusely boring to solve.\n\nThe cupboard puzzle, for instance is a puzzle with no hints and a bunch of letters - boom, word jumble.  Not really a puzzle, and it's just boring when you get down to it.  Why waste your time with an obtuse word jumble whose answer has NOTHING to do with the plot of the game.  In many ways it feels like an activity book.\n\nI enjoy activity books, and so do some others.\n\nSo if you think of it like that, where it's an activity book with puzzles which are disconnected from the plot and natural progression, then go ahead and buy it!  If you detest puzzles where you know the general idea of how to solve the puzzle, but consider solving it to be mindless busy work, then ignore the game.\n\nSeriously, this game is no Zork when you get down to it.","February 1, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

I'm sure that this game was scary at the time but as of now it has definitely not aged well. This is an FMV point and click adventure game where you explore a mansion where you have to solve puzzles (About 10 or so). Also usually games of this nature are very cryptic so if you have played these kinds of games before like Monkey Island and you keep finding yourself lost, then this is not the game for you. However if you are up for a challenge the game is fairly competent for an early FMV Adventure and there isn't anything that I found that would deviate from it being good.\n\nGameplay: All it really is is a puzzle fest, but it does it's job of being a puzzle fest. 7/10\nGraphics: For it's time FMV in games was sort of a new thing and no one knew what to\nexpect, this was one of the first. 8/10\nMusic: You will mainly hear midi sounds nothing too special. 7/10\nControl: The mouse works fine. 7/10\nKeeping Interest: I played this game on scummvm and I made it to the 3rd-4th puzzle. This is why the time steam says I played isn't that much. Like I said the game hasn't aged well so for me it didn't keep my interest for that long because the puzzles were too cryptic for me but for others it might not be. 6/10\n\nAverage Score: 7/10","June 15, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The acting...not so much.\n\n7th Guest is an intresting look back at the FMV games of the 90's.  You find yourself trapped inside a toy makers mansion surrouned by ghostly guests and have to slove puzzles to uncover the story.  And thats about it.  you move around the house with point and click controls similar to the original Myst.  Occasionally you'll come across one of the games many chessey FMV scenes or a logic puzzle you have to solve to advance the plot and unlock new areas of the house.\n\nThe puzzles are nice and varied although its not always obivious what your trying to do with some of them.  The interface works but is kind of clunky and the game is pretty slow as you have to click on the area you want to move to and then basically watch a cut scene of the camera moving to the clicked area. again very Myst.\n\nI said before the FMV is cheesey and by that i mean its bad.  the quality of the video is very dated and pixelated and the acting is terrible.  You can tell they had to film the scenes and then dub the audio over them later so all the actors look like vaudville preformers and the dialouge is hammy as hell.  that being said its so strange that it will at least hold your attention.\n\nThe game is meant to be a horror game but the music is so cheesey and mismatched that it kills any sense of dread or athmosphere.  It sounds more like i'm at a carnivale rather than a haunted house.\n\nComplaints aside this game is B-movie fun and the puzzles are pretty solid.

Loaded it up out of a mix of curiosity and nostalgia, and before I knew it I had beaten the game, and wasted my entire day off.  Of course it's dated and clunky, but every once in a while that very clunkyness will add to the suspense.  There's a very real sense of satisfaction which comes from solving the more challenging puzzles.  Oh god the puzzles.  They range from pleasantly distracting to downright sadistic.  The worse offenders will have you backtracking for what seems like hours.  I found the chess puzzles to be particularly infuriating.  My heart set to racing on more than once occasion, from the challenge alone.  Younger audiences will probably be deterred by just how dated this seems, but I was swept away from the charm inherent to that era.  The acting is just about as broad and cheesy as you'd expect, partially due to the low video quality.  It somewhat reminds me of old silent movies, with actors mugging it as hard as they possibly can simply to be understood.  The live-action video director mentions in the included making of video (nice touch by the way) that the actors were encouraged to 'use their whole body' when speaking.  It's frikkin' great.  Took me about 7 hours to make it through the entire thing, even while attempting to cheat my way through the more head smashy against the wallsy bits, and I'm quite glad I did.
