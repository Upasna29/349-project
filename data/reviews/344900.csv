THE BUGS I FOUND HAVE BEEN FIXED!!! I found out you can smash barrels and crates and even explosive barrels which boomed in my face after smashing with a crowbar. But you can find goodies inside wooden barrels and crates. The world is pretty dead and the ambience is good, the graphics make an excellent job at showing off a dead world with zombies. I love how you can ride vehicles and need to fill your gas tank. I haven't gone far into the game yet but it's enjoyable and really cheap. You can also drive a dirtbike and get a boat or other vehicles which all require fuel, i also plan to add a survival guide when i get better in the game, unless someone else writes one :D Addictive little game!!!!!!!","September 25, 2015","true","2.0"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","33","41","0","10"

How do you finish this bloody game? It won't tell you. It refuses interrogation of any kind. Your only clue is a constantly repeated CB radio message telling you that you've called for help but 'zombies are still sighted in the area'. Kill all the zombies, you say? I HAVE. I HAVE SCOURED THE EARTH OF THE UNDEAD MENACE. And yet, no help comes. Not ever. I'm beginning to think there is none. There's only two of us here now. Me and the unkillable fish in the river. And I've lost the boat.\nOther than the lack of endgame driving me insane, it's a decent game that I have practically no choice but to thumbs up for the meagre asking price. It has some issues with its easy difficulty and map slogging that I go into more detail with in the video below but, in all, a very playable timewaster.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv5iCsUCwBU","September 25, 2015","true","2.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","17","21","8","3"

It would be cool to be able to map keys, and possibly add the ability to strafe (please say yes please say yes please say yes). Also, for some odd yet amusing reason, every time I accidentally hit the enter key (klutz error on my part), the player starts swimming through the ground. So there's a couple of bugs that can use squashing as well. But for 2 bucks? I'm not complaining. Honestly, I'd be willing to pay more just to enjoy the game to its fullest potential.","September 28, 2015","true","0.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You can always find the same item in the same place; there is no random drop system. The controls are difficult to get used to and you cannot change them or any settings period as far as I saw. Eventualy, after you die 2-5 times, the game gets boring because of no variation. I might change this review if these reasons I gave are fixed.","October 10, 2015","false","0.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Fun little game, dying will really make you cuss. Most annoying though, if you load a save all the zombies you killed come back. Also, am finding that the crowbar you find in the car in the beginning is the best weapon, just walk backwards and swing like crazy and you'll kill them without damage to your health. The gun is satisfying but I am having trouble keeping my ammo when fighting HORDES of zombies that respawned, though the ammo does NOT respawn. Just play it in one session and you won't experience this annoyance.\nOverall though, great way to waste some time, without wasting money. Can't go wrong for an entertaining game that costs 2 dollars.","September 29, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This game satisfied both my inner NES, and my desire to roam free in a sandbox world.  Arcade shooter action mixed with just the right amount of exploration makes this game great fun (poised to be super fun, when the bugs are overcome--and they will be, so no complaints).
