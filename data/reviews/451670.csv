The graphics are very good for the price tag, being 2.5D, and the textures are fine as well. The air fighters, bombers, tanks, vehicles, etc. are well designed. The atmosphere takes action across Europe, where you have to fight the Germans in every country. There is much grass, waters, trees, as well as villages, airports, alleys, etc. The audio is very enjoyable, they make you feel like a true patriotic soldier. The airplane crashes are alright, also the explosions are well made. The gameplay is pretty much just to destroy air fighters, vehicles, boats, tanks, etc. You can go either close to the land (small altitude) or in the skies (high altitude). The small altitude is for collecting coins and for killing the terrestrial enemies. The high altitude is for destroying the aerial enemies. The engines are pretty nice, I haven't met any bugs/crashes/lagging. The air fighter can maneuver, turn forward/back/left/right can go very fast (with turbo), also you can set the speed of the air fighter, and mostly it can shoot air strikes, bombs, machine gun bullets, as well as cooling, repairing, ammo resupplying, gas filling, etc. Overall, it's an enjoyable and relaxing game, if you are into strategy and indie game, but I can recommend it to any gamer as well.\n\nStrong PointsPretty nice graphics\nGood soundtrack and explosions\nChallenging gameplay\nMany areas and environments\nThree difficulties available\nMany types of enemies\nBig areas to fight in\nItâ€™s a pretty long game\nWeak PointsThe instructions\nConvoys are hard to fight for the first air fighter which you receive\nUnclear campaign menu\nGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 8/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nAudio: 9/10\nGameplay: 7.5/10\nStory: N/A\nEngines: 8.5/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 8.2/10","April 18","true","1.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","16","19","3","0"

And it also offers up and down pitch movement.\nThere is a lot of stuff you can use to complete your missions. eg. rockets,bombs,smg gun, etc etc\nAs you progress you can check out the shops in game or in menu for upgrades.\n\nI suggest you try this game out , the price is really good vs the content , Have fun!\n\nPros:\n~ War birds offers a very good looking 2.5D setup\n~ Sounds are well produced ,clear and precise\n~ Lots of fun for all ages\n\nCons:\n~ The only con i could find was anyone with motion sickness dont look at the screen while someones playing\n\nOverall: 8/10.","May 22","true","4.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Tip: dont just spam the bullets needlessly as the guns can overheat quickly.\n\nIt's pretty retro, I guess its meant to be since its based off historical events.\n\n\n\n","March 22","true","3.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

Interesting how I've seen a lot of this kind of game set in WW2 or WW1. The ability to change  between pure overhead and 3/4 overhead cameras is a nice feature, the controls are simple enough, and the gameplay can range between lunch-break easy to plan-it-out difficult.","March 18","true","3.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

There is already 5 differents language and i've seen some new languages and update some time ago on the front page.\nMy small request is to get the manual translate on different language.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kevinknows/recommended/451670/","kevinknows","Maggie Greene","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kevinknows/","409 products in account","Product received for free\n\nA fairly interesting and exciting game for those who like war-themed games. It's great and somewhat entertaining, however it's not without it's flaws. The menu and the instructions really unclear. I ended up accidentally buying two sets of magazines in the beginning because I wasn't sure if I had already bought it. There was no notification whatsoever upon purchase. I'm pretty sure navigating through the main menu was more of a challenge than the first few games itself.\n\nThe amount of spelling and grammatical mistakes in the game is also incredibly high for a game that's being sold on Steam. Made me question whether or not this game was proof checked before it was released. I saw that they just added two additional languages (French and Dutch) into the game  a few weeks ago. Perhaps they should start focusing on the base language of the game first instead of adding new ones.\n\nFlaws aside however, the gameplay is actually pretty nice. The graphics are acceptable (could've been better, but I'm not going to complain; each game has their own style), the sound effects are quite on point and the game itself is neither too easy nor it is too hard. Overall I would recommend this game - even more if the minor messes I mentioned above get fixed. But you get roughly what you paid for, if not more.","May 18","true","3.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/underpr1/recommended/451670/","underpr1","Undersniper1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/underpr1/","1265 products in account","This simulate game is about world war two air combats planes which fight in many missions with a smooth and realistic graphics. Mainly in the main menu area you have a few interesting things to watch like sergeant aircrew, hanger, stats, shop.\n\nSergeant Aircrew: which mean when you will be promoted by highter rank, you will receive salary and unlock new function. special skills (canon, maneuver, double rockets, bombing, air strike, turbo, mass blitz, rocket). Once you get gold you can buy endurance, speed upgrade, ammunition, armor, fuel, radar, weapons, etc.\n\nHangar: mean you can buy 4 types planes except one is for free. Also there have his functions or what contain each plane choosen. Also you can see his customization and description which is very detailed.\n\nStats/combat: you can see your and each detailed progress done of the entire game.\n\nShop: you can do more strong your planes by upgrading parts and misc using your gold.\n\nControls: is very huge and varied with multiple weapons to use that can be changed in input tab just before you open the game. This part is very recommended because there is a popup link which explain you everything in a pdf manual. Enough say that it contain pictures which teach you everything of his functions in map,etc.\n\nOptions: sound and music are great. Have two type camera perspective and orthographic.\n\nOnce you enter in campaign mode you will see and face the missions but just before starting there is a play briefing which contain three types of difficulties pilot(give you 300 gold reward), fighter(give you 300 gold reward) and veteran(give you 500 gold reward). You start with a single warplane which is very limited so you will need to gain lot of gold to buy better warplanes and for increase your weapons and upgrades to face many types of air, ground and naval enemies. The rest is predictable and fun.\n\n\nSince i'm not finished the game yet i'm still addicted and enjoying a lot. Also more than a simple game is rich and very descriptive in the meaning of learning real history which i have learned things unknown. If you plan play an world war 2 game and don't know what to do this is your chance and try it, you won't be dissappointed. I rate this 95% Recommended.","March 29","true","49.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I attempted to figure out how to upgrade to further action...to no avail. After spending several hours....attempting to correct this mattter, I just gave up...and consider it a losing effort on my part. So, the game allows you to go thru and fight...say 50% of the European countries....and that is when you cannot go any futher. I gave  up attempting to figure it out....it's a losing battle...so to speak. It's probably worth a couple of bucks...but that is all its worth. Go elsewhere with another game that works correctly.

Now when I go into War Birds: WW2 Air strike 1942, to another game and genre (2.5D air combat game), I like this too. There a lot of cool features: many enemies (tanks, warships, artillery), you can upgrade your warplanes making it more effective in battle, various types of planes (Avro Lancaster, Morane Saulnier 406, Supermarine Spitfire, but my favorite is Avia B-534) and around 130 (!) missions (not bad for indie game, right?). Unfortunately, War Birds: WW2 Air strike 1942 not so perfect, as I want to see it :( Soundtrack... where is he? I only hear shots, bomb explodes, aircraft engine noise and some more in-game sounds, but no background music. Also silence in main menu.
