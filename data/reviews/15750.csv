I remember waking up early before school and playing before the day had even begun. Its a fantastic blend between 1st and 3rd person view that no other game has seemed to capture.  It looks great and plays even better for its age. And the crude, dark humor really makes it a part of the Oddworld universe. I will never forget my first runthrough of this game. One of my top five games of all time, hands down.\n\nBuy it.","October 7, 2014","true","1.1"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","58","63","0","0"

It's a third-person FPS, but not really, because you are usually shooting tools rather than bullets. It's a personal story of a bounty hunter who's only in it for the money, except when it absolutely isn't. It's a methodical game of eliminating enemies with stealth and cunning – whenever it doesn't happen to be a game about massive explosions. Not even the tutorial seems to grasp quite what this is. Odd, but sort of brilliant at the same time.","January 24, 2014","true","12.6"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","48","50","0","0"

When comparing this HD version to the original, you can see that this is one of the best remastered jobs out there. The game still looks very good by today's standards with all the settings cranked up (via Nvidia Control Panel).\n\nThis game also has one of the most innovative mechanics I've come across in a while: live ammo. You must hunt your ammo. This is a really cool twist and the ammo variety is quite great. The bounty system in the first half of the game is really fun and the second half succeeds as an action game as well. The blend of third/first person is also done particularly well.\n\nIt's hard for me to really have any complaints witht this game. I was just surprised at how much fun I had playing it. If you missed it the first time or even played the original, I highly highly reccomend picking this title up. Here's hoping a sequel can eventually be made to expound on this Wild West gem.","February 7, 2015","true","11.8"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","29","29","4","0"

You switch between the modes as you explore the strange Oddworld landscape. So you would do some jumping puzzles and then blast away the enemies with your crossbow. The crossbow is powered by live animals which you pick up as you travel along. You can pick up stingbees that rapidly fire at the enemies or spiders that web them and many more. The mechanic is a bit bulky because you constantly have to switch between 3rd and 1st person. The world itself is beautiful with various landscapes from forests to deserts to icy tundras and mechanical fortresses. It's a very fun game but a bit frustrating sometimes even on normal difficulty. The battle before the final boss was pretty ridiculous with enemies chain stunning you so you have no chance to survive (except luck).

The game allows you to seamlessly alternate between a third-person view for ease of mobility, and a first-person view for shooting the critters at foes and obstacles. Every level brings on a diverse challenge that can be approached differently each time and delivers enjoyable boss fights that can be demanding enough to make you rethink your strategy. The story is interesting and comical and introduces twists and turns that completely change the atmosphere of the game without going too far out into the bizzare. It IS an oddworld, after all.\n\nOn the downside, Stranger's Wrath suffers from some aggravating glitches and performance flaws that remind you of the horrors that follow game ports. Issues such as loading errors, frame-rate drop, achievements not unlocking, textures missing, and incorrect subtitles are littered throughout the game. Stranger, the protagonist, has poor voice acting and every creature of the same species has the SAME voice-over which easily breaks the personality of the subservient characters, and diminishes the quality of the game itself. There is not much progression other than unlocking unique ammo and some minor upgrades. Most of the more interesting unlocks are not revealed until much later in the game, but at that point it really starts get a lot more exciting and fun.\n\nOverall, I found the game to be satisfying to the end. Playing on hard and attempting to capture the enemies alive rather than dead makes the game challenging, but not at all frustrating. With a little patience to tolerate the technical flaws, Stranger's Wrath can be a very enjoyable experience. Out of all the games included in the Oddbox anthology, this one is by far the best out of the four.","July 16, 2013","true","9.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefirstdigit/recommended/15750/","thefirstdigit","プレリュード","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefirstdigit/","24 products in account","Stranger's Wrath is a really mindblowing and innovating game. Being 11 years old it still hold gameplay and mechanics, that are solid to this day. This game was so far ahead of its time.\nAs a player you will get a huge amount of content, a huge variety of ammo and loads of different ways to complete the levels. You play as a bounty hunter and you are equipped with a crossbow, that uses ammo in forms of critters that you hunt. That means you shoot down bad guys with spiders, fuzzles or even bats! You choose yourself how you will deploy this ammo, as they all has their own purpose; wrap them in web, deploy as a living mine or shoot a living skunk that makes the enemy throw up. The games really leaves you with a whole lot of choices. You even get to decide if you want to kill the bandits, or catch them alive for a bigger bounty.\n\nThe enviroment is great and I don't usually like deserts, but I found this one fun and exciting. It was in no way empty. As the game progress you are taken from the desert to the forest, temples, jungles and even more places, so the scenery constantly changes, with a lot of lore and detail, which keeps the player constantly occupied. Together with a lot of content and challenges, this really wraps up a good experience. I found to have ZERO problems playing this game and had no crashes at all. I was even surprised of how well and good the control and camera were. I felt it was made for PC. I did experience only getting the 'Easy'-achievement, even though I finished it on 'Hard'. All other achivements worked and I am sure this is not a common thing. The Achievements are fun and interesting to complete. They are realistic, but hard, so I would recommend doing them. Fun and a good challenge.\n\nFor people who played the previous Oddworld games: You are in for a treat! Even though Abe and Munch is far away and not present, the keen eye will spot references and items from RuptureFarms and such. Even some of the wildlife that lives in these parts, also exists in Abe's part of Oddworld. The two are woven good together and the old-school fan will surely feel some nostalgia when noticing those things. The story is as always extremely good and really reflects on things from our real world. The game has a great message that is delivered with an awesome storytelling and interesting gameplay.\n\nThis game's mechanics and content easily beats todays big games. They have always been very creative, the guys behind these games. The game is also very re-playable, which games rarely are.\n\n9.5/10\n*Would have been 10 if the Hard-achievement had worked for me.\n","January 9","true","16.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Mine happened to occur after the Oddworld Inhabitants logo came and left, leaving me with an error stating the Game Has Stopped Working.\n\nAfter doing some research, it appears that this port of OSW from Just Add Water (JAW) has only recieved one patch since this whole debacle started about a year ago, and since then, nothing from what i can tell. They seem content with leaving this game behind, with numerous issues, as the only dev comment I've seen on my particular issue was roughly eight months ago.\n\nOther frequent issues I've seen thoughout my research include:\n-Crashes occuring in the tutorial level\n-Game succeeding in loading main menu to only show a black screen.\n-Instances where Stranger does not move\n-Taxing on graphics cards. Possibly poorly optimised\n\nThis is all extrememely disappointing as the game was a classic from 3 console generations past, and probably one of my favorite games ever made. This makes the fact that I will be contacting Steam for my money back, much more aggrivating.\n\nIf you must own this game, check out it's offering on GoG.com, as I have heard that they include the non-HD version of the game with the HD port, and I've heard that this may run better. Or, if you have a console that this port was re-released on, buy there. I've not seen issues for those ports.\n\nSupport Oddworld Inhabitants by buying their stuff directly, such as their recently released OST for Strangers Wrath. Please do not support JAW, or at the very least, don't support their PC endeavors by buying this port. The port is utter trash that it will only work for some of the people who paid for it, and JAW is as well for not stepping up to fix their problems, and leaving a classic like this in such a horrible state.","March 3, 2014","false","1.0"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","26","39","0","2"

You are a bounty hunter who works his way up from capturing and turning in wanted criminals for Moolah. The reason why is becasue he needs an operation quickly but it costs 20,000 Moolah. You play a character simply called Stranger who uses like ammo to trap his enemies which is the only way you can turn them in.\n\n+ The game looks great and live, throughout the game every place looks great and diffrent which keeps you intrested. The option menu is good since there is alot of diffrent options for the grathics so most computers can run the game.\n\n+ Storyline works well and since you will get paid differently depending whether you capture them dead or alive, but of course its harder to capture them alive bt you will get paid more. You also get to choose what bounty you want to go get which give you more freedom.\n\n+ There is a good length in this game since its around 10 hours on easy, 12 hours on medium and 15 hours on hard. This a good amount of time, you will get more time if you try to bounty everyone and explore the surroundings thoughout the game.\n\n+ Stranger's Wrath can be a hard game at times, first few hours are fine but then it starts getting alot harder and you will die alot at some points in the game. Its at a good level of difficulty since its not too hard that you want to give up, the game will make you want to get though the hard parts which makes it very rewarding when you get though it.\n\n+ The controls are good and work well with the keyboard and mouse, you can also change the keys to what ever you would like which is great since they can be changed to your liking. Only problem is that Stranger's Wrath does not have controller support.\n\n+ The music is great, it fits perfectly and does not get boring or repetitive. The music mainly plays when your exploring or when your fighting bosses, this works well because it really fits in with the mood of the scene. You can get the soundtrack from the Oddworld website for free.\n\n+ Having Steam Achievements and a good story means that there are some Replayability in the game since you can go back to complete all the achievements or just play th egame again. There is not much but there is enough.\n\n+ Stranger's Wrath is ten years old now. The HD edition is now five years old. It still holds up and looks good to this day. I dont think it will look outdated in some time now.\n\n- The PC port is bad! Really bad. Most computer will be able to run the game but the main problem is that the frame rate is always really low... I get around 25 to 30 on a R9 280X. It you want the game then be prepared.\n\n- For some reason Stranger's Wrath HD is really buggy, the original game isnt but this is. There are lots of bugs and some of them are game breaking. Since they dont update the game anymore you will have to put up with it... Real shame is I love the Oddworld franchise.\n\nOverall I would say Stranger's Wrath HD is a great and fun game that most people will like. Its original and diffrent which is whats great about Oddworld. I rate Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD an 8 out of 10. I would recommend the game if you can put up with the port and the bugs.","January 12, 2015","true","13.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","Bounty huntin' platformer that's mostly a first-person shooter where your only real weapon is a crossbow that only fires living ammunition. There's a third person perspective but I only really found myself using that perspective for travelling and checking from behind cover. It ain't a traditional Oddworld game though it does take place in the same universe.\n\nEach town you go to has a bounty you can take to earn moolah which can be used to get yourself some upgrades or other possibly useful items. Each bounty or boss aren't entirely unique to one another though there can be an enjoyment had in each of 'em. After a town's been exhausted of its bounties you move on to travel to another town with bounties you can accept.\nFinding your next objective for the most part isn't always obvious or pointed out either. Directions are generally figured out by talking to townsfolk.\nEach type of ammo is used strategically whether you're planning on being sneaky or just straight up running in firing hornets at full auto, taking in baddies dead or alive, it's up to you.\nThe stealth isn't very in-depth so learning from and manipulating it to your advantage shouldn't be very difficult especially since the AI can be as dumb as the characters they portray.","April 30, 2015","true","14.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Then this might just be the game for you. Oh and it takes place on an alien world where everything is crazy too.\n\nThis game is great fun; it starts off a little slow but once it gets rolling you will have a hard time putting it down. Set in oddworld you know it’s going to be crazy. Every mission and town you go through has its own little narrative and everything seems to be an adventure all culminating in an epic tale of vengeance and surgery…..yes.\n\nI loved the bounty system, it’s one of my favourite things in any game and in this one it’s great. Take people in alive and get paid more money, even bosses can be brought in alive. It just adds another layer of challenge to the title. Something about collecting them all drove me to obsession.\n\nThe story and world are obviously fantastic, neither are expanded on greatly but they add a sense that there is a lot more going on in the world around you and you are just carving your way through a very tiny part of it. The character you portray is a man of few words and that just adds to the mystery of who he is and what he wants.\n\nNow we talk about the weapon, you only get one but with the HUGE amount of ammo (living critters you catch and shoot at bad guys) you will not be disappointed. It is one of the most unique weapons I have used in any game and with all the upgrades you can get throughout the adventure it always seems new and fresh.\n\nThe combat is fast paced and seamlessly switches from third person fighter to first person shooter. Both have their place and neither feels tacked on. There are tons of environments to explore and fight in and so many enemies to kill or capture each with their own personality. And the difficulty could be pretty brutal in places.\n\nI would recommend this game if you have a few hours to spare and want to get taken into a world that’s more crazy and odd than most. The npc’s are huge chickens for gods sake. On sale you have to have this.\n\nHave Fun ^_^\n","June 10, 2015","true","19.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Didn't have an original Xbox back in the day and when they released the HD version it was riddled with hella bugs. But now I finally gave it a whirl!\n\nStrangers Wrath is a unique blend of 3rd person platforming and 1st person shooting. Most of the game evolves around bountyhunting outlaws, those little bossfights give you room for lethal and even nonlethal approaches which you'll want to do to earn more moolah. True to the universe, the world is hella ...odd, one cool aspect is that the ammo for your gun are living critters which you need to hunt to restock constantly. There are almost a dozen different critters to use to give room for the own preferred playstyle. The game never got boring, allthough the first half until a certain reveal might overstay its welcome a little bit. But what happens leading up to the games end is ridiculous and definitely worth seeing.\n\nAs expected and reported numerously, Strangers Wrath HD comes with some hefty technical shortcomings. This is as barebones as a PC port can get, I had to fiddle with graphical settings for almost half an hour until I had no strange FPS problems or weird bugs like my character not being able to move forward (Tip: turn vsync on!). There is controller support but it's not good, the game lets you rebind all the buttons but prompts show up as JOY1, JOY2. Fortunately the keyboard+mouse controls are totally fine and give benefits when aiming in first person mode.\n\nStrangers Wrath is a really really cool game which combines 3rd person and 1st person action unlike anything I've seen before and ultimately -considering it's over 10 years old at this point- left me very impressed. The world and its characters are exactly what you expect when Lorne Lanning gets to work his magic. Speaking of which, he really should make a new game!","June 6, 2015","true","7.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

And you need that money like no one else because there is something very wrong with your health and the only way to fix it is a very costly operation." Ok so having that goal of (oh no massive spoilers...) 20,000 moolah (yes thats the currency, and yes I know thats epic...) means that you have to resort to becoming a bounty hunter. Now you may think that sounds pretty cool, but think again... it's even better then you could have ever wanted! you are equipped with the Critter Crossbow, (and again it's as epic as it sounds) a crossbow that fires live ammunition, i.e Zappflies, Thudslugs, Stingbees and more! (i think the names are fairly self explanitory there) So equipped with this ammo you set off claiming bounties and slowly earning moolah... but then some stuff happens that if I told you would be incredibly huge spoilers so i won't tell you about them.\n\nI highly reccomend this game to anyone who even just vaugly likes FPS games.\n\n10/10, would run around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ animal again.","February 22, 2015","true","16.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Instead of guns The Stranger uses a crossbow that fires animals and each animal gives you different ways to approach enemies. The difficulty on Normal is actually well balanced, it’s not punishing but you need to play smart. This falls apart in the last section in the game with a stupid difficulty spike where you have to escape an area before it explodes and right after that is a boss fight with two minibosses that can infinite you to death. I did beat the game but because of this I suggest playing on Easy and save yourself some headache.\n\nPeople seem to have some trouble with crashes and the like, but I didn’t run into any.

My PC has the capabilities to run far more demanding games, such as Skyrim, but somehow falls flat when trying to run a game that was released on the original xbox. When I purchase a game I expect it to run perfectly, as advertised, without me having to fiddle around within the depths of its folders or what not. This does not run perfectly. It is unplayable in its current state. The game will constantly freeze for periods of increasing length the longer you play; the longest being at least 20 seconds. I have only managed to trudge through this to the end of the tutorial until it becomes unbareable. This was a waste of my money, and that's so disappointing to hear myself say as I love the Oddworld series and was willing to support them, but this is simply unplayable.

Abe never felt like he fit in with a 3D platformer and with Munch being tied to Abe... Stranger was a good alternative to explore Oddworld in a 3D envrioment. It was a risk; and one that payed off in aces. It introduces gameplay mechanics and an immersive story that devs struggle, more often then not, fail in leaps to pull off today.\n\nYou hunt your bounties with live ammo and it's up to you to decide how to do it, or If you want to chuck the bounties in the slammer or get rid of them for good.\n\nThe more useful ammo, such as bolimites, fuzzles and chipmunks come up quite freqnetly and is often high in the ammo department, while some of the more damaging creatures are rare. The game does push you towards getting the enemies alive through the abundant ammo of that nature and higher payout, but it's also often a lot harder for that route. Which makes two distinct playstyles and either way, you need to get creative.\n\nBosses are often tough, and require good knowledge of your ammo in order to capture them alive.\n\nWith the game itself out of the way, lets talk about the port.\n\nMany people have seen issues with performance, on my 7970, it runs well and I've never seen a problem.

He  collects a bounty and returns for a reward. Like you'd probably imagine, you get more if you can bring in the target alive. Stranger is indeed a strange animal, and it's pretty cool how well he fits into the world of this particular Oddworld game. He really does give off a gun-slinger vibe.\n\nUnfortunately, all this is hindered by very poor optimization. It's an HD port but yet will not let you output above 720p, the option is there, however the resolution will not display correctly (check out the threads about it on the hub), what's worse is that the developers and the people who ported the project have never listened to the community and tried to fix this problem. It's just all around bad support for this specific product and thats5a shame because I really wanted to enjoy this at 1080p or 4k possibly. It just won't display properly, no matter the rig, no matter the gpu.\n\nAnother problem is the frustrating button mapping. It's horrendous and a pain but must be done if you wish to use a controller. By the time you finish you have to have faith and if it doesnt work you must exit the game and redo it all over again, hoping you get it right this time. It's frustrating and frankly a waste of time. This is one of the few action/adventure games that I feel may actually be easier use mouse and keyboard because mappingthe buttons for your controller is such a pain. My experience was with the Xbox 360 controller and it was shocking how bad this experience turned out.\n\nThis may be the worst HD Remaster port on Steam.

An incredible amount of love and thought went into this, and it's immediately apparent. The originality, humor, gameplay, and meaningful undertones all come together to form an unforgettable experience.\n\nThis game is simply... fun(ny). You can listen in on the hilarious dialogue of any character, laugh at the attention-♥♥♥♥♥ chipmunk farting on your crossbow and being "allergic to your ugliness", lose yourself in Michael Bross' amazing soundtrack, appreciate the truly unique design and setting, punch complacent chickens in the face and steal their money, notice the parallels between harmonious peoples being subverted by industrialism and a people out of allignment with nature; the list goes on.\n\nThe gameplay is intense and both 1st and 3rd-person views are fluid and change seamlessly. The animal-ammo system is as awesome as it is funny, with each animal serving a specific purpose so you have a lot of options on how you defeat your enemies.\n\nBeing an Oddworld game, the humor is what you'd expect... It's ♥♥♥♥in' hilarious! There's a lot of unabashed humor and when you really listen to lots of characters, things get funnier. I've never laughed so much from somebody saying "I like oatmeal" before. Oddworld's humor always makes me happy, and games that make you laugh this much are doing something very right! It's just so entertaining.\n\nIs it original? Well just look at a few screenshots of the game and you'll see there isn't anything out there like it. The characters are interesting, and Stranger (the one you play as) is pretty badass. The environments and music combine to create an other-worldy feel, different yet similar to the previous games, but still of it's own. Originality is an Oddworld staple.\n\nThe story is good, but I don't want to reveal anything so I'll just say it has heavy environmental undertones. It's in no way preachy, but the connections between native peoples being killed off by a more powerful and "civilized" culture is definitely there, and it makes you think.

An incredible amount of love and thought went into this, and it's immediately apparent. The originality, humor, gameplay, and meaningful undertones all come together to form an unforgettable experience.\n\nThis game is simply... fun(ny). You can listen in on the hilarious dialogue of any character, laugh at the attention-♥♥♥♥♥ chipmunk farting on your crossbow and being "allergic to your ugliness", lose yourself in Michael Bross' amazing soundtrack, appreciate the truly unique design and setting, punch complacent chickens in the face and steal their money, notice the parallels between harmonious peoples being subverted by industrialism and a people out of allignment with nature; the list goes on.\n\nThe gameplay is intense and both 1st and 3rd-person views are fluid and change seamlessly. The animal-ammo system is as awesome as it is funny, with each animal serving a specific purpose so you have a lot of options on how you defeat your enemies.\n\nBeing an Oddworld game, the humor is what you'd expect... It's ♥♥♥♥in' hilarious! There's a lot of unabashed humor and when you really listen to lots of characters, things get funnier. I've never laughed so much from somebody saying "I like oatmeal" before. Oddworld's humor always makes me happy, and games that make you laugh this much are doing something very right! It's just so entertaining.\n\nIs it original? Well just look at a few screenshots of the game and you'll see there isn't anything out there like it. The characters are interesting, and Stranger (the one you play as) is pretty badass. The environments and music combine to create an other-worldy feel, different yet similar to the previous games, but still of it's own. Originality is an Oddworld staple.\n\nThe story is good, but I don't want to reveal anything so I'll just say it has heavy environmental undertones. It's in no way preachy, but the connections between native peoples being killed off by a more powerful and "civilized" culture is definitely there, and it makes you think. This is a fictionized example of a very real and re-occuring issue in humanity. To me this is the icing on the cake, because not only is this a great game but it promotes a more positive and sustainable direction for humanity; living in harmony with nature and not against it.\n\nSince this game has so much sentimental value to me, I don't see many downsides, but other people might.

It's an FPS platformer that switches regularly from first and third person. What's unique about the game is the main character doesn't use guns. Instead the player uses a crossbow that fires small animals known as "critters" that do specific effects on enemies. As a result the game is a lot more stealth based then one might expect from such a title.\n\nThat isn't to say it's not without it's flaws. It's fairly obvious early on that the game was designed with a child focus. The voice acting is fairly uninteresting and all the characters are portrayed as stereotypical caricatures of typical Old West characters. However it is a very well polished game, especially with it's HD re-release on Steam. Just remember it was originally exclusively an xbox game and as such wasn't designed to use a keyboard. I recommend using a gamepad as a result just so the Third person to first person jumps don't throw you off balance.","September 17, 2012","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead using conventional ammunition, you collect "live ammunition". Small animals that you capture which carry a range of different effects from provoking an enemy to a more convenient location, to blowing them to smithereens.\n\nOverall it's a great game which is too often brushed over, and easily worth your time should you have cash to spare.","July 14, 2012","true","32.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shoot critters instead of guns, set traps, hunt for outlaws. Sounds fun right?\n\nThe execution is unforchanately poorly implemented. The game suffers from hit detection errors and missing sound effects. A first person shooter requires precise aim and I never felt like my shot was quite hitting the mark, I found myself clipping into walls frequently which is especially annoying when being pelted with bullets and trying to take cover. I spent the second half of the game being unable to hear Stranger speak and having his punch attack missing its sfx.\n\nThe last third of the game becomes a monontus mess that I felt obligated to finish to justify my purchase. Go into an area, kill everyone, rinse repeat. The semi final boss has got to be some of the worst game design I've ever seen. Being webbed up and continously stun locked isn't fun or interesting as a boss fight, it's just frustrating.\n\nI remember really loving this game as a child on Xbox, but I see that was also just another case of nolstalgia glasses. This port is garbage, and the game hasn't aged gracefully.

I really wanted to like this game due to the creative weapons, location, and characters, but there is one HUGE issue with this game that kills any enjoyment: It is the most poorly opitimized game I have ever played. It's main issue is that the game will constantly crash at random intervals (sometimes after 2 minutes of gameplay). I'm still stuck on the first level thanks to those crashes! As for the controls, it's the same issue, but I can look past that. I can even look past some graphical issues (including one odd one where if you take a screenshot, it does a weird duplication to said screenshot). What I can't look past is the constant crashes and poor optimization. Heck, the developer of the port is doing nothing to fix the game! For as much as I wanted to like and recommend this game, I sadly can not. AVOID THIS GAME and pick it up on the original Xbox instead!

I was very fortunate in being able to have a rig which supported a smooth port experience. However, there were still occasional visual glitches and the game crashed every time after I died during the last few segments of the game. So even at its best performance the game runs only adequately.\n\nI wish I could say I enjoyed this game more. The most creative aspect of the game is using the creature ammos to capture or kill enemies. This dead or alive bounty hunting mechanic is the core of the gameplay, but it barely gets developed upon after its introduced, and what's worse is that they ditch several mechanics after the halfway point of the game. The game can be played in the 3rd as well 1st person perspective, but all the 3rd person perspective is for is very basic 3rd person platforming and combat, as well as traversing the levels faster. The game has a currency which the plot informs the player is very important, motivating the player to capture more enemies than they kill. This makes for interesting gameplay, as it takes longer and is more risky to capture enemies alive than it is to kill them, but alive enemies pay out more. The earlier levels are also built around a combination of stealth and cover, which combined with the creative crossbow tools, gives the play options in how to complete a level. There are also upgrades and ammo to buy, giving you more to do with your money.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, about half-way through the game money stops mattering, your upgrades stop mattering and capturing enemies alive doesn't really make a difference anymore. This is a problem as multiple of the player's tools is built around distracting and stunning enemies as well as killing them. The dead or alive element goes out the window, and the game becomes a very generic console fps, complete with parking garage level design. It feels like the game ran short of time or budget and lost everything which made the game unique as a fps.\n\nOverall the game is enjoyable but bland. I would ultimately say that the game is average, but since I can only recommend or not recommend a game, I can't really recommend an average game when there are already so many good to excellent games to play on steam, especially in this genre. For Oddworld fans I would say its worth at least a single playthrough, just so you can have experienced another aspect of the Oddworld universe. As a fan of the first two games on the playstation I was dissapointed that not as much of the same atmosphere was found in this game, although that might be a consequence of the xbox graphics still not being able to provide the same amount of detail as the prerendered environments of Oddysee and Exoddus.\n\nFPS fans can pass on this game, but Oddworld fans should see this game through at least once. That's assuming of course they can get this port to work, since it is infamously unstable. Otherwise skip this port and find it on the original xbox.","April 15","false","11.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/recommended/15750/","Pakkidis","Pakkidis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/","1250 products in account","Rating: 7/10\nOverview: Third/First Person Action Adventure\n\nThe Good:\n\n+ The game certainly is original in terms of its character, world and story.\n\n+ Game controls between first and third person and does a great job switching between the two. Third person is mostly used for traversing the environments while first person is used for the crossbow to kill/capture enemies.\n\n+ The premise is simple, but nicely executed. You collect a bounty and then proceed to go hunt it down, usually with a lot of enemies and obstacles along the way. The game is linear and you can only hunt one bounty at a time but each bounty is unique in its own way.\n\n+ Each bounty is unique, like a mini boss battle, each one requires special tactics. You can either kill or capture the enemies. Killing enemies is easier but nets you less money while capturing them is the opposite.\n\n+ Use money to upgrade your character\n\n+ Unique ammo, your crossbow can hold two types of ammo at one time.\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nGraphically the game is decent, it certainly isn't ugly but nothing really stands out.\n\nThe story while decent feels like it never meets its potential. It's hard to care about the main character, villains or anybody else.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n- Broken Achievements, exiting the game makes you lose your achievement progress.\n\n- I really hated the voice acting.\n\n- Game crashes after every death and load in the second half of the game. A reoccurring problem for many users with no fix in sight, making the game almost unplayable. I solution is to quit the game before you die and continue from the main menu.\n\nConclusion:\n\nFor some reason this game reminds of me of a Rare game back in the day. Animals that talk with cute fuzzy ammo to collect. A fun game with some serious technical issues that should be fixed. Given the age of the game its surprisingly holds up pretty decently.\n","March 25","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not just a last gen game that has been upscaled for higher resolution, the character models have been remade from the ground up and the environment have more art assets, looking astonishing compared to the Original Xbox. The story is about a Steef named Stranger, set in the Oddworld universe, who is in desperate need for an operation, in which he became a bounty hunter to catch criminals to cash them in to meet his requirements to get it. Gameplay wise is a mixture between 3rd person platforming which also focus more on fighting and using agility, and a 1st person shooter in which you can switch views anytime seamlessly with a touch of a button/key. Instead of typical guns, you are equipped with a crossbow and you use live ammunition in which you can either buy in game or hunt for them. There are now a bit more features compared to its original release, such as unlocking concept art, new easter eggs, and select difficulties.

And the game itself is.\n\nHOWEVER, Sadly this port of the game is amongst the worst damned ports in PC history,\n\nI am running this game on a GTX 770 and it frequently drops below 30 FPS, and this is on LOW settings.\nTry turning AA on, even the most basic form of it and the game suddenly runs at a nice and steady 4 fps, good! I wanted the game to be more like a slideshow anyway.\n\nThe keyboard and mouse controls are just terrible so if you're going to pull yourself through this you better have a controller ready and even then things are very very sluggish and being precise with your aim is impossible, for those of you who did not know this game features an FPS mode where you launch various critters at your enemies to cause various effects, you also need to go hunting for these critters to refill your ammo, these guys are tiny, like, TINY, and in order to refill your ammo you need to hit these buggers whilst they're running around on the ground.\nIt's impossible, sometimes I have to shoot 3-4 times before hitting the damned things whilst standing still and this is only when using the controller, using the mouse however it is just fine but good luck walking around using WASD.. So I guess I'll just walk with my controller and aim with the mouse, good!\n\nLet's talk about V-Sync, everyone who knows anything about PC gaming knows that Vsync can be a real ♥♥♥♥♥, I personally prefer to always turn it of since I have a high-end enough PC to run mostly anything without any hitches and hey, this game is from 2005, not a problem right? Well I couldn't tell you, because this game comes bundled with glitches, buggs and errors up the wha-zoo including this one wonderfull bug I call V-♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf you disable V-sync, it disables character movement in the game.\nAlright I'll let you think about that for a moment, and no this is not something isolated to my system.\n\nTurning V-SYNC OFF... Turns of... Character movement? That's right! So ♥♥♥♥ you for even trying to turn it of, why did we even put the option in there? Because we wanted you to know this OUR game and we don't give no ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nOh and do you have an AMD graphics card? You won't be running this game, at all. So have fun staring at a black screen.\n\nI picked this game up quite recently and upon being struck with the glitch-fest that this piece of crap is I started googling around for fan-made patches and fixes seeing as the JAW company obviously gives no ♥♥♥♥♥, there are none, and I came across this brilliant little article from Giant Bomb.\n\nhttp://www.giantbomb.com/profile/blazehedgehog/blog/the-odd-tale-of-why-you-shouldnt-buy-strangers-wra/94292/\n\nThis is where my mind was truly blown, this game used to be even MORE BROKEN THAN THIS? I don't even..\n\nDear Just Add Water ( The people who ported this game to PC )\n\nFix your ♥♥♥♥, seriously this is unplayable.\n\nWant to play this game? Do! it is an absolutely fantastic title, just go pick it up on Ebay for eight bucks, that's even cheaper than this broken mess and you're going to have a much better time.","December 15, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This is a MASSIVE design oversight and it makes the game much harder to enjoy like I used to.  so I'm going to say that i don't recommend it, because the lack of flow through the controls that normally lets you zone in is totally broken for me by really poor binding descisions and the lack of forethought that precipitated it.\n\nStill like the game, but be wary, because the control issues can be a definite dealbreaker.","January 15, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: This was not my first time playing this game; in fact, this is my sixth time playing through the game, counting the five playthroughs I had of the Xbox version (also the game really can't do the "Only on Xbox" claim anymore, so that's kinda funny). I took a couple of years off from this game, since it was one of my yearly playthrough games, and coming back to it with both a new perspective and a new control scheme, this game is still as fresh as ever. It's a blend of FPS, stealth, and platforming that just works when it honestly shouldn't.\n\nThe FPS elements can be very tactical in nature, with your main weapon being a crossbow that can hold two of nine available ammo types; each one having their own specific uses. You'll soon find the three or four that work for you and forget the rest, but again, that's not to say that they're useless. There does seem to be mouse smoothing and auto-aiming in this game, which can be distracting for some, but I never found it to be that big of a deal. They can be disabled, as far as I know. This game does have replenishing health, but it's different from how a Call of Duty game does it. You have a health and a stamina gague; the stamina gauge is replenished by either taking in enemies or standing still. Sprinting doesn't drain stamina, but it doesn't replenish it, either. You also use stamina to heal yourself, with a full stamina bar often recovering about 75% of your total health. There's a great deal of tactics to healing, with the choice oftentimes being made between ducking behind a wall or stunning everyone guns-a-blazing.\n\nOf course, another option is to stealth your way around areas, especially if there happens to be a very dense crowd of enemies. It's still recommended that you bag enemies, though, and it's all your choice how you tackle the areas. Your punch, if you've been upgrading it through the store, will most often knock out enemies in one hit. Goons and bosses have their own health and stamina gagues as well. Obviously, an alive baddie is worth more than a dead baddie, so do try to take 'em in alive. It is possible to take in every boss alive (some are pretty hard to do, though) with the exception of very late game bosses, but the stakes have changed at that point, and that's all I'll say on that.\n\nAll in all, I didn't really have any issues with any of the areas, with the possible exception of the last bit before the final boss fight being one helluva difficulty spike. It's something that I can guarantee is different from anything you've played before, and even after six playthroughs, the game still feels fresh and juicy as ever. 10/10.\n\nStory: Man, this game has some great dialogue. It's easy to spend a while in towns just listening to what the Clakkerz have to say. The Grubs have some pretty great lines as well. Basically, there's a lot of lines in this game that'll almost assuredly get a laugh out of you if you even have a remotely crude sense of humor. The surprising bit is that the storyline actually gets good about 2/3 of the way through. That's not to say that the first 2/3 of the story are worth losing; it's just that the stakes become that much higher at that point. The ending is unexpectedly dramatic and actually really good. For a lot of great laughs and a surprisingly well-written story, I give the story a 9/10.\n\nGraphics: As expected from an HD port, the game looks great. One thing that I'm glad to have seen toned down from the Xbox version is the utterly absurd amount of bloom. Seriously, the amount of bloom in the Xbox version far surpassed any premise of artistic direction. Speaking of, the art direction of this game is absolutely fantastic; as to be expected from an Oddworld Inhabitants game. It's an excellent mix of high-tech gadgets and old-timey western aesthetics. The characters, enemies, ammo, areas... just everything looks fantastic. The technical aspects... aren't so fantastic. For starters, the game uses SSAA, which is HORRENDOUSLY inefficient. The game itself isn't too demanding, but the really weird part is that the game prefers my Integrated Graphics on my i5-3470. I could only really run it on 4x SSAA because of this (and yes, I did try and go through NVIDIA Control Panel; it didn't change anything). Even despite the not-so-great technical side of this game, the game still looks fantastic enough for me to give this game a 4/5 for graphics.\n\nSound: Well, the music is pretty good. I always make the note as to whether or not I'd bring this along with me on my MP3 player, and I wouldn't really do that for this soundtrack, but there are some very good songs in there that fit the "odd" vibe this game is trying to pull. Voiceacting is great, with a lot of the humor coming from just the inflections that the voiceactors use. Again, it's hilarious how the Grubs seem to be speaking in all-caps. A rather disappointing aspect of the voiceacting, however, is that the voice clips are rather low-fidelity. I don't have the greatest audio equipment in the world (a Gamecom 777 headset into the included USB sound card) and I can hear the compression on the voice clips. It makes me sad. Surely they could've sourced some uncompressed master audio files or something? Because of this, I can't give the audio portion of the game a perfect, but I still feel alright giving it a 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are 10/9/4/4; 9.0/10. Despite not being the best coded port of all time, the gameplay is still very much worth your time and money.","June 7, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stranger's Wrath was released on the original Xbox, but at a time when other games took most of the attention.  Worse, it was never made backward compatible on the 360.\n\nYou don't need to know anything about Oddworld to enjoy this game -- it's not a sequel.  It's a very funny and 'strange' world -- you're in this Old West style country populated mostly by anthropomorphic animal-things (many of which are chickens), and you take bounty hunting missions to capture or kill trouble-causing outlaws.  You use 'live' ammo -- as in, the crossbow actually fires live creatures at enemies, which is really funny.\n\nHalfway through the game there is a MAJOR plot twist / reveal / change, which brings with it a nearly complete switch in gameplay style.  In most games this would be annoying, but this one pulls it off impressively and makes the game very memorable.  There were a couple hard / frustrating bits, but I loved just about every other minute.","January 4, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not perfect, but I think it's very entertaining. It's one of those few games that perfectly blends first-person and third-person, and has eccentric, interesting characters suitable for a good movie. There's also a twist halfway through that completely changes the game. It's very bold, and it might make some gamers angry, but I've never seen it in a video game before and it really spices up the story. Even the dialogue is consistently humorous and provides an awesome western feel.","December 26, 2013","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: This was not my first time playing this game; in fact, this is my sixth time playing through the game, counting the five playthroughs I had of the Xbox version (also the game really can't do the "Only on Xbox" claim anymore, so that's kinda funny). I took a couple of years off from this game, since it was one of my yearly playthrough games, and coming back to it with both a new perspective and a new control scheme, this game is still as fresh as ever. It's a blend of FPS, stealth, and platforming that just works when it honestly shouldn't.\n\nThe FPS elements can be very tactical in nature, with your main weapon being a crossbow that can hold two of nine available ammo types; each one having their own specific uses. You'll soon find the three or four that work for you and forget the rest, but again, that's not to say that they're useless. There does seem to be mouse smoothing and auto-aiming in this game, which can be distracting for some, but I never found it to be that big of a deal. They can be disabled, as far as I know. This game does have replenishing health, but it's different from how a Call of Duty game does it. You have a health and a stamina gague; the stamina gauge is replenished by either taking in enemies or standing still. Sprinting doesn't drain stamina, but it doesn't replenish it, either. You also use stamina to heal yourself, with a full stamina bar often recovering about 75% of your total health. There's a great deal of tactics to healing, with the choice oftentimes being made between ducking behind a wall or stunning everyone guns-a-blazing.\n\nOf course, another option is to stealth your way around areas, especially if there happens to be a very dense crowd of enemies. It's still recommended that you bag enemies, though, and it's all your choice how you tackle the areas. Your punch, if you've been upgrading it through the store, will most often knock out enemies in one hit. Goons and bosses have their own health and stamina gagues as well. Obviously, an alive baddie is worth more than a dead baddie, so do try to take 'em in alive. It is possible to take in every boss alive (some are pretty hard to do, though) with the exception of very late game bosses, but the stakes have changed at that point, and that's all I'll say on that.\n\nAll in all, I didn't really have any issues with any of the areas, with the possible exception of the last bit before the final boss fight being one helluva difficulty spike. It's something that I can guarantee is different from anything you've played before, and even after six playthroughs, the game still feels fresh and juicy as ever. 10/10.\n\nStory: Man, this game has some great dialogue. It's easy to spend a while in towns just listening to what the Clakkerz have to say. The Grubs have some pretty great lines as well. Basically, there's a lot of lines in this game that'll almost assuredly get a laugh out of you if you even have a remotely crude sense of humor. The surprising bit is that the storyline actually gets good about 2/3 of the way through. That's not to say that the first 2/3 of the story are worth losing; it's just that the stakes become that much higher at that point. The ending is unexpectedly dramatic and actually really good. For a lot of great laughs and a surprisingly well-written story, I give the story a 9/10.\n\nGraphics: As expected from an HD port, the game looks great. One thing that I'm glad to have seen toned down from the Xbox version is the utterly absurd amount of bloom. Seriously, the amount of bloom in the Xbox version far surpassed any premise of artistic direction. Speaking of, the art direction of this game is absolutely fantastic; as to be expected from an Oddworld Inhabitants game. It's an excellent mix of high-tech gadgets and old-timey western aesthetics. The characters, enemies, ammo, areas... just everything looks fantastic. The technical aspects... aren't so fantastic. For starters, the game uses SSAA, which is HORRENDOUSLY inefficient. The game itself isn't too demanding, but the really weird part is that the game prefers my Integrated Graphics on my i5-3470. I could only really run it on 4x SSAA because of this (and yes, I did try and go through NVIDIA Control Panel; it didn't change anything). Even despite the not-so-great technical side of this game, the game still looks fantastic enough for me to give this game a 4/5 for graphics.\n\nSound: Well, the music is pretty good. I always make the note as to whether or not I'd bring this along with me on my MP3 player, and I wouldn't really do that for this soundtrack, but there are some very good songs in there that fit the "odd" vibe this game is trying to pull. Voiceacting is great, with a lot of the humor coming from just the inflections that the voiceactors use. Again, it's hilarious how the Grubs seem to be speaking in all-caps. A rather disappointing aspect of the voiceacting, however, is that the voice clips are rather low-fidelity. I don't have the greatest audio equipment in the world (a Gamecom 777 headset into the included USB sound card) and I can hear the compression on the voice clips. It makes me sad. Surely they could've sourced some uncompressed master audio files or something? Because of this, I can't give the audio portion of the game a perfect, but I still feel alright giving it a 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are 10/9/4/4; 9.0/10. Despite not being the best coded port of all time, the gameplay is still very much worth your time and money.","June 7, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You use a variety of different insects to capture and hand in the bounty's. You have a choice to either jail them alive or hand in their dead corpses. Dead or Alive their coming with you...\nThe game has an extreme sense of uniqueness using the First-Person shooting mechanic and third person parkour mechanic together in a surprisingly fitting fashion.\nOverall I'd reccommend this game for anyone who's a fan of the Oddworld series or just looking for something interesting.","May 3, 2014","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's also a twist halfway through that completely changes the game. It's very bold, and it might make some gamers angry, but I've never seen it in a video game before and it really spices up the story.

It's a first person/third person shooter/adventure with an oddworld flavour. You play a bounty hunter known only as the stranger who uses a crossbow which uses small creatures as ammunition. This is the best part of the game as shooting small creatures at your enemies is hilarious and funs. You have a wide range of ammo types like spiders who can wrap up your enemy or squirrels who shout insults that can lure enemies.\n\nThe game world is also brilliant and typical of the Oddworld world with weird and amusing characters. As ididnt play the original i cant really comment on how well the graphics have been improved but taking them on there own merit they are quite good. The game itself is a lot of fun and has a decent story to it.\n\nThere are some negatives however. Firstly and most importantly this game seems to have issues running on some computers. I bought the game three years ago and it wouldn't run on my old Windows 7 laptop. I wasn't able to play the game until got a new laptop. So it's worth ensuring it will run on your system before buying. Secondly while getting bounties is fun it does get repetitive after a while despite trying to vary each boss. This isn't a big issue though as the second half is less focused on catching bounties.\n\nOverall this is a great original game thats worth getting. 8/10","April 29, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay rocks, visuals are strange yet immersive, soundtrack is distinct and has some pretty great pieces, and the story is humorous while still managing to touch on some significant aspects of larger industrial expansion and what it does to the environment. I know that sounds preachy, but it's been a staple of the Oddworld franchise since the beginning, and every game does so just subtly enough to deliver a meaningful message through your struggle as the protagonist.\n\nAnyways, long story short, if you ever wanted a really weird Western, this is the best one you'll ever see.

And your ammo is living, and almost all of the different types allow creativity to place traps, luring enemies away from the group one by one, or stunning them all at once for an easy Alive Bounty capture.

After playing a while, the gameplay is better than what I thought. Third-person platforming and FPS action... not with guns but with a crossbow with living ammo caught from the wild. You go look for outlaws and capturing them with these in a western-alike style: excellent.  And be sure you think well how to clear an area, or else you are busted. There's also a plot twist in the middle of the game that is very interesting and incentivates you to play until the end. One of the cons I have is that the gameplay can turn out to be repetitive for some people, but still enjoyable. If you are a fan of Oddworld or someone that wants to experience a different platforming game similar to Portal (except for the portal concept and constant first-person view) I definitely recommend it.","November 20, 2012","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I had it on my ps3, but I could not get past a boss because I was only a stupid 13 year old who played Halo most of the time, so I saw that the Oddworld series was on sale for a cheap price, and I picked it up, I have not played any of the other games so far, but Strangers wrath is amazing. I love the switch between first person and third person view for different types of game play, and it was done very well. Platforming is quite simple, and if you have played any other platformer game, this won't bee too much of a challenge. The only problem I have with this game is that the default Xbox controls SUCK! I have tried to change them up, but the meny to do so is very confusing, and most of the controlls stayed the same as before. playing with a keyboard however feels very strange for platforming, but first person is good. I would definently reccomend this game to anyone who loves stealth games, platformers, shooters, and overall wierd games (in a good way).

I have just finished the game and I can say that it was fun to play. This review will be broken up into several parts\n\ncontrols: controls can make or break a game. When I started this game the controls were all over the place. The shoot/punch button was start capturing was R3 and other weird crap. Weather the game didn't detect my 360 controller layout or what I don't know. It took me a good hour to configure everything correctly but after that no issues were had. The controls are a bit stiff but that is a small gripe and I think its due to it being an older title and being a hybrid game. The controls weren't bad by any means but they did get in the way several times. The camera was so so most of the time it cooperated but occasionally it did not. Overall the controls weren't too bad but were a weak point in my experience of the product.\n\nStory: About a 7 out of 10 the story had a lot of personality and spunk although the npcs could get a little annoying and the main character was really bland due to his slow speaking drawl. There was the occasional where do I go or what do I do but by process of elimination or asking npcs you found your way quickly enough. It however did lack any suspense. There's quite a few occasions where you can see whats about to happen an hour or two in advance but it doesn't get in the way too much and the stories entertaining enough to keep you entertained.\n\nVoice/sound: Both are done quite well it might be part of the HD remake but everything sounded crisp and nice. There were however npcs that would repeat things like a broken record and during fire fights or another conversation it could annoy the crap out of you. Almost everyone has a voice in this game and even though they all sound the same and say the same thing except for main story line characters the world seems lively.\n\nVisuals: Being and HD remake I didn't expect too much I never played the original game so I had nothing to compare it to however the game looked nice and played smooth there were no draw distance issues and the characters all seemed well represented. However there are still some blocky textures and areas that look very similar to each other but being a game from the early 2ks you should be expecting that much. Overall with the overhaul the game looks and feels good. I did however have to change my resolution from 1440X900 to 1200X900 the game just seemed too stretched out and the visuals washed  when on my full resolution settings.\n\nGameplay: The meat and potatoes if the game is not fun to play whats the point right? This game even with some challenging controls happens to be a joy to play. Your character stranger doesn't use guns instead uses a crossbow with “Live Ammo” living animals as his weapons. Each one is unique and each one is useful unlike some games where you will use a weapon or gun once and never touch it again this game makes every ammo useful to some degree. There are ammos that you will prefer to another but other than that the mechanic is very well done. You are a bounty hunter and throughout the better half of the game you collect bounties which are basically you doing boss runs. The game is a bit linear in this manner go for a bounty collect it go for another one repeat. However this is not the full story for this game and the gameplay switches up after you collect the last guy. You can collect your bounties one of two ways dead or alive. Dead nets you less reward but is easier alive nets you more but is harder. Some bosses are almost forcing your hand to collect them dead as they will not go down easily. And speaking of that this game is surprisingly challenging. Even on normal I found myself struggling in some areas. There are clear difficulty spikes during boss battles and in some other areas. However this game can still be beaten no matter which way you play and for the most part (spoiler) it doesn't matter in the end how you bag them I had troves of money left and I bought all of the upgrades too and never needed to buy ammo. The game doesn't change (far as I know) depending on how you play the game. Overall the game is fun to play with very few flaws.\n\nThis game was fun to play and I suggest it to anyone who thinks they might like this game!","February 21, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I'm kicking myself for not getting this sooner.\n\nThere is a lot to say about the game now in HD. One the anmation and detail level is fantastic smooth. Sounds are great as well as the smak talk from some of your ammo. Add in the Oddworld sense of humor and boom you just can't turn your nose up at this game.\n\nThe michanic of using the different types of ammo to disable or trap you bounties is fantastic and so much fun. I played for the first hour and that's was it I had to make a review becase you have to play this. The ability to flow from FPS to third person was great too becase you could come at your enemys in different ways alowing you to snipe, stratigic or just power your way through.\n\nFor an old game with a new pretty skin this game tick a lot of boxes so I say buy it :)\n\n4/5","February 24, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/necrobern/recommended/15750/","necrobern","Necrobern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/necrobern/","269 products in account","A solid game which perfectly remains barely aged. The game highly encourages stealthy tactics to deal with enemies, but you can take them with all you have if you prefer. The game has that Oddworld flavor we love (Although a very few species from previous games make an appearance), and despite having just 3-4 voice actors is more than enough to characterize the cast.\n\nNow, i have various negatives about the game but they are minor and probably nitpicking. The plot is extremely minor and you won't know what's going on until very late in the game (There's a good quantity of foreshadowing though), and that hurt my interest in the game to get my full interest (Aside the Oddworld brand). The difficulty curve sometimes is out of place as some late bosses or areas can be taken down with ease but a few early ones or previous to those are overwhelming. (Minor spoiler) The game will make you think you need to achieve certain goals but suddenly will take a completely different direction and make you feel the effort was for nothing (/spoiler).\n\nIt might not reach the level of the original Abe games but Stranger is really up there just for gameplay. Is a good example of a game which goes for playability over plot, specially coming from Oddworld which is known from providing both and instead focuses on a single one.","November 15, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Different small animals function as your ammunition with their own abilities. Third person melee and first person shooting blend a lot better than expected.\n+ Platforming and movement can be enjoyable.\n+ Simple, but rich story.\n+ Excellent varying environments and soundtrack.\n+ The game changes its style drastically about 2/3 the way through. To explain how would be a spoiler, but the "stealth" and non-lethal takedowns are let go in favor of a smashmouth approach.\n+ Sense of humor typical to the Oddworld games.\n+ Well balanced and rewarded careful strategy.\n\nCons\n\n- Ear-bleeding-inducing voices. Almost all voices have been digitally altered to be a higher or lower register of a normal human... and altered quite poorly at that.\n- Early game's focus on "stealth" is extrodinarily basic and hard to maintain. Almost all confrontations turn loud.\n- To get a good reward, enemies need to be "bagged", requiring you to hold down control for about 3 seconds on EVERY enemy you knock out or kill. Can get repetitive and annoying.\n- The late game ammo types, mechanics, and lethal approach were more enjoyable to me than the early game "tag and bag" playstyle. Depends what you're into, but this seemed to be the best avenue for combining your attacks.\n- While there are plenty of ammo types, too many of them serve fairly similar functionalities.\n- Many boss fights. Some uninspired and annoying.\n\nWhile sometimes repetitive and a bit too slow paced, I enjoyed this retro first/third-person platformer/shooter/beat-'em-up thing. Try to avoid the "greatest game of all time" nostalgia filter reviews and enjoy the good this game has to offer that definitely overshadows its faults.","July 12, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The hability to whimsily switch between 3rd and 1rst person, be it to turn tail and dodge some bullets or close in and knock some teeth or simply exlpore your surroundings, 3rd person forces a change in strategy as well as gameplay. As for 1rst person, it is pretty standard with only a few variations and some elements thrown in, such as in a pseudo-stealth combat (e.i. neutralize-don't-kill, hiding) however stealth as itself is overpowered but really REALLY situational (scripted settled foliage) and could be better, maybe system limitations couldn't handle line-of-sight detecting at the time. However most of the combat is done in 1rst person, even though you can get creative and trace and strategy mixing 1st/3rd person, 1rst person is more reliable.\nAs for the lore, even though it moves away from the style and tradition of the rest of the oddworld franchise, it still is rich and organic. A deep world to explore and an even deeper foreground as it forms part of the Oddworld universe, most of it deals with the themes of industrialization, explotation of natural resources and native kinship among others.\n\nMy only complains are that it has not much replay value unless you really love the world they present (as much as I did, it made me lose the count of my plays), and the inclompete universe as the story has stalled and no new game releases have added something new to said universe since the release of the original XBOX version. Nevertheless on a scale this game has a well deserved 4/5","July 18, 2015","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike the previous games which are puzzle/cinematic platformers, this is a cocktail of an FPS, third-person brawler, platformer, and open world game (The open world is nothing large, but its competent). Above all that though, the main selling point of this game is the ammo. In this game you're not pumping lead into some random-♥♥♥ mercenarys, you're planning each move and thinking of fun ways to kill the many outlaws in the game. This is because you have bugs and small creatures for ammo, which can do a ton of things, like distracting enemies with the very annoying chippunk, or wrapping outlaws in webs to keep them on the ground for a easy capture with the bolamite.\n\nThe game also has a fantastic sense of humor, as per usual with the oddworld series, and a lot of boss fights (Although a few are questionably designed). As for story, Its not as complex as the stories in the main quintology, but its still good, and it provides a good amount of lore for people who are interested in it.

You dont just get guns that hurts people, you get ammo types that knocks enemies downs or wrap them up, and you're rewarded for "capturing" enemies rather than killing them which I think makes for interest tactics on overcoming the enemies.\n\nLots of PC port problems though.

Smooth and vibrant. The colour pallete changed often enough for it not to get boring. Perhaps the enemies didn't vary significantly, and the inspirations behind the designs felt a little too obvious, unlike some earlier characters.\nThe story, though different from the original theme of slavery and exploitation, persisted with the theme of social classes and supremacy. Well structured and fitted nicely with the rest of the game. Though I felt the Grubbs were a bit annoying and out of place, that's my personal preference.\nThis is one of my first FPS's and I know that this isn't quite a generic one. It definitley worked. Sometimes though the best way to solve a problem would be to just dive head first in it and take the damage, without much of a planned approach. Other times it was a matter of, in a way, tricking the system. They weren't big flaws, enough to be noticeable and distracting from the tone sometimes, but not unplayable. I believe it had something to do with the way the enemies were distributed and how they behaved.\nI enjoyed this game, the only problem I had with it was the enemy placement/AI, otherwise def recommend to fans and newcomers","May 7","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
