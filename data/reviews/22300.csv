Open ''File Explorer''\n2. Double click ''Local Disk (C:)''\n3. Double click ''Program Files (x86)''\n4.  Locate & double click ''Steam''\n5. Locate & double click ''steamapps''\n6. Double click ''common''\n7. Double click ''Fallout 3''\n8. Right click ''Fallout3.exe''\n9. Left click ''Properties''\n10. Left click the ''Compatiblity'' tab\n11. Check mark ''Run this program in compatibilty mode for:''\n12. Under that it should be saying ''Windows Vista'' service pack 1 or service pack 2\n13. Change it to ''Windows XP (Service Pack 3)'' DO NOT change it to Windows 8 or it won't work\n14. Left click ''Apply'' then left click ''OK''\n15. Locate your ''FalloutLauncher.exe'' folder\n16. Right click ''FalloutLauncher.exe''\n17. Left click on ''Properties''\n18. Left click the ''Compatibility'' tab\n19. Check mark ''Run this program in compatibility mode for:''\n20.  Under that it should be saying ''Windows Vista'' service pack 1 or service pack 2\n21. Change it to ''Windows XP (Service Pack 3)'' DO NOT change it to Windows 8 or it won't work\n22. Left click ''Apply'' then left click ''OK''\n23. Start up your game\n24. Have fun!\n\n((If it still doesn't work try installing this\nhttp://www.xbox.com/en-CA/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient then the steps again))\n\nOkay so I have had complaints about it not working and they do it how I said. So if you click on "Fallout 3.exe" and right click on it, there may be no compatibilty tab. Don't worry it still works for your win, but I think that only happends on windows 10 but if you are on windows 8 or 7 and it is like that then don't worry your "hero" has a solution! xD So if "Fallout 3.exe" does NOT have a compatibility tab then there is probably something wrong with your game files. So just go back and highlight "Fallout 3" the one with the vaultboy logo and then that one should have your compatibilty. I really hope this review helps some people because spending money on stuff that you can't play stinks >:c.","October 22, 2015","true","0.5"," 1,383 of 1,458 people (95%) found this review helpful 103 people found this review funny","95","383","1","103","113"

You're reading these reviews to build your hype for Fallout 4 for some reason. It's okay, I am too.\n\nEDIT 11/10/2015: You know what day it is right? Like, why are you reading this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S. Because I'm getting messages and comments from people saying "Can I play this on Win 7???" I'm just gonna list out the fixes required to make sure it runs just like it would on Vista (but better because you know, you're running 7 for a reason).\n\n1. Crash/Freezing issue at random points in the game:\n\n-Run the game at least once\n\n-Go here ( C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\My Games\Fallout3\Fallout.ini )\n\n-Press "Ctrl+F" type (without quotation marks) "bUseThreadedAI"\n\n-Should read "bUseThreadedAI=0", change the 0 to 1 (if this line isn't there, add it anywhere in the\nblock of lines above the [Display] category of the file)\n\n-(This next line shouldn't be in your file already but do a quick Ctrl+F to make sure, if it is change\nit accordingly)\n\n-Directly underneath "bUseThreadedAI=1", write "iNumHWThreads=2". If it's already there, just\nchange whatever value it is to "2".\n\nSave & Exit\n\n\n\n2. Radio Music Stuttering\n\nPreface: Now even with this fix in place, I still find occasional bouts where either music will not\nplay from my Pip-Boy or the stuttering will return in a certain area for some odd reason.\nThis is just a general fix that will help alleviate stuttering for ~95% of your game time.\n\n-Download MADFilter\n( http://sourceforge.net/projects/maddxshow/files/MAD%20Filter/MADFilter%201.0.0.3/ )\n\n-Extract "MADFilter.ax", "register.bat" and "unregister.bat" file to ( C:\Windows\SysWOW64 for\n64-bit OS's or C:\Windows\system for 32-bit OS's)\n\n-Once you've extracted the files to your directory, run the register.bat that is currently in your\nSysWOW64 or system folder.\n\n-Just to make sure you did the work correctly, download "InstalledCodec"\n( http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/installedcodec.zip ), extract the zip and run the .exe once extracted\n\n-Look for "MAD Transform Filter" and make sure it's installed. THEN, find "Fraunhofer IIS MPEG\nLayer-3 Codec" in the utility. Right click it and select "Disable Selected Items"\n\nRun the game and on your pip-boy radio, select Galaxy News radio and listen to see if the\nstuttering is still there. If it is, then you should go back and check which directory you pasted\nthe MADFilter file into and check InstalledCodec to ensure the MAD filter is installed and enabled\nand then make sure the Fraunhofer codec is DISABLED. If this didn't work, there is a conflict\nwithin your codecs and you may have another MP3 Codec installed and working on top of your\nMAD Filter. I'd check InstalledCodec and see what may be conflicting.\n\nCredit to GoldenShadow for helping me fix this years ago\n( http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=844931 )\n\n\n\n3. Random Crashes and Freezing fix AFTER the Fallout.ini fix:\n\nThis little guy over at Nexus may have a fix for you. If you're still crashing and freezing and have\nno clue why, try downloading his d3d9.dll file and insert it into your game's source directory.\n\nDownload link: ( http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/18900/? )\n\n(If you're in the same boat as myself and still have random crashes, freezes and all sorts of odd\nmishaps in your game and you've done all of the fixes listed above, I'm afraid I have no other help\nconsidering I've dug pretty far to find some other fixes and nothing has really helped. Best to just\nQuicksave (F5 by default) as often as possible)\n\n\nP.P.S. Edited for Win 8 & 8.1 compatibility fixes\n\n(The following is provided thanks to the very generous blue_light1554)\n\n1. Basically, if your computer has two cores, you have to follow French Girls' steps for only "1. Crash/Freezing issue at random points in the game:"\n\n2. Save the modified notepad text and exit.\n\n3. Then you put compatibility mode: Windows XP Service Pack 3\nYou do that for "Fallout 3 Launcher" and the application named "Fallout 3".\n(...\Steam\Steamapps\Common\Fallout 3)\n\n4. Then visit this website: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/pc/DownloadClient\nThis will make you download a missing client required to make Fallout 3 work.\n\n5. When you've done all that, you right click on the Fallout 3 application and do "Run as Administrator"\n\n6. It should work!\n\n7. I'm not an expert so if you have questions or it didn't work for you, go see the website shown here:  http://help.bethsoft.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9977\n\nMaybe you'll find something else useful.\n\nEDIT 11/6/2013: I just upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10 and I can confirm Fallout 3 runs fine on the same exact system I did an entire playthrough on. Loaded it up and ran around a bit and it played just like it did on 7.","June 4, 2015","true","159.9"," 4,474 of 4,821 people (93%) found this review helpful 1,830 people found this review funny","93","474","4","830","117"

Loading screens appear only when entering major cities or buildings.\n\n+ Very atmospheric and immersive world to explore.\n\n+ Every NPC’s are really living in that world. They follow their own daily routine from morning to night. You’ll meet them, talk to them and even remember their names.\n\n+ Good writing and a touching story. It is fun to talk to NPC’s and trying out different dialogue options to see the outcome.\n\n+ Freedom in almost every aspect. A quest can be completed in many ways. You can almost kill anybody you meet (even an entire town). You can be a good guy, a bad guy or have a mix of both. You can play as an action game or you can play stealthily. You can choose to play in 1st person or 3rd person. You can roam anywhere you want but….\n\n+ Enemies don’t scale.  So if you wander off to the wrong area during early levels, you will die easily.\n\n+ Many types of interesting enemies. Some are scary.\n\n+ Graphics.\n\n+ Voice acting.\n\n+ VATS\n\n+ Mods. A lot of them.\n\n+ Galaxy News Radio and...\n\n+ Three Dogs.\n\n\n+- Progression system and level cap (max level 30). The progression system is fun and addictive (with a lot of useful perks to choose) but I personally prefer Elder Scroll’s progression system where you get better at what you use. This way you can shape your preferred character with more flexibility and can even change your play style anytime. That’s why it is not a negative, it’s something that I have a mixed feeling.\n\n+- Dynamic day & night cycle. This game has day and night cycle but it is purely for cosmetic effect and doesn’t change or affect gameplay.\n\n\n- A.I’s are stupid sometimes, especially if you play stealthily.\n\n- Stealth gameplay could be better. Most area design doesn’t encourage stealth gameplay. No non-lethal option either.\n\n- Crafting options are very few. (Mods fixes this)\n\n- No iron sight aiming in 1st person.

Got it on sale on Steam about a year after it came out (09').  I had no friends that had this game and I knew little to nothing about the story/gameplay etc. other then what Steam listed.  I love RPG games w/FPS elements, Deus Ex being another.\n\nFallout 3 does a great job of letting you go at your own pace and shows what an open world environment can really feel like.  How the game starts  is fun too, seeing parts of your childhood. As the time comes when you leave your vault for first time the games says "You have a main mission to do but what's that place over there...".\n\nIt was impossible to see every thing even the first few time you play thru the game and I was always finding new places, people, missions, and weapons.  On top of all that there are 5 DLCs that add more areas to visit ("The Pitt" and "Broken Steel" being my Fav) and help fill out the game even better then most other games I've played.  Most of my playthroughs still take as much as 100+ hours if you take time to visit most/all places as well as do all missions possible for you.\n\nOne last thing is this game has a fantastic modding community that can spice up the game and fix/improve just about any area you could think of in this game from, graphics/terrain to weapons/NPCs.  A must have game for RPG/FPS lovers.\n***9/10***","February 27, 2014","true","717.8"," 391 of 415 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","391","415","0","0"

Fallout 3 is a very easy game to immerse yourself into. I even find it difficult to be an evil character because of all the hard choices you can make in this game. Decisions can effect this game greatly for example there is a choice to blow up a town with a nuke. Karma is truly a b*tch in this game. It also does a good job at giving you that 1950's vibe. And especially the post-apocalyptic survivalist feeling. The exploration in the game is amazing with so many places to explore I have played this game for over 4 years and I dont think I have even covered the entire Capital Wasteland.

My advice? install small things like the street light mod and also install FOSE in order to get those working of couse and after maybe a couple of days of playing Fallout 3 with one simple mod gradually expand outward to big & better mods. Be careful though most mods require the DLC so get the DLC to the game ASAP (Which isn't a bad thing of course gives your system more 'breathing' room, but that's just my point of view).\n\nIf you want a true wasteland expereince install the F03 Wanderers Edition from the Nexus to get the LOL!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/22300/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","When Fallout 3 was announced in 2004, not everyone was happy to hear that Bethesda would be the development studio to bring the Wasteland to life. The franchise's most hardcore fans were up in arms when they found out that their beloved Fallout was being turned into a first-person role-playing game, abandoning the originals' isometric perspective and "dumbing it down" for consoles. Plenty of folks complained that the game would just end up being "Oblivion with guns" (of course, some would argue that that's not exactly a bad thing, as 2006's Elder Scrolls title was one of that year's finest RPGs). I can safely say that while Fallout 3 bears an uncanny resemblance to Oblivion in some ways, but it's also a far superior game in many others.\n\nIn the year 2077, nuclear war ravaged the world and forced a segment of the human race (well, the lucky ones anyway) underground to live out their days in massive Vaults that could protect them from the radiation-spawned terrors lurking outside in the Wasteland. Although the first two games in the Fallout series took place on the West Coast, Fallout 3 is set in the greater Washington D.C. area. Naturally, this means you'll see plenty of familiar landmarks, from the Washington Monument to the White House. You may be saddened to see that the famed Tidal Basin cherry blossoms don't bloom during a nuclear winter.\n\nSome 200 years after this nuclear holocaust, your character is born inside of one of these subterranean sanctuaries. The game actually kicks off after a brief prologue, with your character being forced out of the safety of your mother's womb into the hands of your waiting father. You'll take this time to name yourself and complete a "projection" of what you'll look like when you grow to adulthood, at which point your father's face will finally come into view. It's an interesting way to handle character creation, as well as show off the game's unique approach to presentation and customization.\n\nBefore leaving the safety of the Vault for the horrors of the world outside, you'll need to determine what sort of character you'll be and how you'll approach the game. This begins when you find a book called "You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.," which teaches you about the most basic level of character creation. This is where you'll set your core attributes that will determine your Strength, Perception, Endurance, and so on. These attributes remain largely the same as you progress through the game, although you'll have the rare chance to alter them with perks, equipment, or good old-fashioned drugs. Once you've set your core attributes, you'll need to take a test to determine which skills your character is most adept at using. Like Oblivion, you'll have just over a dozen skills that you can excel in, with three of those being marked as tag skills. After taking the Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test (G.O.A.T.), you'll learn which skills you're best-suited to using, although it should be noted that you can choose your own destiny and fight against the establishment that's telling you how to live your life by choosing the skills you want to focus on. The test is actually more of a psychological profile than an actual test, with your answers determining where your strengths lie.\n\nWhile Fallout 3 could technically be called a first-person shooter, those looking for a Call of Duty 4-style experience will likely be disappointed. It's possible to run 'n gun your way through the game, but the FPS controls just aren't quite up to snuff. Thankfully this is alright since you've got the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (VATS) to help you in combat. Utilizing VATS stops the action and allows you to target individual body parts, which are presented with the percentage chance that you have of successfully hitting them. You'll likely spend the majority of your time in combat using VATS, occasionally finishing off your foes in real-time when you run out of the action points that fuels VATS.\n\nOne area in which Fallout 3 doesn't resemble Oblivion is in its leveling system. While Oblivion rewarded you for doing specific things throughout the course of the game, here you'll only be able to upgrade your skills by earning experience points. These can be gained by doing everything from killing enemies and completing quests to winning speech challenges and successfully hacking computer terminals. There were times when I missed the ability to focus on improving a particular skill, although not having to spend hours practicing our sneaking skills just to gain a level or two was actually quite liberating.\n\nWhile there are plenty of memorable characters and places throughout the game, the real star of the show is the massive, wide-open environment. It's incredibly easy to get distracted from the main quest, and that's part of the fun, as you'll find yourself getting sucked into one side quest after another as your explore the Wasteland. Of course, this can lead to moments when you'll need to spend an inordinate amount of time walking from one location to the next, as you can't use the game's fast-travel system if you haven't visited your target location at least once. There are times when it feels like a bit of a grind, though at least you'll stumble upon plenty of cool locations during your travels.\n\nGiven that it uses the same Gamebryo engine that powered Oblivion, it's probably not surprising to learn that Fallout 3 is a helluva great-looking game. Sure, the characters still look a bit weird while they're talking, and you'll likely notice some draw distance issues no matter which version you play, but this is still one of the most visually impressive games of 2008. The PC version looks particularly nice, especially since it runs at a smooth and steady 60 frames per second with only occasional dips.\n\nFallout 3 is an admirable achievement for Bethesda. It’s a game that provides action, adventure, exploration, interaction and excitement in a beautifully realised Armageddon that provides so many unexpected moments, but somehow manages to remain consistent and believable.","October 28, 2015","true","38.8"," 144 of 154 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","144","154","8","0"

Was pretty good but graphics sucked because I was broke at the time and playing it on a 19 inch CRT (like the ones you used to have in your bedroom in the 90's). So when I bought this on a steam sale for like $5 or something. I decided I would play it right. I then spent the next 2 days, modding the heck out of it with Nexus Mod's. Oh my I made this 6 year old game look fricking goergous. Much prettier then even Skyrim. It was one of the most immersive game's I had ever played. (One of the mods I used launched it in a weird way so steam never recorded my time playing it which is why it says iv only played it for 5 minutes).\n\nI seriously recomend picking this up in a steam sale, and take your time modding it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebetaplan/recommended/22300/","thebetaplan","The Beta Plan!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebetaplan/","38 products in account","I am going to start this review with controversy. Of the Fallout series I think Fallout 3 is the best of them. Now before you start flaming me over the fact your prefer Fallout: New Vegas or Fallout 1 for instance, let me try and explain this.\n\nFallout 1 & 2 remain good classics, that must be played by any fan of the later Fallouts, if only for the feel of it for the moment. The first Fallouts had the best incentive to go away from the safety of community, because either your vault or your tribe was in danger - both of them showing much of Fallout world. However, that said although I enjoy pixelated games... they are pixalated games and some of the tactic options are for the time excellent, but now outdated.\n\nFallout 3's incentive to travel is a bit odd. You must basically because you are thrown out and you are supposed to set out on your family member that walked out on you (before you go 'What?!', sorry I won't spoil more). This incentive is rather... odd. However, than comes Fallout 3 itself. Although opinions aside about the radio jockey - a controversy in the community - the added old school music and now stunning graphics make the Fallout world come to live. Although some errors in cannon can be found, most quests are excellent and tie into the world itself. Also allowing free roaming like the old game, but now the road itself is just as interresting - something Fallout 1 & 2 were less able do due to technical reasons (random encounters based on luck (or unluck)).\n\nThe main quest can be ended in much shorter time than I played in it, heck I have several lives, but I also have but one expansion. Still if you focus on only the mainquest than you are doing it wrong. Go out and explore and feel like an adventurer in a dismal post-apocolyptic world.","February 11, 2015","true","263.8"," 62 of 75 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","62","75","4","6"

I found this game to very enjoyable. Unlike many of our games today. This one felt much more immersive. Despite having older graphics and sometimes glitchy gameplay. The story and moral choices are touching and make you almost geninually care about finding your dad. Gameplay wise it is very well rounded. Unlike Fallout NV combat is much more simple. Seeing as how there is simply one type of ammo. Then you shoot said ammo. Nothing else. But NV boasted more guns and more mods for guns. But if you want a much better made game Fallout 3 is probably a better choice. It really works well on immersion. It lacks the painful abundance of loading screens in NV. While the wasteland around you almost feels fearful. Seeing as how you can run into raiders/mutants/dogs/bears/and basiclly anything else. If you are looking for a memorable game. This is probably it. HOWEVER one problem I noticed was that there was a point that one will reach in the game. Where finding supplies become basiclly an after thought. Seeing as how I soon had stocked up 400+ "rare" MC cells. This impairs it but not totally killing it. If you had to buy either NV or 3.

Bethesda really nails the whole post-apocalyptic feeling, because everything just feels empty and deserted. These days the game looks pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and even back in 2008 when I first played this game, I didn't think it looked that impressive (Dem Mods though). I admit that I'm a little spoiled by New Vegas, so the mechanics in FO3 don't feel quite as good as they do in New Vegas, but using VATS and the gameplay itself is excellent. I enjoyed all the songs in the game, but I really wish they would have added more, especially with all the DLC this game has. The karma system is something I feel all RPG's should have and while some of the decisions you make don't really affect things as a whole, it's still nice to have multiple choices to the quests you do. Audio as a whole is excellent (as stated with the music) but it just feels limited with the amount of the voice actors and the songs on the radio, the quality is definitely there though. I honestly could keep going on why I love this game so much and there is a lot of stuff I haven't even seen yet (DLC and Mods) but there is one big issue that makes me question this version in particular. On Windows 7, this game would crash at least every hour for me and sometimes it would be even worse. You would think with a game as popular as FO3, that Bethesda would at least fix something as big as this is, but they haven't. I have played this on Xbox 360 before and it maybe crashed 1 or 2 times (it's pretty sad when the console version of your game, performs better than the far superior PC). If you can deal with the technical issues, then you're in for one of the best RPG's of all time, up there with games like Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age: Origins, Skyrim, and KOTOR. Regardless of any of the negative things I said about FO3, I think one of the most important aspects of any game is fun and if I can sit and enjoy a game for extended play sessions for weeks and keep coming back to it after I already beat it before, well I think that's what every game should strive for.\n10/10 A Masterpiece","November 7, 2014","true","51.4"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

I'm waiting for so long and it's getting on my nerves quite frankly. But, at some time when I was playing, this idea got off of my mind and I actually had one of the most fun that I ever had during my playtime. The gameplay feels right, the pip-boy is a great feature, the soundtrack and the music has to be one of the best to date, and the story is amazing. If you like RPGs and open-world games, this is totally a must buy. But the debate comes upon everyone every once in a while about, which Fallout game is better. Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 3? Well, I couldn't decide so I just bought both of them. But if you want to look at the open world aspect and the terrain, Fallout 3 is a lot better. The empty wasteland of Fallout New Vegas just seemed a little boring, only seeing something interesting in your path every now and again. It might be a little trouble first playing it because of the compatibilitie issues, but once you've fixed that, you'll have fun. PS: What are you doing reading my review?!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IwanClarke/recommended/22300/","IwanClarke","Iwan Clarke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IwanClarke/","232 products in account","FALLOUT 3 GAME REVIEW\n\nIntroduction\nWhen I was younger, I played this game on XBOX (those were dark days) and failed to even reach megaton (The first place you come to in the open world after what is essentially a tutorial level). Got fallout new vegas on steam soon after I got a gaming PC. I loved it. I loved skyrim too so i decided to replay fallout 3 to see if i was just an idiot when i was younger. SPOILER. i was.\n\nIt has a few issues with windows 7, and multiple monitors but more or less all bug fixes can be found here[pcgamingwiki.com]. nexus mod manager has loads of bug fixes and graphical upgrades for those who wan't them. If you are just interested in how good I thing this game is, and not why it is, then skip to the conclusion. but i urge you to read the whole thing to make up your own mind\n\nNegatives\nHere are a few things that are wrong with this game.\n\n1.No Patch or bug fix for windows 7\nthis game has been about for ages. but it refuses to work with modern operating systems. bethesda could get so many more sales if they just released a patch. they could just release some user created patch's as an update. it wouldn't even take much time or money. This is (in my opinion) their best game and its going into a state of ruin. if the modding community was not there to support it. it wouldn't even be playable.\n\n2.Games for windows live\nOk so it's not as bad as uplay or god forbid, origin, but its still irritating. not to mention the fact that it has cause numorous bugs and save corruptions/wipes in many games. many games now are having this tumor surgically removed but not this one. you can patch it out using mods and nexus mod manager but this should have been done as a patch by bethesda. Again, bethesda's best game is being dragged down by the lack of a simple patch, that not only would increase the sales and plays of the game but be cheap and cost virtually no time at all.\n\n3.When  Your father dies\nso your dad has this big project that is called project purity and it basically produces purified water from dirty water. and these bad guys called the enclave want it so they can infect it with a virus and wipe out all humans and other species who have even slightly mutated  since the war 200 years ago. and at the controll panel they ask your dad to activate it so he locks the door and floods it with radiation. one question. WHY???. at this point in the game i had full power armor (T51-B arguably the best model in the game) and ton of alien weaponry (from motehrship zeta). and he only killed some general guy and a foot soldier. i killed more men just getting here! his death was unneccisary and it really feels like its shoe-horned in to give the player a reason to hate the enclave.\n\n4.The ending\nThe ending is complete rubbish. you have a choice to sacrifice yourself or tell either your mutant side-kick (if you have him) who won't actually die or some random brotherhood of steel woman to sacrifice themselves instead. i have a number of problems with this, the first being that if you chose to let them die, you die anyway, with no explination. the game simpley fades away and starts narating your life and all the stuff you have done. no explination given at all. its like they just ran out of time and said "well people will only choose to sacrifice themselves right? ... right? ... RIGHT?". not to mention the fact taht you only die because you need to enter the room your dad filled with radiation for no good reason!  THIS MAKES THE BROKEN STEEL DLC  PRETTY MUCH REQUIRED - thats all im saying without using spoilers  becasue it increases level cap and removes the crappy ending. as well as giving a flimsy explination as to why you 'died' even if you didn't sacrifice yourself.\n\nPositives\nBut that's just the negatives, here are some positives:\n\n1.It is bethesda's best game\nif you like skyrim. its that but with technology instead of magic and guns. lots and lots of guns.\n\n2.It is scary.\nnot the jump scare kind of way. this game is atmospherically scary. when you are trekking through the abandoned, dark gloomy subway tunnels hearing the muffeled movement of the ghoulified remains of humans all around you. it getts pretty tense. afetr a while of straight playing you become slightly desensitised to the fear. but it's really good while it lasts and if you get the point lookout DLC then it does (when you travel to point lookout anyway) become really scarry again.\n\n3.The story is amazing\nThe story, despite its faults, is really good. it becomes really immersive and the choices you have to make are sometimes really moraly grey. for instance i had a choice between killing this man who was routed to the spot for decades, unable to move, with little conversation and immense boredom. while having his insides torn slowly from his body by a tree that had grown around him. or speeding up the recovery of the wasteland. and improving life for everyone. it was a really difficult choice but I had to choose improving everyones life over his.\n\n4.World Design\nthe world is teeming with secrets and, while it may not be very large, requires quite a lot of exploration to find everything. random encounters make thsi all the more intresting also.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I think Fallout 3 is an excellent game. it may have its issues, but most can be fixed by getting the DLC and user created mod's.\n\nIt is by far bethesda's greatest game and the best in the fallout franchise. it is lore is rich and immersive and the music is some of the best i have heard (in terms of actually songs that include vocals and are in the game as radio tracks or jukebox records. not background music).\n\nThe lack of achievements is saddening. I would really like to 100% this game, but alass it seems bethesda did little more than shove this game on steam without continuued support or additional features. a shame really.\n\nIf I was to give an arbitrary score to this game it would be around 8/10, losing a point purely for its lack of achievements, a few story plot holes and its inability to work on most windows 7 (and 8) PC's. overall its a great game and i completely recromend it over fallout: new vegas. or any game for that matter. just make sure you get the broken steel DLC and point lookout if you want to keep the scary atmosphere going.","September 27, 2014","true","70.1"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","25","32","7","0"

This game is probably the most unique game i've ever played, its a open world RPG much like The Elder Scrolls games, but Fallout has much more, such as radiation poisining, cripable limbs, better atmosphere and more realisim.\n\nThe story begins with your birth, and in a quick pace progresses to the most important moments of your childhood, such as the time you get your Pipboy 3000. You live in Vault 101, a place made to keep its citizens alive during the nuclear war that happened on the surface. But, Vault 101's doors never opened after the nuclear war. Everybody was to repopulate and die in Vault 101, nobody was to leave and nobody was to enter. But of course you got out because.. who would want to live in a scary vault filled with people for the rest of your life?\n\nAfter your childhood "dream" ends you are awakened by alarms, you are very confused. Your best friend tells you that your father left Vault 101. You decide to leave Vault 101, as it is no longer safe, creatures from the outside have poured in because of your father opening the Vault door. When going outside of the vault, you can already feel the atmosphere, how amazing it is. In the distance you see cities, and of course, The wastelands. Now you should be ready to feel the awesomeness of the game, the quests.\n\nIn Fallout 3, there are many ways to finish quests. Lets say you need to get past a door, but you need a key to open the door. You could always pick pocket the person who owns the key, but depending on your skill level, he will notice, and start to kill you. You could also blow his brains out, easiest way to do it. But whatever you do, it will impact the future of your game. If you were bad throughout the game, and killed lots of innocent people, your Karma will go down. But if you do good things, your Karma will stay at a neutral level, or gain. Everytime you level up, you can choose a perk you would like to advance in, and you will get a certain amount of skill points to upgrade your stats. Also, theres a neat aiming system called VATs, its really hard to explain what it actually does, but you could always YouTube it.\n\nGraphics: 8/10 (they are good, but not even close to newer games)\nSound: 9/10\nGameplay: 9.5/10","July 20, 2014","true","134.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I don't recommend that you buy Fallout 3 standard edition, because I regret that I bought the standard edition. So listen to me: DON'T BUY the STANDARD EDITION, but do BUY the GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION. The main reason is that all dlc's are worth it and it'll cost you more when you buy the standard edition. My second reason is that some mods do require all dlc's. I hope this will help people and that they don't buy the standard editon but the GOTY edition.\n\nMy rating for this game is: 9/10\n","May 26","true","79.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

In all honesty, it plays pretty well, the environment may not always be interactive, but it's quite well detailed for a 2007 game. You have a choice to be either a hero, a neutral or villain in the Captial Wasteland. As you continue leveling up, more perks become available. While I have played the regular version, the Game of the Year Edition comes with all the DLC, but it's worth it for: You get to travel to Pittsburgh, aka "The Pitt", get to be abducted by aliens in Mothership Zeta, run in Alaska, attacking Chinese soldiers in a simulation on Operation: Anchorage, help the Brotherhood of Steel fight back against the Enclave in Broken Steel and travel through the swamplands in Point Lookout. If you enjoy RPGs, Post apocolyptic open worlds, bloodshed (In combat and the locations) and enjoy a game that has a story to it,  I'd suggest trying out for yourself. When I tried it out, I thought it wouldn't be worth my time. However, after patching it and getting Nexus Mods Manager (Call me a ♥♥♥♥♥, but had to remove Radscorpions due to Arachnephobia), the game improved for me. After running in the wasteland, I have found a few unsettling locations for all you people who enjoy a "creepy" atmosphere. .Only complaints I have is that for me, half the time, the VAT system doesn't aim worth a heck, the game tends to crash when running programs like Skype, Google Chrome (When on Youtube) and other games with the problem that FO3 ends if it's just alone, but with Broken Steel, you can play more of the game or simply choose to not do the battle, but continue other things before the final quest.However, that shouldn't stop you from having a good time. If you do get the game, I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did and remember: Tunnel Snakes Rule!","March 7, 2015","true","48.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","5"

A good 100+ hour world to get lost in, and would recommend DLCs too.\n\nFULL REVIEW BELOW\n“Man had succeeded in destroying the world – but war, war never changes” – Ron Pearlman\n\nThe year is 2277 and it has been 200 years since the Great War that consumed the Earth in nuclear fire and radiation. You are a resident of Vault 101, one of many underground shelters built before the war. The door to Vault 101 slides open for the first time in 200 years, and you emerge into the ruins of Washington D.C, now known as The Capital Wasteland.\n\nThis review is written from the perspective of a fan of RPGs and story-driven games, who hasn’t played any other Fallout games.\n\nGAMEPLAY AND DESIGNFallout 3 is a massive open world sandbox RPG that can be played from a first or third-person perspective. You are thrust into the world and given a goal, but it is up to you to decide how long you want to take to reach it. The Capital Wasteland is a harsh and sprawling land that lets you go wherever you want, whenever you want. The map is absolutely huge, consisting of downtown DC and all of its surrounding areas ranging from sewers to suburbs. The absolutely huge amount of approaches to the land can be overwhelming for some players. You may struggle with knowing where to start, especially given the fact the game offers very little direction. Just doing quests would probably only uncover a quarter to a third of the entire map, so players that prefer independent exploration and spontaneous discovery will get a lot of more value vs. someone who follows the quest markers.\n\nThe progression system is fair and you start to feel more powerful over the course of the game, however by the end if you play your stats right you can literally have a jack of all trades, master of all character. Being able to cap every single stat on one character can eliminate some replay ability meaning the only reason to start another character would be alternative morality choices. On the other hand, it does eliminate the annoying factor of not being able to see what’s behind that door because I’m one point too short in this specific stat for people who don’t have time for 5 different playthroughs. Enemy difficulty adapts to your character level rather than the areas. This means that no matter where you go, the enemies will always be at your level. This is good as it keeps the combat fresh and evolving all the way to the very end, but bad because you can't stomp early game areas. It also allows players to explore freely at any point in the game without the risk of being suddenly disintegrated by some level 30 mob and losing 3 hours of progress because you forgot to save.\n\nI really like the way the game handles the exploration and looting systems. You can fast travel back to any area you’ve discovered. This sparks the age old argument of immersion vs. quality of life, but hey, you’re not forced to use it. As you work your way through the game you slowly progress from picking up as much useless crap as you can carry to analysing the environment and cherry picking the most relevant and valuable stuff. For example, I didn’t see the point in lugging around a motorcycle gas tank until I found out you can build a flaming sword out of them and began hunting for them. I hoarded seemingly useless scrap metal until it paid off because it turned out some guy in a city was willing to pay for it to fix some pipes. I felt a wasteland junk expert by the end, as my approach to every new room became systematically rummaging through filing cabinets and desks for valuables that extend beyond money vs. not money.\n\nSTORY AND NARRATIVEFallout 3s story is essentially structured into the main quest, side quests and DLC quests.  The main quest itself is a pretty mediocre story about finding your dad. It has its moments, but ultimately just serves to give the game a beginning and end. The middle portion, you will spend getting lost in the sometimes great, sometimes bad and sometimes plain weird side quests. The side quests are few in number (given the games size) and you won’t see 4 or 5 people with floating question marks on their heads asking you to fetch 12 bear asses. The role play aspect plays a big role in these side quests, allowing you to morally be the second coming of Christ, a boring stoic neutral dude, or Lucifer himself. This can cause quests to branch a few different ways (your stats can come into play during conversations too) but ultimately it usually ends up resulting to being good or evil. The excellent DLC packs definitely present a lot more ambiguous choices where you really have to think about things beyond being good or evil. Every DLC adds something to the game both story and gameplay wise, and I whole heartedly recommend getting them all (or the Ultimate Edition) if you can.\n\nThe other side of the story telling is more subtle than speaking to townsfolk and being explicitly told what’s going on. A lot of the locations in the game contain stories that you figure out, rather than being told. For example, I entered a motel room with a bunch of long dead skeletons, some guns and pre-war cash laying around. Some people would just loot the joint and move on, and that’s fine. Other people will look around and realise through the way the bodies and guns are positioned and seeing the pre-war money was leading back to a briefcase in the middle of the room, that a standoff after a bank heist took place in this room over 200 years ago. Bethesda put a lot of TLC and work into deliberately laying places out this way. It’s not just a random composition, there is a reason why everything is the way it is. You may think it’s a shame that so much work was put into things most players would miss, but I prefer the think that the fact that so many players miss it makes it much more special for the players that catch it.\n\nThe voiceover work can be a bit hit and miss, with the stand out performances being Ron Pearlman’s narration and Liam Neeson as your dad. Everything else is ok, or sometimes outright embarrassing, but I suppose that’s fair enough given the sheer amount of people there are to converse with. Your character isn’t voice acted, which of course gives a lot more freedom to the writers regarding conversation options. The writing is the real star of the show in this game. The game also offers a couple interesting radio stations to listen to whilst you roam the wastes, but in a game as long as this you will run into a lot of recurring dialogue and music that unfortunately gets old fast.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORAMANCEFallout 3 was released in 2008 and it shows. It is by no means an ugly game and the scale of the world definitely makes up for the lack of eye candy.  The scale of the world also results in lots and lots of bugs. Some can be game breaking (albeit rarely) and others are just irritating or sometimes humorous. Ultimately I would say it’s worth powering through them to play the game. The game also has some major stability issues, especially on newer hardware. For instance I was having issues because for some reason this game was having issues with an OS newer than Vista and a processor with more than two cores. Almost everyone falls under that blanket these days and although these have easy fixes they are still annoying to deal with. The game used to have GFWL but thankfully it’s been removed. I would normally mitigate the ugliness of older games with mods, but I had issues with those here as well. Your mileage may vary, but I couldn’t go over 8-10 mods without constant crashing and FPS drops. In depth complicated mods are also much more annoying to install than something like Skyrim so I had to settle for more minor visual and quality of life changes.","October 19, 2015","true","109.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Bethesda reached it's full potential in this game and it's 5 things of additional content. The story alone was amazing, and the side quests, characters, DLC's all drove the story further. The exploration of the world can award you with items like the Ailen Firelance and the Experiemental MIRV. I may not be able to play the game on my PC and see mods that drive this game even further like Cube Experiemental but I have done everything and seen everrything available in the Xbox 360 version of the game. Overall I rate this game a 10/10 because it nails everything that a roleplayer would want in this Post- apacoliptic RPG named Fallout 3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fall0utGuy/recommended/22300/","Fall0utGuy","Alex ☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fall0utGuy/","192 products in account","Hi there! This game is Fallout 3, a post-apocalyptic game from the wonderful developers of Bethesda Softworks. This game is over 6 years old, but despite the short main story in the game, there's still a good amount of content to go about. The game world is open, the Capital Wasteland is inhabited by many things, some friendly but most things you'll meet are going to want to tear you apart and use your skull for decorating. But how about the DLC? Well I'll tell you. The only DLC that I have currently is called "Operation Anchorage", the story of the DLC is that in broad strokes you're helping fight the Red Chinese in the American Reconquest of Alaska, it gives you an insight into how a soldier lived before the Great War, daily putting his life at stake for the greater good of America, and the defense against Communism! You also need a DLC to continue playing after you continue the main storyline though... I don't know, I don't mind myself, but of course the DLC also gives you an expansion to the story, which I won't really go into, because it would spoil some... Things... Let's keep it at that, I guess you may have already had it spoiled anyways but I wouldn't wanna be the person that does it.\nBeware though, multiple people are complaining about the game being unstable on Windows 7 and even more so on 10 I've only had it crash twice, one being because I messed with the game files... I only had one glitch as well, and it wasn't gamebreaking.\nQuestions I'd like to ask myself if I had no idea about Fallout:\n\nQ: Why wouldn't I buy Fallout 1 and 2 or Tactics first?\n\nA: You can do that, but the three first games are different to 3 and New Vegas in the sense that it's isometric top-down view in those games. There are also major graphical glitches on some system, but they should be fixable with an unofficial patch somewhere I believe... In comparison to newer Fallout games, which can be played either as 3rd person, or 1st person, I personally play as 1st person because it's more immersive.\n\nQ: Is there/what is the levelcap of Fallout 3 without any DLC and does DLC make a difference for the levelcap?\n\nA: In comparison to Fallout New Vegas where the levelcap can be 50 with all the DLC (30 without any at all) Fallout 3 only has a levelcap of 20, however this can be raised to 30 if you have the Broken Steel DLC, which is also the name of the DLC that allows you to play on after the end of the main Story.\n\nQ: What are the main differences between Fallout 3 and New Vegas?\n\nA: There's a number of them, mainly the factions system that they included in New Vegas, and also the removal of percentage chance to have a successful special dialogue option in favor for the more simple "Have X amount of points in Y skill, and you will be successful in this special dialogue." There are mods however, that allow you to switch it back I believe. Also that Fallout 3 by default has a color filter that makes everything look greener, whereas in New Vegas it makes the game look more orange-yellowy. There is a mod to turn this off called Fellout for both games, and I highly recommend it as I like being able to see specific colors instead of them being tinted either green or yellow. The locations are also vastly different as Fallout 3 takes place in the bombed ruins of Washington D.C and New Vegas takes place in the Mojave desert at Las Vegas (New Vegas in the game, surprise surprise) also the ability to disguise onself as a faction is New Vegas... It's something I don't really use but it can definitely be helpful in some situations, like when you don't wanna cause a shootout, and need to stay stealthy.\nThis has been my review for Fallout 3 and I hope you liked it, patient reader. At first I thought I would just adress that the game is far from unplayable with Windows 7/10 as some people claim that it is, but it may vary from system to system I suppose.\nThank you for reading, and I hope I convinced you somewhere along the way to buy Fallout 3.","September 11, 2015","true","65.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","4"

The game world is huge, and there are tons of places to explore and things to see.  It's hard to put into words how tightly the elements of character, setting, and plot are woven together.  Discovering what has happened to humanity after the nuclear apocalypse is fantastically entertaining.  The controls are very easy to get used to, and what first looks like a complex inventory\status menu turns out to be quite simple and logical once you get the hang of it.  The choices you make have observable consequences, and you will more than likely develop real feelings toward some of the characters you meet, unless your heart is made of stone.  Regardless, exploring post-apocalyptic DC is a fantastic experience I would recommend to anyone.\n\nI purchased the game and all DLC for $7.24 and have played around 63 hours as of this edit.  This is a 10/10 game for sure.","December 31, 2013","true","79.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Fallout 3 takes place in a desolate wasteland filled with anarchy and hatred but what makes it amazing are the glimmers of hope surrounding the otherwise hopeless landscape. Fallout 3 has great lore and interesting story that is immersive and not only is story engage but also the atmosphere. It makes you want to explore the Capital wasteland even more. The combat mechanics are a little meh, but you can get plenty of mods to fix that from the nexus. Speaking of mods the mods for this game are amazing which increases the experience 10 fold. So overall Fallout 3 is a priceless gem that should not be skipped, I would rate this 9.8/10.

This game literally ruined my life, i've finished it like 14 times before losing the count. No, i'm not crazy, yes, my social life imploded. And don't trust the grandpas that will tell you this game is garbage just because they played the first 2 Fallouts and refused to play this one, they are just ignorant. In this game you live a wonderful and touching adventure in first person (Identifying so with the character), watching the character growing and becoming the hero or anti-hero that he'll be. Oh yes, because obviously you can and have to choose between choices that will influence the events and your karma. So, we have an abnormus replay factor, if we consider that we can play as good, bad, neutrals or do a mixed playtrough, choosing maybe a different type of class for the fight. AND, the game is easily moddable and has a large and active modding community: Nexus Mods. So, even if you have finished it in every way possible, you can mod it and transform it in a new game to discover. Trust me, this game is AWESOME.\n\n\nLa guerra... la guerra non cambia mai.\n\nItaliano:\n\nNon fidatevi del tempo di gioco che dice Steam, l'ho comprato anche qui giusto per averlo. Questo gioco ha letteralmente rovinato la mia vita, lo avrò finito qualcosa come 14 volte prima di perdere il conto. No, non sono pazzo, si, la mia vita sociale ne ha risentito un pochino. E non fidatevi dei vecchiacci che vi diranno che questo titolo fa schifo, solo perché giocarono ai primi due ai tempi, e si rifiutarono di giocare questo, sono degli ignoranti. In questo gioco vivi un'avventura stupenda e toccante in prima persona (Immedesimandoti dunque nel personaggio), vedendo il personaggio crescere man mano e plasmandolo lentamente nell'eroe o antieroe che sarà. Eh si, perché ovviamente potrai e dovrai fare delle scelte che influenzeranno gli eventi ed il tuo karma. Abbiamo dunque anche un fattore rigiocabilità enorme se consideriamo che possiamo giocare da cattivi, da buoni, da neutri o fare un mix, scegliendo magari anche una tipologia di personaggio diversa per quanto riguarda i combattimenti. Senza contare il fatto che il gioco è facilmente moddabile e vanta di una community di modders vasta e attiva, ovvero Nexus Mods. Dunque anche avendolo finito in tutte le maniere possibili e immaginabili, potete ancora moddarlo all'infinito e renderlo un gioco nuovo tutto da riscoprire.

There is an abundance of weapons, and interesting items such as "bobbleheads" that you can find in various places to permanently increase your character's efficiency. I have lost count of how many different replays I've had on this game, and every single time it gets better. Now, I can't cram all of the amazing things about this game into a single review.

Although the map isn't as big as Skyirm, it was a big one when it was released, and it has a lot of details that makes worth to spend time exploring it all.\n\nThe history is great, and not only this major one. There are little histories inside the big one, details or personal messages of past wastelanders that immerses you even more inside the wasteland.\n\nThe characters are great too.You can find evil persons, good persons, weird ones, etc... the world is still alive.  Dialogues are great and there many ways to bring a conversation. Also it has benefits if you choose certain options, so it's interesting to repeat to see how many possibilites are there.\n\nAlso has dark humour and easter eggs. It's an open world, so you don't have to go just by one way, you can go wherever you want.\n\nThe only bad thing i would say is that maybe there isn't much variety of weapons, specially on the melee field. Also the karma system is a little overbalanced, it's hard to be evil. Also, the level cap its at 20, but that is solved if you buy the DLC Broken Steel, which raises it to 30.\n\n9/10","September 27, 2014","true","20.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","4"

It's just so gloriously satisfying to be immersed in this world that has been so painstakingly put together just for your entertainment.\nThe amusing little side stories that you uncover in this game can be quite hilarious (if you are anything at all like me then you can't stop yourself from snooping every email on every working terminal you happen to pass by). The characters can be so amusingly ridiculous at times that you just want to shoot them or worse yet set them loose in the desert to see how badly they fare. And some of the missions are just... Well, completely surprising. They can leave you scratching your head and wondering what the hell you should do, which way should you go? And I really love that! I never thought a game could be like that. And yet this one is. It will always be my absolute favourite.","May 20, 2014","true","208.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Not working on Win 7 and 8? No excuse. Most people use Win 7 and it was released only a year before Win 7. So if Bethesda wanted Fallout 3 to have a shelf life of more than one year, they should have patched it.\nYes there are fixes and workarounds but they only work occasionally and are frequently too complex for a dumbass like me (a dumbass who would buy a game that doesn't work with his OS).\n\nWhich brings us to two questions.\n\n1) Why has this not been patched?\n\n2) Why is it on Steam if most people can not play it?\n\nAnd I am pretty sure that there is one answer for both questions; "Money and Laziness". Unfortunate as this and ESO have made me start to wonder,\n\n3) Is Bethesda going to start being like EA (and by "EA" I mean "Cashcowing and not fixing problems and releasing low quality games")?\n\nAnd I think that the answer is a sad "Yes." And I think it has for some time.\n\nThe game is decent though.","December 12, 2014","false","0.3"," 41 of 75 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","41","75","4","2"

Sadly though i wasnt able to experience the second game of the franchise. I rarely found any bugs or glitches with this game and has replayability since you are always trying to discover new locations, characters, or enemies and go back and find little secrets hidden within the game or just to simply find things you havnt seen since you last played. Although even with this ther can tend to be small tiny glitches such as main characters your supposed to follow getting stuck in walls which makes you have to start from your recent save, but this rarely happens anyway. Even when you complete the storyline you can still explore these wastelands to find new side quest which are generally killing someone or just getting specific items. Bethesda really did a good job at making this brilliant game, Personally i would rate it 8/10 and would recommend it.","July 6, 2014","true","2.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This time, of Fallout 3. Shall we get started?\n\nTo start, I have to say I don't think I've ever experienced a more enjoyable character customisation than the one found in this game. It was full of humour and interesting choices (and said interesting choices often lead to more humour) and this theme continues throughout the duration of the game. Some notable choices include the chace to explode one of the only decent cities in the game, and the opportunity to commit genocide (that's going to remain without context; I don't want to spoil it for you). I honestly can't wait to jump back in and get back to making choices. CHOICES!!!!!!\n\nThere's plenty of content in this game. In most of my reviews I mention that there's a need for extra content, or so much of the same type of content that it got stale but, much like the story of goldilocks, this bed was just right (How can a bed be too soft?!) I liked how the game was riddled with locked doors that could only be opened if you had a certain science or lock picking skill\n\nThe storyline was admirable, but not incredible. It basically consisted of "You're dad's gone missing, go find 'im" and then turns into "Genocide, yes or no?" However, I really did like the way the environment and various notes and computers could tell their own story and add depth to the game. Not enough games do this. The last of which that I've played was Mass Effect and before that, Skyrim (Both of these score a 10/10, btw)(Although, Mass Effect loses points for not publishing the third one on Steam) Often enough, reading journal entries could reveal more about what was actually going on in the environment. For example, in one particular moment, test chambers had dead mutated humans and, upon walking into these rooms, you could discover that they still contain radiation. This in itself mightn’t reveal much, but reading some journal entries shows who was responsible for these deaths (I shall say no more.)\n\nNow to mechanics. This game was built by Bethesda, so I thought I should mention that I noticed some similar mechanics in both of the games. However, obviously because this game is set in a post apocalyptic Washington D.C and not Viking Tamriel (And I'm not just saying that because of the helmets) There were some different and welcome variations between the two. For staters, the skill trees were far different. I actually liked the one in Fallout slightly (SLIIIIIIIGHTLY) better, although I can't really figure out why. However, I didn't really like how the currency in the game (Bottle caps) Were difficult to come by without performing getting bad karma (And I really wanted the good ending.) I honestly can't remember if I bought anything at all in this game. I just horded my caps until the end (Although, at times I wished I'd repaired my combat shotgun or purchased some health kits) For most weapons (All the weapons? I don't know, I didn't try them all out) There weren't any scopes, which made aiming excessively difficult. There was a cool system that allowed you to target a specific part of the body of your enemy and gave you a percentage chance of you hitting it. This was a great idea, but it was performed badly. A still, unaware target, regardless of the distance, should have a high percentage of hit. This wasn't always the case. Even a target standing 12 cm from your face only had a 95% chance of hit (SERIOUSLY, CHARACTER. DO YOU HAVE TOUURETTES?!) I would've disregarded this mechanic entirely except for the bonus critical chance it offers.\n\nThe art style was good. I liked the way everything, even the towns, looked so make-shift and finding American monuments completely exploded was somewhat satisfying (I'm getting arrested for saying that, huh?) The graphics were decent, especially considering when this game was created.\n\nAll right, let us summarise.\nCharacter customisation: Good\nContent: Excellent\nMechanics: Satisfactory\nArt style: Good\n\nI'm just about done. Final verdict- 8.3131932524020387829/10\nThanks for reading.","July 20, 2014","true","30.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

But after a while, I enjoyed the game a lot.\n\nThe game's difficult, it has a nice atmosphere, the story's great and the characters are pretty good in terms of personality. Hell, I even got scared sh*tless when I was encountering some enemies in the night and inside some buildings.\n\nHowever, I do think that the main story was a bit short but I found it enjoyable nonetheless. I get it that you can continue your story with the Broken Steel DLC but I don't really have it, that's why it was short for me. And as for the notice, yes. It's not optimized for Windows 7 and later since it wasn't working at the beginning, but after watching a guide of how to make it work on Youtube, it took me like a few minutes to make it work. Not a very big deal.\n\nOverall, Fallout 3 is not my favorite Fallout game but it's surely one of my favorite games. I can fully recommend this game. And if you have a potato PC like I do, then don't worry. The game was running with like 30 FPS and I had a nice time.\n\nP.S.: That f*cking behemoth in the beginning, though. I wasn't expecting that at all. ;-; Also, I can't believe there's a weapon called "Fat man" lol.","February 25","true","30.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","9"

In my personal opinion this game is better then fallout 4 and a bit worst then New Vegas. If you love Action RPGs this is a "most play" game for you. I will try to explain the diference between all 3 games. Fallout 3 overall is better then fallout 4 except in the graphics. And fallout 3 overall is a bit worst then New Vegas except in the story, I think the fallout 3 story is better then New Vegas Story.

While New Vegas is more robust, Fallout 3 has a more concise story, and a much more fleshed out world to explore.","February 16, 2014","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The pacing of the story is much different.and there is V.A.T.S. which there is nothing even close to similar in either of the Elder Scrolls games.\nThis games only drawback is GFWL, and some win 7 machines don't like to run the game well. I personally didn't have any issues with it however.\n\nThis game is on my list of top favorite games of all time, at least in the top 10 for sure. It has it all.

Now I know what you're thinking and before you say anything about how long I've played, but I owned the game on xbox before rebuying it because it's just that great of a game. This game has one of the best post apocolyptic setting and style I've ever seen.The game play is obviously like any RPG made by Bethesda. You can really get a feel for your character and have relativly nice control over who they are, even if it's all put on a morality system that sometimes can be a little off. The situations you're put into have multiple outcomes and ways of going about them and the game gives you a sizeable amount of freedom without giving you everything. The combat and weapon variety is awesome, even if some weapons are better than others. If you are really committed to having your character be a certain way, you have all the freedom to do it and the tools available. It really is a game where you can get a feel for how you want to do something. And the large modding community this game had gives this game even more replay value because mods can add so much more to this game.\nNow there will always be obvious problems in these games. While the game is mostly great, you will experience your occasional bug but that is pretty standard with Bethesda RPGs. And the fact that when you try and zoom in with a weapon, it just ZOOMS in was a pretty bad choice(which I'm glad can be fixed with mods and that Bethesda later chose to change for Fallout: NV). Also that third person was also a little weird. While I'm sure some people may have enjoyed it, I usually stayed with first person. I think this could've been fixed if you had more control over where your character was located(I.E. To the right, left or centered). The game is also EXTREMELY easy if you're a thief. You actually have to force yourself into not being successful because it's too easy to be successful in this game.\n\nBut all and all, I recommend this game to EVERYONE who even has a slight interest in trying it because it's an experience that isn't worth missing out on.

The main story line of the game has multiple endings based on what you did earlier in game or what you choose near the end of the game. The game also has tons of hidden special weapons hidden around the map with better stats and a new name it really makes you want to go out and explore. with an amasing sound track and a big open world to explore I would rate this game a solid 10/10 and is on my list of the best games I have ever played.\n\nGood job Bethesda!\n\n\n(just sayin I played the game on console so ignore my hours)","December 17, 2013","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The ups are decent graphics, good balance and gameplay, decent voice acting and quests, while the downs are crashes and graphical errors, horrible animations, weak level perks, and to be honest? Not much replayability. Yeah you can choose different outcomes for quests, or wield different weapons, but attention isn't given enough to the different styles (melee, ranged, unarmed) to warrant playing out different characters.\n\nBut this is just my opinion. I still say this is a fantastic game despite its flaws, and worth buying. The encounters, both scripted and unscripted, are fun, plain and simple. There's plenty to explore and amusing scenarios to play over and over quickly via the quicksave and quickload, which is instant, unlike other games. The AI is decent, funny, and makes for interesting scenarios.\n\nAs a standalone game it's worth the investment, just dont expect perfection. 8/10","June 18, 2011","true","78.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was on the summer holidays last year and I spent the whole summer mastering the game . I found everything that there is in it . Now that my best friend Kenan bought it to me on steam I was really happy . So I downloaded it and started playing it all over again. Damn nostalgia striked when I hear Three Dog on the radio saying "THIS IS THREE DOG , AUUUU AND YOU ARE LISTENING TO GALAXY NEWS RADIO" . Damn. So I was playing it for 18 hours straight and I finished the game. My goal now is to mater it all over again on the PC. But I got to admit. Console version is ♥♥♥♥ compared to the PC version of the game. FPS , graphics everything looks better on the PC. And + there are no problems like game quits for no reason or freezes after playing for several hours. That happened to the PS3 version a lot and it's broken so I am glad they fixed that on the PC version. The game offers you over 100 hours of gameplay and I am looking forward to buy the DLC's so I can expand it even more. It's just sad *SPOILER ALERT* when you die at the end of the game, but you don't if you own the DLC called Broken Steel. Fear, courage,adventure,shooter almost everything is mixed up in this game. It's one of the best games that exists and I recommend it to everyone out there.

New Vegas may have polished what Fallout 3 lacked but Fallout 3 has such a different and unique atmosphere from NV. I will not give any spoilers as to what happens during the game in this review so don't worry. The game really does capture you from the start and transport you all the way to the end which is amazingly well done. You will begin to feel for the characters that you encounter and if they so happen to die you'll actually care unlike some other games. The gameplay is obviously from a FPS perspective and it is an new feature added that wasn't in the previous games. The open world element to the game is suited to the game and exploration is encouraged throughout it. The graphics may seem slightly dated but that is hardly noticable when you immerse yourself in this expansive world of post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Overall I give this game a 8.5/10 an amazing game that revived the franchise.","November 30, 2014","true","100.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Characters is something Fallout 3 does almost flawlessly... they iconic location such as the washington monument and the lincoln memorial are so well re-created in this depressing post-apocalyptic setting!!! not to mention the characters are very well done by Bethesda.. my favourite companion in any Fallout game is Fawkes he is so ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!!!! i can´t stress it enough if your doing a playthrough of Fallout 3! use him...\n\nThe DLC´s\nfunny to think that my main gripe with Fallout 3 isn´t even part of the main game!!!!! Mothership Zeta is the worst DLC of all Fallout games to date imo it is unitresting and boring! Point Lookout on the other hand is completely different! it has intresting characters... creppy locations and a fairly good main quest! overall i recommend it the other DLC´s Broken Steel is basically a must have if your serious about this game as it lifts the level cap from 20 to 30 aswell as let´s you play after the game´s ending The Pitt is also a pretty good DLC and i recommend it aswell!\n\nVerdict\nwith everything i said in this review there is still so much more that is great about Fallout 3! sure i´m not gonna deny that it´s buggy and is not optimized for Windows 7 and up tho there are work arounds.... besides that Fallout 3 is easily my favourite video game of all time!!!!!","March 7","true","152.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

First of all, Its fallout, These games are known for their action-packed, yet emotionally and path focused stories. First of all I'll adress negatives; The game is VERY dark. (this isnt a negative for all people, but for me it is, I like bright colorful scenes, with a more realistic story) Another negative is well, Later on in the story there isnt VERY much to do, although you'll find quests what bothers me is, you'll find a city with 50+ and only 1 or 2 people will give you something to do. Another thing is the ♥♥♥♥ING ACCURACY IN VATS IS AWFUL, IVE BEEN FACE FIRST WITH OVER 500 MOBS WITH A .44 REPEATER ONLY TO MISS, JESUS CHRIST. And lastly in my Cons is Optimization. some people have it worse some people have it ok, luckily i was the Ok side. The game crashes every 4 or so hours and alt-tabbing means you have to restart the entire game. Also controller support is god awful, (THE GAME HAS GWOL CAREFUL!!!)\nWhere do I start with the good? Jesus christ man this game, the story is godly, the dialouge options are amazing not to mention the way the ending is molded based on your choices. You'll have follows based on karma, exclusive rewards for doing good or bad deeds, it just never ends. The guns go on and on, combat is actually fun, your limbs get crippled and the game is realistic. It isnt some COD ♥♥♥♥ where i find ammo on every body i see, I literally need to scavenge and use my rarer rounds (.44, 308 etc) wisley and dont find them off little timmy's body. Not to mention the atmosphere (although i hate dark games) goes INCREDIBLEY WELL. The games characters and factions even put into a proper perspective what happens in such an enviorment, although ill end my review here, please, pick up this game either on a console or a PC (optimization on PC is ♥♥♥♥) but play it, just play it.","June 24, 2015","true","18.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Anyway, I'm going to do something different this time around and review this one twice, once as a game and once as a Fallout game, because THERE'S a contentious issue.\n\nAs a game: It's a bit clunky, and the mechanics are often broken, but the story, atmosphere, characters, and immersion completely make up for it in a way that I've never seen before and almost didn't think possible. It was Yahtzee Croshaw that once said, "Immersion can save the life of a bad game, and inversely, a lack of immersion can be a dogshit bullet right between the eyes." I wouldn't call Fallout 3 a bad game, per se, but the flaws are clearly there. The weapon degredation isn't entirely necessary, as you'll run out of ammo far sooner than your gun will break, and there really aren't enough non-combat options for...anything, except getting bosses to stop being ♥♥♥♥♥. Overall, though, it completely sucked me in, and I highly recommend it to anyone who can handle what is probably the first game I've played that truly deserves an 'M' for Mature (as opposed to WHEE SHOOTY SHOOTY EXPLOSION).\n\nAs a Fallout game: Let's start off with the good. With only one exception I can think of (the T-51b not being 'powered,' which I immediately created a mod to fix), it fits in with the lore perfectly, so no complaint there. In addition, it builds on the Fallout universe in a way that makes it seem even more truly alive, and does a lot with what already existed. I like what they did with Mr. Handys, Deathclaws, Harold's story, Fallout's trademark crazy people who'll start a cult over anything, the music (good God, I LOVE what they've done with the music), and several other elements. As for the bad, or what is popularly concieved as disowning it from the franchise: well, the tone is definitely shifted, into a more desperate, lonely experience, but people often forget how often that was often present in the first Fallout, too, what with the Glow, the invasion of Necropolis, the whole Boneyard situation, etc. Secondly, the gameplay is obviously completely different. It's certainly necessary for this particular game, but was it necessary for a new Fallout game? Countering a question with a question, is it really that different? You can still target individual parts of enemies, increase skills and earn perks, the SPECIAL system is still thankfully there, and you can get companions to help you out. Despite the 3D gameplay, this is still the same Fallout world with the same Fallout situations that you solve in the same Fallout ways. Yes, it is a Fallout game. I personally would put it below Fallout 1, but above Fallout 2. If you're an original Fallout fan, I recommend it even more.\n\nNo, you want a game that seemingly will deviate to a large extent from the originals, look no further than Fallout 4...\n\nP.S. I find it interesting how Dogmeat shifted to a tank, instead of the ally who knocks enemies down so that you can get 95% criticals to their eyes. No complaints on the new version, though.","September 12, 2015","true","105.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You live in an underground vault, what seems to be very peaceful; until your dad decides to leave, and chaos breaks out. You follow him and end up in a completely destroyed wasteland where you will meet all sorts of amazing and terrifying things, while trying to find your dad.\n\nYou can explore the wasteland in either third person or first person. There's a special V.A.T.S. (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) available to target specific body parts. It then shows a slow-motion scene of you dismembering the abominations you meet in the most gruesome way, which makes combat extremely fun and satisfying.\n\nOptions are endless. You can spend hours exploring the destroyed buildings you come across, or search for loot in dark caverns, or just help someone out who's in trouble; it's all up to you. Meanwhile, you'll earn experience, improve skills and gain perks, which helps you build your ultimate character. You can be a saint, or the devil himself, or choose the middle road. People will react differently and dialogue differs according to your playing style.\n\nEverything is well written and the dialogue can be very interesting, serious, or just plain hilarious at times. Often you will find yourself grinning at the hilarious things people say or things that happen.\n\nGraphically, this game isn't exactly stunning; character models often look a bit 'stiff' and dated, but the atmosphere and general details totally make up for that. Audiovisual this game is incredible. You hear happy classical tunes coming from your radio in the background, while in reality everything around you is destroyed and not happy at all. And although you will probably hear the same lines every now and then, voice-acting is well done.\n\nThe game itself has a lot of bugs, glitches and flaws, but if you look past it, you will see a beautiful game with an overwhelming amount of content, good for literally hunderds upon hundreds of playing hours. The gameplay is very addictive, this is roleplaying at its finest. It will draw you in, and once you've got the grasp of it, it's difficult to let go. You want to keep exploring, discover new places, quests, and persons. Everytime you play, you're bound to find something new. Simply a masterful game that's worth every penny and a must play for anyone.","October 29, 2015","true","250.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

If you dont like oblivion style gaming, you can still play old 1 or 2 if you didnt played it yet.\nBut what I really cant swallow is the ending, which is pretty linear and very "hero" like.

Mods have updated the visuals, effects, and content of the game to feel like it's brand new.\n\nEverywhere you go, there is a town or person that needs to be saved, and you are that person who can save everyone... or not. While this game doesn't offer as much freedom of choice that New Vegas offers, Fallout 3 gives you many opportunities to feel like a hero in various ways.\n\nNewer games tend to throw side-quests at you so you can get detoured for hours doing a lot of them. Fallout 3's story progresses in a very linear fashion, and while there are many sidequests that you can partake in, you often have to go out of your way to find and solve these quests. You can very realistically go from the beginning to end of this game without doing one sidequest. It's not a bad thing, but it does make this game less immersive than more recent games of this type.\n\nIf you've never played Fallout 3 before, this is definitely one worth playing as it set the bar for other amazing games in the genre.\n\n8/10 "Great"","July 1, 2015","true","11.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

To start this review off you should know that I have put a good amount of hours in the game, but since its not made for windows 10, I had to troubleshoot in order to get the game running and one of the cons to that is that it does not show how many hours you have put into the game. Overall the game is OK for something that came out in 2008, It is essentially skyrim, with mutants, and not dragons. the gameplay is alright, you still can't sprint (Just like Skyrim) so thats a bit of a problem, but so far the storyline is cool, the characters, and the open world is really cool. If you have never played any of the fallout games, and you still want to get fallout 4, I would suggest, playing Fallout 3 just to get yourself familliar on whats to come.\n\nOVerall the game is good, especially if you can get it on sale, but like the game says, it is not compadable for windows 10 so you will have to do a bit of searching to get it running, but for me it took less then 5 minutes to get it started.","November 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

The gameplay is much like The Elder Scrolls with guns. It's like playing Oblivion but in a post-apocalyptic era. Taking the role of a father's son you embark on a journey escaping from your home, Vault 101. You never knew what is going on in the outside world until you see that the world is already ruined. There are tons of side missions to do, but never had the time to finish it all. The best thing is, it's an open world RPG game. The story is immersive and driven well within the game and has choices, choices, choices. Choices which leads to your own responsibilities. This is truly a great game even when it's quite old now. I hope that there will be a remake for Fallout soon.\nStory: 9/10 - Good story, yet needs more depth. Otherwise, it has a very good story in it.\nDifficulty: 8/10 - Great, quite challenging in my opinion for a post-apocalyptic survival game. Yet it can be cheated by console commands. Money is also crucial and buying things are expensive so it truly sets the environment well.\nQuests: 8/10 - The quests are great, lots of them. But some of them might be boring or yet too easy.\nGameplay: 9/10 - Hours of gameplay in an open world game made this game interesting. (Not counting the DLCs yet)\nGame Flow: 8.5/10 - Good, except there are a few bugs lying around here and there such as quests that didn't trigger, glitches that make you suddenly fall into a bottomless world, etc.\n\nOverall 8.5/10 - What more can you expect?","March 8, 2014","true","17.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/22300/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nFallout 3 is large open world FPS-RPG which takes the narrative of "what would happen if there had been a nuclear exchange in the 1940's and the citizens of the United States was trying to struggle with the after math of a nuclear exchange". Developed by everyone's favorite open world developers Bethesda Game Studios and released in 2008.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Welcome to Vaunt 101, while there aren't any Vault Hunters searching for it (Ha, Borderlands cross over review joke) there are quite a number of treasures to be found within this vault. The Vault was designed to house and take care of it's inhabitants in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust.\nYou spend a good chunk of time learning about vaunt 101, meeting the other citizens, and growing up. Literally, you start as a baby being born in vault 101, then as you grow up you learn more about core mechanics within the Fallout 3 game, ethics, V.A.T.S., S.P.E.C.I.A.L., combat, and more!\nThe games story really doesn't start until your father suddenly disappears and you go searching for him! I won't spoil anything else about the story, but it does go on for quite a while, as you would expect and hope for in a Bethesda game!\n\n*Hardware: "Notice: Fallout 3 is not optimized for Windows 7 and later" EHHHHHHHhhhhhhhh..... My brother and I had to tinker with the files and do some trouble shooting to get it to work on my windows 7 computer in 2015. Then I directly transferred the game data to my new Windows 10 Computer Rig.\nI can say we got it to work, however I cannot say for certain if any changes were made that would allow you to simply download from steam and get the game working. I can say that right now with the changes we made it works on windows 7 and 10.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=645059383\n\nGameplay: Wheeeew, where to start? Lets start with the simple first: Fallout 3 controls like a FPS, I trust 99% of the people reading this review understand what direction to point the gun and click to KA-BOOM. (If you don't, I'll just file that under "troll")\nNext to explain V.A.T.S., the game probably will do a better job of explaining it, but V.A.T.S. stand for "Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System", and will allow you to pause the game, and take aim for you at a specific part of an enemy. But hitting your target is based on percentages, so if you shoot at point blank and have a 99% chance of hitting your target, there's always that 1% chance you'll miss.\nSince my luck is terrible, I tend to try to avoid using VATS, but over stream someone pointed out I could use them for explosive weapons and grenades, since I particularly STINK at hitting my target when I'm throwing a grande.\nNext we move on to S.P.E.C.I.A.L.! S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is an acronym for the primary attributes in Fallout3. They stand for: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. (This is pretty standard for RPG's, so I'm going to move on, but if you need a better explanation, feel free to leave a comment!)\nAll the other qualities of the game can be broken down into the "par for the course" as far as RPG's and Open World games are concerned. Expect a lot of exploration, expect gear with different perks, expect optimization strategies online; explaining where to go and how to play.\nSomething I didn't expect was: Fallout 3 is hard! I fancy myself an average skilled gamer (I play medium difficulty with ease normally), I'm constantly eating Stimpack for breakfast while I play (Stimpack = healing item). I've sunk a crazy amount of caps (that's the currency by the way) into hoarding Stimpacks, I'm like a doctor or someone doing illegal drug related stuff.\n\nAchievements: At this time there aren't any steam achievements for Fallout3, this may change someday, depending on if Bethesda decides to add achievements. (They have achievements for Skyrim, and Fallout4, but those were available at launch.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=634244631\n\nPrice: Fallout3 is priced at $9.99, the Game of the Year Edition is priced at $19.99. You'll get more mileage (almost literally, ha!) out of your game by purchasing the the Game of the Year Edition. Over twitch someone suggested I play through the DLC to get power armor, and it would make the rest of the play through easier.\n\nConclusion: Fallout 3 is to some, what Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is to me; a wonderful game that opened them up to the amazing size and scope a game can actually be. While I will always personally prefer Oblivion, I have enjoyed playing through this game, and can easily recommend it to anyone who's even remotely interested. Fallout 3 is totally worth your time.\nI recommend this game to anyone whom enjoys a challenge, likes Open World games, mods, enjoys RPG's, isn't intimidated by large open spaces, and has A LOT of free time to explore.\nThanks for reading my review!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=634244615\n\n*The Hardware part of this review was added specifically for Fallout 3 and isn't a regular Atratzu Review critique of games.","March 24","true","17.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

But I will hazard these statements—Eliot contains the same ecstatic vision which runs from Münzer to Yeats. However, he retains a grounding in the social reality/order of his time. Facing what he perceives as a choice between ecstatic chaos and lifeless mechanistic order, he accedes to maintaining a separation of asexual purity and brutal sexual reality. And he wears a stoical face before this. Read his essay on Tradition and the Individual Talent, as well as Four Quartets, when he’s less concerned with depicting moribund Europe, to catch a sense of what I speak. Remember how I said there’s a certain kind of conservatism which I respect more than bourgeois liberalism—Eliot is of this type. Of course, the dichotomy he maintains is reactionary, but it’s due to a deep fatalism, not ignorance. -- Barack Obama","May 3, 2012","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheatcodesmayn/recommended/22300/","cheatcodesmayn","rob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheatcodesmayn/","256 products in account","The fact that so many people still name Fallout 3 as “the greatest or most significant or best” Fallout game ever only tells you how far Fallout still is from becoming a serious series. FPS critics have long recognized that the most influential FPS games of all times are Doom and Wolfensteinwho were not the most famous or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Adventure critics rank the highly controversial Legend of Zelda over games such as Monkeys Island who were highly popular in online communities. Fallout critics are still blinded by commercial success. Fallout 3 sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore it must have been the greatest. RPG critics grew up playing a lot of RPG games of the past, adventure critics grew up playing a lot of adventure games of the past. Fallout critics are often totally ignorant of the Fallout games of the past, they barely know the originals. No wonder they will think that Bethesda did anything worthy of being saved. In a sense, Fallout 3 is emblematic of the status of RPG criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it Bethesda or whomever else) and too little to the merits of real games. If somebody creates the most divine game but no major publisher picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of RPG critics will ignore him. If a major publisher picks up a company who is as stereotyped as can be but launches them worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of RPG criticism: RPG critics are basically publicists working for major publishers, distributors and game stores. They simply highlight what product the gaming business wants to make money from. Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great RPG like Baldur's Gate, which never sold much, unlike commercial products like Fallout 3. At such a time, RPG critics will study their gaming history and understand which games accomplished which innovation to the genre, and which simply exploited it commercially. Fallout 3's "Brotherhood of Steel" removed any trace of the western Brotherhood from Fallout. It replaced xenophobic military complex with white knight hereos. Well known developers never spoke highly of Bethesda, and for good reason. They could never figure out why Bethesda's games should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that Bethesda was simply lucky to become a RPG phenomenon (thanks to "Open world-mania", which had nothing to do with their games). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) gaming endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Bethesda more attention than, say, the Ubisoft or EA. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Bethesda's games. Brian Fargo of Interplay was certainly a far writer than Todd Howard. Obsidian were certainly much more skilled developers than the 'Greatest Game Developer of Our Generation'. And Rebecca Heineman was a far more accomplished programmer, capable of entire games such as "Fallout 1" and "Fallout 2"; not to mention the far greater Slavic programmers who followed them in subsequent decades or the US companies themselves who initially spearheaded what Bethesda merely later repackaged to the masses. Bethesda sold a lot of games not because they are the greatest developers but simply because their games are easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of fun, short stories and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented "Open world-mania" in 2001, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading these pages about such a trivial game developer.","August 3, 2014","true","47.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TMParasyte/recommended/22300/","TMParasyte","[TM] Morning Star","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TMParasyte/","128 products in account","I could make a joke about this game then say "10/10" at the end, but I believe this game deserves more than that.\n\nThis game is absolutely incredible, anyone who says its anything less of a masterpiece is mentally handicapped.\n\nFirst of all, the area to explore is massive, I have over 200+ hours on it (I played a lot of it while on offline mode, so the hours on my account don't show the full amount) and I still havn't gotten around to looking over all of the areas.\n\nSecond of all, the quests are amazing. Starting off with the main story, it is incredibly fun. From starting as a kid in the vault to fighting off the Enclave forces alongside a gigantic robot named Liberty Prime, it is a non-stop good time.\n\nAs for the DLC's, most are equally incredible. Broken Steel, The Pitt, and Point Lookout are all amazing to say the least. While Broken Steel adds onto the main story and raises the level cap, The Pitt and Point Lookout give you entirely new quests and areas to explore, both of which are awesome. To a lesser extent, Operation Anchorage and Mothership Zeta are both somewhat decent addons, but failed to meet my expectations. Operation Anchorage was very short, I finished it in about 2 hours without rushing it, and Mothership Zeta was incredibly repetative and dont even get me started on what it attempted to do to the Lore.\n\nAlongside the Main Quests and DLC's, many of the side quests are also fantastic. One that really caught me off guard was a short little quest called "Oasis" in which after exploring the dull wasteland, you find yourself in a lush green paradise, where you meet a mutated man-turned-tree named Harold. The story is quite interesting, and depending on which ending you chose, can leave you quite upset.\n\nNow lets talk about the graphics. Yes this game is a bit outdated, but I for one think it looks fairly decent, and still hold up to some games today. As for the textures, they are quite flat, but I dont think you will really be paying attention to that while your gunning your way through hordes of Super Mutants and Ghouls.\n\nThe enemies in this game are also amazing. There are plenty of enemies scattered across the Capitol Wasteland, from little pests like Radroaches and Bloatflies to the incredibly strong Deathclaws and Super Mutant Behemoths, there is little time to sit around a campfire and sing ballads about your fallen comrads before a gang of Raiders come to ruin your good time.\n\nThese Raiders wont be much trouble however if your properly equiped. This game comes with a bunch of weapons which are all fun to use, such as the Combat Shotgun, the Hunting Rifle, and everyones favourite, the Fat Man. Most of these weapons also come with one or more "Unique" variations, which usually grant higher damage or special abilities, all of which are very useful when things start to get a little rough.\n\nLastly, entertainment. I am not stretching this at all, and I dont think what Im about to say will change anytime soon. This game is the best game I have ever played. It is absolutely insane how good this game is. If I could play only 1 game for the rest of my life, it would be this. The story is great, the graphics are good, the area to explore is huge, the enemies are awesome, the replayability is off the charts, and if you ever start to get bored, a quick look over at the Nexus will keep you playing for hours on end. Now that ive said all this, I can honestly say...\n\n420/69","July 15, 2015","true","164.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fallout 3 is a phenomenal game and I highly recommend playing it for atleast a half hour. it's a pain to get it working on windows 7 and higher, but its worth it. If you know a lot about computers it should take around 10-15 minutes to get working but if you're a computer noob like me it should take around 30-45 minutes to get the game working with no crashes/graphical bugs.\nNow, lets talk about the game as a whole.\nGraphics yet outdated add something to it, the atmosphere of the weast land just goes with it.\nThe AI isn't the best but it doesn't hinder the experience much.\nBugs/glitches are common in the game but there more funny then anything, such as corpses spazzing out when you kill them. Some screen tearing here in there but nothing to bad, I don't think you would notice it.\nThere is a glitch with the radio that some might have that causes the radions audio to become choppy or studder but this can be fix.\nRemember, this isn't like a cod game or some crap, this is a shooter that requires skill and smart thinking to get past even the most simple super mutant. This game will test you in the most epic of ways. Buy this game and be sucked into the greatest most deep game ever made.\n\n\n\n\nFALLOUT 4 HYPE!!!!","August 28, 2015","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(And my Pros/Cons)\n\nPROS:\nHundreds of hours of epic gameplay in the Capital Wasteland!\nWith DLC's about 50+ hours at least (plus new perks, weapons, enemies, quests, and other stuff)\nVaried terrain, enemies, weapons, quests, armor, perks, and other items\nCrafting/repair system\nGame that is open-world\nGraphics are phenomenal for its time\nKarma System\n\nCONS:\nAfter completing largely everything in the game its hard to play again (can get sick of playing too much)\nGraphics need reworking (in my opinion)\nSome weapons largely have no effect on enemies\nPistols in game need to be completely re-worked (e.g. sights, recoil, damage, animations sometimes)\nSome quests are variations of each other\nIf you dont like large games you wont like this\nGame might erase your save\nThere are certain enemy and graphics glitches that are known to happen\n\nOVERALL: This game is revolutionary! I highly recommend this title to every gamer! Even though my CONS outweigh my PROS I still believe this game is still very good but with limited replay. 9/10\n\n(Anyone who wants to friend me do so but I might reject your request)","November 13, 2014","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, a friend of mine screen shared over Skype, and what followed was a lot of fun and even more lag (the fault of Skype as screen sharing does that sometimes.).\n\nShe tried really hard not to loot anyone because she had a nude mod installed, but eventually gave up because this was five years ago and she figured I would have seen nudity at fifteen. Anyway, she eventually spelled out "Hello" in limbs she collected from her victims, and any game that allows for that is pretty much a gem in my eyes.","July 25, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

While it is alittle lack luster with it's Aiming system, Most people will just use V.A.T.S. anyway so it's not a big loss. Even if you only want to try it, I would suggest buying the Game of the Year edition, Because while this game isn't for everyone most people will find themselves wanting more of the game. The in-game soundtrack is amazing and while limited the Radio station for Galaxy News Radio is great. Exploring the Capital Wasteland will keep you entertained for a good bit, enless you don't like exploration. Bottom line, You will sink some time into this one. The only reason my hours are low now is, That I played 3 on Xbox and recently obtained New Vegas which I had never played at all, Highly recommend getting both of these amazing games.","July 7, 2014","true","47.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although my game crashes often due to it not being optimized for Windows 7. Despite this, (and quicksaving until the F5 button fades away) the game is fantastic. The wasteland feels much more open than the Mojave Wasteland and it feels like much more time was put into it.

IF you liked Skyrim, this is a game you'll want, Fallout in general is a similar version of the elder scrolls, hust a deifferent story and environment.\n\nthe shooter part of the game isn't fantastic, but the story takes all the games issues and covers them with a layer of paint , and makes the paint job look very nice.\n\nthis game passes with a rating of 7.9, very good.","September 15, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it is alittle lack luster with it's Aiming system, Most people will just use V.A.T.S. anyway so it's not a big loss. Even if you only want to try it, I would suggest buying the Game of the Year edition, Because while this game isn't for everyone most people will find themselves wanting more of the game. The in-game soundtrack is amazing and while limited the Radio station for Galaxy News Radio is great. Exploring the Capital Wasteland will keep you entertained for a good bit, enless you don't like exploration. Bottom line, You will sink some time into this one. The only reason my hours are low now is, That I played 3 on Xbox and recently obtained New Vegas which I had never played at all, Highly recommend getting both of these amazing games.","July 7, 2014","true","47.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That and finishing the end of a game is an impulse just so that I can have it completed. At least it should have let me kill one of my friends and then just play the game further as my completely alive wasteland legend. The cap of how much weight I can have on me at one time was also so annoying that the first thing I did when I got perks was get more strength so I could hold more. A lot of people say the game doesn't fit in with the others, and that New Vegas is a much better sequel to the other Fallout games, but I never really got into the first games. Mostly because I never bothered to buy them because I heard they were top-down games and I was more into the first person kind. Regardless, good game.

You will do things that you regret, you will help the people who need it the most and you will survive, one way or another.\n\nChoices matter here, you can murder people decimate communities or you can help fix the broken and worn out towns and ease the pain these poor souls must suffer from every day life. Someone upset you? bash their skull in with a hammer. Did someone take your teddy bear? blow their brains out. How about that ugly green mutant shooting hot lead at your face? MELT IT. You choose your skills, your weapon and your tactics. Be it melee weapons, guns, explosives, energy weapons or big ♥♥♥ versions of these, like say a minigun or laser equivalent. What about a gun that shoots nukes? The variety of traits and skills gives a different style each time you play. You can choose between light, medium and heavy armours that come with pros and cons along with stat changes.\n\nFast travel is a option if you want to move quickly from discovered locations. This gives incentive to explore more areas and gives you the ability to travel more freely between the large landscape. If you're truly hardcore, don't use it and just walk everywhere you go. (Not recommended for new players)\n\nThe trademark S.P.E.C.I.A.L (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck) gives you the choice of adding points to each. Be a well rounded person, or dumb as a brick with super strength. Super smart and really slow and weak also work, but your big brain makes for a nice target, better add some points into luck to avoid getting headshot too often, or just sweet talk your way out of everything with a high charisma. If everything else fails, just take the bullets like they are your daily minerals.\n\nI mean, if you don't like people you could always detonate an old war nuke..\n\nExplore 200 year old vaults who have a secret and nasty history, with amazing and atmospheric story that makes you really think about the world you are in.\n\nLike fast gameplay? Just do the main quest and forget about those perky side quests, or if you like a long and adventurous playthrough, explore the world and make a change to this hollow wasteland, for better or worse,\nbecause war..\n\nWar never changes.\n\n(I bet you didn't see that coming)\n\nPersonal Rating: 4.5/5","March 3","true","66.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Beyond that matter though beholds an atmospheric, action packed journey. The mods enhance the game significently, but I  HIGHLY recommend playing the vanilla version throughly before putting your hands on mods; to fully experience the utmost example of an RPG. The action is fantastic, using an expansive arsenal of weapons and using VATS creates an interesting optional way to mow down your opponents. The expansive content the DLC's provide makes this game even more exquisite than it was, living it up to it's upmost potential (thankfully fixing the terrible ending). Character designing is iffy at best, does not provide a lot of breathing room (or creativity on that matter). Now the dialogue is fantastic and has humorous options that gives a charming trait to the game.  Therefore leading to the obvious conclusion which is BUY THE GAME.

Not to mention, there are so many side quests that the game itself doesnt get boring. You can choose which quests you want to accomplish. However, some have to be finished for the game to continue. The fighting system is glorious, fire with precision using VATS, or become a master with guns using the iron/sights. With many different ways to play this game, it will never get boring. My only complaint being that there is not a workshop for Fallout 3.

Fallout 3 is the game i must say got me into gaming in general, and its sequel "Fallout New Vegas" is what got me onto Steam in the first place, Fallout 3 technically gave me more vocabulary to use (Not the profanity) but the more advanced words, in which i knew what alot meant due to FO3 and i was using them while in 5th and 6th grade, its truly wonderful. Now i know it isnt exactly a  Rated for everyone game, but this game got my friends, not only on PSN but in school and so much more, i could have so many conversations just about this and its succeeding game, and so on. Anyways, what i loved about Fallout so much, is that it wasnt just a wasteland game, it was everything from A Nuclear Post-Apocalypse Wasteland to a Zombie Apocalypse to even a monster one. I truly do love this game, as there really is alot too do, and its plot is marvelous, and the fact that it doesnt technically make you do a quest, but gives 100+ more that you must find.\nAnother big thing i love about it, is that it isnt modern, or technically future either, but that its staged in the 40s- 60s, and that theres always a story that backs ups your player, and then customization also. The factions are awesome too, my favorite faction actually, as one of their soldiers faces' is my profile picture, is the Enclave (Enclave Armed Forces) and that i actually would love it if one of the later Fallouts gave you the ability to really join it, and rise through the ranks, like how it was in FO3 with the Brotherhood Of Steel, and in FNV with The N.C.R and Caeser's Legion, but one can only wish and dream for right? Anyways, I totally recommend this to ALL gamers, even those who hate it because it "Sucks" in which they only say that, Because they die so quick after leaving Vault 101 and Megaton.  One miore thing, Ive replayed/played this game so much that i know how to beat it's main quest within an hour or two, and the same with all add-ons, thus is why i have Fallout3:Game Of The Year Edition on Ps3, and Regular Fallout 3 in my steam library. Love this game, it'll love you... I cannot wait for Fallout 4.","May 24, 2014","true","23.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It took the RTS elements of the first two Fallout games, and blended them seamlessly into an fps.  Bethesda nailed it, and I'm very excited for Fallout 4.  My only complaints are that the game was VERY unstable, randomly crashing the first few times that I played it.  However, after running in compibility mode, and tweaking some config files, I got it running.  Also, the ending was somewhat anticlimatic,  but my character died a hero.  This game is on my top 10 list, and I reccomend it to any RPG/FPS fan.","June 21, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Through more forementioned wizardry (See Bonus Plotline  above) I found yet another story about growing up in a vault under the ground and eventually attempting to leave said vault. Once you leave the vault the game asks if you want to switch genders and then ends. I felt that the game was a little overpriced for its legnth and overall quality, but I do think that the game needs to be appreciated for the message it's trying to convey, by showing the player that life is nothing but a series of goals, and it never truly ends with one big event, but with collections of smaller events that make up our lives, and I think the game needs to be appreciated for that.\n\n4/10 buy the XBox version or learn how to mod the Havok engine.","July 24, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","2","3","7","1"

Though it makes some serious changes to the gameplay formula, it still maintains the spirit of the original two classics. I've played this game for hundreds of hours on the PS3 (have the Platinum trophy for it), and this still managed to engross me, mostly due to the large amount of mods available for this game. Just about any complaint I have for this game can be fixed thanks to the highly dedicated modding community, which remains alive to this day, years after release.

Through more forementioned wizardry (See Bonus Plotline  above) I found yet another story about growing up in a vault under the ground and eventually attempting to leave said vault. Once you leave the vault the game asks if you want to switch genders and then ends. I felt that the game was a little overpriced for its legnth and overall quality, but I do think that the game needs to be appreciated for the message it's trying to convey, by showing the player that life is nothing but a series of goals, and it never truly ends with one big event, but with collections of smaller events that make up our lives, and I think the game needs to be appreciated for that.\n\n4/10 buy the XBox version or learn how to mod the Havok engine.","July 24, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","2","3","7","1"

Fallout 3 is the game i must say got me into gaming in general, and its sequel "Fallout New Vegas" is what got me onto Steam in the first place, Fallout 3 technically gave me more vocabulary to use (Not the profanity) but the more advanced words, in which i knew what alot meant due to FO3 and i was using them while in 5th and 6th grade, its truly wonderful. Now i know it isnt exactly a  Rated for everyone game, but this game got my friends, not only on PSN but in school and so much more, i could have so many conversations just about this and its succeeding game, and so on. Anyways, what i loved about Fallout so much, is that it wasnt just a wasteland game, it was everything from A Nuclear Post-Apocalypse Wasteland to a Zombie Apocalypse to even a monster one. I truly do love this game, as there really is alot too do, and its plot is marvelous, and the fact that it doesnt technically make you do a quest, but gives 100+ more that you must find.\nAnother big thing i love about it, is that it isnt modern, or technically future either, but that its staged in the 40s- 60s, and that theres always a story that backs ups your player, and then customization also. The factions are awesome too, my favorite faction actually, as one of their soldiers faces' is my profile picture, is the Enclave (Enclave Armed Forces) and that i actually would love it if one of the later Fallouts gave you the ability to really join it, and rise through the ranks, like how it was in FO3 with the Brotherhood Of Steel, and in FNV with The N.C.R and Caeser's Legion, but one can only wish and dream for right? Anyways, I totally recommend this to ALL gamers, even those who hate it because it "Sucks" in which they only say that, Because they die so quick after leaving Vault 101 and Megaton.  One miore thing, Ive replayed/played this game so much that i know how to beat it's main quest within an hour or two, and the same with all add-ons, thus is why i have Fallout3:Game Of The Year Edition on Ps3, and Regular Fallout 3 in my steam library. Love this game, it'll love you... I cannot wait for Fallout 4.","May 24, 2014","true","23.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The world is vast and so nostalgic to the 50's. Ever wanted to drink soda then die of radiation poisoning, well go ahead. Trust me you can do a ton of stuff in this game. The only problem is that there are barely any enemies to grind on and when you do find them you get verry little EXP. My final rating for this game is 9/10. It really sucks that it keeps crashing though.","April 24, 2014","true","8.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

As a result, a water purifier that has no reason to exist released radiation it shouldn't have, thus killing Col Autumn, who had no reason to be there. Later we got through a villiage of children who fdso gah frrzlmpr blaa huygnnl asdf so we could enter vault 87 and recover a GECK, a device which would be better put to use in virtually any possible manner besides the one for which we had aquired it. Then Col Autumn, who shouldn't be alive, but is, captured us with a flash grenade that shouldn't have worked in a place he shouldn't have been able to reach, so he could stop us from fixing the machine he wanted fixed. He then tortured us for a code that didn't matter which we had no reason not to give him. Then, the president, which is a computer for absolutely no reason, set us free to enact his plan which was of benefit to absolutely no one, and then kills himself for no reason whatsoever.\n\nAt the final battle, everyone in the world has the same goal: Turn on the water purifier. Due to this overwhelming consensus, we were obliged to fight a massive war. Finally, Col Autumn gave his life to stop us from turning on the machine he was trying to turn on. At the end, the Enclave defeated themselves by sabotaging the machine they where trying to activate, causing it to explode even though it shouldn't, and obliging us to enter the purifier and die of radiation that wasn't actually lethal. At least until the DLC retconned our death, making everything Fawkes ever said to you a lie. A ghoul companion refused to enter the chamber, even though ghouls are healed by radiation.\n\nIt's a fun game otherwise.","December 25, 2013","true","38.2"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","6"

The game has a decent story, characters, and controls. The end of the main story line kinda sucks but once you get the dlcs you can play after main storyline is completed. Really worth it also. The gameplay length then becomes ridiculously immense. The replay value is very high. I've clocked in close to 300 hours on this game and in my second run through, I am still finding quests and areas that I hadn't the first time. If you like role-playing game elements, 1st person shooters, wide-open worlds for exploration, and a game with tons of side-quests, this game is for you.","May 29, 2014","true","37.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Its locked at 60fps, but im sure there's a work around.\n\nModding is the best thing ever and is actually why I bought the pc version. Modding also extends the life of this game so much, as the story can be finished rather fast.\nI know its unrelated, but i recommend some snow mods, and fellout, to give the skys a more grey look instead of a green tint.\n\nThere is so much to explore and do, i recommend taking your first playthrough slow, and do whatever feels right, not what you think will get you through the mission. Its an RPG, get Immersed!\n\nI would recommend this to anyone. I mean, its cheap, and its better than a lot of the new AAA titles out there.\n\n","September 28, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was originally a top-down exploration type thing. Not even joking. Bethesda then bought the series and developed this... thing. Most gamers will say they love the Fallout series, and thus the reason Fallout 4 is doing so well in sales (plus it's a really good game). Fallout 3 is Skyrim, with guns. Just really weird gunplay mechanics sadly. The story was actually quite good, despite the fact that I don't really like this game. I can't seem to get over it all.\n\n\n\ntl;dr Fallout 3 isn't for me, but might be for you.

Absolute must for any Fallout or RPG fan as this is proper quality for the most part.\nSadly Fallout 3 is not as good a New Vegas due to it being more linear that New vegas as well the enviroment being a bit boring  in my opinion, however its is well good and should give it ago when on sale even if optimisation is dreadful.\nAbsolutely fantastic mooding community with endless replay ablity I actually regret not Buying GOTY edition!","February 8, 2014","true","62.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you like wandering around fighting off bandits or weapon wielding mutants. Steal everything in sight or at least try to. This is most likely the game for you. Practically everything you do dictates how the game goes. I'm currently working on beating it again, because first fap wasn't sustainable to justify how much i enjoy it.
