A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.\n\nFlash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.\n\nOn Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.\n\nWe contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.\n\nI not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for).\n\nThanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.","November 21, 2014","true","351.8"," 4,156 of 4,359 people (95%) found this review helpful 181 people found this review funny","95","156","4","181","166"

They make live streams and discussing their next moves, make events with "Platina" igname currency and working hard with community.\n5. So far, this is the best Free-to-Play "not Pay to Play" game.\nYou are not forced to buy anything, like ANYTHING. You can trade with players for "Platina", you can craft any in-game weapon without donating, you can purchase any skin without donating, the only purpose of buying platina is "RUSHING stuff" if ure lazy to wait crafting process 12-72h, or buy Slots (<<< Which yet u can once again trade with ppl for Platina and use it in Slots)\nSo the game is about FARMING and using your time. If you can't afford it and calling this game expensive then you are simply stupid.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Section9/recommended/230410/","Section9","Section-Nine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Section9/","254 products in account","There are very few games that have held my attention for 1,000+ hours over the years, this is one of them. I created an account back when the game was still in Alpha (late 2012), back then it was was just a simple module with some enemies to kill with a handful of warframes to choose from. Even then though it showed promise. Over time they have added tons of content, new warframes, weapons galore, new planets, mission types, Archwing (fly in space!), events, clan dojos and foundry, player to player trading system, syndicates to join, player HUBs (relay stations), PVP, 8 player Raid etc etc. If you enjoy third person shooters, 4 player coop, pvp, raiding, RPG's and/or ninjas in space (lol) this game is a dream come true then for you. Being that it is free to play there is literally nothing to lose checking it out.\n\nThe game is a constant work in progress and the developer Digital Extremes (DE) is constantly tweaking and adding new content all the time. Warframe has a very decent crafting system and you will most likely find yourself trying many different warframes/weapons combinations to see which one(s) fit your style the best. Believe me the game encourages you to do so, it is surprising the amount of variety in the game. When you find something you like it is a rewarding feeling and you will too it is just a matter of time. Also decent customization for your warframes, weapons, Sentinels (companion), Kubrows (dog companion), Liset (your ship), with a multitude of color choices, skins and attachments.\n\nEvery Warframe has its own set of individual abilities, they all have a total of 4. Some are better at being tanky, dps, sneaking (cloaking), solo play, healers, AOE damage, defense etc. There is a Warframe for every situation it seems. You can also make your own builds for each frame based on what mods you have (you attain them while playing missions they are dropped by enemies) For example "Continuity" mod allows for longer power duration time, when you ability is activated. More ammo, damage mods etc etc sooooo many. Making building your perfect Warframe/weapons very flexible and enjoyable. You have the opportunity to have a Primary, secondary and melee weapon. With the opportunity to make your own builds for everything here adds to the games replayability imo. Same goes for sentinels and kubrow companions they all have their own set of mods, especially made for them.\n\nThat being said the game can be very grindy, especially for newer players. That is to be expected though being that it is an MMOish experience. Especially to gather enough resources and credits to craft your items. Well worth it though if you have the time to invest. Sometimes they seem to nerf warframes and weapons for no reason at all and then they rework it again and "fix" it. Nerf/Un-nerf is the nature of free to play MMO' ish kind of games. (Constant "balance" tweaking) This is not an instant gratification game either, the game gets better the more you play it. You can also purchase items with real money from the in game market, it is NOT necessary though. Most things can be attained just playing the game gathering resources and crafting them accordingly. Except, of course vanity items, skins, unique color palettes and limited time only items that have been available over the course of the game.\n\nDE sometimes gifts players new color palettes and send them to your inbox (valentine's day, halloween, St. Patrick's day etc.) Free weapons too, they seem to do somethings special on the games anniversary every year. The developer also listens to community feedback and designs and have added many things based on that. Which is always a plus. The game can also get repetitive at times, but with the amount of content in game now that is harder to happen. You just have to mix it up from time to time and try new things within the game.\n\nAll in all the future looks bright for this game. A Developer that actually listens to community feedback. Constant updates/hotfixes. Plus there is so much new content coming soon! Game is not perfect of course, but what game truly is right. There is a lot to enjoy here and unique setting and premise to the game, definitely sets itself apart from the competition.\n\nMMO's are hard to review, but at its current state I give this game a 4 stars ( ★ ★ ★ ★ ) out of 5","July 10, 2015","true","374.1"," 1,385 of 1,492 people (93%) found this review helpful 120 people found this review funny","93","385","1","120","40"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CornyKelleher/recommended/230410/","CornyKelleher","The Great Stromboli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CornyKelleher/","421 products in account","Update (24/4/14): It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had.\n\nThe premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind.\n\nMultiple new game modes exist, including "Invasion", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission.\n\nThe latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat.\n\nThe most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy.\n\nIn conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new "EVE Online"-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard.\n\n<hr>\n\nOriginal Review (25/11/13)\nA great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole.\n\nWarframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance.\n\nGameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition.\n\nWeapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character.\n\nSo far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a "community effort" in which everyone can participate.\n\nThe only "issue" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games "premium" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill.\n\nThe game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its "free to play" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds.\n\nUltimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.","November 25, 2013","true","120.1"," 2,143 of 2,419 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","143","2","0","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatorplayspacman/recommended/230410/","Predatorplayspacman","Brovahkiin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatorplayspacman/","134 products in account","Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe.\n\nWarframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture.\nWarframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free.\nWarframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please.\nThe Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol,  a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in.\nAnd then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee.\nWe've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine.\nMelee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3.\n\nSo yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative.\n\nThat said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.","March 4, 2014","true","035.5"," 1,011 of 1,154 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","011","1","0","48"

Ninjas.\n\nI shouldn't have to say anything more.\n\nFair warning: If you're not willing to spend a LONG time playing this game, you'll find your options kind of limited. You start with 2 character slots, 6 weapon slots and 50 plat, 20 plat can get you a character slot and 12 plat can get you 2 weapon slots. You'll pretty much want to spend this 50 plat on slots, as everything else is a waste. Getting more plat costs money and I highly recommend that if you want to spend some money on plat, log into the game every day and wait for the 75% discount to show up. With the discount, a one time purchase of about 1000 plat should set you up for life if all you buy is slots and you don't care about having all the weapons. If you want to collect ALL the weapons, you'll probably want to spend $50 and go for the 3000 plat option.\n\nThe mod grind (collecting thingies to improve your stats and the stats of your weapons) can take a stinking long time to work through, but if you can have fun doing it (after all, it just means playing the game a lot), you'll be rewarded with weapons that feel like they do more than tickle the enemies you fire them at.\n\nGood mods and good weapons are required if you want to be more than a leech on the later planets, but everyone's usually blasting through the missions so fast that they hardly notice if you lag behind and die horribly to the handful of enemies they overlooked.\n\nI'd say the biggest problem this game has is a lack of reasons for veterans to return to old content. It can be really difficult to get a group for that one mission you need to unlock the other mission you need to unlock the mission that unlocks the next planet you want to get to to work your way towards that boss that drops the parts you need to make the warframe (class) you wanted a week ago and still haven't reached.\n\nPlaying with friends is recommended.","November 12, 2014","true","467.7"," 268 of 297 people (90%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","90","268","297","31","2"

Did I say Space Ninjas?  It's really really fun living out your childhood dreams of dropkicking baddies in the face while throwing stars at a secondary target.  If you ever wanted to be Bruce Lee; this is your game.\n\nIt has boss fights with actual strategies, plenty of unlocks to find, lots of socializing for those that want to chit chat as much as kick things in the derriere.  The new weapon damage system gives hardcore mathematicians something to theory craft about, but is as easy as Paper, Rock, Scissors in it's simplest form.  Weapon choice is varied in feel thus you many choices to find the perfect weapons that suit your playstyle.\n\nAlternative playstyles such as Stealth plays a prominent role in Warframe.  You can absolutely wreck targets from the shadows!  You can choose between Support frames, Offensive frames, and Defensive frames for a mission.  Invite your buddies or grab some guys / gals from the recruiting social channel.  If you want to meet new people, join a completely randomized group of 4 players hell bent on conquering space!\n\nYou have multiple saved loadout slots for free!  Digital Extremes doesn't really nickle and dime you in this game like other F2P games.  They do need to make a profit so they sell cosmetic items, XP boosters, warframe slots, weapon slots, and materials for those too busy to go fight.  Nearly everything in the game can be acquired by doing fun events that last nearly a week so you can choose when to partake of them.  They give away the best guns for free during those events.\n\nThey have a XP system that also nets you some of the best guns in the game for just running missions to collect loot and crafting that loot into weapons and warframes.  Leveling up those frames and weapons gives you the XP necessary to unlock the sickest weapons!  This is a Play to Win game where you can buy materials to craft if you are impatient, but you can just play more and get it.  Isn't playing the game the purpose of it?  Of course you can buy completed Warframes for real money, but spending a couple hours of your time you can get the same thing for free.  Of course you still need to buy the inventory slot for that frame to use it.  At less than $1 a slot, no subscription fee, and no initial game purchase, this sounds like the steal of the century.  And you don't have to buy them and still have fun, but it's nice to be able to support the developer for their time and effort.\n\nIn short play this now!","November 26, 2013","true","819.6"," 1,040 of 1,279 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","040","1","0","25"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/recommended/230410/","skillless","Peashooter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/","238 products in account","There is only one thing you need to know about Warframe: It's free.\n\nOh, maybe I didn't make myself clear enough. When I say that Warframe is free, I mean, literally speaking, it is free. Still not clear enough? Alright, I'll elaborate. Apart from two different types of items - appearance items (such as skins and coloring pallets) and weapon/Warframe slots - it is possible for all players to access almost all types of in game items and entities (apart from a few that are no longer available to everyone). In this manner, it is possible for you to obtain every Warframes (characters or so to speak), every weapons, every non-visual-based items and the likes. Of course, there are conditions to fulfill, and obtaining everything will most likely take up a good portion of your time (isn't this what you are looking for?), but the point is, it is perfectly possible to play Warframe in the long run without paying a single cent. It's your choice.\n\nSo, what is Warframe? In this game, you are basically a character known as "Tenno" who fights battles within a futuristic solar system. You will be teaming up with 3 other Tennos (this is a 4 player co-op game) to complete missions laid out by Lotus, a female commander issuing you orders. Nah, she is nicer than your ex-girlfriend, so don't worry about that.\n\nYou will basically be facing three separate forces, Grineer, Corpus and the Infestation (think of the three races in Starcraft if you want to get a better idea). There are different types of missions, ranging from elimination, rescue, spy, to defense and rescue. As for weapons, basically you get to equip a primary weapon (rifle, shotgun, sniper and many others that are hard to categorize), a secondary weapon (categorization is hard for this as well) and a melee weapon (sword, mace, fist... you know the deal). As for your character, you will be using one out of the somewhat 10-ish (slightly less than 20, though the number is gradually increasing as more update comes by) Warframes. Each Warframe comes with different stats, such as self-repairing shields, like those in halo, health, energy (mana) and speed. Still, more importantly, each Warframe has its own unique set of 4 skills. These skills are great assets for the players as most of the times they will come in handy. One thing to note is that gender is preset, so those transsexuals don't have to fake their gender anymore, which is, well ... you decide if it's good or not. There are also mods (modifications) that you can insert into your weapons and Warframes to make them much stronger than they originally are.\n\nOh and there are parkour. Learn how to press "WASD" + "LShift" + "LCtrl" + "Space" in fluid coordination. It will be helpful and painful, but you will definitely need them.\n\nSimple?\n\nUnlike many co-op shooters, Warframe definitely has its merits. One of the most apparent distinction of the game is that it has a leveling system that can be found in most MMOs. You can level up both your weapons and Warframes to a maximum rank of 30. Moreover, you can rank up your mods as well to make them more powerful. In this way, Warframe won't be a simple "run-shoot-kill see-score go-sleep" type of game. Never. There are things more important than that.\n\nAnother merit of Warframe is that there are frequent updates. When I say frequent, I mean FREQUENT, as in one big update per month or so. There will be new game modes, Warframes, weapons, mods ... etc. I mean, come on, who thinks that L4D2 came too fast after L4D1 is released? I do. Who is still waiting for L4D3 after all these years? I am. Who thinks that Gabe Newell should fulfill the unsaid promise of completing the trilogies of Valve games? I do. Come on, we have been waiting for L4D3 and Portal 3 and HL3, and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of waiting. This won't happen for Warframe though. The game has a gradual and comfortable pace of updating. You get new contents every now and then, and they usually blends well with the game. Usually.\n\nStill, like most games, there are pros and cons of Warframe and I have to sincerely admit that there are shortcomings with this game when compared to other games. One major shortcoming (I won't say flaw) of this game is that it lacks a concrete story line. Apart from some trivial storytelling, there really aren't much of a tale going on. There are stories told, I'm not saying there aren't, but they are rather weak. I know, that is not their aim, and that is not really the point of Warframe, but compared to the rich (though monotonous) storyline of L4D and Portal, Warframe needs to good a better job here.\n\nAlso, the game can be rather repetitive. You know, this applies for most Coop shooters, so there really isn't much to say about this. Yeah, repetitive.\n\nSo, in general, try Warframe. It's free. If you don't like it, drop it. Simple as that. If you do like it and if you feel that you will be playing it in the long run (like how I felt after my first 100th hours), do consider buying a little platinum to expand your weapon and Warframe slots. I bought like 19.90 USD worth of platinums.

The huge variety of weapons, mods, and warframes allows for multiple play styles, so if one style doesn't work for you, try another! All in all, I've played over 750 hours, and plan to put in much more, because yes...

There's a nice balance between what you can get without paying a cent and buying stuff, which imo is what makes this game so good.\nI was always a sucker for third-person shooters, and this might as well be my favorite.\nThe gunplay is a bit bumpy starting off, but once you get through the first mastery rank test there are many weapons to choose from.\n\nSomething I really like about this game is that it lets you play how you wanna play. You can be be at the sidelines of the battle, assisting your team and picking off targets. You can mess with your opponent, lining them up for a perfect slash dash. You can soak up hits while your team flanks for the objective. Or you can ♥♥♥♥ all the ninja ♥♥♥♥ and come from the front, guns blazing. Also melee play is an actual, and reliable choice.\n\nThe controls are laughably easy to get into, after an hour I was completely used to it.\nAnd, now with the new update 14, there is an new and better intro to the game. It might take a while to discover what this does, how that works, what happens when I do this, .etc, but that can be cleared away with a quick look at the wiki.\n\nI would give it a 8/10, has yet to disappoint me.","July 18, 2014","true","55.6"," 279 of 322 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","279","322","0","5"

Jordan Golem, pretty cool actually\n\nKubrow, you can got and rise your own dog-like loyal companion, but they are just running everywhere and dying and then they losts their loyality which you can refill only by 30% per day (they losts it like 20% per their dead), and their health drops about 10% per day, you need to buy refills (DNA Stabilizers, 6 things per 75,000 credits) which refill only 40% per use. and to find a egg you need to spend about 2-200 runs (depends of random and your luck) to get one. so in point of view they are just credit-sink and any normal sentinel can replace every type of doge (and sentinels don't require credits to take care of them and don't lose loyalty after death)\n\nEdit: A new breed of doge that pick-ups items for you\n\nEdit2: New "Incubator Upgrade Segment" makes owning Kubrows much easier, Kubrow will lose only 5% per day and it automatically places Kubrow into stasis if he on verge of death\n\nThis game have great variety of Warframes and their awesome abilities, and most of them have many differences in abilities and different stats (and cool looks)\n\nEdit2: Every frame is unique and you can't really compare them, except if you want something specific\n\nThis game have a nice amount of Bosses (one boss per planet), but most of them are bulletspongy and boring, for example you need to wait until they become vulnerable or you need to shot into specific hit-point to kill them (example: Councilor Vay Hek, General Sargas Ruk, Lephantis, or Mutalist Alad V) and some of them closed behind keys to get frame which drops from them (Vay Hek(Hydroid) (No longer needs a key), Lephantis(Nekros), Mutalist Alad V(Mesa))\n\nEdit2: You obtain some frames from fun Quests\nOthers through Dojo Lab Research\nAnd there are some with specific ways to earn their parts (Ivara drops only through Spy mission-type and etc.)\n\nIn this game you can get every weapon\frame without paying platinum (in-game currency you need to buy with real-life money (but still you can get it through in-game trade with people)), but you need to craft them yourself (blueprint costs credits (in-game currency you get through doing missions) some blueprints requires research from Clan Dojo's laboratories, which requires credits and resources too, and blueprints requires resources and credits to craft them (Resources you can get through missions from killing enemies).\n\nCool variety of Mods for Warframes and Weapons, which drops from enemies and you can make you weapon\frame more powerfull with them, but some mods are rare and some mods drops from rare enemies, and some mods are very, very close to be useless (Intruder: +6 seconds for hacking Maxed, Rifle Aptitude: +15% status chance Maxed.)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut even so this game is very good, and i had a good fun with it, i'm recommending it, try to play it with friends and kill things together. (I don't have much friends though)\n\nDevelopers support this game with Weekly Updates and Hotfixes in which they fixing bugs, glitches and adding some new changes or items\n\nEdit2: Also Devstreams nearly every 2-3 Weeks with News about New Updates and answering questions from players\n\n9.5/10, this game still grows and becomes more interesting with time, i hope on this game's release developers will get rid of all disadvantages in it.\n\nThis is best F2P game on Steam (I don't count Valve's TF2 and Dota 2, cause they turned into the crap, imo) in my opinion","January 9, 2015","true","727.3"," 392 of 473 people (83%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","83","392","473","47","28"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/recommended/230410/","toquina","Overkill_Ashley♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/","302 products in account","Warframe's relaxed take on third person combat, impressive visuals, and vast combat customization lets it appeal to both hardcore gamers as well as weekend warriors. Latency issues and high system requirements can put off many but its free to play model is fair. All of the content is provided to players free of charge and that makes it difficult not to recommend it to everyone.\n\nYou assume the role of one of the Tenno; an ancient group of warriors that were placed in cryogenic stasis in order to survive a losing war.Your character then awakens to find the solar system in extreme turmoil. Caught in a war between three major factions and being the only ones able to disrupt the stalemate, they soon attract attention. Awoken and lead by a mysterious identity going by the alias “Lotus” the Tenno's intentions continue to remain unknown.\n\nWarframe's third person combat is simple but refined, providing a very relaxed and smooth shoot-'em-up feel, while a complex but easy to follow weapon modification system offers endless customization to the gameplay. Enemies will drop many modifications during missions, which allow players to change weaponry and their character to improve combat performance without limitation. This design allows players to modify all of the smallest aspects of their character and weaponry while maintaining the game’s RPG elements. Each of the weapons have their own specific function, attack patterns and style, which further compliment your playstyle. Dying can come across as cheap as some enemies will stun lock players to death or simply hit through their shields for an instant-kill. Included to increase difficulty; it often feels unjustified and overly punishing.\n\nMission maps are generated randomly based on pre-existing tile sets depending on the planet and type of mission chosen. Each mission has a specific objective, however many of these feel overly similar; often consisting of back tracking and repetitive fetch quests.  Missions are unlocked by completing the adjacent nodes connected to them; however this soon branches off into many directions, though many of these use the same tile-sets as the previous mission with only a few varying objectives between the two. Missions can often feel too similar to one another on a single planet, giving little reason to play ones that branch away from the main path.\n\nThe matchmaking system can be frustrating, offering little choice in terms of selecting a mission or joining a game already in progress. Offering no options besides public or private, you may often find yourself leaving a laggy game only to be thrown back in again numerous times. The matchmaking system definitely needs work and it’s constantly overlooked throughout updates.\n\nWarframe's free to play model uses micro-transactions to speed up the acquisition of weapons and characters with the use of in game currency called platinum. Free users are still able to access all content within the game but will struggle to gain access to everything without consistent farming for materials and parts needed to create new weapons. Platinum allows players to directly purchase weapons and characters without the need to craft and collect materials. With free players able to access all content while giving paying customers faster access to new content, Warframe shows how the free to play model doesn’t have to alienate non-paying users.\n\n\nWhile Warframe doesn't provide the adrenaline fueled action we're accustomed to in shooters, its Shoot-'em-up style combat remains satisfying for many hours and the endless customization options add much needed padding to help overcome the repetition. The heavy reliance on a random loot table for item drops throughout the game can lead to extreme frustration at times, especially when farming for a specific item. Bugs can be prominent at times, especially the ones that affect the user interface, however most major issues are fixed quickly with a hotfix provided by the development team.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Stunning visuals, especially for more powerful video cards\n+ Plenty of weapons and characters to level up\n+ Customization allows any type of design and play-style which adds replay value\n+ Frequent content updates\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Dying can feel unfair at times, leaving the player stun-locked until death\n- Matchmaking system needs work, often selecting poor hosts\n- High repetition within missions\n- High system requirements\n- Microtransactions are a little overpriced\n\n\nWhile rough around the edges at times, most bugs and technical issues are not persistent. As long as you can meet the system requirements and bandwidth isn't a limitation, there’s no reason not to give Warframe a try with its fair free to play model.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out the Analog Reviews steam group where we strive to provide honest and unbiased reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AnalogReviewsOfficial","January 11, 2014","true","455.4"," 456 of 582 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","456","582","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/recommended/230410/","astralchaos","Falem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/","1065 products in account","Intro\nWarframe is a fast-paced third person shooter. The developer, Digital Extremes, is the studio behind The Darkness 2 and Dark Sector. Digital Extremes gets involved with the community, by providing regular patches, video updates and participation in the forums. Digital Extremes borrows heavily from their previous game Dark Sector that was developed in 2008 and scrapped on 2012 in favor of making Warframe.\n\nSummary\n+Great Atmosphere/Environments\n+Great Weapon/Skills/Character Selection\n+Great Clan System (Dojo is impressive)\n+Great Developer Support(updates are good chunks and come often)\n+Great movement opportunities(Running across wall is fun)\n\n-Grind(Blueprints/Materials)\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is pretty solid, if you are looking something flashy like Devil May Cry, you are not going to get it here. That being said, the variation of weapons really make up for this. The warframes themselves are great in terms of variety and design. Each one has stats and abilities that set them apart, which results in a fresh experience every time you play with a new warframe.  Being able to run along walls or run up them makes mobility in the game more dynamic in terms of getting from point A to point B.\n\nRank System\nRank system emphasis on developing experience with Warframes, weapons and equipment rather than getting exp in general. Your rank is a signature of how much firepower you have accumulated in your arsenal.\n\nSince rank challenges vary it will test a wide array of your skills from marksmanship, mobility, and combat abilities. This system results in the player being more well rounded by fleshing out your skills in a multitude of areas.\n\nCustomization\nUpgrading, transmuting, and fusion are several methods to improve your options. The level of equipment acts as points for attaching mods. This allows for multiple combinations of mods to get different desired advantages, to fight certain factions or missions.\n\nThe forma is also a great way to make a weapon use less points in certain slots allowing you to develop it even further.\n\nAtmosphere\nThe setting is great and in my opinion helped attract alot of people to this game. The atmosphere and level designs are becoming more varied as the developers are updating the game with new environments. The new environments are really fun to play in and sometimes have their own perks.\n\nUpdates\nAs someone who made a long guide for this game I can say that their updates are so solid I feel my guide gets outdated every month and requires me to go back and make it relevant. This is most apparent in their UI changes they have made which made my videos a-bit weird to see for the newer players.\n\nClan\nThe dojo is one of the nicest additions I have seen yet. Not only does it offer a nice place for members to go to but in a sense its structure is an achievement of everyone who has helped contribute to it. The dojo offers a wide variety of nice side things like being able to do pvp, and being able to craft new weapons that are only available through research.\n\nPay to Win?\nIf you are worried about this game being pay to win rest assured that’s not how it is. The only real benefit to paying besides cosmetics is being able to get slots. You can put time in and get the same results you just can't have many Warframes/Weapons at once. They also designed it in a way that is hybrid in some areas. For example in foundry you will be able to pay money to speed up the process. So instead of buying the weapon, you can collect the resources, craft the item in foundry and then pay to speed up the process so you don't have to wait.\n\nGrinding?\nYes, there is grinding when you are looking for specific warframes and materials. Generally you will grind in the places where you reap the most benefits and try to get the pay-off aka the warframe as soon as possible. The grinding got a bit worse in a way when they introduced more materials which made the chances lower of getting blueprints. This is setoff a bit by the fact that they introduced alot more environment maps which increase its replayability. So if you do not mind grinding, buy slots to make more warframes if you like the game enough.\n\nConclusion\nOverall Warframe is a classic example of how free to play games can be great and interesting and still give developers plenty of profits without turning it into a Pay to Win game. If you are looking for an interesting game.... just give it a try, I am sure it won't disappoint.","November 26, 2013","true","699.0"," 528 of 690 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","528","690","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xVArchonVx/recommended/230410/","xVArchonVx","Archon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xVArchonVx/","127 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThe best F2P game I've ever come across. A fair bit buggy, but that's to be expected. The amount of content/updates that are constantly added to the game are insane. To give an example: If you were to compare what Warframe is now to what it was back in 2013, you'd be playing a completely different standalone game in a technical sense. There's so much to cover that I cannot fit it all into one review, but let's start with the fundamentals. The only other shooter I've played with mechanical depth that can hold a candle to what Warframe allows would be Resident Evil 6. This game's combat system is that deep. I'm not talking about things like Mods or attribute values, I'm talking about the sheer number of movement and attack options you have.\n\nIn default mode, the shooting mechanics are pretty straight-forward. But the moment you hit the key to switch to a dedicated melee mode, the game reveals its mechanical complexity. With melee now your primary means of attack, you're able to empower attacks, block/parry, do combos through the use of Stance mods. The game now resembles something closer to a simplified version of Devil May Cry than an traditional shooter. Delaying your melee attacks at key points in animations will allow you to do a comboed move rather than a generic slash. And with most Stance mods having at least 5 combo chains, (in addition to some weapons having multiple dedicated Stance mods) the skill ceiling is significantly increased.\n\nBeyond that are your movement options. You can do a sliding slash both on the ground and mid-air. You can run on and scale/hang from walls, dodge in any direction, and can even divekick enemies to knock them down or springboard off of friends and foes alike to complement your standard double jump.\n\nThe basic aspects of combat are further supported via the use of Mods. Mods are items that fit into weapons and Warframes alike to help improve and tailor the player's chosen combat style. Every item has 10 Mod slots and 1 Stance or Aura slot. Each Mod has a number value that deducts from a point pool on a chosen item. Mods can also be fused with other mods to improve their effects. Weapons are also able to be fitted with different combinations of elemental mods to produce a new effect. It it through this system that allows Warframe to appeal to virtually any type of player's preferred approach to combat.\n\nCustomization is a large part of Warframe, whether aesthetic or stat-wise. You're even able to choose your own ship (though such a choice is purely for show), customize the interior of it along with your frames, weapons etc. Better yet, most Warframes and even certain cosmetic items can be aquired simply through grinding.\n\nThis, however, brings us to some of the cons that Warframe can rely on a bit too much at times. The game is very grind-heavy and can eventually wear an individual down as you run the same missions over and over to acquire a certain blue-print, To its benefit, there are a variety of mission types and enviornmental tile sets to go along with them. Furthermore, the game is exceptionally optimized; and is able to keep literally dozens of enemies on screen with respective particle and weapons effects without dropping below 45-50 on a mid-range computer (I had an GTX 660 as reference).\n\nAnother problem the game has is its inclination towards being buggy. One of the worst I've heard of so far is the inital Archwing mission causing the game to outright lock up when the game is in Directx 11 mode. There are also numerous other bugs that will crop up as a player puts more and more time into the game.\n\nCertain cosmetic items (and even Warframes) are sometimes only purchasable with Platinum, which requires that players spend real money or trade/sell in-game items to other players for Platinum (if one does not wish to spend real money).\n\nStory-wise, the game explains very little to the player up front and uses Codexs to allow the player to piece the lore together ala. Dark Souls. With multiple factions each having their own agendas in addition to the Tenno themselves, there is a lot of world building content for players to go through.\n\nOverall though, it's an amazing and unique F2P game that will likely not be outdone by its competitors anytime soon. If ever.\n\n8.2 out of 10.","May 4","true","25.5"," 110 of 119 people (92%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","92","110","119","12","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kvothekingkiller/recommended/230410/","kvothekingkiller","Kvothe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kvothekingkiller/","293 products in account","Note - if you dislike the review, please feel free to leave why.\n\nHaving put a good bit of time into it, I thought I'd finally "review" warframe. I'm not gonna do a stupid "I jumped off a wall at a million miles an hour 9/10" or "Spun midair, became a rocket 11/10" bull ♥♥♥♥. Those aren't reviews, and they aren't useful.\n\nLet me make it clear, I LOVE WF, but I HATE what DE is doing to it\n\nSo, who am I? I'm a Hunter grade founder, roughly 1k hours (says 1.8k, WF in game says about 1k, I blame leaving it up while I sleep for the alerts :P), and I started playing in U7 so I've pretty much seen it all.\n\nWF went from a game where they had cool ideas about what they wanted to do, to a bunch of half baked, never quite finished or polished ideas that eventually just seem abandoned. I.E. the revamp of damage/armour and weapons, Archwing, or Void Tower missions. Void missions were meant to be hard, and for the elite, and have amazing loot according to DESteve before they were implemented, but in reality they were very easy, and just another place to run a million missions hoping for the (probably) 1% drop chance for the item you want.\n\nAs I see it now:\n\nPros:\n+Art team (sound, animation, graphics i.e.) is AMAZING (no sarcasm).\n\n+Enjoyable with friends, but that's most co-op games for you.\n\n+Not P2W. Is it pay for convience, or pay to skip? Yes, to a fault imo, considering the prices are stupid. But everything can be earned in game.\n\n+Stamina/movement has been reworked. No longer do you run like a ninja. Who has asthma. And both their left lung just collapsed. And their right lung.. And just had both their legs broken in a tragic zorencoptering incident.\n\nCons:\n\n-massive grind and time walls (sometimes at the same time). Some grind is good, some waiting is ok. Done properly it enhances a game wonderfully, making that epic item so much sweeter and cool. WF however uses it in place of real content.\n\n-P2P connection, no one likes lag, and WF rakes in cash. Servers should be a priority for WF.\n\n-weapons are kinda meh. All the weapons of a given type feel the same (i.e. all bows feel the same, all snipers feel the same down to the RoF). By that, I mean they all just have slightly altered stats, none feel like they have recoil, or a worry about accuracy, or take more than point and click in the general direction. What I'm trying to say is that a lot of weapons (imo) just don't FEEL like they should compared to a lot of other shooters.\n\n-Plat is incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing expensive. I.e. weapon is around $10 roughly, and a new frame is roughly $20 iirc (assuming you don't want to do the farming for them). To make it worse, there's no rhyme or reason to their pricing. A garbage weapon might be more expensive than a better weapon for no reason, along with NO WAY to try before you buy ANYTHING. And contrary to what some people will say no, just because you like something does not automatically make it good, viable, or top tier.\n\n-Enemies are stupid. The only difficulty there is for enemies is how many they throw at you, and how high their armor/HP/Shields and damage are. There's no attempt here, not even say, to make the trash mobs stand by the heavy enemies who either give buffs, have bigger guns, and use special abilities (i.e. projecting a shield).\n\n-Farming is either survival, interception, or defense missions. Everything else is either a ghost node (level/area) generally.\n\n-Balance... doesn't really exist outside of a general nebulous concept. This doesn't sound like a problem, but balance is the lifeblood of any game. I'm not talking about one or two slightly OP weapons, I'm talking EVERYTHING is whacked. Clan tech weapons (very expensive to craft weapons) are mostly worse than what you can find in the markets for way cheaper (roughly 1/3 fewer mats in some cases). Worse, there are mods that have been around for a year roughly, and are just as useless as the day they were created, for example, "Warm Coat" is a mod that reduces shield reduction on missions that have the completely random ice effect, halving your shields. Besides the obvious flaw of not knowing when you'll enter an ice mission, you'll get better results from simply using a +shields mod of the same cost as Warm Coat.\n\n-No endgame stuff. Sure there's raids, but that's just another place for them to add grind walls in place of real content. You'll do some massive farming, but at the end of the day, it was all for naught unless you wanna run hour long survivals, or high wave interception/defenses. Once you get a weapon decently modded, any skill requirement goess out the window.\n\n-Content is sparse, and often trapped behind massive grind or time walls to stretch it out. Problem with that is that it's stretched nearly to the breaking point. Content comes down to grinding weapons/frames to level 30, forma'ing them (aka prestige) to make them slightly better, and repeat. Fusing mods to make them better and stronger, assuming you can FIND the ♥♥♥♥ing ones you want in the first place.\n\n-New players have it extremely rough. They start off with garbage versions of mods, unknowingly, and the planets they unlock generally have the same mats, or atleast not enough different mats, which makes crafting anything very hard early on. Unless a new player has an older player helping them, they're SOL. And the one thing that was supposed to help new players, the codex, doesn't. You need to spend time unlocking it to learn enemies weakness, and what drops from them, making it even tougher for new players to learn about their enemies.\n\n(INB4 "But there's a wiki!" the info should be there at their fingertips.)\n\n-Lore, what they have is great, and really sets up a unique universe, the problem is that they don't have almost ANY anywhere. Prime 'frames in their codex entry have a tidbit, normally just an short few paragraphs, as do some of the other codex entries, and TSD which adds a good bit about the tenno. This isn't so much of a con as they need more lore, which would be fantastic.\n\n-Rushing\nInherently nothing is wrong with rushing, but as a new player getting put with the more experienced players who just rush missions mean you're getting left behind, and missing vauable loot (for a new player) as the mission ends early because people got to the extraction zone and started a 60 second timer to end the mission.\n\n-Communication\nThis is their biggest fault, their streams are a mess. DEsteve or DEScott usually being the cause. I feel sorry for DERebecca trying to control their lazy attitude towards the stream, treating it as a place to drink beer instead of answering question the community asks, and avoids/dodges questions with half answers or jackassery to (rarely) straight up insulting people (mild insults at best however) and flatout telling them they're wrong despite everything saying they're not (i.e. armor in D1.0 scalled up to a 95% reduction pretty quickly, and every weapon that did not ignore armor was pretty useless, DESteve was against reworking this, even though all but 4-5 weapons were considered useless).\n\nAlso, going along with this, they're NOTORIOUSLY poor at including all changes in the patch notes.\n\n-Bugs! I expect some, hell, EVERYONE does. But DE either seems to do ZERO testing, or so little that people are unable to log onto the servers at all more than once. As in a 100% fail rate for everyone, not just a server overload or something. So, either they're not doing enough in house testing, or they're letting things get changed at the last moment before a patch rolls out.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI had high hopes for this game, and DE pretty much crushed them. If you like grinding korean MMO style, go for it. Otherwise stick with something better. Overall, as the game is now, I cannot recommend it  personally, however it IS worth trying to see if it clicks with you despite everything else as it IS free to play, and the new player experience is awful.","July 19, 2015","false","803.9"," 1,162 of 1,604 people (72%) found this review helpful 106 people found this review funny","72","162","1","106","318"

Kind of a drag\nand finding groups for normal missions, everyone just wants to do void missions and alerts. #Rip matchmaking.\n\nSo now the standard game rating:Story: 10/10 (Enjoyable, and forces you to learn how to get a kubrow (without paying plat).)\nGameplay: 10/10 (Arcade-y-shoot-y-stealth-y-f2p-y-fun-co-op-y-time-based-and-stuff-yeah.)\nPresentation: 9/10 (Warframes are ugly, but they grow on you, and other than that the whole game looks fantastic.)\nSoundtrack: 8/10 (Not memorable, not annoying, having your own music in hurts nothing.)\nReplayability: 10/10 (This game is great, I will come back to play it, but rght now I'm waiting 2 days for playing a new warframe and I just dont feel like grinding.)\nI want to provide a second note, which may actually be different now as the whole thing seems to be under new management: The support guy can blow a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nWhen I went to them the first time with an issue about the game, I was playing on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop that wasn't able to run warframe, I asked what the problem could be and he told me the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ in the world, I can't handle when the support team who is supposed to help just sends you to virus filled websites and helps you in no way whatsoever.

Now we come to the characters themselves, the Warframes, these are robotic suits-ish that the Tenno control and complete missions with, now theres actually a large amount of these ranging from healing ones, to defensive ones, stealthy ones, and aggressive one, each one coming with its own unique set of abilities, stats and look. There are no real "Good" Warframes as they are all good in there own way and who am i to tell you how to play your game. So just go out, find one that you like, and have fun.\n\nSo the fact that Warframe is a free game might put you off, and yes even though warframe has a currency that is obtained by paying real money, but that does not mean this game is Pay To Win, this is because you are allowed to freely trade said currency with other players for their items, so if you dont want to use real money but you want an item that you can only get with the currency, then all you need to do is farm for a little bit, and sell of the items you got to players that want them, meaning that every single item can be obtained without having to pay any real money.\n\nAll in all I highly reccomend you at least give Warframe a try, I mean, what harm can it do.\n\ntl:dr\nGood game, basic controls, basically 100% free to play, space mums included, check it out","May 3","true","493.3"," 72 of 79 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","72","79","8","1"

Pretty bad tutorial.\nThe tutorial simply guides you through basic combat, and nothing more. The more complicated mechanics such as mods and damage types are barely touched on. These two main mechanics are crucial in-game, and due to the lack of a tutorial for it, I've encountered far too many new players who are clueless. You will have to google for a crap ton of information. (Bless the wiki page)\n\n2. Pay-4-Convenience.\nIf you're rich, you get through majority of the game faster. But it is NOT Pay-2-Win. Everything is obtainable, and the grind isn't insane unless RNGesus hates you. A person who paid money and a free-to-play player will end up with the exact same gear. Essentially, you buy time in this game, and nothing more.\n\n3. Limited areas to play in.\nIt's not open-world. Instances have a certain tileset for each planet. It randomizes, but generally remains the same. There are, of course, new tilesets added in certain updates.\n\n4. It's easy to get burnt out.\nBy burnt out, I mean that you'll probably play the game on and off when you first start. This is due to the long waiting times for crafting new items, which are the only way you can get new items on your own. That tied with the daily trade limit makes it difficult to play for several hours straight. But once you've attained a fair amount of items, getting burnt out becomes few and far between.\n\n5. You're free to do what you want.\nThis can't be a bad thing, right?  But it is for those who want some form of direction in a game.  I initially found it really hard to stick to playing this game. I love every aspect of it, but having no actual goal is painful. This game is recommended for those who like loot-based games like Diablo 3.\n\n\nPros:\n1. Everything is obtainable if you play the game. (With the exception of the Founders Pack)\nYeah, play the game and get everything. Simple as that. Wanna get something that is no longer available? Trade.\n\n2. Fantastic Graphics on low-end PCs\nI'm able to run this on a PC with only 2GB of RAM and an Intel Graphics card. I've upgraded since then, but it runs at a smooth 30 FPS on that disgusting old rig.\n\n3. Gameplay.\nGameplay doesn't get dull, unless you're one of those cancerous people who plays Ash-hole. Fast paced, and both melee-only and ranged-only builds are viable.\n\n4. The Dev team.\nIt's clear that the Warframe dev team cares about the game and does not try to turn it into a cash-grab. New expansion? Free. New item being released? Don't need to fork up any money. New mission? Do the pre-reqs and gain access to it. Entirely new mechanic that could possibly act as DLC? FREEEEE.\n\n5. Community.\nYou will rarely ever encounter any cancer players. Why? Because Warframe heavily relies on working with others. If you're a horrible person to group with, you'll build up a bad rep and eventually no one will group with you. The downsides of being an ♥♥♥ are so huge, that if Kanye played this game, you'd think he's Oprah or Ellen or one of those nice people that everyone likes.\n\n\nFeatures\n+ A lot of 'Warframes' which act as classes (extremely flexible)\n+ Detailed mechanics (modding, damage 2.0)\n+ Large amount of viable weapons (majority are extremely different from each, all are able to be molded to endgame)\n+ Fantastic graphics (recently got a revamp with better smoke and fire physics)\n+ Incredibly optimized (expect smooth framerates throughout)\n+ Plenty of customization and cosmetics (you will rarely find another person that looks exactly like you)\n\n- Dull movement system (despite having a parkour system, you'll be rolling/bullet jumping everywhere. This is starting to change with the added Orokin Moon Tileset)\n- Limited areas to play in\n- Repetitive (very limited number of mission types)\n- PvP is pointless (you don't get much other than cosmetics)\n- Ridiculously grindy\n- A lot of flukes (there are certain builds that do all the work by pressing A SINGLE BUTTON. I kid you not. Check out 'Warframe draco runs' on youtube.)\n- Limited trades each day (tallies with your Mastery Rank, which you can increase by leveling items)\n- Limited inventory (appears as a cash grab quite early on, but you can earn Platinum through trading)\n- Certain items are obtainable at certain times (2 main items; orokin catalyst and orokin reactor. They are untradable, and I've personally wasted over 400 Platinum on the market buying them because I missed an alert that was only available for 1 HOUR. The recipe that can be bought on the market is stupid)\n\nTLDR;\nIt's free, but can appear as P2W.\nYou can obtain everything if you spend time and effort.\nPlay if you like loot-based games.\nExpect to wait. A lot.\nCommunity is awesome.\nDevs are awesome with constant updates and hotfixes.\nBeing a Helicopter with dual axes is fun (yes you can do that in this game)","April 9","true","239.3"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","49","52","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/230410/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","Warframe is a free to play TPS / hack 'n slash co-op game with stealth and parkour elements. In it the player becomes one of the Tenno, space ninjas awakened from a long slumber, who control powerful suits known as Warframes which provide different abilities and allow them to tackle on dangerous jobs from Lotus.\n\nThe graphics are just incredible. Each location has its own design style, the environments are shiny and rich in details, while the special effects are just plain beautiful. The only downside might be the fact that the last one can be a little bit too distracting at times and hard to see through during a fight.\n\nIn the sound department, the music is appriopriate to the situation (speeds up when in a fight, for example) and whatever plays in the background is usually the theme of the faction you're fighting against (though it can get overriden by the boss' theme if someone like that appears). A few of the tracks deserve a mention for being just plain incredible, such as Drums of War, Becoming the Hunted, Cold and Gold, We Are Not Alone, Reap What You Sow and This Is What You Are. The sound effects aren't anything special, but they are diverse enough to not get boring or tiring. The voice acting is also really good, even if a bit scarce.\n\nThe gameplay consists of you and up to three other players deploying on a mission and completing a specific objective (like killing all enemies or capturing important targets) while moving through randomly-generated rooms. You get to use between three weapons - primary, secondary and melee (which can be of many different types, like bows, shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, shurikens, kunais, swords, axes, hammers, polearms, scythes, glaives, knuckles, gunblades.. yeah, this game has tons upon tons of weapons) - as well as an assortment of movement options, including, but not limited to sprinting, sliding, wall-running etc. You can also attack enemies while performing any of those maneuvers, giving you a large degree of freedom as to how and when to move in and strike.\n\nAs far as stealth elements go, you can obviously use cover to keep yourself out of sight of enemies. You can also use silent weapons like bows and shurikens to take them out from a distance, or sneak up behind them and perform an insta-kill stealth execution. Some abilities can also make you invisible or silence everything within a certain radius. The mechanics are very solid and it's fun slicing stuff down.\n\nThere is also the Archwing and its own missions, where you move in no-gravity using the eponymous mechanical wings, shooting down foes akin to a space shooter. While it isn't as diverse as the standard gamemode, it is a good change of pace from time to time. Not to mention, even more awesome.\n\nThe amount of equipment, types of environments, and missions you can encounter is staggering. The diversity is what keeps it from getting too stale.\n\nAnother good thing is that the multiplayer functions pretty well - even with high ping, you will notice an obvious delay, but it won't impact your experience or general gameplay as much as in some other games.\n\nStory-wise, the game isn't really all that rich, but it is solid nonetheless. There is a lot of lore in transcripts and descriptions of some weapons and Warframes, and the quests also provide an interesting narrative as far as the identity of Lotus and the Tenno themselves goes, as well as what happened in the past and what the player characters did before they were put to cryosleep. I'm not going to be spoiling anything, as you should discover it yourself, particularly when it comes to the newest Second Dream quest.\n\nI think this is it for the pros, so let's start counting out the cons. The game is still, quite obviously, a glorified grind to get better stuff. Fortunately, most of the time it's somewhat fun to play.\n\nSpeaking about multiplayer, if the host's computer lags horribly due to all the stuff going on in the game, you can expect your gameplay to be similarly laggy, with everything "flash stepping" all over the place.\n\nAnother bad thing is the fact that enemies are pretty stupid sometimes. They tend to take cover at not exactly the best spots, or forget that you just sped right past them and still sit there waiting in cover, just being covered from the wrong direction. Harder missions only strengthen the enemies' stats together with spawning elites more often, and sometimes new types of enemies.\n\nAlso another thing is that the game requires a LOT of grinding to even get moderately powerful. At the beginning you're going to struggle to complete the missions that aren't the absolute simplest of all, since you don't have much resources to manufacture new stuff, and the starting equipment is very weak. And even if you do get strong weapons, they're not going to be powerful enough without a good assortment of high-rank mods for them to customize their damage output. Of course, if you have a friend who's been playing the game for quite some time and is willing to help you out in getting started, this becomes a bit less of an issue.\n\nThe amount of slots you get for equipment is also very limited. While it isn't so bad with weapon and sentinel slots, you get only two Warframe slots for starters, kind of limiting your options as to how many roles you can fill in a team. You really need more slots to be able to do something besides one or two things.\n\nThe last thing is the fact that the game is pretty glitchy. Objects can spawn at wrong places due to random generator just messing up, or you can land outside the map and fall into the Void to a collision detection glitch or a lag spike. And this isn't an uncommon occurence.\n\nOverall, this is a grindy and harsh at the beginning, but very fun game once you get far enough. You should check it out if you don't mind a sluggish beginning, especially if you've got more experienced friends who can help you get running.","August 12, 2015","true","540.1"," 61 of 72 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","61","72","5","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nocturnyl/recommended/230410/","Nocturnyl","Kёґλђк","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nocturnyl/","72 products in account","So, I've been playing Warframe for around 2 years now, and I have to say I've had fun.\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to review this game with a negative bias like the one I have, so I'm presenting facts as objectively as I can here in as fair of an environment as I can.\n\n\nWarframe is a scifi third-person action game that plays more like a firstperson shooter on steroids. It essentially feels like a cross-over between older fast paced games like Quake and Unreal Tournament, with properties akin to that of a more modern shooter.\n\nThat being said, I can't call into question the fun other people have playing this game, so I can't consider that a worthwhile approach to determining whether or not the game is worth paying any money into or not. But I can say it's fair to judge other factors, for example...\n\nThis game is based heavily around "Modding", the use of items to upgrade weapons appropriately, and Crafting, the use of materials picked up from fallen enemies / broken containers or enemy storage lockers, to build things like weapons and characters to use. It takes a very long time to gather these materials, and because of this, it has been referred to as "Farming" when a player repeatedly runs the same mission, or runs a mission for a very long time in order to gain more of a material out of it.\n\nNow, here's where my reasoning comes in as to why I don't like this game as much as I could. It takes too long.\n\nI am someone who has a lot more free time on my hands than the average gamer, so I haven't had to buy much in this game using the in-game currency Platinum ( which is purchased with real world money ).\n\nNow, that's fine. Having micro-transactions to skip the time consuming part of a game is okay, because you can still have the option of acquiring it yourself over a longer period of time with simple hard work.\n\nWhat's not okay is something Warframe players refer to as RNGesus, the Random Number Generator. What's also not okay is the extensive nature of "Farming". A significant portion of content in this game is hidden behind a 'grindwall', or rather, an extensive task or list of tasks that MUST be performed before you can access certain parts of the game. This is not as bad as DLC, and it isn't as bad as micro-transactions in some other games, but it can be fairly irksome at times. All in all, this game is fair about how it treats many things, especially how it treats micro-transactions ( in the fact that a huge number of things can very easily be acquired with time and effort ) except for one problem...\n\nPricing.\n\nIt effectively costs anywhere between $2 to $15 to straight-up buy a weapon or Warframe in this game. This is a problem that is very hard to argue against or in favour of because of an even larger problem, the value of time. Calling into question the fairness of the pricing of micro-transactions in this game is difficult because you call into question the value a player has of their time. Is it worth spending $10 to get a weapon now, or is it worth spending anywhere between a few hours to a few days to collect the credits and resources to buy it, then wait an additional 12 hours for it to craft? Is it worth spending $15 to get a Warframe ( Playable Character ) immediately plus bonuses, or is it worth it to spend several hours acquiring the parts and the credits and resources, then waiting approximately 4-5 days on average for it to build?\n\nThe problem here in my eyes is that it is not worth it, typically because in the time it takes to acquire these things, I could have done much more in other games, or even worse, for $15 I could've bought an entire other game.\n\nI admit that Warframe is technically still in beta, and that many things still do need to be complete, but this does not feel like a beta game any longer. There is a huge quantity of content in this game, which I would easily value as being worth well over $40 ( Generous for a game that has no form of very specific story or singleplayer campaign + no straight up form of sandbox, as well as being restricted to missions that are run from your Liset, which is essentially your 'main menu' of sorts. )\nThe audio quality is impressive, and the visuals are even moreso; The animations for melee weapons are both practical for gameplay and impressive to actually look at, though the game is very lackluster in the way of animations for other weapons. The vast majority of weapons fall into only a specific set of holdtypes / animation sets, with the reload being the only animation that's different in a lot of cases. All primaries are held like a rifle or a bow, all secondaries are held like a pistol, two pistols, or a gauntlet / power-arm of some kind, and a significant number of weapons recycle the same reloading animation.\n\n[ There used to be a snippet here about recycled assets; They don't do this anymore. ]\n\nThe enemies in this game are not always fair, though in most cases it's thankfully relatively situational. For some examples...\n\nNullifiers are a Corpus enemy that project a large spherical field that completely negates all abilities and halts bullets ( Though does not halt Area of Effect [AoE] damage. ) Their protective shield shrinks when damaged, though there is a limit to how far it will shrink from a single instance of damage, and as such the user is highly encouraged to use weapons they are potentially very uncomfortable with in order to deal with this one very exclusive and specific enemy. The only other significantly time-efficient alternative is to approach the Nullifier in melee range, which opens you up for counterattack from enemies.\n\nKnockdowns are a very frequently used tactic in this game, both from players and from enemies, ranging from Impact and Blast being used to knock over or completely knock enemies away, or in less fortunate cases, used by enemies to knock YOU over, and knock YOU away. In most instances, knockdown is avoidable with enough map awareness and enemy awareness, but the much more immediate problem resides in the quantity of knockdowns and their presence during much larger fights. Enemies with plenty of knockdowns within their utility kit are typically encountered much more frequently during higher level missions in higher quantities when all enemies are uniformly more present, making it very difficult to continue to keep an eye on the entire battlefield as a whole.\n\nThen there's the scaling issue, and the arguement of utility versus damage. As it stands, the most effective weapons in this game are generally either VERY utility, or VERY damaging, with very little inbetween. The most effective weapons tend to either be semi-automatic / burst / fully automatic rifles or shotguns, explosive launchers, while the less conventional weapons such as trap layers or flame-throwers / freeze-rays tend to be much less effective to the point of rarely being used in Endgame. I understand that not everyone might see this as a problem, but if a player happens to take a liking to a particular weapon, they may end up finding that their favourite weapon falls off and becomes completely and utterly worthless in higher level missions regardless of how they try to build it, because of how enemies gain health and gain shields and gain armour endlessly without ever offering any significant weaknesses to compensate for the increasingly bullet-sponge-y behaviour, or offering any respite for players using weaker weapons by choice.\n\nAnd on a final note, the community isn't exactly the best either, a significant portion of the time. It generally is ill-advised to run with public matches, due to both troubles with being left behind by speedrunners, or being talked down upon by "better" players ( read: Higher mastery rank. ) regardless of context.\n\n\nAll in all, I can't really recommend this game to people who either lack free time, or are at all prone to being frustrated by what can be arguably described as an unfairly balanced environment.","April 26, 2015","false","184.0"," 395 of 605 people (65%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","65","395","605","52","71"

(It's harder than you might think)\n\n+Combat is fun, albeit a bit buggy at times.\n\n+Weapons and frames a quite varied, making almost every item a new experience.\n\n+Not bad in terms of graphics, everything looks like plastic and rubber but hey, it's a free game.\n\n\nNow the Negatives...\n\n\n-The game is an infinite power creep.\n\n-The forums, I have never met such a nasty group of people in my life.\n\n-The game doesn't have too much grinding, the game IS grinding, you are grinding to grind more.\n\n-The game is ridiculously easy, you can get almost every item in the game in just about a month.\n\n-The paywalls, unless you only want to have two Warframes, you gotta pay up, that or attempt the horrible trading system.\n\n-The generic enemies of clones and spacemen, most of the concepts are quite unoriginal. The enemy designs seem to be based on freaking shapes, or just generic space zombies straight out of something like Halo or Dead Space.\n\n-The AI barely makes enemies a threat, they will suicide rush you solo, all while getting slaughtered.\n\n-The bugs, this is a beta game but good god, it's been out for 2 years, they simply neglect to fix them. Hell, sometimes they create more bugs than they fix. These things are so rampant, it actually makes a SERIOUS impact on the games sometimes, from camera issues to getting stuck in walls, bugs ruin SO much of the gameplay that it hurts sometimes.\n\n-The balancing, DE couldn't balance a seesaw, some items are worthless, others OP to the extreme. The developers have proved time and time again to be completely incompetent when it comes to the issue of imbalance with weapons and frames, they will leave the top teir weapons that completely outclass anything that comes near them alone, while nerfing random items that very clearly didn't need it. It makes no sense, the whole update process is an endless stream of nerfing and ignoring. They also just straight up ignore useless frames and items, theres nothing more to say, they just ignore them.\n\n-The updates, most just introduce a shiny version of something already in game, or a useless gun.\n\n-The end goal, if you don't care about a number next to your name, there is none\n\n-The asskissing, DE will release a patch to fix something THEY broke, and people thank the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, yeah sure, that makes sense, not to mention ANY critisism of ANY of their decisions, (no matter how stupid they are) will be shot down by their White Knights\n\n-The gameplay, stealth is a neglected factor entirely, the whole game is just trying to get ahead of your squad to try and do more damage, any other gamemode is just killing ♥♥♥♥ with some minor objective to focus on while you spam your skills or choice of over-powered weapon.\n\n-The devs greed, they will ignore major problems so that they can release a new Prime package and find more ways to suck your money out, (Like slots, for example)\n\n-The idiotic community, just go look at the wiki, every page's comments has someone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a weapon and telling you some other one is better, they just bicker endlessly about everything.\n\n-The matchmaking, there isn't any, you have to go sit in a chat room, (Unless you join a clan, WHICH YOU SHOULD BE!) and wait for some Rhino Prime to join your game, unless you're doing normal missions, cause then you are ♥♥♥♥ out of luck cause unless some random person is doing the same node at the same time, you're doomed to play it solo.\n\n-The money creep of cosmetics, every new item that comes out is more expensive than the last, you know why DE does this? Cause they know their brain-dead community will eat it the ♥♥♥♥ up, and throw tons of money at the screen while mashing "THANKS DE" into their keyboard as hard as they can.\n\n-The lack of progress with updates, sure they come often, but seriously, they give us random weapons that who's gonna care about when there is elite top level gear that cannot be out-classed. The updates never bring ANYTHING new or significant.\n\n-The lack of variety in gamemodes, there's like 4 or 5 gamemodes and you better like them cause they are gonna be the only thing you play, ever.\n\n-The PvP, this should have never been added, the Conclave is straight up dead, being horribly unbalanced and incredibly laggy, (I'll get to the reason behind that next.) and Dark Sectors are controlled by clans that use DDoS and other shady tactics to force massive taxes down players throats.\n\n-The lack of servers, every game is hosted by a player, which means lag, a LOT of lag, it sometimes makes the game literally unplayable, and it's incredibly common.\n\n-The crashing, I crash 2-3 times a day on Warframe, just... my god, if I had to list the amount of times I had to Alt-F4 out of the game, this review would be three times as long.\n\n-The movement, you simply latch on to walls when you wall run, nothing feels natural, every jump, every vault, they all feel stilted and slow. Not to mention sometimes you just FLY mach 5 across the map when you jump from a sliding position, the jumps are so irregular.\n\n-The melee combat, you run up to the enemy mash the E key and you MIGHT hit them, it's completely random. And just like other weapons, melee weapons are completely unbalanced, for the most part heavy weapons are useless, and certain weapons destroy the rest hands down, its borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n-The Argon issue, every new weapon requires Argon crystals as an artificial way to make them harder to obtain, this simply comes from DEs issue of being uncreative with ways to acquire new weaponry.\n\n-The fact that certain frames are one trick ponies, certain frames are only used for one (sometimes two) abilities, while the rest of their entire arsenal is completely ignored.\n\n-The lack of a challenge, this somewhat correspondes with the game being too easy, with a certain frame and weapon, anything can be completed by a braindead child, people actually have to make up their own end-game of getting to high waves simply to have the RISK of being defeated.\n\n-The lack of a skill requirement, as I said directly above, so long as you have the right weapon and frame, you can conqeur literally anything. There is no reward for being good at the game, in fact you don't even have to try your best, simply having the numbers 1-2-3-4 on your keyboard is enough to be just as good as anyone else.\n\n-The most ignorant developers I've ever seen, here is an example, there is a weapon called the Dark Dagger, it is awful, as every single handed dagger is. However, the hilarity insues when you realise, that the tiny Dark Dagger, is around the same speed as the giant two handed hammer Fragor. And you think that's bad? NONE of the dagger stances actually match the Dark Daggers stance polarity, NONE. That is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard in my life to be honest.\n\nIf you want to play with other people, join a clan, most of the community is elitism ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who don't care about the gameplay, and are simply waiting for the next prime to come out.\n\nThe more people who dislike this only proves what I'm talking about with the asskissing, every one of these points is true, no matter how much people will try to deny them.\n\n\nFanboys will be ignored and most likely have their rant deleted, think before you post.","September 8, 2014","false","657.3"," 341 of 520 people (66%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","66","341","520","42","50"

It is not the proper forum for me to write four pages as to what happened to the game, and why I can't suggest playing it anymore. If you want to read more on it, I suggest going to the actual forums for the game (not through Steam, but through the official website). The players there are very active in posting, and there will be a lot of threads going in detail about the faults of the game, and talking about how DE's actions have never been further out of sync from what players want from the game, and from the direction they were once taking it.\n\nInstead of writing four pages, i'll summarize it into something short and concise. Again, if you want more specifics, feel free to go look into them, but I'll summarize, as I have logged more than enough hours into the game to be very familiar with it, and what has happened.\n\nWhat it really boils down to is this:\n\nThe company is using grind walls, and severely crowded RNG tables to deliver content. Which is one of the least creative, and worst examples of game design I have ever played. It wasn't originally going to be that way, but that is what it has become now. And considering it is supposed to be an action game, and not an MMO/RPG, the grind really kills the feel of the game, you are much less of a Space Ninja saving the solar system, and more of a mindless drone collecting resources for new weapons, all for literally no reason at all, due to the lack of story.\n\nIn my 20 years of gaming experience, I have never seen a company so unwilling to work with what their player base wanted, and just outright ignore them. The community is incredibly vocal with ways to make the game more enjoyable for the players, and keep them interested, and avoid just getting burned out on the game, and patch after patch, they go ignored.\n\nFrom the past year of expereince with this game, the current state is that it is a fantastic concept, being delivered in one of the worst ways imaginable, by an inadequate design and balance team.","January 9, 2014","false","067.5"," 138 of 200 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","138","200","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luckspeare/recommended/230410/","Luckspeare","Luckspeare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luckspeare/","58 products in account","I have played this game for two years, and have ambivalently enjoyed it.  There are many things it does really well -- the action and feel is great, when it's great.  And it's got personality, complete with your missiongiver (the Lotus) being creepily manipulative and codependent, and your ship's AI being hilariously Tourettesy and sullen.  The good parts have been good enough to overlook a lot of really irritating things.\n\nBut, after years of playing this, I have to turn my thumbs down given the path it's been on for quite a long time.  The good has been shrinking rapidly in proportion to the bad, and, given that a game like this is one you play for the long haul, I can't recommend it to anyone starting out.  As time goes on, at least in the two years I've been playing, it has only become *more* buggy, *more* tedious and *less* rewarding, to the point where I wonder if the devs respect their playerbase.\n\nProblems (short version):\n\n1) The game has longstanding, serious game-ruining bugs that do not get addressed, while new content introduces new embarrassingly-bad bugs that should not have survived beta testing.  They just don't seem interested in fixing them.\n\n2) The game is a grindfest, and that's part of the game and has been for a long time, and that's fine within reasonable bounds.  But the reward curve has been getting worse while the game has been getting more tedious and requiring more mind-numbing repetition of missions not interesting enough to sustain that repetition.\n\n3) In their quest to extend game life and make more challenge, the devs have been creating artificial difficulty by, for example, creating missions that are long and tedious, and, rather than requiring skill, require patience as the players repeatedly engage in Skinner-box behaviors until the mission is finally complete.\n\nPutting 2) and 3) together, the game is becoming a less- and less-rewarding Skinner box, and it's known as Trollframe to many players now because of its irritating non-rewards after extended, much-repeated tedious missions.\n\nProblems (long version):\n\n1) The devs seem to have become sloppier and sloppier.  Pretty much all new content is patched in with insufficient testing, and serious game-degrading/session-ruining bugs and frustrating glitches go uncorrected.  Most recent case has been the change of how enemies spawn in Extermination-type missions, in which you have to kill all enemies on the map to complete it.  Apparently, the devs found that some players had figured out how to complete these missions more quickly by stealthing them, making them able to grind faster.  Horrors!  So the devs immediately implemented a change that staggers them differently and makes some spawn well-behind the players -- sometimes at the mission start! -- making for a lot of time-consuming backtracking.  It also makes it so not all enemies are spawned by the time the players reach the final room of the mission, so the players just sit there from 3-10 minutes waiting for them to spawn in onesies and twosies.  It's disproportionately frustrating, like an extended, interactive loading screen that just sits there for a long time but requires your continued attention to progress.  This change has not been retracted 3 months after the fact, and it's not fixed.  Why not test it before putting it into production, or withdraw it until fixed, if it contains a serious bug?\n\nThere are lots of things like this.  There are a lot of bugs that just don't get addressed, and some of them (like falling out of the map, which happens more frequently than it should) have no in-game remedy and are mission-ruiners.\n\nOn the other hand, if there is a grinding shortcut, the devs are ON that, lickety-split.  So, instead of fixing the backspawning problem (making the player run all the way back to early parts of the mission to kill a newly-spawned mob, making the mission take a couple minutes longer with what amounts to a fetch quest) that has annoyed players for at *least* two years, they instead introduced *more* spawn delay and backspawn to thwart players that might be able to cleverly shave a minute or two off a mission (and, interestingly, completely avoid the backspawning bug).  From this, I can only infer that backspawning is intentional, and what bothers them is when players can *avoid* experiencing it.  Your priorities are showing, DE.  That one right there gets them a big middle finger from me.\n\n2) The game has been increasingly oriented toward endless, frustrating grinding with worse and worse chances of getting desired item drops -- it's been getting worse, such that these days people commonly refer to it as Trollframe.  The game is grinding-oriented -- we all know this.  But the devs have increasingly been orienting the content such that it involves this sort of grinding: so-and-so mission will be available for 7 days, and you can only get X item from it.  You need to collect all its pieces from repeating a long, tedious mission, which has a random chance to drop them as its end-mission reward.  They've set up the drop tables (percentage chances of getting each item at the end) so you can get a couple of the items reasonably, but one of the items has a very low percentage chance to drop, so you pile up extras of the first parts while you get silly junk items the other half of the time.  So you repeat this mission twenty, thirty, forty times, til you're numb with it and despise it, but you're pressing that twenty-minute Skinner box button sequence hoping for the thing.  Grinding can be fun and engaging, but they've pushed the envelope too far.\n\n3) In terms of actual gameplay, there's been an irritating trend toward more tedious and irritating missions and enemies.  The latest one at the time of this writing, the giant robot-dog Razorback, is a mission filled with bugs and made artificially long and tedious.  It's not difficult once you know how to do it, but it takes forever because of the way it is strucured (press this button, wait for bursa robot to jump down, knock him down and hack him, wait for him to disable Razorback's defenses, now shoot Razorback in a 2-second time window that isn't really very clear when it starts so you might miss it, and repeat 6 to 30 times depending on player DPS and other factors).\n\nEh, I'm tired of the game looking more and more like a literal Skinner box -- that Razorback mission is almost humorously literal in being one.

She will provide such riveting input as "It's the Grineer!" and "Doors sealed." and who could forget the classic: "Why do you spend so much time playing that game?". From there, you galavant around the solar system slaughtering thousands and doing physically impossible things like:\n\n- Operating around Mercury, a planet so close to the sun the average temperature is about 400 degrees.\n- Traversing a plane of existence populated only by mind-controlled techno-zombies.\n- Getting the last piece of Rhino Prime.\n\nWarframe likes to build itself up as a complex and lore-rich game filled with boatloads of content and a tight combat system.\n\nUnfortunately, what it actually is is a more technologically sophisticated version of Farming Simulator. You want that fabulous looking gun from the market? Well get your wallet out because this game will suck you dry like a vampiric ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you don't like spending extortionate amounts of disposable income on a FREE TO PLAY GAME, then tighten your belt, grab your pillow and get ready to play the captivating, soul-crushing experience that is Warframe.\n\nThe game's general gameplay is a fun blend of shooting and slashing. Your character carries both ranged and melee weapons, as well as using a set of abilities that come with whichever "Warframe"(Class) you choose. These weapons can range from pistols, to rocket launchers, to flamethrowers, to a gun that literally shoots rubix cubes. The variety of these weapons is a major selling point of the game. As it stands right now, there are dozens of weapons to choose from, as well as a great deal of "classes", most of which are well thought out and interesting. Some of which make you question the whole "space ninja" ideal (really? A water frame?).\n\nWhen you first get into Warframe, you'll see all this content, the lovely graphics, the polished sound design and fluid combat and think "All of this is free to play?! Hot damn that's amazing!".\n\nSadly, this is what most people think before they begin to understand DE's business model.\n\nWarframe is a game about grinding. You perform the same missions ad nauseum for the sole purpose of levelling up your weapons/classes, and gathering materials that have a mercilessly low drop rate. If you've played World of Warcraft, you know the feeling of running the same boss again and again and having it not drop what you want. That concept is applied to this entire game. You will grind. Forever. I've played for over 850 hours and I only just got every warframe and about 80% of the weapons.\n\nIt's a structure of loot-tables and abysmal drop rates designed to stretch the game's overall playing time to the longest possible length. It teases the player with what they could accomplish, and then forces them to spend entire days playing for a single item, only to hit them with hurdle after hurdle.\n\nYou want to get a new Warframe (class)?\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n- Play the game until you unlock the planet's final boss.\n- Grind the boss, many of which feature invincibility phases and can take up to 5 minutes to kill each time even with a full team of players.\n- Pray to whatever gods you believe in that 1 of 3 "parts" drop.\n- Run the boss again and again for the other 2.\n- Build each 'part' of the frame, each of which costs even more resources, credits, and literally 12 hours of real-world time.\n- Buy the 'blueprint' from the marketplace, which is often extremely costly for newer players.\n- Use your parts to fashion the final Warframe, which will take, and I'm not kidding, THREE DAYS TO BUILD.\n\nRemember raid lock-outs from WoW? That concept where if you kill a boss you have to wait a whole week until you can kill it again? The same thing exists in this game, but in a different form. You will spend most of your time in Warframe waiting for things to happen. You will wait for weapons/warframes to build. You will wait for the (entirely randomised) alerts to pop up with something good. You will wait for something interesting to happen. It's like if someone made Stormwind into a full game.\n\nEvery now and then, the developers will throw out an event, these are usually half-♥♥♥♥♥, completely rigged against the player, extremely poorly thought-out, rampant with bugs, and a massive waste of time. But they'll make you feel forced to play the terrible content by granting players that force themelves to endure it a big shiny one-of-a-kind weapon. And it often isn't worth the trouble.\n\nThe story isn't much to write home about. You wake up from stasis and find yourself in the middle of a warzone between clones, zombies and jews. From there you stab and slash your way to victory. Victory isn't actually in the game yet though, so you might want to set your sights a bit lower first. Maybe try getting Volt Prime, I dunno.\n\nWarframe is a good game. I would even say a great game. It's just dragged down by developers that don't understand how to balance or handle the game they've created. It's a restrictive, neutured experience which constantly keeps players on the edge. A nefarious business model based entirely around the carrot-on-a-stick method.\n\nIf you don't mind grinding, if you have friends that already play this, if you don't mind developers consistently wrecking the game every patch and if you have a great deal of podcasts you need to catch up on, then I would recommend Warframe.\n\nIf you want a game that will grant progression based on how much time and effort you put into it, then I would not. The game will slam you with real-life time restraints and force you to wait days for content you already spent weeks grinding for. It's a time-sink in every sense of the term, and it's not enjoyable in that respect.\n\nA good game hindered by greedy developers and the micro-transaction business model designed to keep players playing for as long as possible.\n\n\n\n\nBut hey, at least Nova has a nice ♥♥♥.\n5/10.","July 19, 2015","false","855.7"," 175 of 263 people (67%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","67","175","263","40","8"

I really, really do. I love almost everything about it, from its gameplay to its lore to its graphics to its sounds. Even its customization is better than almost any game I've ever seen. I do not easily get addicted to a game, but this game managed it when I first came across it, you can see my proof of that by just looking at how many hours i've put into it.\n\nBut, Warframe has been steadily slipping into a downwards spiral. A spiral of extreme grinding.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it gets plenty of content too, and that content is pretty damn good most of the time. A good example of this was an update called ‘The Second Dream’, which brought with it a quest and a fitting soundtrack that were both truly epic.\n\nBut despite all that, Warframe’s grind problem is overshadowing all of that awesome content. It got some ‘Band-Aid fixes’ here and there over its lifespan, but overall it has been steadily getting worse and worse. And now it’s gotten to the point where I really can’t enjoy the game anymore. Warframe as a whole just feels like a giant chore now. Now that’s partially because I’m a veteran and I’ve got not much left to farm for, but this is mostly because of the extreme grind it just forces you through if you want to get anything in this game.\n\nThere are other issues, like enemies tending to be nothing more than bullet sponges, and the trading/recruiting channels being nothing more than tedious walls of text, but all of them fall into the minor category compared to the grinding problem.\n\nWeapons, Warframes, Prime Items, Special Items, Event Items; at least 80% of the game’s real content is locked behind Time walls, Wait walls, Pay walls and especially RNG- and Grind walls. Now I could totally understand this to some degree, but Warframe has crossed that degree and then some. With drop chances that rarely reach above 5%, and most missions being very lengthy and tedious, you have to grind so very much, it just becomes ridiculous.\n\nThis is even worse for new players, who have to grind everything FROM SCRATCH. Not only that, but there is so little in Warframe in terms of tutorials and information, that new players (and sometimes even veteran players) will often find themselves overwhelmed and confused.\n\nNo, I’m very sorry DE, but I can no longer recommend Warframe in its current state. It wastes an unforgivable amount of a players time on mind-numbing and monotonous grinding and it ruins the rest of the game. Something really has to change drastically in order for me to change my rating and start playing this wonderful game seriously again.\n\nTL;DR:\nPro's:\n* Great Visuals,\n* Great Sounds and Music,\n* Great Gameplay,\n* Supreme Customization,\n* Free to play,\n* Good lore.\nCons:\n* Enemies tend to be nothing more than bullet sponges,\n* Trade- and Recruiting channels are nothing but tedious walls of text,\n* Overpriced Market Items and Platinum prices,\n* The grind is real! Dear god is it real. It's the main reason I can't recommend this game.","May 23","false","859.2"," 118 of 172 people (69%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","69","118","172","11","26"

The F2P model in this game is one of the best out there.  The only things you need plat to get are weapon and warframe slots and you can trade other players to get the plat needed for that.\n\nThe game play is fantastic.  With the addition of Movement 2.0 the gameplay is fuild and enjoyable.  The weapons are diverse and the use of Stance Mods for Melee weapons allows for a deeper hack and slash experience.  These Stance Mods are not enough to make the Melee combat as good as DMC or something similar, but combined with the amazing movement system and sweet Warframe powers you will find the combat is quite enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is Warframe's strongest quality and for this reason I have kept Warframe installed on my PC even when I am through with its grindy nature.  This brings up Warframe's biggest flaw, it is a grind fest.  There are more things to do than ever before and the constant updates will only bring newer content, but Warframes take days or weeks to aquire and Weapons such as the Dread will only drop for a specific enemy that can take quite a long time to spawn.  (Example: I have been marked for death by the G3 and I have yet to have them invade me... it's been mounths...  Granted, the Stalker [dropper of Dread] likes to pop up more than the G3 do, but this RNG type nature is still annoying for those looking to aquire the weapon.)  The main drive behind playing Warframe is getting sweet loot, but what should I do with my sweet loot?  'Get more sweet loot' just isn't going to keep some people interested.  More end game content with more sweet loot is sure to come, but the grind to get more stuff only leading to more grind to get more stuff is definitely a downside.\n(Tip: Void missions are fantastic.  If you ever get bored of the main map go to the Void.  Profitable, interesting, and fun as hell.)\n\nThe Lore for Warframe is some of the most interesting Lore I have ever experienced.  It takes an approach similar to Dark Souls where you can easily ignore the Lore without any downsides, but for those interested it will expand into an intriguing mix of theories and speculation.  One of the main reasons it is so interesting is because there are quite a few unanswered questions.  When these eventually get answered the Lore might not be as interesting as it once was, but the depth, history, and love woven into the present story of Warframe by DE speaks for itself.  It is truely fantastic and even if I stop playing Warframe I will still pay close attention to the developing Lore and story.\n\nDespite the grind, Warframe shines as one of the best Free to Play games of all time.  The gameplay is fun and addictive, the Lore is deep and interesting, and the commitment by DE to provide even more content for the players of Warframe is undeniable.  The grindy nature of Warframe may hold it back for some, but it is not as bad as other games--Mass Effect 3's Multiplayer was a quest for more loot and it was still enjoyed.  If the concept of being a space Ninja Badass makes you even remotely consider Warframe then I recommend you download it as soon as possible.  The grind will put you off, especially at the beginning, but after you have a few Warframes and awesome weapons the game really opens up.  The missions are diverse and the gameplay is so enjoyable that you can easily overlook the grind.\n\nTL;DR/Summary\nGrab a friend and sit down to enjoy one of the best Free To Play games of all time.  If you ever thought being a Ninja in space with awesome abilities and badass weapons would make a cool game, welcome home and enjoy the great gameplay and fantastic Lore brought to you by the commited developer, Digital Extremes.  Warframe will only get better from here, so suit up Tenno and get ready to kick some ♥♥♥.","September 17, 2013","true","447.2"," 235 of 365 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","235","365","0","0"

Farms were closed, factories shut down and local stores were forced out of business. The only businesses allowed to operate were the ports, for importing food to feed the now practically enslaved workforce. All national production refocused on the construction of the "Door Frame" Austria's answer to your door hanging needs.\nBy the year 2031 rogue factions within the Austrian government decided it was time to strike, uploading a selective virus in to the entire nations production lines. This led to the creation of the "War Frame" a door frame so focused on war that it caused conflict wherever it was mounted, homes across the globe now featured Austrian doorframes and unfortunately a rogue batch of Warframes were also set loose across the globe.\nThese Warframes were notorious, sealing front doors to homes to prevent you visiting your neighbours, sealing doorways to places of worship so people could no longer pray to their chosen gods and gradually over time the world fell to darkness and chaos, as even the doorways to power plants and gas stations refused to open.\nSome Warframes gained sentience and self awareness and as they saw the human uprising finally coming to fruition, their evil colleagues and companions burned in the streets and smashed to splinters they rose up to assist their human allies in the fight against their own kind.\nYou take the role of one of nineteen types of Warframe, from Oak, to pine to cedar wood. The choices are limitless, your skills totally customizable, from 'tea tray services' to 'Opening for the elderly'. As one of the newly freed warframes, you must take up the mantle of free-DOOR-m fighter, fighting across not only earth but the moon, Mars and Titan to free the oppressed human people from their true foes, the evil Warframes of the Austrian Mega-doorframe-corp.\n11/10 would open and close door again.\n","April 13, 2014","true","229.4"," 166 of 253 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","166","253","0","8"

Support was contacted but useless.\n\nWF crashed atleast once an hour (if not more) during the first two weeks I played. Apparently this is 'suspicious' and I received a 20 year ban. Srsly. "Banned until January 1st, 2035" Contacted support, the person I spoke to was very helpful* and gave me some tips on how I could get the game running better and had the ban lifted in less than 24 hours of me submitting the support ticket.\n\n4 weeks after this, I'm running Cassini (Survival) on Jupiter one night with random players. (Cassini is a popular grinding spot- lots of enemies, lots of loot and relatively easy.) After completing a 40+ minute run I see our mission results and notice I got over 800k Affinity (think Exp Points) for my weapons and warframe. Thats a stupid amount of Affinity. Normally a 40 minute run would get you 80-120k at most, I run 2 more Cassinis, one for 11 minutes, the other for 6 minutes. Both runs gave over 500k Affinity. Again, a ridiculously high amount. I ask in Region chat if anyone else has been getting insane amounts of Affinity from Survival missions. No replies. Try to check out an Alert and get an error message. I log out and try to log back in and what do you know- Banned til 2035.  Contact support, ticket gets closed the next day. No reply, no ban lifted, just a middle finger in my general direction. Try again, making it very clear that I'm not some 1337 hacker trying to exploit the game. 3 days later, I get some very rehearsed/copy and pasted reply saying I goof'd and violated their EULA and there's nothing I can do. Spent over $100 on this game because I thoroughly enjoyed it during the few weeks I played. Lesson learned I guess. Don't pay a ♥♥♥♥ing dime for any F2P game you enjoy or want to support. Silly me.\n\n*I wanted to credit the support guy I mentioned but when I tried to view my old ticket, I was informed my account has been suspended and can no longer view my support tickets or anything related to their support page.

It's hard for me to write this after so long.\n\nTo begin with, the game has great community and still has a lot of potential if many core issues are fixed.\n\nWe started playing Warframe with my friends when it was not on Steam yet, like almost 4 years ago. None of them play it anymore just because of glaring issues that you begin to see after some time.\n\nDevelopers are focusing mostly on new content no matter what. Game design issues that were in the game from the beginning are simply ignored or a band-aid fix is released which doen't adress the issue itself. Broken enemy armor and health scaling, useless weapons and Warframes aka mastery fodder, energy management is non existant, most warframe abilities either useless and nobody ever uses them or OP due to superb CC capability or straight invulnerability etc. and at some point get nerfed without buffing other abilities to compensate and so on.\n\nEvery once in a while devs introduce a new system just to forget it for next year or two. Two-three weeks after it's been released and almost nobody uses it, and there's a plenty of such cases (Archwing, Dark Sectors, Kubrows, Syndicates, Maroo's Bazaar, Focus...)\n\nGrind, oh god, grind increases exponentially with each new update. I feel really bad for newer players. Devs tell they want to change the situation where old-time players have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on. And how they fix it - they release a weapon with crafting requirement of 30000 for a not so common resource called Cryotic. To explain, you can get like 100 Cryotic in 2-3 minutes maximum if you're good at only type of missions where you can get it - excavation. There you have to defend excavator for 2 min which can be simply one-shot by high level enemy (there's enemy damage scaling issues too, yup). Not to say the weapon itself is again a useless one.\nAfter community uproar passed and people seemingly forgot about this issue, devs release new Primed Warframe with requirements for similar kind of resource (Oxium) of 14000 (by similar I mean the way to obtain it - you have to play specific missions to get it and amount is like 10 per specific enemy at best, and there are not too many of those enemies).\nAfter another community uproar it was changed to 7000, which is still a huge amount for many people, and more so for newer players.\n\nAlso Void, a place where Primed ("glorified") versions of Warframes and weapons drop. There were already many Prime Warframes released, and some of them have already been "vaulted" (taken out of drop tables). The official reason for that is there isn't too much space in Void mission for many Primed Warframes and weapons, and not to create dilution in drop tables some Primes were vaulted. But from dev-team's actions you can guess the real reason is different. There are several mission types in the Void that have little to no Prime part rewards and devs keep adding useless resources to the drop tables where they simply were not present several updates ago, thus intentionally diluting Void mission rewards.\n\nAlso devs tend to put most desirable Primed parts into most boring and long (20 min) missions in the Void. And the chance for this part is like 5% or so, and guess what? It's 5% for one of 5 different parts, making it 1% (if you're lucky) for the exact part you want.\nI guess it's okay that people don't want to waste 2000 minutes of their time to have a chance to get the part they need. Not to go too much into details, I'd say Void missions are not the only missions that have this problem.\n\nRecently there was an update addressing most of OP Warframe abilities, and that seems to be causing another community uproar now, as broken enemy mechanics are not fixed and most of the time those OP abilities were used to work around those broken enemy mechanics. I'm not sure how high level missions (Sorties) or raids (aka Trials) will look like after this update as in some cases there will be no counteraction to nearly instakill damage any more, especially when you barely scratch the enemy's health (lvl 100+ enemies).\nEndgame here is like it's either you relying on those OP abilities to keep you alive or you get one-two shot the moment you fail to do so.\n\nTL;DR\n- Devs produce more and more content (and bugs and broken mechanics too) and seems like they forget of even 2-3 month old content\n- Ever incresing grind, with latest updates - exponentially\n- Warframe abilities nerfs without fixing core enemy problems that were causing players to rely on these "OP" abilities\n- Many initial game design flaws that most likely never will be adressed\n\nEDIT:\nI really feel sorry for game's community managers, latest patches look something like: band-aid to fix an older band-aid that could not get another band-aid fixed...\nMy hope for this game melts.","May 28","false","664.5"," 74 of 103 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","74","103","5","21"

I spent 1000 hours on that game. Never played a game so much in my life. And guess what. I had fun in it. Plenty. The actual gameplay isn't even bad.\n\nBut the game is flawed.\n\n1) Welcome to grindland.\n\nIt's basicaly a huuuuge grind. Everything can be either bought with money or grinded, but buying in-game items with real cash is out of the question because of the ridiculously high "platinum" prices.\n\nBut hey, who wants to pay to get stuff anyway right? Go out there and farm that orokin golden bling bling gear, mighty space ninja!\n\nAs much as  I like the fact this is a TRUE free to play, I just can't stand game where the sole sense of achievement you get from playing it is about your possessions. In fact, the entire rank of your account is based on how many different weapons you own. Doesn't that give you a slight hint on how much of a grinding simulator this is?\n\n2) "Balance? what is that lawlzors"\n\nI started playing at update 8. That was almost 3 years ago.\n\nAt times, some weapons were already better than others, but not by that much (eg. Boltor). You could run any set of gear and still enjoy all the different playstyles they provide. but as the game progressed over the years, it was crippled by some MAJOR powercreeping. To this day, those weapons I played with at update 8 are completely useless. Some of them had slight buffs, but are still absolute trash (see Lanka for instance). Basicaly all the "top gear" that all those high level players use are either  a new weapon that's blatantly overpowered (Just think of the Soma when it came out) or a prime variant of it, which is basicaly a better, shinier version of a gun, that sometimes is already too strong, because the devs have zero knowledge in how to balance the game (Soma prime?! What a good idea!).\n\nWhat this means is that to run harder missions, the best choice of gear will always be that one new weapon that's just stronger than the rest, not that cool polearm you loved so much, simply because it's being outclassed by that one new melee weapon that just came out, or whatever else is considered the best weapon at times. This restricts a ton of different playstyles from being anything near viable. Want to play a Sniper zephyr with glaive with the Vectis's unique playstyle? Well sorry, but the glaive is old, thus underpowered, and a new sniper just came out which is better than the vectis by a long shot. Yeah, I had that happen to me.\n\nIt's just a race to aquire the strongest weapons, which are then replaced when a new patch brings out something better. Meanwhile older but sometimes more fun gear are left in the closet accumulating dust due to their innefectiveness. Playstyle diversity is a joke is this game. Even the many different classes have only one, 2 rarely, viable build for the late game.\n\n\n-=Conclusion=-\n\nThe reason why I can't recommend this game is probably because I grew up, and started to dislike games centered about grinding and possessions. Yeah, Warframe's gameplay is good, but you'll never jump into a mission telling yourself "I'm here to have a nice game" , but instead thinking "I'm here to get X item". Some of my friends enjoy these types of game, so if that's your thing, go ahead and jump in. But to anyone reading this who doesn't feel like grinding the life out of yourself while using the same broken gear in every mission, feel free to pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n","December 30, 2015","false","959.0"," 186 of 290 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","186","290","5","9"

How about the Grineer, whose sole purpose in life is their devotion to their queens and total domination of the universe.  What they lack in technology and in capital, they more than make up in conviction and their endless numbers.\n\nNeither.\n\nIn Warframe, you represent power.  The power to end conflicts with a swing of your sword.  The power to tilt the balance of power between civilizations at will.  The power to render technology obsolete because YOU, are a living weapon.\n\nThe run down.\n\nPros:\n\n-  Customization at its finest.  Everything can be recolored.  Mods are available to further enhance yourself, weapons, and kubrow because wrecking one army isn’t enough.  Everyone has to go\n- Parkour.  Prerequisite for ninja status\n- Graphics\n- Everything can be found without paying but patience is a must.\n- Raids a step in the right direction\n- Developers engage with community.  Frequent updates\n\nCons:\n\n- F2P but pay for convenience.  Nearly any weapon, mod, and warframe can be bought with money.  The only limits being the size of your wallet and the amount of trades available per day (determined by rank)\n- End game can be monotonous and certain frames consist of spamming one or two buttons to kill entire rooms of enemies. RNG is a big factor in drops\n- PvP is a work in progress\n- Experiences connection issues and bugs at times\n\nYou’ll feel powerful but perhaps, at least in this case, can too much power be a bad thing?

This game completely makes you forget about all of that.\n\nThey have turned this game into a Community Driven MMO, recently adding in Steam Workshop Support to let the fans themselves contribute towards the game's content available. And even before that, they have taken several fan-created Warframes and Weapons and put them into the game today. Some examples of this being the Mios Blade & Whiip, the Silva & Aegis Flame Sword & Shield, and even the Zephyr Warframe.\n\nThe Free 2 Play Aspect of this game is an absolute GODSEND, and every single other MMO out there should look at Warframe as a good example of how to do a Free 2 Play MMO done right in a 100% Non-P2W Fashion. Oh, you wanna buy that really powerful gun at such a low rank just to compete with the big boys? TOUGH ♥♥♥♥, scrub! All the weapons in the game are XP Locked, and in order to get them, you have to be the required Mastery Rank for that weapon to unlock the ability to own it. Plus, you don't even NEED to spend any real money in the game whatsoever. The game has a fully active Trading Economy where you can trade valuable ingame items with for actual Platinum Currency. Of course, you're still ALLOWED to spend moeny on tthe game if you want, but at absolutely no point do you feel like you're being FORCED to do so whatsoever.\n\nTired of people in League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive telling you how they're going to ♥♥♥♥ your mother right in front of you in public all because you didn't do as well as you should have ingame? Well I've got some good news for you! Warframe's community is nothing short of AMAZING. If you ask a question about ANYTHING in the Region Chat, you are guaranteed to get a helpful response back from multiple people. There's even an entirely separate chat called the Recruit Chat in which you can literally ask for help if you're having difficulty accomplishing something. Ontop of that, Digital Extremes themselves regularly have Livestreams where they interact with the fanbase of the game itself; in which they give out Free 1000 Platinum OR a Legendary Fusion Core to people regularly when these livestreams occur every couple of weeks.\n\nNow what of the Gameplay? Well, the best way to describe this game quickly is with one 3 word sentence:\n\nDESTINY DONE RIGHT.\n\nThis game has a similar concept to how Destiny's gameplay was setting itself up to be, but it literally fixes EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM that Destiny has within the 1st 10-15 minutes of playing the game for your first time. You will NEVER EVER hear the words "There's no time to explain why I have no time to explain" out of ANYONE'S MOUTH in this entire game. The storytelling of this game, while still a WIP as of this review, has only gotten Better and Better. Especially after the release of Update 18, which completely changed the way everyone percieved Warframes and the Tenno forever. The Second Dream quest that came with that update didn't even feel like a quest. After you finish it, it feels like you just walked out of threater after watching A GREAT MOVIE. The Lore of Warframe has only gotten better and better as the updates came through, and I can't wait to see more now that Digital Extremes got themselves a brand new Motion Capture Studio for themselves to make Animated CG Cutscenes.\n\nCombat is divided into both PvP and PvE, but the main focus of the game is primarily on the PvE side of things, with PvP being an Optional Game Mode that has completely different rules and regulations from the PvE part of the game entirely. The gameplay itself is a mix of a variety of different gameplay types in one. Hardcore Parkour + MOBA + Third Person Shooter + Hack & Slash + Stealth ALL IN ONE GAME. That's Warframe's Gameplay in a nutshell. It lets you choose how you wanna play your game. Do you wanna go Balls-Out Guns-A-Blazing? Go for it! Do you wanna go in all Sneaky-Like and go Stealth? Go right ahead! As for the MOBA part, that's where the Warframes themselves come into play to describe that one. Each Warframe has 3 Special Abilities and 1 Ultimate Ability; and sometimes even a Passive Ability as well, depending on the Warframe. This formula has been used constantly amongst MOBAs like League of Legends and DotA 2, and it's also used here as well. And with this game, it works perfectly. Each Warframe plays different from one another, and no Warframe feels the same as the other does. Granted, certain Warframes need to be updated and reworked; as of this Review. But Digital Extremes will definitely get around to it. Some Warframes that are in desperate need of a rework at this time are Warframes such as Mag, Volt, Oberon, and Nekros; as examples. But again, DE will get around to them eventually. Mag and Volt are already confirmed to be getting reworked even as I type this review out right now. As for the Warframe Combat itself, that's where things get fun. All the Guns and Melee Weapons in the game are fully customizable with an In-Depth Mod System to add stats and buffs to your weapons exactly the way you see fit for your style of play. The game allows you to have 3 Mod Loadouts, listed as "Config A", "Config B", and "Config C". And you can switch them on the fly right before each mission so you know exactly which loadout to go with for each enemy faction in the game.\nNow what about Character Customization? Lemme tell you, this game went ♥♥♥♥ing ALL OUT with that one. If there's was a word to describe Warframe, it would be "Pay 2 Bling". The majority of the ♥♥♥♥ you buy with Platinum and Steam Wallet Funds are all purely Aesthetics. And there is a HELL OF A LOT to choose from. Dozens of Color Pallets, Syandana Scarfs, Armor Platings, etc.... You can make your Warframe as badass-looking as you want it to be.\n\nAnd of course, Archwing. How could I forget about Archwing? Now to be fair, this is one of the more "Heavy WIP" Gamemodes that Warframe has, but even right now, it's still FUN AS HELL to play. Flying through space with a Winged Jetpack strapped on your ♥♥♥ at Mach 1 Speeds is fast-paced and feels like you're playing Zone of the Enders in a way. But as I said before, this type of gameplay is Heavy WIP, and there still is a lot more to be done wiith it to polish it up. Mobile Defense and Defense Missions need to be completely reworked, and Environments need to be a bit more varied. Ontop of that, the enemies are a bit bugged right now AND the Variety of Archwings and Weapons needs serious work. Right now, the Itzal Archwing is overpowered so badly to the point where it outclasses literally every other Archwing in the game by a large margin. But I'm sure DE will fix it eventually.\n\nThe bottom line here is this:\nThis game is absolutely amazing for so many reasons. It is a milestone with the Free 2 Play MMO Market, and should be set highly as an example of how to do a Free 2 Play System done right. And the gameplay is absolutely fantastic. When they said "Ninjas Play Free", Digital Extremes was NOT KIDDING. This game is the True Definition of what Free 2 Play should be like for Every Free MMO out there.\n\nWtf are you still reading this for?! Go and play this game!

Instead everyone is just essentially racing one another through the level to get to the loot.  Furthermore, the game even aids this mentality by providing an exclamation mark on your minimap directing you through whichever mission you are in- helping you maintain top speed at all times.\nVerdict\n\nMy first instinct was to add another piece of slag to the stuff listed above: that I feel this game is a little too far towards pay-to-win on the freemium scale.  My reasoning for this is that it just takes so much time to get new Warframes and armor without caving and paying real money.  I played Warframe for around 22 hours and I only managed to build one new sword and one item enhancer…  In my opinion that’s a really poor rate of return.  Add to this that the packs you can buy with real money are 40 bucks or more on Steam, I got mine for $10 during the summer sale, and it’s easy to see that the game is designed to siphon away either your money or your time.\n\nThe thing is, this is maybe the only kind of situation where I’m not enraged at what I would normally decry as “Pay2Win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.” This system works because the game is almost entirely PVE and you aren’t really competing against anyone.  Due to this important distinction, I feel like the player can’t really resent it when others pay real money for fatter lewts, because the only time you see them is when you’re helping one another kill stuff.\n\nThough it waxes too far into a grindfest for my tastes, Warframe is a decent free-to-play with nice graphics and uncomplicated controls.\n\nSee other game reviews and articles at GameSmelter.com","November 26, 2013","false","23.7"," 359 of 586 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","359","586","2","8"

The objectives vary enough, but the main flaw of the title Digital Extremes is out soon given the limited variety of levels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wiegraf/recommended/230410/","wiegraf","Wiegraf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wiegraf/","638 products in account",""Ninjas play free and slay gleefully"\n\nWarframe is the pet project of Digital Extreme, the canadian development team that has been behind the Unreal series, Bioshock and The Darkness 2 (along with Homefront which was still a good game overall despite its many flaws). A cooperative third person shooter with impressive visuals and art style, refined parkour and mobility options as well as an interesting take on sci-fi, it is one of the most active, successful and evolving game on the F2P market.\n\nSet in the far future of the darkSector universe, the solar system is now in a constant war between the conquering Grineer and the merchant guilds of the Corpus while also brushing off the Infested, remnants of a bio-weapon from the past. In this age of conflict, An order of warriors who were thought to have disappeared come back at the request of an entity known only as the Lotus. The Tenno are awakened from their slumber anew, their powers only matched by their mastery of the Warframes\n\n\nFree to Play or Pay to Win?\nBeing a free to play title, this question will always come at the forefront of people's mind. Put simply, let's take in consideration what "Pay to Win" entails : the term signifies that a game allows paying customers to gain power that is greater than non-paying customers with no option for the non-paying customers to match this power equitably.\n\nWarframe does not, in fact, allow paying customers to gain such power. In fact, most of the exclusively paying content of Warframe lies in cosmetics alternatives like skins, color sets, accessories and such. While you 'can' purchase some weapons, Warframe and such with platinum (the paid currency in the game), these are also obtainable through seeking out the equipment's blueprints and parts then crafting them into the desired items.\n\nEven more so, many of the Prime equipment (more embellished version of the regular gear) cannot be bought outright except outside of a Prime Access offer which allows paying customers to gain a set of gear corresponding to the most recent Prime Warframe released. Even so, the difference lies that those who purchase a Prime Access do get a few cosmetics atop of the already obtainable Warframe and weapons through regular play.\n\nMoreover, the Platinum currency is often used in ingame trading between players as the mean to buy Prime equipment part blueprints and other such tradeable ressources. Thus, the Warframe economy works on a supply and demand system where gaining rare parts and mods (more about this later) can be then be exchanged to other players in order to gain Platinum without personally spending money.\n\n\nThe Pros\nFirstly, Warframe is a constantly evolving game that has been nearly three years running. The game that it was in closed beta (where I got the first chance to play) has changed so very much that many that returns to the game today find it an almost completely different experience. From the game being now more approachable to having added many features that the community suggested to even revamping entire systems already in place for others that expand the gameplay greatly :\nFrom a skill tree system that was archaic at best to an upgradeable modding system which uses randomly dropped 'Mods' to customize your equipment's performances;\nClans having an actual, fully customisable "Dojo" that can be expanded, worked on and visited by any clan member and those invited by clan members;\nThe addition of Void Towers and Derelict Missions which requires Orokin keys to access where the most prized Prime equipment can be found;\nHaving your main hub transformed from a mere screen which you interacted with to an actual ship you can walk inside of and use the facilities' functions interactively;\nThe overhaul of the original damage system which favored entirely armor ignoring type to a damage system that favors experimentation and combination of elements to create combo elements and status effects;\nThe implementation of a fully functionnal "Melee Mode" that takes the old quick melee weapon attacks into a fully useable and effective style of play with combo chains (using Stance mods), blocking and rewarding effective combat with melee damage multipliers;\nAn overhaul of the whole parkour aspect of the game for "Parkour 2.0" which changes the original, somewhat iffy mobility system for much more intuitive and fun mechanics that bolster player acrobatics by a mile;\nThe implementation of the Archwing which is basically a free flight, space combat mode inspired greatly, it seems, from Zone of the Enders;\nThe addition of relays and syndicates, social areas where players can meet, talk and interact with said Syndicates to gain reputation and unlock weapon and Warframe augment mods which adds and/or changes exisiting Warframe abilities;\nThe addition of daily Syndicate missions to quickly gain reputation.\nA complete rebalance and revision of the Conclave, the PvP aspect in the game that was originally inline with the coop component that is now actually more competitive and 'fair' to partake in;\nAddition of Sorties, which are daily, very hard set of missions with modifiers which allows to get rare ressources and drops;\nFinally, the devs actually hosting a weekly "Dev Stream" where they preview components of the game they're working on, keeping the community aware of what they are doing as well as answering their questions as well as "Prime Time" where both community managers Megan and Rebecca play the game's newest features with community members as well as displaying community made fan art and messages.\n\nThe Cons\nAs a free to play game, there is the required incentive for players to pay for things they could get for free by playing, aka a "time wall". For one, crafting of most weapons and Warframes isn't instantaneous and usually can be counted in hours and, in case of an entire Warframe build, days (aka 12 hours per part, which can be done simultaneously, then a 3 day build for the final combination of the parts into a Warframe). Along these are some of the few points that might vary depending on the player's opinion on them :\nThe game can be a bit grindy due to mods and parts dropping using drop tables per enemies;\nEarly game can take a bit of a time to take off; however, once you've started to gain some gear and mods, you will progress much more smoothly through the rest;\nThe original inventory size limits the amount of gear you can have at once and paying platinum is the only way to increase them (which is suggested to do with your starting amount of Platinum);\nSome of the event gear that have come and gone cannot be obtained before another round of events makes them available once more or as a chance through a special vendor that comes every 2 weeks for a weekend;\nThe trading system requires either the creation of a clan with a trading post, be invited into a clan dojo to trade or unlocking the Maroo's Outpost on Earth;\nThe game is playable solo if you wish but heavily encourages co-op play, especially for endgame missions;\nWhile present, PvP is limited to conclave and while overall balanced, some Warframes simply outdo others with their abilities even though their functionnality are different than their co-op mechanics;\nSome gear is gained through "Clan Research" making joining a clan a must if you want to progress absolutely as far as possible since your overall Mastery Rank (player level) is based on how many pieces of equipment you've max ranked.\n\nConclusion\nWarframe will appeal to those who wish to play a shooter with satisfying firearm and melee combat mechanics, flashy powers that are varied and unique to every Warframe. While the loot drops and slight grindiness can be a turn off, it is often offset by just how the gameplay feels fluid and intuitive to get into.","March 4","true","700.5"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","27","32","2","4"

You might think, just by looking at its store page with the "Free to Play" tag and the "dlc(?)" packs underneath that it's Pay to Win.\nThat is not the case. Not even a little bit. You can obtain everything non-cosmetic in the game without paying a dime. You can even trade rare items for the in-game currency, platinum. So you really can get everything without paying.\n\nYou start off with little, taking a weapon of choice for a Primary, Secondary and a Melee weapon, as well as one of three Warframes. Your Warframe has certain abilities that set it aside from others. As you master your weapons and Warframe, The Lotus takes notice and allows you to test your abilities and Rank Up. After you've ranked up, you now have access to better weaponry to take on bigger things.\n\nThe mission variety is good, the amount of weapons can be overwhelming, but there's always something to do. Give this game a shot. DE is an excellent company, they do livestreams every other Friday(could be mistaken on schedule) and talk about what's going on, what they're working on and what they want to do.\nThey listen to feedback from everywhere; Steam Forums(ugh), their own forums, or even Reddit. They are not a greedy company.

It's just grind and scamming other players in trade-chat.\n\nGame is incapable of being difficult without also being tedious at the same time (meat sponges; insta-gib-capable foes; forcing gear limitations; stat restrictions, etc.). In part due to the satisfying but ultimately imbalanced movement system and fundementally broken mod system.\n\nMod system relegates player progression to the mercy of RNG's whims.\nMod drop tables are over-saturated with useless things (like +7.5% radiation resistance) that absolutely nobody runs. If anybody tells you that they run those mods, they're simply horrible players or their mod count is lower than the number of combined digits across their fingers and toes.\nStances; advertised as a long-awaited fix to the horrible melee system, were a disappointment and also relegated to the drop tables, futher saturating them.\n\nNo variety in builds if you want to grind efficiently. Stack damage mods on guns; slip in crit mods if the base chance is 20% or more; put every power mod that would be suitable on your frame, then fill the rest with durability mods.\n\nMelee has been awful forever and only serves as a mobility tool.\n\nEnemies are either inconsequential glass figures or spicy meat-sponges due to the messed up scaling bought upon by the mod system.\n\nDon't ever buy platinum (paid currency) unless you get a 50% off coupon or better as a daily login reward. It's horrible value for money otherwise.\nFor the love of god do not buy the starter packs on Steam at their base price. They are a HUGE rip-off; only reason I bought the Tenno Pack last year is because it was like 75% off during winter sales and became excellent value-for-money.\nWeapons and Warframes in the market are hideously overpriced considering you'll need to go through tens of weapons and warframes to rank-up.\n\nPvP is an absolute joke. You know how in  most RPGs you deal a lot of damage compared to enemies, but also have a lot less HP compared to them? It's like turning party members in those games against each-other. You just run about instagibbing/getting instagibbed and finding ways to cheese the system.\n\nEnemy variety is poor, with the only real distinctions being the differences between heavy troops and regular ones (the former of which is the only thing you should really consider when modding weapons as they're far, far more resilient than regular enemies).\n\nThere's no pay2win, only pay2notgrind. Warframe utilizes a time-based gating system like those commonly found in mobile games. You kill enemies in missions, they'll drop materials. You'll buy the blueprint from the marketplace. And then you'll craft the item.\nWeapons take a minimum of 12 hours to craft; clantech takes 24 hours PLUS the time spent crafting the pre-requiste materal (this can make the cumulative time of some clantech to be over 96 hours if you're dead-on with your timing in moving through each stage) Although there are many missions available which offer those special materials as rewards, massively reducing the total clantech crafting time. Warframes take a minimum of 84 hours to craft; get the helmet, system and chassis blueprints as random boss drops, they take 12 hours each but can be crafted simeltaneously, then combine them into the main warframe blueprint from the market, which takes 72 hours to craft.\n\nTo be honest, I don't have an issue with the time-gating system as it isn't coupled with pay2win stuff like most time-gate systems are. Although some might, which is why I've explained it here.\n\nThe good things about the game?\nIt looks very nice. Although the atmosphere is non-existent as opposed to how it was years ago (go search for early-2013/late-2012 footge and compare it with 2014 footage).\nMovement system is fun but is almost impossible to balance around without introducing tedium.\nGunplay is okay I guess.\nDevs don't do rollbacks whenever exploits pop up and are fixed. If you're fast, you can capitalize.\n\nOnly real reason I'm still on-and-off with this game is, plainly put, some form of addiciton. Although I did quit cold-turkey for about 8 months earlier this year out of plain disgust with their implementation of the stances system. At the time of writing this, it seems I'm phasing out again. Whether or not I'll come back I don't know.\n\nAlthough I'm looking at this from the perspective of a long-time player; so if you're new then you probably haven't become disillusioned with the game quite yet and will enjoy the bit that you play.\nIt's like a worse version of Mass Effect 3's multiplayer.\n\nAlso:\nWarbros #1\n","November 16, 2014","false","378.7"," 53 of 78 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","53","78","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NikolaiLev/recommended/230410/","NikolaiLev","time to get schwifty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NikolaiLev/","1008 products in account","At its core, Warframe has the potential to be an enjoyable game.  With fast-paced acrobatic combat, it evokes the feeling of old-school fast-running shooters.  I even got flashbacks to The Specialists.  But for every minute of enjoyment I got out of the game, an hour of disappointment presented itself.\n\nAs a free-to-play game, there was an expectation for some grind.  But grind is deliberately an essential part of the game, for the same reason it is in subscription-based games; to encourage users to purchase Platinum.  In fact, every decision by the developer seems oriented around profit.  As someone used to the hobbyist approach of indie developers, this bothered me.\n\nBut even beyond that, there just isn't much of the Game here.  The missions are repetitive, all factions use a swarm mentality, the AI is shallow and simple, and there isn't much variety in the weapons.\n\nThe game is purely gear-based.  If you don't have the correct mods (which you have to grind for) or good weapons beyond the starting gear (which is deliberately weaker than most weapons) then there's just no amount of skill that can compensate for that.  Despite community feedback, weaker weapons rarely (if ever) get buffed up to the current power curve, and instead get "retired to the vault" to make room for even more powerful new purchases.\n\nUnless you're allergic to variety, there is a paywall.  You only get access to a paltry amount of slots for Warframes and weapon slots, and you can only purchase them with platinum.  You can't even grind for them like you need to with everything else.  So if you want to try a new frame, be prepared to sell the old one.\n\nFinally, just as most free-to-play games, the price of in-game currency is bloated beyond belief.  The cheapest Warframe costs 75 platinum, which is a $5 purchase.  More expensive frames cost up to $20 worth of platinum.  For that price, you could just get another game.  There are occasionally discounts you can receive for logging in daily, but these are exceedingly rare.\n\nOverall, despite how many hours this game has given me, I just can't recommend it.  Most of those hours I can't even recall, as they consisted of mindless farming for Neurodes or Orokin cells so I could have something new to play with.  But only a small part of it was actually fun.\n\nIf you really love grind, or repetitive, shallow gameplay, you might like it.  But if you want challenge, depth, or a developer that cares about more than making money, this game isn't for you.","December 8, 2013","false","260.5"," 156 of 256 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","156","256","2","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiablosInferno/recommended/230410/","DiablosInferno","Diablo the Reaper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiablosInferno/","61 products in account","Warframe is a fast paced RPG, Hack and Slash, and Third Person Shooter mix that blend concepts from popular games like Halo, Assassins Creed, and Call of Duty into one jam packed free-to-play online game. This game supports nearly every play style, and there is no one way to play. Unlike other games with four or five classes, this game includes 20 unique armors with unique skills to aid in your fight and with new ones added frequently. Also unlike most other free-to-play games it is not pay-to-win. Granted, you can only go so far in the game without the ‘special’ currency which you have to use to get extra ‘slots’ to store your armor and weapons, but that’s is one of the best parts of this game, you don’t have to spend a penny to get this currency, you can trade it with other players for things you’ve obtained in your missions that they need, you know how some people want to just buy their way to the end of the game, so there are always people buying and selling things to each other passing around this currency to each other. As far as the graphics go I am extremely impressed. The graphics surpass those of a lot of games that cost $40+ and still remain free-to-play. The gameplay is even more impressive, with 20 different ‘warframes’ to choose from and each having unique abilities, the game is very dynamic. The way I might use my favorite warframe might not work for you and you might be killed frequently while I blaze through killing everyone. Also there is a miniature card game involved and each warframe and every weapon has ‘slots’ where the cards go drastically changing the stats, survivability, and the abilities of your warframe and weapons. These ‘mods’ are sometimes dropped by your fallen enemies with different enemies having different mods they can drop. These mods can also be traded with other players for the special currency, other mods, or for blueprints for special items found only in a special kind of mission. Which brings me to another aspect of the game: crafting. As you progress through the levels you will pick up materials that you use to build new weapons, armors, and some very useful equipment.  Different locations have different components that drop from them. Being a game that takes place in space, each of the different locations is an entire planet, although most of the time your missions are inside the ships orbiting these planets. Each planet has most of its ‘nodes’ ruled by a single one of the factions, from time to time there will be missions where you support one of the factions to either invade and take over the node or defend it from the opposing faction. There are three distinct factions: The Corpus, The Grineer, and the infestation. The Grineer are the first faction you come into contact with, they rule the entire first planet and are the faction in the tutorial. They are a race of humans deteriorated from years of excessive cloning. They are heavily armored units with standard bullet shooting guns and feature everything from standard machine  guns  to flamethrowers and rocket launchers. The next faction is The Corpus. These troops are a mix between robots with mounted laser guns and cyborgs with different laser shooting guns. These units also have recharging shields like those seen in Halo. This factions weaponry is comprised of mostly repeating energy guns, again much like those in Halo, and continuous beam lasers, also like those in Halo. Another Faction is the Infested. These are troops from the Grineer and Corpus that have been afflicted with a parasitic growth that takes over and changes their bodies, a lot of Halo references here, these being completely identical to the flood in how they work. These units are almost all melee units that are very strong and attack in swarms. As far as weapons go they have their claws and the heavier unit will slap you with its stretching arm. Almost every planet has their own boss which will randomly drop one of the three pieces you craft to form you new set of armor. Each boss has its own set of skills which most of the time will have some correlation to the warframe obtained from killing them. For example the boss General Sargus Ruk uses a flamethrower and has a variety of fire based abilities he uses to try and burn you alive. Upon his defeat he will drop one of the three parts needed to craft Ember, a fire based warframe with two abilities nearly identical to those of Ruk. While on the subject of bosses, I am going to mention another of my favorite features. Upon killing a boss you have a chance to receive a ‘death mark’. Getting one of these will give you a chance to have a deadly assassin, appropriately named The Stalker; spawn randomly into literally any mission many levels above you with extremely overpowered weapons. He is thought to be a rogue Tenno, those who can use the warframe armors, and has the same weapon load outs and many abilities shared with other warframe armors. As far as weapon load outs go, you may carry around a primary, secondary, and melee weapon, and have the choice of only bringing one weapon with you if you would like to. With this comes even more diversity in play styles. Personally I prefer t use mostly just a melee weapon, relying on a powerful long range primary and short range secondary for those tricky kills. Others might use only there primary weapon completely ignoring their secondary and melee weapons. Each weapon can be outfitted with mods to drastically change how the weapon works, one mod can cause your weapon to fire two bullets at  time, while another may cause your weapons bullets to travel through enemies and objects such as walls or doors. Right now there are nearly 350 of these mods with new ones added all the time. There is also a large variety of mission types. Some of these include defending a certain object from the enemy, destroying targets such as the ships power core, or special machinery, to straight up kill everything on the ship.  This game also includes a very popular RPG tool: customization. On top of the mods you add into your weapons/armor, you can also customize the clor of your weapons and armor, and there are special attachments, bought with that special currency or obtained through one of the frequent events. As a paid game I would give this a 9/10, but being completely free-to-play it gets a 10/10. Definitely a game worth trying, and if you don’t like it you can just delete it with no worry about money you waited because its free","August 26, 2014","true","184.2"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","3"

I like my shooters first-person.  But my gaming buddies would not stop praising it, so I finally said, "Fine!  If it'll make you STFU, I'll download it!"\n\nI should have listened to them from the beginning.\n\nWarframe takes place in the far-flung future.  You play as a Tenno, a literal space-ninja.  You fight with swords and axes and guns and all kinds of weaponry.  Each Tenno, of Warframe, has a different set of powers to master.  Some Warframes may not fit your playstyle, but there are plenty to choose from; I ♥♥♥♥ you not, there are currently TWENTY-FIVE DIFFERENT 'FRAMES to choose from, and the dev's add more on a regular basis.  Be warned, however, you start the game with one, but as you master the game you can defeat bosses that drop the components for other Warframes, and craft these in your Foundry.  Yes, the grinding component is VERY strong in this game, but I personally don't see it as the chore it's made out to be.\n\nThe learning curve may be a bit overwhelming at first for people brand-spanking new to this genre, like myself.  As long as you have friends who play it regularly, and are willing to help your n00b ♥♥♥, you'll do just fine.\n\nPlay this game with friends when you're stuck, but consider going into missions solo as well.  Each mission is randomly generated, with a number of map 'tiles' acting as the mission proper.  Missions may have tiles that repeat, sometimes even multiple times.  This helps n00bs like myself grow familair with map structuring, and before long you'll know where all the super-secret goody-drops are located.\n\nAnother added bonus to this game is that it is completely free-to-play.  Yes, microtransactions exist, but they take a backseat to the gaming experience.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, is available to non-paying players -- as long as they're willing to grind.  Microtransactions consist of purchasing fully-built Warframes, Warframe cosmetics, or fully-built weaponry.  No advantage is obtained if you buy a weapon rather than construct it; it's the exact same thing.  Team Fortress 2 may be free-to-play, but it's easy to tell the different between a F2P and someone who bought their virtual toys.  And there is quite a rift between these haves and have-nots.  In Warframe, there is no such rift -- not that I've noticed, anyway.\n\nI never thought I would became as addicted to this game as I have.  This game pulled me away from Team Fortress 2 for a whole month, and I STILL come back to it regularly; no other game that I have currently installed can say that about itself.  And allow me to clarify: I like my FPS games.  I heart/less-than-three them.  For a game like Warframe to pull me away from a game like Team Fortress 2 -- that says a lot.","November 24, 2015","true","456.1"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","7"

In this review, I'll be stating how "Free to Play" the game actually is and what the gameplay is like, what the game offers in terms of content, and a pros/cons list at the end of the review to sum things up.\n\nSo first off, how Free to Play is this game anyways? As a lot of us know, most Free to Play games have you paying for microtransactions to get most content in the game, with no way of using the in-game resources or currency to get them instead. Warframe does not do this, only cosmetic items, color pallets, interior decorations for your Liset, etc. Things like Weapons, Warframes, and Companions can all be earned by playing the game and getting enough resources/credits. Although Warframe and Weapons slots can't be obtained without platinum (Warframe slots are 20 platinum each and weapon slots are 2 for 12 platinum), you can trade items in the trade channel to people in exchange for platinum. Another thing I should mention is Foundry build rushing. If you are building a weapon or Warframe in the foundry, you will notice a "Rush build" option. This isn't spendy though, usually only costing 25-50 platinum to do so. Trust me, if you have what people want, you can obtain a hefty amount of platinum without paying a dime and have plenty to spend on rushing builds or buying slots.\n\nNow if you actually start liking the game and want to spend money to get things quicker, this is where you could have a tough time. Market prices from Digital Extremes are, you could say, "Extreme". With Weapons usually costing about $5-$12 depending on the weapons and Warframes costing $5-$20 depending on the Warframe. To put this into a better perspective, it costs $5 for the most basic package of platinum, which is 75 platinum, all the way to $200 worth of platinum, which is 4300 platinum. There is a cheaper way to get platinum though. The game has a login reward system and sometimes you can get a coupon for 25%, 50%, and 75% off your next platinum purchase. This would be an ideal time to buy some. They started doing Prime Access, which allows you to access the lastest prime Warframe and weapons instantly.....for $150 of course. The cheapest package you can get in Prime Access give you just the prime accessories, a 90 day Affinity Booster, and a 90 day Credit Booster....for $50!! I feel Prime Access just isnt all that affordable, but maybe that's just me. My rating on Warframe's Free to Play factor is a 9/10.\n\nAlright, next thing to talk about is the actual gameplay. Is it fun? Is it rewarding? Well, Warframe can be very fun to play at times, other times it can be annoying and tedious to play. It's a 3rd person view Co-Op/PvP shooter with unique elements that will be talked about later. In the beginning, you will have a choice among 3 Warframes ( Excalibur, Mag, or Volt), you will have a choice between 2 primary weapons ( MK1-Braton or MK1-Paris), you will have a choice between 2 secondary weapons (Lato or MK1-Kunai), and you will have a choice between 2 melee weapons (Skana or MK1-Bo). Either of the Warframe are fun to play, in my opinion. The MK1-Braton is garbage, both secondaries are good for beginners, and both melee weapons are good for beginners as well. Getting used to some of the controls might be a pain at first (Such as wall-running and sliding), but eventualy you'll get the hang of it and be flipping around like a space ninja in no time! Basically what I'm saying here is that the beginning of the game is hard to get past, in the sense that you feel underpowered and weak compared to your foes. If stick with it long enough to get better equipment, then it becomes much more fun to play. Weapons are fun and all, but I think the Warframes are what spice the game up the most. Each Warframe has a set of 4 powers that you unlock as you rank them up. The powers are some of the most fun this game has to offer. Example scenario: You are a rank 10 Excalibur surrounded by 25 Grineer troopers and there are just too many to shoot and kill before you die yourself. What do you do at this point? Activate Radial Javelin, which is your most powerful power as Excalibur, and watch as all 25 of them are pinned to the walls around you. Eventually, you'll be able to do the same thing, but with 50 guys surrounding you. Warframe powers, yes please. Now what about rewarding gameplay? This game can reward you at times, however, it can be very grindy. The first thing you'll probably farm for in this game are resources. Resources aren't that painful to try to get, although Orokin Cells, Neurodes, Neural Sensors, and Argon Crystals are the ones you will be grinding out on the most. In terms of farming, the only real things that could be tedious to obtain are Warframe parts, Prime Warframe parts, Prime Weapon parts, and Archwing parts. Speaking of Archwing, if you have played the game awhile now and feel the need for something new to do, try getting the Odonata Archwing and fly through deep space in Archwing missions. It's a breath of fresh air if you feel like ground combat is getting boring. Gameplay can get pretty intense at times, if you finally have the loadout to survive 30 minutes on Warframe's survival gamemode or 30+ waves on Warframe's defense mode. All in all, the gameplay is fun, the farming/grinding usually isnt fun, but once you get that weapon built or Warframe built, the fun begins yet again. Overall, Warframe's gameplay gets an 8/10 from me.\n\nNow to talk about what Warframe has to offer in terms of content. Well, it has a lot of content to offer compared to when I started back in June 2013. There are 22 Warframes available to play as, not counting the Prime Warframes (Only difference is they have an extra polarity and look way cooler). There are  100+ weapons in the game as well, not to mention the primes of course. There are 14 planets to visit, each with increasing number of missions available. Tons of mods to choose from, including melee stances, which enhance your melee weapons by allowing you to perform combos. Just, plenty of content for a newcomer to explore. Every other Wednesday, Digital Extremes usually updates the game with new content, bugfixes, and changes that improve the experience of the game. Usually every two months, Digitial Extremes puts out a massive update, usually going up a whole number ( As in Update 14.5 goes to Update 15). These massive updates add hours upon hours of new things to do. Warframe's  amount of content gets a 10/10 from me.\n\nNow finally, a pros/cons list to sum everything up (And some things I didnt talk about):\n\nPros:\n-The game is fun to play once you get the hang of things.\n-Easy to learn thanks to a tutorial\n-PvE and PvP\n-You can earn content in the game without paying\n-Friendly community\n-There is a wealth of content\n-At least 7 gamemodes to play\n-Endgame is cool, more to come!\n-No Pay to Win business models\n-Rewarding exploration (Especially in Void missions)\n-Warframe powers are fun as hell\n-Most boss fights are awesome for a F2P\n-Alerts, Invasions, and Infestations as daily missions are great and rewarding\n-Most all weapons past the beginner ones are great\n-Pet dogs\n\nCons:\n-Market pricing is a bit steep\n-Prime access is ridiculous\n-There is some farming/grinding\n-Some bugs still in the game a frustrating\n-Napalms are jerks\n-Beginning of the game loadouts can be tough to get past (Because of how underpowered they feel)\n-Higher mastery rank Tenno entering your game could ruin the experience for you\n-Some people in trade overprice everything ever\n\nLet me know if there's anything I could add, as this is my first review :).\nIf you need any help in-game, add me as ttrlabs02. If I'm online and not busy, I shall help you out!\nThanks for reading, Tenno.","January 20, 2015","true","967.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoggyCow/recommended/230410/","SoggyCow","[SubG] SoggyCow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoggyCow/","20 products in account","What I posted on the forums of WarCrap. 3 year veterine;\n\nThis is my last post on these forums, I've been around since Update 5 about 2.5 or more years ago.\nI have watched this game grow, and like all companies, once they grow, both good and bad things can happen.\n\nWhen this game first came out, I enjoyed it very much, every time there was a sale, you bet I would buy it, when there was an opportunity to help fund it, I was all over it. I have put a little over a house + car note into this company - in return, some platinum, sure, but knowing I was helping and a part of something - moreso.\n\nI've reach Mastery Rank 20, bought all of the warframes, all of the guns, KEPT all of the warframes and guns by purchasing a huge amount of slots - thats just me. I liked how this game was challenging when I started, there wasn't much of a dractic *press 4 to win* button. There was a real challenge, kind of like the Mass Effect titles - now this has become, which is indisputable, a game of pressing 4 and killing everything; jumping, skipping, twirling in the air like a... whatever that tiny girl things was flying around on Peter Pan..  Then Equinox comes out, further sealing the tomb on what was a challenge in this game.  My friend and I oftenly joked about how, "not playing this game is more fun than not playing at all" - sitting in 1 spot with 2 Equinoxes collecting drops; standing, doing nothing.\n\nOut of being frustrated and now bored of this now cartoony game, I went into a Relay late at night. I never talked to people much in this game before - never really liked the relay and region chat much as I've always understood it to be weird people typing this little chat box for hours with the frequent, "F*** You" and other obsinities - I just always played the game. But in this Relay, after looking at around, this idiot really annoyed me, talking about philosophy, suicide, and other things that don't belong in this game. I told this person to kill himself, not really meaning it, but dude, its an online game lol? So him and his friends in here said, "lets all report SoggyCow" -they did. I went to sleep, woke up, logged in - 2 inbox messages came to me; #1 was for abusive language and destructive behaviour, #2 was for game griefing. Two strikes for 1 thing, "go kill yourself". (in a Mature-rated game (even M+17 picture below this forum)). I asked Support what this was for, they gave me the run-around, didn't even answer my question.\n\nSo I quit out after feeling betrayed by the company I helped on 8/20, I came back and logged in to see what was going on on 9/2. Again, another inbox message? "You have been reported for abusive behavior - you are now permanently banned from all communication" - I wasn't even logged in the game, and I don't talk to people. Thats 3 strikes after telling an idiot to go kill himself. No curse words, just go kill yourself. I then came to the conclusion that all of their reports at once tripple hit me because I firmly believe these new guys in the Support center have no idea what they're doing.\n\nI made 2 support tickets, both say my relay, region, recruit, trade, clan, and squad chats are permanently disabled - so I'm down to a single-player game, and that all bans are final - go kill yourself. I find this insane how the Red Text can one day talk about "blue balls"; sexual stuff with children, and young adults, but if you tell someone to kill themselves in a Mature rated game - goodbye.  I filed a report on DE to the bbb.org (actually found several other bad ratings there), reported this to Rebecca and Megan, support - no help.\n\nSo I have support a peice of my mind, unfiltered with regular cursing, explaining whats going on as if I'm standing next to a guy down the street. What is their responce? - "You have been permanently banned from Support".  So, lets see, after telling an idiot to go kill himself, again, without cursing -  3 fake reports hit my account, and now I'm banned from even talking from support. 1 message from Rebecca (she has always worked hard), saying "ill look into it" - nothing happened though, and no reply from Megan. I'm well-off, good job, but even though, I now regret putting all this money into funding this game.\n\nHeck, even before this happened, I was on the forums here when Equinox came out and saw a topic called "Equinox could be a Genderbender" - it was about how Equinox kind of looks like a man and woman. I replied on the topic, "With Equinox's first skill, you can go from Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner with a push of a button."  - This was flagged as abusive bahaviour by [DE]Denielle (or however you spell that name). This game seems to be rated E, under the mask of an M. Turned into some kitty game..\n\nI've brought in DE lots of advertisments from YouTube, which I'm deleting now, and thousands of dollars - what a way to treat your fans & loyal customers.\n\nIf this Feedback form ever wanted good real honest feedback from a long experianced customer - this is it, "go kill yourself".","September 9, 2015","false","167.2"," 70 of 114 people (61%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","61","70","114","13","8"

Everything else is just aesthetic.\n\nWill it be slower? Yes, of coures it will, otherwise what would people be paying for?\nIs it painfully slow? Not if you find good ways to achieve what you need.  Definitely recommend looking up on the wiki and making friends.  You will need to trade if you want to achieve everything for free.\n\nPerformanceGame runs at 4K res 60+ fps without ever dropping frames...well I did once drop 1 frame because my friend was spamming skills Lel\n\nMovementThe new movement system makes this game better in my opinion.  It makes the gameplay faster for people that like to run through missions (about 99% of players).  It also makes you feel cooler, yeah... B)...oh...and it makes you wonder how bringing your gun up your shoulders breaks gravity lel\n\nCombatThe combat is different from most games.  You can use ranged weapons, melee weapons, skills, a mix of all, or just run  through enemies.  This game offers a lot of choice.  Of course it is best to take advantage of the strengths of the warframe in use.  Generally speaking it's a fast paced shooter that includes skills to do damage or buffs.  This, however, does not mean this is the way you should play.  It's all up to you.\n\nInventoryA vast variety of warframes, weapons, mods, etc.  Will entertain you for hundreds and hundreds of hours.  The developers made it even easier to level up now so it takes less.  The modifications require some thinking from the player's part and you can set different configurations so you can switch fast from one build to the other.\n\nAlso the game is free...why not try it? I feel like people underestimate it just because it's free.\n\nJust out of curiosity - if you don't agree, I'd love a comment saying why!

Though all items in the game are purchasable with the game's premium currency (platinum) the only thing required to be purchased is cosmetics. For the gamer strapped for cash, fear not, you aren't necessarily required to spend money to obtain platinum. Yes, you read that correctly. This is because there is an in-game trading system where you can trade your hard earned loot, not just to players for theirs, but in many cases, for platinum they've purchased or even traded other players for.\n\nDon't get too excited though when you start playing and realize that you are given 50 platinum right off the bat. Though you start with it, that first bit is not tradable. It is however, very useful for purchasing extra slots for carrying extra warframes and weapons, or even a cosmetic or two if you'd prefer that.\n\nAll-in-all Warframe is, for me, one of the best and fairest games I've come accross in recent years and for that it gets something I find few games as of late are worthy of: a great big thumbs up.","November 28, 2015","true","034.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

A game where you're a space ninja fighting off stupid robot things while grinding like ♥♥♥♥ to get upgrades and better weapons. Although the game can be fun at times it can get really repetitive really fast. A lot of the missions are rehashes of other missions with minor changes to the layout or enemy placement. And speaking of enemies the AI is not good in this game. Stealthing is very easy as the range of vision isn't far and they don't detect sound making it almost too easy. Also they don't seem to dodge too much and will only move side to side when getting shot at making them a little easy to hit.\n\nThe grinding is just hell. You will spend hours upon hours just to unlock a new weapon or certain upgrades. Although this may seem fine at first glance it will get tedious as time goes on. If you're into that then good for you but I, for one, am not. The controls are a small complaint for me as they feel awkward and sometimes unresponsive at times. Some controls feel awkwardly placed and some take a lot of time to get used to.\n\nSome will argue that it's a free game and that a lot of this stuff doesn't matter. Sure you think that but for me it just isn't a game that I took enjoyment in playing. Recent updates have added interesting things but not enough to keep me playing. It's an average game that has a lot of wasted potential and falls short with heavy grindfests, at times awkward controls and heavy repetitiveness.\n\nThis game gets a 6/10 from me. You may disagree and think this game's really good and that's great you enjoy but I found no such enjoyment.","April 9, 2015","false","24.0"," 59 of 95 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","59","95","6","4"

It still probably is.  But it is in a pretty severe decline.  The devs have shown a complete lack of awareness about the state of their own game and an unwillingness to listen to dedicated players.  Instead, they have begun trying to balance the game around mid-game content (T3/T4-ish) more more accurately around the skewed conceptions of casual players.  The recent nerfs to many top tier frames are a perfect example of this.  Casual players and players in mid-game content thought that Excalibur was overpowered, so the devs smacked him hard with the nerf bat, but the truth of the matter is that Excalibur wasn't even capable of doing most of the high-tier content in the game (sorties/raids).  He's now completely useless at end-game and middling at best in mid-game.  Simulatenously, they have gutted many of the frames that experienced players DO rely on, making high-level content difficult or generally just tedious.  The nerfs to Trinity and Valkyr have made it so that the only way to do a Sortie 3 Survival with a bad modifier is just to camp in a corner with a Frost/Vauban, which leads to undynamic, stale, boring gameplay.  They reworked Mag because they felt she wasn't played enough and all it did was completely gut her kit to a degree that she is now useless in end-game, while giving the illusion of greater complexity in the mid-game.\n\nIn a PvE game,  the correct way to effect game balance is to buff weaker characters/weapons/etc. to bring them up to the level of the stronger options in order to create a large diversity of EFFECTIVE playstyles.  Warframe's approach has instead been to brutally nerf all of the stronger options (except the ACTUALLY ridiculous things, because it's not like Ash needs some work or anything... >_>), removing diversity from end-game play, making everything feel far more tedious, making you feel generally underpowered (when the devs have explicitly stated that in Warframe "you should feel overpowered" because that's what warframes are in lore), and basically forcing high-tier content to be cheese in stupid, boring ways.  Since I don't look forwards to endless camping of a corner just to get through Sortie 3's, I'm not going to be playing this game much anymore, unless the devs pull a 180.  Which is a shame since I have over a thousand hours and hundreds of dollars sunk into it (by my own volition, because I believed in supporting the devs for their work).\n\nLong story short, the devs are unwilling to address tediousness/grind in a frequently tedious/grindy game, and their attempts to do so have only exacerbated the problem by leading to LESS dynamic gameplay being the only viable option at high levels.  Give this one a pass unless the devs pull their collective heads out.","May 28","false","069.4"," 45 of 70 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","45","70","5","7"

I am a hunter level founder and have spent almost as much money as I have time into the game (more than I care to admit to). It really hurts that I have to re post my review and change it to negative, but I am honest and not a fanboy. I will try to be a short as possible and just list my various problems with this game.\n- RNG. Enough said about that\n- Weapons have no impact. One of the fun aspects of any shooter is feeling the pain you're dishing out to your enemies. This game does not do that.\n- Lackluster quests and lore. I have never been more bored in my life with lore than I have been with this game. It's vague and uninteresting.\n- The cesspool that is the community. Seriously, just avoid the forums and region chat. It'll give you cancer.\n- DE. While I do not hate the game, I do dislike the developers. There's a reason why they stay up past midnight working on every major update while no other companies do that. They have no structure and that's not a good thing. As big as they are, there's no excuse for the lies, stealth nerfs, and procrastination.\n- Painfully slow movement. With "Parkour 2.0" they removed coptering. I am fine with that as long as you can add in something replace it to keep the fast pace. DE did no such thing and instead made us slower, probably to make the grind more tedious and try to force us to buy their stupid prime access and new weapons of the moment that they're pedalling.\n- No character at all and/or cringeworthy jokes. Seriously, Ordis needs to go die in a hole. He is NOT funny and is very annoying. The only character that was funny, became unfunny because of DE's lack of sense of fun. I refer to Darvo of course, DE ruined their only good character. Also, the newest quest was just terrible and made me realize even more how unoriginal anything in this game is. Sentients is a stupid ♥♥♥ name for a race and are obvious cheap knockoffs of the reapers from Mass Effect. There was a point where scorpions (another unoriginal rip off from MK) had the description "make the pain feel good." Instead of adding nice descriptions like that to add character, DE opts in instead to remove that and not add anymore like that.\nOverall, just play something else. I am not even getting into how much of a rip off the plat prices and market prices for all the garbage that's being pedalled is. This game has no fun factor at all. It has nothing.","August 2, 2015","false","996.5"," 150 of 259 people (58%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","58","150","259","31","22"

It had a dragon warframe included, so why the ♥♥♥♥ not, right? Any, I picked up right where I left off months ago, and some nice changes have been made. The new Law of Retribution raid is pretty much the only reason I can recommend this game now, for a variety of reasons. It gives you a purpose, for one. Before, I was just swapping gear and getting more powerful just to do the same old ♥♥♥♥ and get even MORE gear. Now, with a massive raid as challenging as this, I finally had a reason to get my frames up to snuff and whatnot. Secondly, this raid is the only gratifying victory in the game. I felt accomplished only by the end of LoR, nothing else, as this was the only mission that wasn't just a fetch quest or grind.\n\nAnother thing I've learned to love about the game since I picked it back up again is the glory of trading. Do you know how fun it is to rip off people who paid REAL money for digital ♥♥♥♥ in this p.o.s. game for your digital ♥♥♥♥? It's insanely fun. Yes, kind sir, you can pay $30 for platinum and exchange it for my crappy rare mod that I have lying around. Then I'll buy the Mesa warframe with your cash, and you can enjoy a crappy mod that I can farm again in under an hour. It's great fun as long as you're not on the idiot side of things.\n\nIn short, here's the scoop: Chroma, The Law of Retribution raid, and ripping people off for plat are the only kicks I can get out of this game, and now that I've done all three I assume I'll rarely be picking this up again after my recent binge. This game is still the equivalent of smoking, in that just because you unwittingly catch yourself doing it doesn't mean you'd recommend it to others. *Update over, enjoy the original review below*\n\nIt's addictive for all the wrong reasons.\n\nSure, the space ninja gameplay starts out fun enough, what with the stabby-stabby and shooty-shooty ♥♥♥♥. But then, well, you realize that your only options to explore more of the game consist of A.) spending real world dollars on ridiculously overpriced content or B.) grinding and farming your way to the top of the free-to-play food chain. Now, of course, the game is built for farmers and grinders because there is a LOT OF FARMING to be done. Every single item requires a blueprint, which requires farming, then materials, which require farming, then parts of the blueprint which need farming, then the final assembly, which requires farming and grinding. In short, you could be looking at seven hours worth of work and literally three days worth of waiting just to build a new ♥♥♥♥ing pistol. Unless, of course, you'd like to speed that process up for a measily $9.99.\n\nNow, I'm not not knocking the monetization as considering the game's target demographic, the farming aspects are very well done and you're ultimately never really shoved into a corner where the devs beat you up and steal your lunch money. But here's the thing: it's not addictive because the gameplay is great, it's only an okay time killer. And it's not addictive because any of the rewards are great, because no one gun or warframe is that spectacular. No, it's addictive because the temptation to get more ♥♥♥♥, whatever that "more" might be for you, is always there.\n\nAfter 40 some odd hours wasting away my life on this game, I realize that there was no real accomplishment to show for it. No overarching story, no greatly increased OP character, no real progress. Just a swap of this frame for that frame, this gun for that gun. In short, it was like shuffling a deck of cards for 40 hours.\n\nIf you have literally nothing better to do with yourself and want to spend days, weeks and months of your life like that, Warframe is hands down the free-to-play game for you. But poke past its initially endearing facade and you'll find a game so utterly trivial (even by video game standards) that shame is all you'll feel long after ignoring the clock.","November 22, 2014","false","222.9"," 84 of 141 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","84","141","7","9"

Both quite unpolished and in so much need of work.\nGave Firefall the benefit of the doubt, and just loved it.\nI needed a change though and a good buddy of mine in Firefall, was also playing Warframe and so I asked how the game was these days. Three months later, and I am all in on this game.\nWith Firefall having open space and more of an MMO feeling, Warframe is level based, with a mission.\nA big change for me, but liking it lots. You get to know the mechanisms, the frames, mods etc etc and just get better at it. Frames keep leveling, so are the mods. All these things give you a feeling of accomplisment in this game.\nThe frames are quite distinctive, and all have their specific abilities that make you come back for more.\nDE is adding more features, releases frames or updated/upgraded frames (Prime) and hopefully in the near future I'd like to get more into the lore of the Tenno.\nEvery week a live community stream and I believe every other week a dev stream as well. Both with giveaways.\nAll in all a great game that will let you have a great time with your buddies.\n\nps. It's certainly not p2w at all. Almost everything you want, you can get it by playing certain levels etc etc.\nIf you do pay, that's great.

But DAMN do I love this game. Almost 1,500 hours on record. The gameplay is so buttery smooth, the gunplay so tight and fun, the melee slick and gory, the parkour and jumping and sliding and gliding and backflipping, all of these merge into an incredibly fun experience that keeps me coming back even after months of hiatus.\n\nIt's also a rather generous game in terms of free-to-play. Few things are locked behind a paywall - most can be obtained if you are patient enough. And you can get currency by trading items with other players. It's very fair and logical, even if it takes time.\n\nThis is the only free-to-play game I've invested substantial amounts of money into, and I don't regret it at all. They keep adding stuff and improving things. Not just more items to grind (although there are plenty of those) but I'm talking new maps, game modes, refinements to mechanics like melee and stuff, even entire sub-games in the game (do you like Strike Suit Zero space combat? cause you can do that in Warframe now.)\n\nThere are dozens, hundreds of ways you can customise your loadout and play style, from your choice of suit (warframe) and its abilities to your main, secondary and melee weapons, to the attributes of all those, and more and more details.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, the music and sound effects excellent, and the gameplay, oh man. Like butter.\n\nTake a look at the other Steam reviews. Everyone is aware how grindy the game is, and we don't care because it plays so, so very well.\n\nI love how good I am at this game.","October 12, 2015","true","717.6"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

It's so random in fact, that I've encountered several scenarios wherein energy orbs are either a dime a dozen, or harder to find than Waldo in a Carmen Sandiego book (now apply this to loot, enemies, currency, and crafting materials). That being said, it isn't lost to me that the developers did this intentionally, just so that it would be easier to entice players to use actual money to buy the in-game currency (platinum), or the other "pay to win" options available (buy warframes, weapons, boosts, and materials as opposed to farming them).\n\nGot a lot of money to bypass the crappy RNG? Play this game.\nGot a lot of time to waste on the crappy RNG? Play this game.\nNo money or time? GTFO and avoid this like the plague.\n\nEDIT: If you want to play this game, but also want to reduce the wild RNG's relevance, then I suggest that you keep logging in till you get the 75% discount to Platinum, then buy the 4300 Platinum pack from the store for 50USD. That much platinum is more than enough to get you started and then some, and the value is great.","March 28, 2015","false","391.1"," 53 of 87 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","53","87","5","5"

You'll see it when you realize you need ~40 forma to build all the weapons that require them (each one taking 24 hours) which means ~40 neurodes in addition to the plethora of weapons that already require neurodes so around ~90 of those. Void farming gets very tedious especially when the host disconnects and you get nothing.\n\nHonestly I don't see the point of having it set up like that. You should be allowed to keep all the rotation rewards you rightfully earned regardless if you or the host disconnects. I know some people could abuse that system, but then why should we have to be punished for it too?\n\nAnyways, I already built most of the weapons but overall I'm just fatigued with the RNG. It gets tough trying to keep up with it all and the only reason I kept playing was I got addicted (in a bad way) when realizing I put in too much time to stop now.\n\nIf you hate RNG in your video game rewards, then do not pick this up. Because even if you think you can deal with it, eventually you're going to get sick of it. That's all I have to say. (also DE is nerf-happy so be wary when spending your resources upgrading your equipment because it could turn out mediocre if too many people on the forums complain...because they don't want others using a weapon they don't like).","October 4, 2015","false","903.3"," 75 of 127 people (59%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","59","75","127","7","0"

Seriously, as a character modeler myself, this is like all the stuff you want to make in Zbrush but can never get into a real game because it's too far away from mainstream design.\n\nThe dev team is a bunch of hardworking people who outdo themselves with each update. I cannot begin to describe how happy I am with the growth of this game, it blows me away every time an update rolls out. The events are super fun, the weapons modding is full of tons and tons of options, there is an ever growing list of items and warframes... there is just so much to bite into in this game. I am a person who enjoys deep detail and stats and customization, and this game speaks to that need very well, in addition to its utter crafted beauty.\n\nOh, by the way, it's totally free.\n\nThe only place I find a little lacking is lore. They have done a lot of worldbuilding and set up a great stage for their characters but have not embellished them or the history of the world very much. This grows with every update, of course, but I feel it is growing much more slowly than the game itself is. I'd love to even just be able to read more somewhere, if nothing else. However, there is enough there though to latch onto to make stuff up, and that can be fun.

Don't do it.\n\nThe short version:\nThe entire game is grinding.\nYou can pay absurd amounts to skip (some) grinding.\nIf you skip all the grinding, you will have nothing to do.\nThe game is a huge waste of time, and if you let it, money.\nThe long version:\nThis game is full of "wouldn't it be cool if" and completely lacking in actual fun.\nThere is some hint of a story, but it's so much work to get from one part of the story to another that there is no point.\nThere is some really deep ♥♥♥♥ that could be done with themes, for example the factions or the fate of Earth, but the game is so stuffed with "wouldn't it be cool if" that even if you wanted to read into these you would barely have time.\nI feel like there is a missed opportunity for a lot of customization which could actually reduce work on the developers' part.\nthe game claims to be in a "beta" state, but there are feature and content changes every patch which is more indicative of alpha or pre-alpha development.

When I first played Warframe, it was a little bit after it's debut on Steam.  In terms of content, it was after they switched over to the current ability system.  When Banshee was still the hot stuff.  Since then I've grinded my way to near end game, collected most of the shiny macguffins they've thrown at us, and felt generally terribly annoyed with the developers.  There have been a lot of mistakes, bugs, and some downright stupid decisions that should not have happened in the first place.  There are times where I do wonder if they ever bother to think how the players will react.  Yes, there are constant hotfixes and updates.  But the real issues frequently brought up on the forum are not addressed in the updates.  The contents released feel slapped on, empty, and almost always really buggy.  The beta excuse is lame and abused.  Warframe is released on PS4 and we are still in beta?  People have been asking for better net code fix for ages and there have been no significant improvements since I first joined.   Hiding and encrypting the data to prevent people peeking into drop rates is an overkill and does look suspicious going by what they did around that time.  (IE, not doing thier job of fixing the drop rates.)  The recent release of Prime Access and its outrageous pricing makes me question if they even have an inkling of how to properly price a F2P game.  Their digital currency, Plat, is pretty expensive enough as it is.  Only with a 50% or 75% coupon would the price be more reasonable.  Oh, but you can't use the coupon for Prime Access.\n\nThe concept of a space ninja is great, but Digital Extreme doesn't have a clear direction for their "baby."  All this incessant padding with gimmicky weapons and frames is getting old and stale very quickly.  Older weapons and frames won't get adjusted unless people are really vocal about it.  There's only nerf, nerf, and nerf if they think a weapon is too over powered.  Buff is rare.  Valkyr is also a poor choice of a Berserker frame is she has such a squishy stats.  Damage 2.0 might fix some things, but the biggest problem of connection issue hasn't even been touched.\n\nWhile Warframe is indeed a game where the important content such as weapons and frames can be farmed without digital currency, I still would not recommend it.  For those who are looking for a co-op online game, this is not the one.  This game is very grind intensive and not very friendly to the new players.  Connections WILL be an issue if you don't have good internet, as Warframe doesn't have any official servers to host missions.  Because of the way is constructed, the envrionment doesn't always encourage good cooperations between the players.  You are better off joining a good clan or kidnap some friends to play with you.  Public matching can be boring and disastrous.  The recent events also brought out a lot of campers/leechers...","January 1, 2014","false","502.5"," 51 of 85 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","51","85","0","2"

What do I mean by Pay for Convenience? Every gameplay changing weapon, item, part.etc can be gotten through simply playing the game whether you're grinding for that specific resource or rare drop or not. Another feature is these 12/24/72 hour building periods for weapons, enhancements or Warframes. BUT HOW IS THAT JUSTIFIED?!? Well that's simple, this is a Free to play game and the Devs need a way to earn money, yet you can still get every item you want simply by playing and waiting. If you choose to spend money you can use it to rush foundry builds or outright buy items from the market or trade chat. Another thing to note is this game is still technically in beta (despite having a working ingame Market focused around premium currency) and receiving updates nearly every week.\n\nNow that that is out of the way lets move on to the real review.\nWarframe is a game about an ancient warrior race, they are called Tenno. (some may recognize this as the last name of the protagonist in the Dark Sector series, that game is also created by Digital Extremes an Warframe is seen as its successor) In a nutshell they are a group of Space Ninja whose sole purpose is to maintain balance of power in the Solar System. How might they do that? Simple, they slaughter hundreds of deteriorating clones, Greedy Merchants and Infected who are pretty much zombies of the aforementioned clones and merchants.\n\nGameplay can be a mixed bag for people, Its generally Pve with the occasional pvp thrown in due to fan requests. You will have a Primary, Secondary and Melee weapon. This is simply to create versatility in your loadouts and to offer unique ways to approach the fast paced combat. Now I mentioned before grinding and waiting times, yes you will need to wait a few hours or days to build your new weapons and Warframes but its Free to Play so I'm going to let it slide.\n\nI understand this review could be more concise, but there are so many more that do this game more justice than mine. Besides its free to play, you should give it a few hours and then decide for yourself.","September 12, 2014","true","887.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pwb3/recommended/230410/","pwb3","Xoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pwb3/","255 products in account","I have played this game for years. I've played since the first version of the star map, since before the landing craft was a tangible thing. Back then, there just wasn't enough to keep me interested in the game, and I would play it for short periods, months apart from one another.\n\nNowadays, I feel like there is too much. Not too many items, but too much to do to get them. As others have noted in the community, there is a very definite "resource creep" - that is, a slow and methodical increase of crafting costs - that has been overtaking the game slowly. First it started with increasing the prices of existing materials with each new item. Next was adding things like Oxium, Tellurium, Cryotic, and now Nitain, new resources that are required in new items, introduced solely to add a level of difficulty to crafting. I can't blame them for this, they are trying to create a desire in the playerbase to use the premium currency, Platinum, which can be used to buy resources (as well as ways to craft them) as well as to trade other players for items (namely Prime parts) which are typically difficult to attain.\n\nHowever, with the most recent few updates, the resource creep has become a resource sprint. I spent part of my last week collecting enough Oxium (a fairly uncommon resource that drops in small quantities from a very specific and uncommon enemy type) to build a particular weapon. The gun required 3,500 oxium, which drops in quantities of 7-11 per unit. While this was ridiculous to me, I had heard the gun was one of the best ways to kill a particularly annoying boss, and so I buckled down and did my farming to get it.\n\nUnfortunately, the gun was a bit of a disappointment, but I feel that is in part due to the hours (literal) I spent trying to get it. If the cost wasn't so high, I would enjoy this gun way more, but because I spent so much time working up to it, the end result ended up being lackluster.\n\nThere is another weapon which has a similar spike in required resources, the Sibear, which requires 30,000 Cryotic to build - a resource that drops in quantities of 100 from extractors that take a full minute to complete, and which can be damaged and destroyed by enemies if not guarded carefully.\n\nI thought this was bad, but with the most recent update to the game, they introduced Vauban Prime. Vauban, for those who know, is a Warframe whose parts do not drop from bosses, but from (rather rare) in-game Alerts. As such, he is a rather uncommon frame, as most people have not put in the time to get him, or have just been unlucky about the alerts. I understand, then, that they want to make Vauban Prime difficult to attain as well. However, they did not accomplish this by restricting drops (which are pitifully low anyway, with the rarest parts dropping at an ~5% rate in some of the games most difficult missions) but rather by ramping up the resources required to craft him, severely. Initially, it required 14,000 Oxium and 9,000 Cryotic to craft all his parts, as well as 20 Nitain (a resource that only drops from in-game alerts and specific Sabotage missions). DE "fixed" this in the next patch by reducing the amount to 7,000 Oxium, though Cryotic and Nitain stayed the same. However, as someone who just very recently spent hours getting even half that amount of Oxium, and who has spent hours in the past trying to get Prime parts with pitifully low drop rates, I am not at all thrilled by this prospect.\n\nSo, naturally I'm just going to spend money to get that stuff instantly instead of spending hours (possibly even full days worth of time) trying to get what I want.\n\nWell....no. It's actually pushed me in the other direction. I'm not going to quit just because there are a small handful of items with ridiculous crafting requirements. I can live without Vauban Prime and without the Sibear (and I unfortunately already have the Grattler). What I am afraid of is that this game's crafting requirements will keep increasing at this ridiculous rate, and I can guarantee you, if it does, I will stop playing this game. I have already vowed to myself that I will not be buying an Platinum with the game in it's current state.\n\nA side note, more to DE than the players, I am actually okay with Vauban Prime requiring so much Nitain, as Nitain is tied to alerts, and Vauban's non-prime variant is also tied heavily to alerts. It makes sense, and ties that alert-exclusivity back into the frame. The Nitain in conjunction with the other unreasonably high requirements, however, is too much, and almost appears player - or at least new player - hostile.\n\nFor new players interested in starting Warframe: only do so if you are either willing to spend hours upon hours doing the same mission over and over again to collect resources for crafting, are prepared to spend tens and possibly even hundreds of dollars on in-game content, or expect not to get new content for the game until long after it comes out. (Which, admittedly, isnt' a terrible option, there are still a good number of good weapons that don't have ridiculous requirements...yet. But several of the game's 'best' weapons have already been committed to the Prime Vault, which means you will have to spend either platinum trading for them, or money buying them direct from DE.)\n\nTL;DR - read the last paragraph.","May 18","false","731.8"," 39 of 64 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","39","64","3","4"

Many years after the fall of the Orokin, the Grineer have discovered a Warframe Cryopod. Activating the pod, Captain Vor awakens the Warframe, which you get to choose between Excalibur, Mag, or Volt. After attatching a strange device to you, a mysterious figure known as the Lotus contacts you, urging you to break free of the Grineer. You learn to use your skills and powers as you escape, up until you find the Liset and leave Earth, to strengthen your Warframe until you can defeat Vor, and regain complete control.\n\nLike all of my reviews, I'll be making a list of pros and cons. Mainly cons as much as I love this game...\n\nPros+ A well written lore, even though we don't see much of it until The Second Dream and Natah.\n+ Fun and exciting gameplay.\n+ Great customization, both in terms of cosmetics and gameplay.\n+ Warframes for almost every playstyle.\n+ Good voice acting, for the few characters who are.\n+ A large selection of weapons to choose from,\n+ Well optimized. Looks good even on the lowest options.\n+ Great designs.\n+ The community is mostly helpful and kind, as long as you avoid certain areas. While randoms aren't usually terrible, I reccomend playing with friends.\n+ A good soundtrack.\n+ A large amount of content.\n\nCons- Tons of grinding. This isn't a bad thing for some, but it is for many.\n- Many of the Warframes are terrible to obtain. We now have two Warframes locked behind an alert-only resource, one locked behind RNG, another behind high-level content. This ruins the whole "frame for every playstyle" idea.\n- Many weapons and frames aren't good at high level content, making it hard for some people to enjoy those if their favorite frame/weapon aren't one of those.\n- The community is toxic in some areas, mainly Trading, PVP, and Draco.\n- The support is terrible. If you manage to get someone good, it's not bad, but most of the time you get the same terrible people.\n- Weapon balance is poor and most of them don't scale well.\n- RNG is TERRIBLE. Doing a hard mission for a long time and getting barely any good rewards can ruin a lot. Damn Nyx Prime Chassis...\n- The devs tend to add more content instead of fixing it. Hydroid, Mag, and other frames are broken or nerfed to hell\n- The only way to get high level gear is to do high level missions, but to get through those high level missions you need the good gear you get from those missions, leading to a never ending cycle of pain\n- Trading is terrible. Many people refund platinum and can get you banned, making it risky.\n- Bad enemy scaling.\n- Bosses are either too easy or bullet sponges.\n\nFINAL VERDICT6/10\nAverage, but fun.\n\nI reccomend this to anyone who loves sci-fi, co-op, games with large content, or anyone who wants a few hundred hours of fun. I cannot reccomend it to anyone who hates any of the above, and despises grinding.\nIt's a fun game that gets worse at it goes, depending on what you enjoy.","January 5","true","524.3"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","20","29","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolffstamps/recommended/230410/","Wolffstamps","Wilk [Curator]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolffstamps/","233 products in account","After well over 600 hours into this near perfect game, I have decided to complete a review.\nGraphics\nThe graphics in Warframe are absolutely stunning for a F2P game, even if it would be a Pay2Play game, it would still be jaw-dropping. However, in Warframe, you could play on med-high setting and still get 60+fps while getting an amazing experience making you feel as if you're going at max speed on a rollercoaster, completely dazed. Although the older computers might not be able to play the game on med-high settings, they'll still have a similar adventure during their game-time because of a smart move by DE (Digital Extremes aka the devs of Warframe) which just adds so much actions taking place at the same time, you won't have enough time to spot a graphic you might not want. In Warframe, you can turn on Nvidia PhysX effects (as long as you have an Nvidia card) for the best experience coupled with max settings while having 45-60fps.\n\nGameplay\nIn this game, the tedious amount of farming required to earn an item you really want to craft is just unbelievable! Although I didn't mind farming the other 50+ hours for some little things, I was completely enraged when I realized I spent around 10 hours trying to get a single blueprint part for a warframe ( a full warframe is made of: systems blueprint, a helmet blueprint, chassis blueprint, warframe blueprint and a random material). But in the end I did find the part that I needed, however I gave up trying once I traded for another part and couldn't find any more parts. So apart from farming, the gameplay is extremely well done. It comes with around 8 PvE gamemodes and the other 2 gamemodes are PvP. So far there's only 2 gamemodes I and a whole part of the community didn't enjoy. The first one being called Spy 2.0 (DE remade the 'Spy' missions to produce what they thought to be a better gamemode), you basically become a hacker who has to find 3 (usually it's 3) different objectives that are in vault rooms, but the player(s) have to find a way inside them, the enemy faction could destroy the current objective if the tenno are spotted. The second gamemode which wasn't that great was Excavation. There's this massive machine which digs into the ground for minerals while you have to defend it from damage and also keep it's power up by killing enemies, however, there is only one type of enemy which drops the power cells. Apart from all of that nonsense, you could create weapons ,sentinels, companions, Clan Dojo's and tons more. If you want even more of the game, just join a clan, craft a key to get inside their Dojo (clan HUB type of area) and find their foundry rooms for even more blueprints!\n\nMaps\nWarframe is absolutely amazing with maps! The whole map will never be the same since it is always randomly generated using a bunch of different tilesets. In the maps there are usually secrets that don't always pay-off finding them, but if you want time to go by quick, try to find a few in a mission, it'll give you credits and sometimes materials. The tilesets are very fun to try and parkour around once you know them well, especially the Grineer (an enemy faction) ones.In the Orokin Void there's some new traps, obstacles and secrets, same goes with all the other tilesets. Other than that there's not really that much to say.\n\nPay2Win or Play2Win?\nIn Warframe, there's two currencies, Credits and Platinum. You can get credits for just playing the game, but can also get platinum as a daily reward (around 20). Every player starts with 50 plat. You could pay for nearly anything in the game using platinum, including more slots for Warframes or weapons, speeding up items that are being built, and use it to trade. A daily reward is also a coupon that can even give you -75% the normal price of platinum, so you could buy the most amount of platinum (3000 if I remember correctly) for only around 100 of whatever currency you use (WAY less than half price!). So you can go the easy route and pay your way to the games core, or just get free stuff as you go along, which is one of the best things I've ever seen in a game!\n\nPros and Cons\nGood things:\nThe graphics are  extremely well done for a FreeToPlay game. I play on max settings with 60 fps.\nWith the new combat system (Combat 2.0) this game feels like you're actually swinging your weapon and doing something.\nTons of warframes to unlock, tons of weapons to unlock, a wide range of companions, all of which you can customise to your demise.\nIt has a nice challenge (at least when you're new or farming exp points for something) since the levels increase as you go along.\nOnce you've done all of the missions (200+), there's Nightmare mode and Alerts, plus Quests.\nYou won't get bored easily, all you need is a clan (I would suggest Lightning Claw).\nThe parkour is almost Assassin's Creed level! You can wallrun , jump really far, and do awesome manoeuvres.\nThe map is 100% randomised every single time, using tilesets, DE have made self-generated maps.\nThere's secrets. These secrets are worth your time, I won't tell you anything else about them...\nYou can get into a clan, do to it's Clan Dojo and actually look what's inside it.\nWhat if I told you,Clan Dojos are all made by players and YOU could do it too?\nYou can get Platinum (paid currency) for free as a daily reward.\nIt has won multiple awards.\nThe community is amazing.\nThere's always that one thing you desperately need.\nSo much damn updates\nEpic developers\nThe developers give out free Platinum every stream\nYou can get Platinum as a daily reward\nWorkshop support\nController support\nKeyboard support\nMouse support\nIn-depth options menu settings\nToo many mods to use\nToo many mods to collect\nToo many mods to trade\nTrading support\n\n\nCons:\nI will have to say, it can get quite tedious having to farm for hours on end.\nStarting out may be a bit harsh.\n\nFinale + Final ratings\n90 of 100 ~ Wolff-a-critic\n95 of 100 of potential free content\n92.5 of 100 reason to download Warframe\n\nSo I would give this game an easy recommendation, no question needed... unless you don't have time to grind, or don't like playing games much, or are very busy.\n\nAny questions?

The only thing platinum allows you to do is get things faster and easier.\n\nOne of Warframe's highpoints is that it's easy to jump right in, play a quick 3 minute mission with (Up to four) friends, and jump right back out. You can spend a few minutes playing, and that few minutes might change into a few hours, but it might not.\n\nThe user interface has traded a bit of functionality for looks, but when I say it traded, it got a LOT of looks out of the deal. It's quite the knockout of a UI, visually.\n\nDigital Extremes themselves are a good company. They listen well to the community, and try to find a middle ground between pleasing the playerbase, and making the game into the vision of what they want it to be. As of recent updates they appear to be pushing back much needed bug and balancing issue fixes in favor of new content, but hopefully that will slow down and they will realize that this game, is not only their baby, but a giant chunk of software that needs polishing. It might be their baby, but currently their baby is a little bit under the weather and they refuse to buy cold medicine. But this is understandable. They are excited to make their game.\n\nThe game is a timewaster, and can be addictive (As my in-game hours show), but it can also be played casually, though progress will be slower. There are no paywalls, and finding a match is fairly easy. There are tons of characters and weapons and even companions to choose from, and you will find no shortage of fun to be had, so long as you take care not to burn yourself out. The level designs get repetetive after a while, but new tilesets are added often, and enemies will become a challenge very quickly until you can equip yourself well enough to be the warrior-god you were meant to be. Enemies will again become a challenge in later levels.\n\nThe biggest gripe reviewers have (I'm looking at you IGN) about Warframe is its lack of a story, plot, lore, and quests. Quests are a recently added feature that is so far a bit underdeveloped, but has amazing potential. Often reviewers ask "What exactly is the point of this game? What objective are you trying to reach?" And the simple answer is, there is no objective. The game is there for fun, and fun alone. The fun of slaughtering hordes of enemies with a single blade, blowing up a battalion of troops with a rocket launcher, and then using an ability to stomp so hard you literally FREEZE TIME. The fun of being a powerful slaughterfactory that cant be stopped (Until you reach later levels).\n\nWarframe is, overall, a good game. It has a nice grimdark feel, interesting character designs, a responsive and involved developer, and is being constantly updated and reshaped. Being critical, I would have to give it an 8/10. Should the developers get some content fixes out, I'd give it a 9/10. So grab a few buddies, grab your trusty Skana, and go kill some Grineer!","September 30, 2014","true","217.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I mean as a new player the skills and stuff mean very little And the only way to test it all out and find your Niche' is to play the different character types.\n\nWith alot of game where you have to pay for certain in Game items you know from the get go guys who have cash to blow will get the best and the rest of us meer mortals with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Exchange rates will be stuck with the scraps... Warframe gives you the option to jump ahead with Paid content but everyone can get there eventually.\n\nNo items that are Platinum(in game real money Currency) only that can not be found or made later.\nIts all just a matter of time and according to some higher level friends you can actually start trading platinum at a later stage.\n\nOverall i love the game a bit of a rocky start but well worth it.\n\n","November 6, 2014","true","409.8"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","3"

However, there's a reason why this is still in beta. After playing for a week or two you'll see that pretty much all the missions are quite similar. Sure there are different ones like Extermination and Survival, but most of them end in getting the task done and then running back to "Extraction". Also, this game is a complete grindfest. The Devs put up ridiculous prices so you either have to buy the item or you have to grind for DAYS in order to get it. However, if you do get your item, it usually takes days for it to be ready. A new warframe takes THREE DAYS. THREE! And you need three components (which all take a day each to build) in order for you to move on to the main blueprint (takes 3 days to build). So this game emphasizes on you either having money or time. But yeah, not much content or backstory either. I seems interesting enough, but it's so vague.

I've come back to this game countless times when other F2Ps went bad. Digital Extremes is certainly interested in more than just profit, but in my honest opinion, that's certainly always debatable. For now, I'll go over the game and the company behind it.\n\nGameplay\nWarframe's gameplay, at its core, is quite fluid. You can cut enemies to bits with your melee weapons, shoot them apart with ranged weapons, and even approach a situation with stealth. However, exploration is fairly painful at best. At its worst, well, I've had moments of rage inducing issues with exploring the map as it currently is.\n\n\nControls\nThe controls respond quite well, and you get used to them within the hour. The way you move through your environment depends on how you wish to traverse it. Simply running across terrain, wall running or climbing to get to high places or past distance gaps in the floor, or even the new Bullet Jump system that has been implemented to get more distance.\n\nHowever, I would like to note that there are some ways to quickly traverse short distance simply using a rolling double jump or a roll slide. Having played this game for so long, playing catch-up with your more experienced allies is unenjoyable at best, so memorize this: Tap shift, and immediately hit control. Or tap shift and immediately jump. It covers distance quite nicely.\n\nVariety\nThe weapon variety in this game is absolutely rediculous! Why is it rediculous? Because there's over 150 weapons in the game! Including "Primed" versions". There are over 30 different frames as well, also including "Primed versions".\n\nThe weapons go from automatic rifles like the Dera and Braton to powerful shotguns like the Tigris and Hek, to explosive-launchign pistols such as the Angstrum and Kulstar, to even whipes and blades such as the Lecta whip and Gram heavy sword.\n\nWarframes provide very interesting choices as well. I've found myself enjoying Rhino Prime for his ability to soak up alot of damage. While other frames do it better, his abilities on display help him outshine others. I find myself using his Iron Skin with the Iron Shrapnel augment, which basically makes him a human claymore. His ultimate ability, "Rhino Stomp", also initially named "Radial Stomp" suspends enemies in a form of stasis, stick in the air. Jopkingly I've called it "Hammer Time".\n\nMods\nMods are indeed in the game, but not as game modifcations like one would expect. Instead, they are cards you can use to increase the performance or your weapons, warframe, sentinel and/or Kubrow. You can get mods that increase helath, shields and armor, mods for powers, status effects and durations, and mods for mobility. Weapons have plenty of interesting mods to make for very fun builds, if making custom weapon builds is a preference you have.\n\nYou can even make a rocket launcher a silent weapon with the use of a sound supression mod. Warframes can also get syndicate and Conclave-locked mods known as "Augment Mods", which add a bonus effect or power to each Warframe ability, however there isn't a mod for all 4 for any of the Warframes yet. Having said all of this, weapon and character variety is certainly not in shortage.\n\nDigital Extremes\nDigital Extremes has been a standard to which I have judged most Free to Plays that have come out thus far. They put time and effort into their work. More than most companies ever do as a matter of fact. However, as this is a free to play game, like any company running a free to play, they must have a way to make profit. They do so with a very fair model. Almost everything in the gam,e can be gotten without paying a dime if you don't go merchantile. The only things that can be purchased specifically with Platinum, the premium currency,\n\nWhile the company has always been a ccused of questionable actions, Their handling of situations has gone fairly well. Being honest to their players and giving all the information they can to keep the community in the loop with them. They also do this through their weekly thursday night Prime Time streams, as well as their bi-weekly Friday afternoon Devstreams, which give out free 1000 Platinum rtewards during each of the aforementioned Devstreams.\n\n\nComplaints\nLike any othe rgame, perfection is always the big lie. I'll put up my complaints with the various parts of the game to let you all know what you possibly may deal with.\n\n1. Repitition\n\nThis is the biggest problem in the game so far. Repitition. You'll likely burn out before you make enough progress to be content is you always use the same weapons and Warframe. For this reason, variety is deeply encouraged, so make sure to grow your arsenal of equipment as much as you can.\n\n2. Balance and Effect\n\nThis is a massive problem, not about weapons, but about the Warframes. Some are clearly well-designed for their purpose, while others, having been the first designed for that purpose are outshined by others. Mag gets my attention here, as her ability to perform anything in the game is continually dewbuffed to being next to worthless. Hydroid and one or two other frames suffer from this issue as well, reducing their worth to little more the Master Experience fodder.\n\n3. The Map\n\nI've complained about this once, and I'll do it again. This thing is a nightmare to navigate. The only thing they so far have done to improve it is a full-on map layout to see where you're going a little more. However, the issue of vertical detection on the map is still a fairly large problem, as it does not separate floor by flor. I already mentioned the idea of making a Metroid Prime-esque map system to replace the current one, but so far as I know, it remains on the back burner instead of where things are in need of adjustment.\n\n4. The Grind.\n\nGood GODS the grind. This is a traumatic experience at best, anbd most likely where you'll burn out while trying to collect prime parts and just give up. While DE claims to be trying to lessen the grind, I fail to see that. In fact, I see the exact opposite happening here, as well as in certain other place with Warframe, in addition to nerfing certain mods, certain powers, and never certain guns that need it. This is where the game flops from a 7 story building flat on its face. While not anywhere worse than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from Firefall or Spiral Knights, it's still arguably frustrating from time to time if not often.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nMy thoughts on the game vary, but as you can see from my collective hours, I certainly lean more toward recommending it, if not a bit hesitantly.\n\n8.5 Weapon/character/pet variety\n9.0 Gun/swordplay\n10 Movement fluidity\n4.0 Replayability\n100% Free to play, as advertised.\n\nOverall, I'd give Warframe an 8 out of 10.

If you aren't used to the games parkour, speed tricks, and moving while fighting mechanics, some of the higher end players doing lower level missions will simply leave you in the dust and not look back, completing the mission themselves, leaving you sort of an empty experience with the mission.\n\nThe most intimidating thing about the game is its parkour system though, being able to move at extreme speeds, wall running, climbing and vaulting just about anything, sliding while unleashing a torrent of melee attacks or gun fire, and using it all to your advantage. Give it some time, after a couple of hours practicing it can start to become second nature, especially anyone used to combo based games. But in the end when you are feel confident about your ability to do it all, nothing feels more badass then executing a series of attacks while sliding and moving through waves of enemies quickly and efficiently, and being able to turn around when all is said and done to see some of their bodies still falling to the ground.\n\nAnd come on, whats better then being a freaking space ninja with guns.","April 7, 2015","true","646.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

I spent a while trying to sum it up with a genre but it borrows from several. Mass Effect with jumping! It's a third person shooter/brawler that puts you in the role of a Tenno, a nearly extinct race awaking to find several factions ruining the galaxy and various shenanigans occuring that are for your detriment. Going on missions in various space stations, ships and planets using tons of weapons and warframes in a free2play game that looks and plays like a current gen AAA game.\n\n+ Good Graphics & Sound Design\n+ Large amound of varied enemies, unique styles and boss battles.\n+ Procedurally generated maps with dozens of tile sets.\n+ Very satisfying gunplay and indepth melee combat/combo system.\n+ Fantastic replay value.\n+ Hundreds of weapons covering all different categories and type & Plenty of warframes to get with very unique abilities.\n+ Decent story and universe created.\n+ F2P\n\n- Lack of direction to new players after initial quests.\n- Late game can slowly get repetetive.\n- Minor inconveniences to be had if not spending any real money.\n- PvP is currently Peer2Peer and very laggy with no tangible rewards for putting time into it.\n- A lot of mechanics go unexplained unless you actively check the codex/wiki.\n\n\nIn essence you are able to progress through hundreds of missions that are instanced for up to 4 players in a squad, completing random objectives in procedurally generated maps against one of the 5 possible enemy factions (or sometimes a combination!) This is a solid formula, with a lot of different planet/map tilesets, a ton of very well crafted rooms and a very hefty roster of enemies for each of the main faction. Combine this with the hundreds of weapons you can craft (varying from pistols to grenade launchers to crossbows to electric boomerangs to rail guns), 20+ warframes (classes with very unique 4 abilities, akin to a MOBA) to choose from, a very good looking engine and some solid gunplay/melee combat and you've got a fantastic game in it's own right. You level up and upgrade all of your gear with mods that drop from enemies constantly, so everyone can tailor their weapons and warframe to their own liking and you do get a very solid sense of progression. You can parkour around the maps, wall run, pull of some complex melee combos and act like a space ninja, or you can be moving from cover to cover, co-ordinating with your team and playing it through like a tactical third person shooter.\n\nIt has a very good looking engine that stands up by todays standards depiste the game being nearly 3 years old (counting the closed beta) It's got a godly particle system, as well as full usage of PhysX, very cool looking units and maps and a consistent art style throughout. The sound design is very competent but the music stands out the most, there are several dynamic sound tracks when fighting each of the factions that change depending on how much combat is happening but they all sound very unique and cool to listen to in the middle of some hectic shenanigans.\n\nThe kicker being that this is completely free to play. This is a hybrid co-op/MMO without the 1-9 button smashing on the keyboard and it relies entirely on your skill with the weapons, abilities and movement to be good. It being a F2P MMO esque game, you do have to craft new weapons and warframes which take time but due to how inherently fun the actual gameplay is, farming for materials or blueprints never feels like a chore and 99% of the time you'll be collecting more than enough materials just while playing normally. There's a ton of PvE mission types, some new PvP, horde modes, a space combat mode (think zone of the enders) and plenty of replay value inbetween.\n\nThere are several story quests and tutorial missions to all new players a grasp on all of the basic mechanics however once the tutorials are over you are just sort of left to your own devices. The lack of constant direction might annoy a few players but I strongly reccomend just deciding that you want to go and check out a planet or get a cool weapon then work toward those goals, seeing new things and acquiring more equipment on the way. Planets have bosses, new planets need to be unlocked and so on so there are tangible goals to set yourself. You can create a clan with your friends, build a very large Dojo that can be used for trading, researching exclusive weaponry, dueling, storing event trophies as well as assisting in building solar rails for the very large scale PvP solar rail conflicts.\n\nI would reccomend if you're really into it getting just a few dollars worth of platinum then buying a scarf, they're cool, because it's in space.","February 9, 2015","true","859.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Unfortunately, every patch (and there's about 4/week) makes the game even worse.  It's been out for almost a year, and I don't think a single bug has ever been addressed, while every patch brings a whole host of new bugs; most minor, some major.\n\nThe netcode is terrible.  There are no dedicated servers, instead relying on one of the four players to host.  It seeks out the absolute worst host imagineable for every game.  When I play with friends it's fine, but about 9/10 times you play with the public the lag is so bad as to render the game as unplayable.\n\nThe game frequently refuses to accept certain inputs.  It's fairly common to just be plain unable to use your melee weapon, or be unable to crouch for several games.\n\nBosses occasionally become completely invincible.\n\nDid I mention the lag?  It's bad.  I don't just mean there's lots of snap back, and targets become impossible to hit; I'm talking extended intervals (i.e. double-digit minutes) where it's so bad you have trouble leaving the room you're currently in.\n\nThe variety of weapons started out as neat, unfortunately they've increased the grind factor needed to get them every day.\n\nThis is the rare case of a an early Beta game being pretty fantastic, but absolutely every change they've made since then has been for the worse.  I would pay money for the Warframe of 8 months ago.  I wouldn't pay $0.01 for the Warframe of today.","February 14, 2014","false","734.6"," 33 of 54 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","33","54","0","1"

I've asked if spending realy money is the way to progress properly and naturally of course the people at end game who "have it all say no and was referred to a "beginnner's guide" wiki.  Took a look into that, yes I had been using mods and amplifying the ones i found useful.  Playing online with either people that have or are in end game and that can craft all warframes is definitely a massive margin progression.  It's as clear as night and day when a starter using only what's provided as opposed to someone leveling a freshly made warframe of calibur 5 to 10x greater than what a new player would start with.  Was tempted to buy platinum from the ingame shops, then I quickly realized, that in this game money = power.  Cash shops in other games don't "make you stronger" if you choose to buy in.\n\nIn addition to only having one chance on an account to make a permanent starting decision?  I don't have to mention the name of the game when I ask others if a decision so early in the game should be permanent.  Especially on the PS4, no one's farming for parts of a new warframe within the first 20-40 hours of game play.  The obvious answer is to "buy" Platinum if you're not happy with the warframe you started with.\n\nSo if you're looking for an online shooter, that's different.  Yup it's here.  If you're coming in with the thought that an online game will have decent natural progression...yea about that...I can name a game that was the most anticipated this decade that many would say is a flop/mistake that does that better than this...BUT, if free is where you are and strive for to make the best of a game, give it a shot.  It's not a total, complete circle of a turn off.

There are always glitches, bugs, and issues that accrue the ire of many players, but DE (the company behind Warframe) is next to always on top of releasing patches.\n\nWarframe, in a brief nutshell, is a space-age, sci-fi ninja hack-and-slash with an intriguing storyline (the "prequel" to Warframe is Dark Sector) where the Tenno - the race every player is - has been pushed back into the Void, and has only recently come back to find the Sol System in the middle of a three-way war between the militaristic and brutish Grineer, the greedy and technological Corpus, and the overwhelming numbers of the Infested. The Tenno's role in this game is to bring balance back to the Sol System by assassinating key personell from all sides who threaten galactic stability.\n\nGameplay-wise, Warframe is - at the time of this review - very "grind-y", such as other MMORPGs. To level up, one has to fight the enemy, collect resources (a drop from enemies or by releasing a Titan Extractor to systems), collect modifications (a drop from enemies) and clear planetary systems (usually by defeating the boss). Weapons are unlocked via purchasing blueprints and crafting them with one's gained resources, and one must also have the appropriate "mastery rank" (on paper, your overall player level separate from weapon levels, Warframe levels, and sentinel levels), which is leveled up by leveling up Warframes and weapons.\n\nWeapon-wise, combat feels visceral and satisfying, for the most part. Some weapons have become outdated while some have begun to shine. The Warframe you control determines how fast, how well-armored, and what powers the players has, with a general rule that caster-classes have low shields, health, and armor, but possess potent powers, and fighter-classes have high health, shields, and armor, but have less powerful abilities than casters.\n\nThere IS a real-world currency market in place, but 99% of the items sold there can be made/found by playing the game itself. The 1% of items not found are purely cosmetic, such as color schemes and syndanas (capes). The real-world currency to game currency ratio, in this author's opinion, is quite unbalanced, however. 75 platinum (the game currency) is $5 USD, with bonus platinum being awarded depending on how much one purchases in one transaction (for example, 180 platinum is gained from $10 USD; 150 being from the $10, and a 30 platinum bonus).\n\nWarframe is able to be played alone, but is much more enjoyable and beneficial with friends or a clan. With a moderate amount of startup resources, one can start their own clan, or can simply join a preexisting clan to save resources. Clans offer clanmates to join games with a player, clan technology (which offers high-end weaponry), and miscellaneous activities, such as 1 v 1 PvP in a dueling arena, trading, and obstacle courses.\n\nFinally, Warframe has a dedicated forums page to report bugs, meet with potential clan members, introduce yourself, make suggestions, offer feedback, or generally just shoot the breeze with fellow players.\n\nPROS:\n+Multiplayer with clanmates or friends is enjoyable and practical\n+Everything save for cosmetics can be obtained without real money\n+Solid swordplay, gunplay, and Warframe powers\n+Complex damage system which promotes a well-coordinated squad and a variety in weapons\n+Many side activities\n+Many graphics settings can be changed, so lower-end PC users don't have to worry as much\n+Forums have a decent, active community\n\nCONS:\n-Prone to glitches and bugs after major updates, but are rectified quickly\n-Playing solo can be tough at higher levels and bosses\n-Real currency to game currency is at an uneven ratio\n-Damage system can take some time to learn and master\n-Grinding for resources can be a bore at times","December 5, 2013","true","366.1"," 28 of 45 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","28","45","0","5"

It can be a bit of a grind getting everything you need to get that new frame or weapon that was just released but again, when played with a bunch of friends and you combine your missions for everything you team wants to get, it is a tonne of fun.\nI think they are getting a bit complex now - but the devs have always done an awesome job of not only adding new content but making sure that they can please their fan base while trying to enlarge it.  The Live dev streams are also pretty cool. If you get into it, you will probably spend more money on this free to play than any other title you ever bought outright.

Most companies are down for sitting around on their latest update like "Yeah we did a good job" Meanwhile at warframe HQ the dev team is like "DONE THIS UPDATE, GOTTA MAKE A NEW ONE, GO GO GO"\n\nThe game feels so good, plays smooth as (shaved) balls. Everything feels good to do, and even if it bugs out a bit, its generally entertaining to some degree (EG. flying off walls at hyperspeed)\n\nDownsides? Honestly not many, Im sure computer strength can be a major issue, but its fairly good for the most part, mid grade computers should be fine at like 20 fps on reasonable settings. While it is possible to play this game free, and nearly everything is obtainable without paying (even many cosmetic stuff) It does take quite a long time. The further you get in the game and the more time you invest, the less this becomes a problem. Anyways, it is VERY easy to spend WAY too much on this game, Im sure Ive spent hundreds on this (yes yes, I feel the shame). Also, inventory slots are platinum manditory, however you can get platinum from others in game, selling recipes for stuff like formas and such. You will need inventory slots if you want to have more than a small handful of warframes at your disposal at one time, or weaponry.\n\nLong story short, lots of fun, watch your wallet, its tempting, so so tempting.","June 13, 2014","true","624.4"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

Warframe is a great game, at first it may seem P2W, (Pay to win) but over time you'll come to realize that any item in the market, can be earned without platinum. (Warfrmaes premium Currency.) Warframe has very fast paced, intense and fun third-person combat that still doesn't feel repetative to me, you play it stealthy when doing hostage rescues and spy missions, or you gun or slash anything in your way in an exterminate mission. That brings me to my next point: The mission variety! There are spy, mobile defence, survival, defense, interception and deception, to name a few. Each mode is varied enough for each mission to feel exiting and fresh even after the hundredth mission completion. There many more cool features in Warframe, the factions are cool and interesting, there is a good 4-player co-op, great characters, fun and interesting guns and even a multiplayer mode that I've yet to delve into. Overall I believe warframe is a addictive fun game with a great community. I would give Warframe a solid 8/10. Very good but still needs improvement, Digital Extremes are great developers who constantly update their game and show that they care about Warframe and the people who play it. I hope this helps you decide on whether or not to get Warframe.(It's free who cares!)

Are you a fan of Monster Hunter?  Then I would HIGHLY recommend giving Warframe a shot.  This game is the best of both worlds, bringing difficulty and fun gear collection to the forefront of free-to-play games without requiring any money to be spent, contrary to popular belief!\n\n// First Glance //\nAfter delving into the deeper aspects of what this game has to offer I am without a doubt mesmerized by its beauty and presentation.  The overall design and scale of this game has been a welcoming experience -- as I am tired of most games lately, the same cut and paste formula used from one game unto another.  Yes, Warframe is based loosely upon the sci-fi genre but the way Digital Extremes has gone about creating this particular universe and breaking the mold of every other sci-fi game has been much appreciated on my end.  The strange and unusual that pushes others away from this game has drawn me closer and given me the desire to learn more about its unique direction.\n\n// Key Aspects //\nThis game has a lot to offer.  I will admit that I was one of the original beta testers that walked away after closed beta.  The fact that the game only had two different ”tile sets” and lacked content was an immediate turn off.  But now after returning many months after my last login I find the game has grown substantially, thanks to the community-developer relationship, which in respect has gained a lot of traction due to the various features that keep veterans from the community and development team going.  What this game has to offer is, simply boundless, once you've peered through the veil.\n\n280+ procedurally generated missions, which include:\n•  Standard Missions\n•  Alert Missions (randomly generated location and reward)\n•  Infestation Missions (guaranteed reward)\n•  Invasion Missions (guaranteed reward x3)\n•  Challenging Boss Fights\n•  Void Missions (private instances, earned via key drops)\n•  Orokin Derelict Missions\n•  Nightmare Mode\n\nThen we have character progression:\n•  Limitless ways to customize your warframe via mods\n•  Limitless ways to customize your weapons via mods\n•  Clans and Clan Hall building\n•  Clan Research for clan specific gear/materials\n\nAnd with each patch there is a special event that takes place, something big and eventful that ties into the lore and awards players with unique gear that can no longer be collected after the event has ended.  Talk about gratifying.\n\n// Pitfalls //\nThe only drawback I see this game having is with people and their lack of patience.  (If you've made it this far into my review then by all means get to downloading!)  It should be mentioned that most crafted items need to take 12-72 hours (in real time).  Also, using revives is limited.  You can only carry a set amount of revives and when you’re out, you’re out; until you gain another one (one per 24 hours).  On the flipside, ALL gear and warframes can be attained through gameplay and the only things platinum (real money) need to be used for is additional weapon slots, warframe slots and aesthetic items.  Earning platinum through the game is easy as well, selling rare mods to other users is an easy way to attain this currency in order to make the small purchases you need to maintain your collection of warframes and weapons.  Therefore, real money from your wallet is not required.\n\n** To help alleviate confusion while playing keep this Warframe wiki[warframe.wikia.com] close by.\n\n// Understanding //\nFrom the moment my friends log out, I find it interesting how the community in this game thrives.  Aside from the “Recruiting” chat channel (to enter hidden zones with a pre-formed party) there is little to no communication between users.  It’s as if there is an unspoken language between those who have survived the tutorial and beginner missions.  Experienced players in most missions have zero communication and there is a strong sense of synergy, as if role-playing our speechless Tenno comes with the experience and territory.\n\n// Conclusion //\nI feel most people overlook this game by the sheer fact that their first experience was miserable and they didn’t take the time to give this game an honest chance.  From the surface it’s overly complicated and doesn’t hold your hand.  But for those who carry on, that is the draw… that is the appeal.  Set your own goals and the game will become very rewarding.  What are you waiting for?\n\nMasterful Tenno persevere, while the inept are left to drown.","February 4, 2014","true","672.6"," 34 of 57 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","34","57","0","13"

I personally don't enjoy it all that much but that is not why I am not recomending the game.\n\nI am not recomending the game because of the herendous attitude of the Warframe community. I have had awful experiences with warframe players they think that just because you don't know how to do every little small specific thing to get a thing (weapon, warframe, kubro, trade, etc) that your some sort of mentally impaired child. Of course not all of them are like that but if you want to chat with any hardcore veterans oh you better be a good player or they will just pass you off as an idiot.\n\nI have had this experience before in other smaller communities ever gone to play an old game and ask questions about how to do something just to get insulted? Personally that happens all the time to me.\n\nOh and there is all of this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGuwE_0j1d8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCY1JyQOh4o\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B1Dk7lTIJ0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIPzhJnJDOM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GH7xv673Qw\n\nWhat you will see in this collection of videos is the wonderful Warframe player and partner (sarcasm) mogamu who threatened another Warframe player's youtube channel in mogamu's words he was going to make him "dissapear" by using the dev team and other youtubers he plays with to take down RevXdev's channel.\n\nI tried to find an official statement about this from the Warframe development team and I could find nothing. Now I am not a fan of RevXdev I only just found out about the guy but he shows some real damning evidence that Digital Extremes does not care about your comitment to the game or how much you have spent. I hope this guy is able to share his evidence with a greater audience which is partly why  I am writting this review. He only gets a few thousand views per video which is why he has not really caused a storm yet but hopefully he will be able to bring attention to it.\n\nI can't play a game where a dev team wants to ban someone just to silence them as it seems from all of this evidence.\n\nEdit:\n\nI forgot to mention that this game is going to be deleted from my computer I can't stand the sight of it.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI just checked Mogamu's channel after seeing a comment that his subs are falling and that amazing 200k mark he keeps boasting about is gone. Glad to see this information is getting to people.\n\nEdit 3:\n\nI see a lot of people accusing RevXdev of being a Bigot. Now I don't personally think he is but even if he is what does that have to do with the issues in question?\n\nEdit 4\n\nThis review has become more popular then I thought it would. I think it is important now that I mention I do not hate anyone who supports this game or plays this game the review is meant to inform people that there are instances of accounts being terminated for odd and sometimes asinine reasons even if they are loyal players.","February 16","false","79.9"," 34 of 57 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","34","57","6","5"

While not every gamer's taste, I find Warframe to be a refreshing take on design.  The characters and aliens are unique, very inspired and striking.  My compliments to the art direction and the whole team.  The gameplay is tight, responsive and franciticly exciting giving the player the experience of feeling like they're a true "space ninja".  You'll be parkouring over obstacles, climbing on walls, hacking apart enemies and sliding across floors while going all "John Woo" on anyone that stands between your teams and your objective, Ninja.\n\nI've found myself coming back to this game over and over again ever since a friend got me into it way back in June 13'.  As of today, I've already spend hundreds of hours in Warframes.  Game sessions can be as pick up and play as a half hour or turn into longer survival and raids.\n\nIts one of the most open to all FTP's out there.  Paying players don't overwhelm the F2P players in the gameplay department.  They just don't have to spend the time gathering and crafting those items.  All of which can be easily found in the game and created with miniumal grind time compared to how many other F2P's work.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trueese/recommended/230410/","trueese","Trueese","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trueese/","175 products in account","I've played this game for a LONG while now. I love ninjas and slaughtering my enemies. This game gives both of that to me. I have always been a huge fan of third person shooters. And 'Warframe' gives me the extra boost that I need to be on the top of every game. I mean come on, I'm sure those of you who want to see how AWESOME your character looks while your slaughtering your enemies. I mean, a game just doesn't feel right if I don't look cool, right?\n\nAnyways, this game does not really have a story yet and I still love the game, I have spent a lot of money on the game even when you aren't required to. I put this one aspect of the game on the top of this list because the game is not P2W (Pay to Win) and that is the main reason I have stuck to this game for so long. You can craft everything in this game, the warframes, the guns, the ammo and health packs. I mean you don't have to spend money aside from if you want to have more than 2 warframes or if you want an awesome looking cape or scarf that has absolutely no attributes. But, you can buy every gun and every cape and so on. But you can craft it, it may take around 12-24 hours or if you're looking at warframes it adds up to 3 days but you can wait, trust me. Also, if you aren't looking to collect every warframe, you'll be just fine with just 2 frames. I have only used the Frost Prime, and the Vauban. I'm stuck on those 2 frames. I have a lot of other warframes but I'm just so connected to the ones I currently have because they are EPIC.\n\nThere are some items you cannot buy. And that is what makes them so precious. They have a special name to them also, that way, you can rub it into your friends face that you finally made the weapon or warframe. The first 3 items that came out were called the Frost Prime, the Latron Prime, and the Reaper Prime. They were such a high demand, people were always asking people to take them on void runs. Which that reminds me. To have a chance to get the parts to make the weapons/warframes, you have to get Void Keys from survival missions or defence missions. (Don't worry, it will take a while, but it's definitely worth it!)\n\nThe game can sometimes get boring to me I will admit, after playing for about 3-4 hours you get tired of slaughtering your enemies because most of the time you will be farming for supplies or just surviving it out on a survival mission with your buddies. But then, you can just go play a different mission and have fun all over again! They have a variety of different mission types out there while your waiting for that storyline to come together, some like Extermination, Capture, Defence,and plenty more. The game does not make all enemies level with you, you can choose to play on a low level mission or you can choose to play on a high level mission. Each planet has its own set amount of missions all with increasing difficulty as you go along.\n\nEvery update they have had (And I will say, they update frequently.) they have added more and more content. I will tell you this, if you're tired of games having a limit on how much weapons they have on the game, then this game is the game for you. There are TONS and TONS of guns and melee weapons you can choose from, I've played for a while and I can say some guns I don't like, others I love and will use over and over.\n\nEach warframe and gun has 30 levels you can achieve. Each level, it adds a mod point that will allow you to add mods to your gun. Now, 'Call of Duty' players don't get so excited, I don't mean mods like scopes and camo, I mean mods that will change fire rate, bullet damage, bullet elemental damage, and SO MUCH more. But, now you 'Call of Duty' players can get excited for this. You can relevel your gun, why you ask? Because you get to change a mod slot to make it have a symbol on it. Now, you're wondering what does the symbol do? Well, if it matches the symbol on the mod card, it only takes up half of the points that the mod uses. It is definitely worth it to relevel a gun, especially if you plan on using that gun for a long time!\n\nI can't wait to see the storyline come together, and I can't wait to see what Warframe becomes. 10/10","January 13, 2014","true","335.0"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","1"

As in, you can either spend 3-4 days (depending on how much do you play) farming for resources to get a new Warframe (character "class") and then spend another 2-3 days building it OR you can just buy it for 20 dollars\n\nThe game does everything in its power to make you throw money at it - Want a pet? You can either farm for an egg which can drop from dens present only on one planet, usually found in quantities of 4 per mission, then you have to farm for credits and resource obtainable only in special area accessible only with a key received from several missions as a random reward, then you have to craft an item to even begin the breeding and then you have to wait 4 days before your pet matures. OR you can throw money at the game to bypass all this ♥♥♥♥. But that's not all! If you happen to not play the game for a while, your pet will die because you have to "feed" it with item that costs quite a lot of credits.\n\nThere was also a new resource introduced some time ago, which drops only from one enemy in the game that also happens to attempt suicide whenever he sees you to make you even angrier and drop money to bypass boring grind\n\nCash shop is incredibly overpriced - 40 dollars for a discounted pack with three weapons, out of which only one is "good" and a color palette (weapons in that pack also have extremely small chance of dropping from a single enemy in the game, who happens to be someone who can and more often than not will kill you before you even notice... coincidence maybe?)\n\nThose color palettes cost about 4 dollars each and there is about 10 in the store...\n\nThe game is focused on grinding and farming - if you want to play high level content you have to level up some gear and farm credits and resources to get your mastery rank up so you can then start farming resources for the good gun viable in high level missions so you can grind and farm even more to get even better weapons so you can grind all the mods and credits faster so you can repeat the whole process more effectively\n\nGame is intentionally gear based - Literally no amount of skill can help you if you don't have good gear/mods\n\nBosses are just bullet sponges with the "weakspot" mechanic\n\nDrop tables are diluted, especially when new gear comes out\n\nGames are hosted on players' computers, so expect heavy lag and common disconnects\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you enjoy doing the same boring and tedious thing over and over and over again, this game is probably for you.\nOn the other hand, if you don't like being ripped off by greedy developer, you should look somewhere else.","November 8, 2014","false","66.0"," 93 of 168 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","93","168","7","0"

It is not an average community. Many of these poor souls must freeload your keys. They shall not give you what has been promised.\n\nImmediately, after typing, at least 5 people type to me to "inv" them.\n\nI see.\n\nUnfortunately, there shall only be 4 to a squad. Thus I must tell the others the most disgraceful of words.\n\n"Sorry, full."\n\n"No Problem" they say. No problem indeed.\n\nAs I greet my squadmates, I ask them the most important of questions, the greatest test of all.\n\n"Anyone got keys?"\n\n2 reply. 1 key each. This was lucky, as I had 1, so with RNG on our side, we would soon have all 3 Mesa blueprints.\n\nBut the last man. The man so named "EmberPlayer1337", did not reply.\n\nThus I went to my navigation console, clicked "Eris", and found the mission node.\n\nI clicked it to confirm with my squadmates that I, indeed, had a key.\n\nWe decline. We do so again for the others.\n\nBut EmberPlayer1337 did not show his key. I decided to go anyway.

I expertly use my Dragon Nikana to cut down the infested in my way.\n\nThe only number that mattered was "damage dealt" in the endgame screen. I remember this.\n\nAs we all attack Alad V, we must experience the incredibly repetitive mechanics of his methods; wait around for him to toss his collar onto a fellow teammate, attack him.\n\nWe swiftly struck him down. As we near the end of the mission, I pray. I pray to all the PC gods. I pray to all the Warframe gods.\n\nAnd most importantly, I pray to RNGesus.\n\nWe acquire the first piece. Mesa Chassis.\n\nAs we queue the mission again, the same pattern happens. And before I knew it, we were done.\n\nI waited, watching, to see what we had earned.\n\nLucky again. Mesa Helmet Blueprint.\n\nThe final man used his most precious key. Again, we use the same strategies.\n\nI was so eager. We were 1 step away from the Warframe.\n\nThen, it happened. There was no Mesa Systems. There was no RNGesus smiling. For RNGesus was furious. I had angered him.\n\nMesa Helmet.\n\n"Rats" filled the squad chat as me and the others returned to our ships in shame.\n\nBut, there was still EmberPlayer1337. The man who had not spoken. He must have a key.\n\n"Sorry guys, only pieces I needed. Don't want to waste keys."\n\nThen the most evil of notifications for those getting Mesa parts.\n\n"EmberPlayer1337 has left squad."\n\nSuch is life in Warframe.","December 13, 2015","true","476.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","8","9","7","1"

Well, you do missions against the Corpus *Also known as Boxhelmets and Robots*, while siding with the Cyborg armored guys. Each mission gives a 5% chance or so, to have a "Harvester" spawn at you in another game, which if you abort, will cancel the Harvester coming at you. This Harvester once killed can drop nothing, a Detron Blueprint, a Detron Chassis, or a Detron Barrel.\n\nWhen third party programs tried to find a way to properly make the Harvester spawn easier, because of course, no confirmation of whether or not the Harvester came randomly or you had to do missions vs Corpus, Digital Extremes, the maker, took out the logs from view.\n\nLong story short, Beta is a tag, Developers are money grubbers, game is going stale, and I haven't seen a single good content addition since I joined. Every boss that gets reworked gets turned into someone with an "Invulnerability Stage" that can be teabagged 99% of the fight.\n\nMixed with glitchy parkour, bad melee, unbalanced frames, and overpriced cash shop, I'd avoid this game like the plague.

While there's a cash shop, you can buy almost everything in it with in-game credits if you're willing to do a light bit of grinding. For everything that isn't purchasable with in-game currency, you can farm in-game for the cash shop currency. Grinding is very important in Warframe. Effectively, if you wish to obtain new weapons, "Frames", or the like, you can either pay for it with the cash shop currency, or gather the materials from playing missions, pay a fee of in-game currency, then wait a few hours or days--real time, regardless of whether or not you're online--for it to finish. That said, the loot system is surprisingly fair, and it doesn't take much time to start building an arsenal of weapons and Warframes to play around with.\n\nThe storyline is fairly basic, but servicable. It's just tangible enough to help develop immersion, and that's all it attempts to do, assuming you don't think too hard about how a character can be your mortal enemy, but also simultaniously a bisected reanimated corpse, and a power hungry commander that's never seen you before.\n\nWarframe would be relatively forgettable if it didn't have its incredibly rewarding, surprisingly in depth combat system. You have access to a wide variety of weapons ranging from high tech railguns to a whip made from the spine of a feral beast coated in lethal parasitic growths. Melee combat is deep enough to stand on its own, with a variety of weapon classes, fighting styles, combos, and the built in 'mod' system which allows you to customize the your Warframe, firearms and melee weapons. Most mods are fairly generic, offering things like increased reload speed, or higher damage. However, some are more interesting, being able to change the functionality of your abilities, or, say, allowing you to replenish your "energy" when taking health damage, which adds a considerable difference to playstyle.\n\nYou have your standard parkour system with wall running, slides, cliff hanging, flips, rolls, and the like, which combined with the weaponry, and the individual abilities of each frame, results in incredibly engaging, immersive combat that supports a wide variety of playstyles.\n\nAltogether, if you're looking for a third person shooter MMO with incredibly strong gameplay, and a fairly pleasant aesthetic, and don't mind a bit of repetitive grinding, I recommend giving Warframe a try.","March 12, 2015","true","704.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","6"

Its simple but brilliant.  As long as they keep making new stuff (and the developers have been constantly cranking out quality stuff) then basically there's no level cap.  You just keep building and playing with new toys!\n\nThe developers are fantastic: super involved in the community, great sense of humor, high quality content.

Its simple but brilliant.  As long as they keep making new stuff (and the developers have been constantly cranking out quality stuff) then basically there's no level cap.

There's hardly any story to this game and it's nothing more then a "Pay to win" game since i sank too much cash into it. I think Digital Extremes should have made a proper sequel to Dark Sector which looked like it was setting up for one at the end. Unfortunately we got this crappy MMO that has very little to do with the superior Dark Sector.\n\n1: This game is extremely repetitive.\n\n2: The updates are turning into jokes.\n\n3: There are bugs everywhere.\n\nThe community is next to COD when it comes to smugness and they treat you like crap. The "dev streams" are more like sale pitches. It becomes more of a grind with each new patch and the RNG doesn't play in your favor no matter what you go after.\n\nI found that my hard earned in-game credits don't mean squat since the market only takes "Platinum" so it's not fun anymore.

This game obviously had A LOT of work put into it, which is why I do not understand why it is free. It has outstanding graphics, even on the lowest setting. However, this game in some aspects has a "pay to win" feel to it. To be able to get new items and characters in which they call "Warframes", you can either buy them with real life money, or invest immense amounts of hours into the game to get them, which isn't that bad at all because the game is really fun. The gameplay is terrific, and the given ability to free roam each individual map is superlative. Each map has different objectives, environments, and climates, whether its to the inside of an enemy ship, a snowy mountain, or some abnormal planet. If you're looking for a new game to play, that's free and not to mention fun, then Warframe is most definitely the game for you!

I have many hours in this game, with 1500+ before it was even on steam. If you have money to throw, and you don't mind being forcefully excluded from exclusive items because you can't afford it, by all means try it out.

You farm for resources, get warframes, level up, get more resources, make a better weapon, level up, and so forth. I will not go into the abusive devs, but they are abusive. Even by writing this review I have a risk of being banned. The devs HATE negative feedback. They threten to ban people for saying blank isn't good, it's bad.\n\nAn example of when I saw this was when the void trader comes to visit warframe and sells unwanted items.\n\nI would recommend this game if it didn't feel like a waste of time after getting far in the game. It looses the spark of potential when you get everything and find out there is nothing "fun" to do. When I say "fun", I mean new things that are not repeditive. The maps feel the same because they are just puzzle pieces being reused. There are too many updates in the game to fix bugs the devs should have known about. If the devs cared about the game, they would have spread out the updates to once a week at most to give time for debuging.  The devs could also take the critisism from the community, instead of blocking/banning them. If I made a game, I would expect tons of hate from the community if I made a mistake. These devs should expect the same and should stay cool headed when reading the hate from the community. To be honest these devs feel like minecraft server admins, threatning to ban people for saying something bad about them/the game.\n\nO.K now that im done with the rant about how the levels are repeditive and the devs are rude to the players, lets move onto the shop item and their prices.\n\nTHE SHOP ITEMS ARE WAY OVERPRICED. When I say that, I mean that even the community sells the items for less. This could be a good thing, or a bad thing if you are new to the game and dont know about the community market. For those who are new to the game and are looking for a price listings of all items go to: warframe.market  . Why is this important? Why are you bashing on the market prices? As someone who didn't KNOW that this market even existed, I wasted 50 or so plat on a crappy weapon in the store. ALSO DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON PLAT UNTIL YOU GET 75% off. I wasted so much more money on buying plat when I didn't have a discount. If I were you and you got a 50% discount or even a 25% discount, I would to wait for the 75% discount because 50% isn't much of a discount compared to 75%. It would also be cool if the discount applied to prime access.\n\nMy total review:\nGame expirience: 7/10\nDev expirience: 3/10(inexpirienced devs need to take critizism cool headed. Might change if they never ban me for this review)\nShop prices 1/10(too expensive compared to the community's market)\nUpdate ratings: 6/10\nServer speed: Upgraded from a potato to a watermellon(4/10)\n\nProbs going to get banned for not recommending this game cause negative feedback is something devs ban for. I don't care though, cause the truth needs to be seen by someone.","April 27","false","278.1"," 39 of 68 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","39","68","0","0"

Ok there is warframe, weapon and companion slots for Platinium, what you need to purchase for real money, but there is good thing that you can trade with platinium too. And you can get up to 75% discount on platinium purchase from daily log-in rewards, and im getting 75% discount 1-2 times per week.\n\nTrading and recruiting isn't like it was half year ago, now in recruiting all you can find is Draco (Rep farm) and Void keyshares and now is almost impossible to sell anything that isnt extremly rare, only things that u can sell without sitting in trading section for half day is newest prime parts and mods that arent achievable anymore.\n\nNealy 8 months and 600 played hours later (still playing this game every day) I can say that this game is getting better and better by every update.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/230410/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","In Warframe, you play as a Tenno, a member of a species of ancient warriors that have reemerged to lay waste to the various nefarious species populating the solar system. Your foes include the Grineer, a jackbooted army of deteriorating humanoid clones; the Corpus, a mix-and-match crew of robotic and human parts; and the Infestation, a bunch of shambling organic creatures that vaguely resemble the Flood from the Halo series. While your enemies are visually uninteresting, a lot of the Tenno suits and weapons have a great sense of style that imbues Warframe with a spark of personality. Each species has a cursory backstory, and there is some lore to be found buried in the menus, but there's no narrative thrust or intrigue to speak of. And so you run mission after mission, moving outward from the sun as you level up your loadout and become a more proficient killer.The core combat of Warframe is straightforward. This is a third-person action game in which you wield two primary weapons and a melee weapon against foes who are largely content to come right at you. You also gain suit powers that allow you to dash and slash through a bunch of enemies, or stun all foes within a certain radius, though these abilities can change drastically depending on what suit you equip. You could unleash fiery maelstroms, turn invisible, create a decoy, use teleportation to switch places with an enemy, or manipulate your foes to fight against their allies. Acquiring new suits, however, requires a significant investment of time or money.Regardless of what powers you have equipped, you can often wage effective war against your enemies by firing on them from a distance, then slicing up the ones who manage to get close. This tactic grows tiresome after a while, however, and doesn't serve you well as you take on tougher levels. Fortunately, you can combine your ability to jump, sprint, and crouch into an acrobatic array of slides, flips, jump kicks, wall runs, leaping slashes, and more. Though there's a certain rigidity to your movement, your mobility is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things about Warframe, and it's fun to zip around your enemies, slashing and shooting until the only ones left standing are your fellow Tenno.You can run Warframe missions with up to three other players, and while flying solo is definitely possible in the early going or when you're grinding for experience or resources, teaming up becomes necessary as you tackle tougher missions. ighting your way through fiendish hordes with the help of some allies can be very satisfying, especially when there's a good mix of powers in play. Coordinating with friends is the best way to get this kind of experience, because jumping into matches or having folks join you can lead to lopsided situations.If there's a gap in player level or a mismatch with the mission challenge, as often happens, your cooperative missions can devolve into all-out sprints as players easily cut their way through enemies they far outclass.To minimize such gaps, you can focus on playing only new missions, since those tend to scale toward the upper bound of your capabilities. To spice things up, you may want to acquire a new gun, a new melee weapon, or a new suit. Warframe is free to play, but you must spend either time or money to acquire new items. Currently, new suits range roughly from $5 to $25, with new weapons falling close to the lower end of that spectrum. Alternatively, you can purchase blueprints to craft new weapons and suits using in-game currency. It takes a significant amount of time to save up the money for a new blueprint, and then you must spend even more time acquiring the resources to actually craft it.Even if you skip the lengthy crafting process by using real-world currency, you still have to spend time leveling up your new gear. Jumping into a high-level mission with a brand-new suit is a death sentence, so it's back to lower levels to grind for experience. As your gear levels up, you gain more slots to modify it using boosters picked up during combat. Adding abilities to suits, improving the attributes of your gear, and imbuing your weapon with elemental damage are just some of the things mods can do. Unfortunately, the system to apply and improve mods is poorly laid out and barely explained, leaving you on your own to figure things out.Some problematic menus pale in comparison to Warframe's real problem: a pervasive tendency toward repetition. Whether you're forging ahead with a high-level suit or leveling up a new one, Warframe repeats enemies, environments, and scenarios too frequently. Without new challenges for your combat abilities, the excitement soon dries up, leaving you without a compelling reason to keep playing.As it is now, Warframe's interesting combat mechanics are too quickly overcome by the grind of repetition.","January 17, 2014","true","32.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

What about, the graphic is great and also the gameplay. As in every Free2Play, you can Shop items with real money, but the concept of "Pay2Win" is definetly relative: All the items and the equipments that you can Shop, you can also get them by playing well and a lot, with patience. What else? It's based on Teamplay as every good PVE has to be, and the variety of playable Warframe and Weapons (In constant increasing) is impressive. The only defect it's that the scenario tends to be repetitive in long times. Trust me, and give it a try, possibly with some friends, you will not regret. (Sorry for my bad english.)\n\nItaliano:\n\nPremettendo che il tempo di gioco di Steam è inesatto, e che è dai tempi della Closed Beta che faccio parte della community di Warframe, vi assicuro che questo gioco è geniale. L'ho visto crescere, venire sviluppato passo per passo con il miglioramento e la progressiva aggiunta di contenuti. Che dire, la grafica è ottima e il gameplay pure. Come in ogni Free2Play non manca la possibilità di Shop ma il concetto di "Pay2Win" è decisamente relativo: Tutto ciò che può essere comprato nello Shop si può benissimo ottenere con impegno e pazienza, guadagnandolo all'interno del gioco. Che altro dire? E' incentrato sul gioco di squadra come ogni buon PVE dovrebbe essere e la varietà di armi e e Warframe giocabili (Tra l'altro, in continuo aumento) è impressionante. L'unica pecca è che le ambientazioni alla lunga risultano ripetitive, ma questo accade nella maggior parte dei F2P. Fidatevi di me, e provatelo, possibilmente assieme ad amici, non ve ne pentirete.","February 13, 2014","true","69.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TimmyPrime/recommended/230410/","TimmyPrime","Mrminitimmy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TimmyPrime/","55 products in account","Warframe is a thrid-person MMO action shooter from the company DE.\n\nWith most of these types of loot driven games, there is no particular "end-game". There will always be another mission or raid that you haven't done, new colour scheme, mod arrangment or ability synergy you haven't tried yet. If you somhow manage to go through al the avaliable quests, mission nodes and raids that are avaliable to you, there is always the call of plat (Warframe's premium currency) that will most likley bring you to the system known as "Void".\n\nThe Void is this game's equivilent of a gold mine. This is the only place where the fan-favorite "Primed" gear can be found. Depending on what suites you, you're able to either trade this primed gear in for in-game currency via the trade channel or build it into your very own personalised ♥♥♥♥-machine. (No rule 34, plz)\n\nIt always helps that there are constant updates and patches brought out by the fan-savvy company that always finds a new way to amuse and suprise us, especially with the constant introduction of new Frames, weapons, pets, sentinels and quests. (Scweeeeeeeam. Saryn Prime's coming out ^.^)\n\nAlthough, you still need to realise that DE is a buisness and needs to make money off this somhow. Unfourtunatly this takes form in the ways of MICROTRANSACTIONS. i cri erytiem. Although you can still make platinum off trading valuable gear, the real world buying is very unfreindly to noobs that want all the cool, powerful and expensive Frames and weapons. It still helps if you're pateint, intelligent, determined or just plain poor (this is a free game after-all)\n\nLike all MMOs, this is another great game to spend time with some of your mates. Somthing that makes it better though is the fact that all loot it EVENLY SPREAD OUT AND SHARED. Like..ermagerd. Yes, Warframe allows you and three other your mates to actually stay friends after you've said "I think I'd like to go play CS:GO now". Unlike games like WoW where you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at your life-long mate about who gets a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ peice of armour you didn't even want anyway, Warframe allows you to rejoice when somthing valuable and rare drops. Unfortunately this does mean RNGesus does rule   here. Praise be to RNGesus.\n\nThis last point is more of an interpretation of whether you like it or not. There is no "Most Powerful Weapon or Frame". Each Frame has its own purpose with both strengths and weakness', whichever one you choose, you're in for some fun. You might prefer to be a bullet-sponge, or perhaps a bullet-dealer. Maybe a little more finesse with a bow and arrow or a more head on approace with a claw weilding mechanical cat. Whatever you choose, it'll be your job to mod your Frame and weapon right with the mod space given to the best of your skill and know-how (or google becuase you're lazy)\n\n11/10 Needed more skin-tight leather suits.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dudeman647/recommended/230410/","Dudeman647","NillaWafer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dudeman647/","104 products in account","Saying this game is Free to Play is a bold lie. Let me tell you the story of when I started this game. You are only allowed to pick 1 of 3 starting classes, or warframes, out of the existing 10 or 15. So you play around and you want to make a weapon. You can either 1. use ingame points to unlock a blueprint for the weapon, if the weapon you want even has a blueprint, farm the resources to make the weapon which can take a really, really long time, especially for a starting player, after obtaining everything, spend even more ingame credits to START the making of the weapon which takes 24 hours (not joking), wait an entire day, and THEN you get to play with the weapon. Or 2. give Warframe your money. Making warframes is even worse. You have to fight the same boss over and over just hoping you get the right drops from it. You need a Chassis blueprint, systems blueprint, helmet blueprint, and a warframe blueprint. You need to build ALL those items before you can even begin making the warframe, which all use ingame credits AND TAKES 3 DAYS TO MAKE. Or you can throw your money at Warframe. Oh, and you can only have 2 warframes out of the 15 to play with. You only have 2 warframe slots and like 5 weapon slots. You want more weapons or warframes? Looks like you have to spend some MORE MONEY. You need to give Warframe more money so you can get more slots just to get more warframes and weapons.\n\nLet's talk gameplay. The gameplay is "fun". Sort of. I enjoyed playing solo missions more than playing with 3 other strangers . Why? Because if I play solo, I can try using stealth, which is impossible if your new "teammates" fly down the halls shooting everything in sight. Also, if I play solo, I can play at my own pace. Every single game that you play online with 4 people, the game becomes less of a fps and more of a race. Actually, that's a perfect description of what happens. It becomes less of "There's 2 guys over there, I'll sneak up on one and shoot the other in the head" and more of "RUN RUN RUN OH LOOK AN ENEMY OH HES DEAD RUN FASTER FASTER". It turns into a clusterf**k of color....\n\nI'll summarize all of this. So basically, this is micro-transaction the game. The only way to enjoy the game to it's full extend is spending a lot of money. And I mean a lot.\nI would actually prefer it if you had to buy the game. That way, Warframe wouldn't be a lie, and you wouldn't have to deal with half the bullcrap in the game. Sadly, even IF they did that, you would have to deal with the OTHER half of the bullcrap, like waiting 3 days to play with a warframe. It's just a stupid system, and is just used to siphon more money from your wallet. Oh I forgot to mention, you can spend real money to speed up the process ._. so yea, more ways of spending money... great...\n\nThe game is "fun" ish, if you can look passed all the crap, which I cannot. If you ignore the facts that you need to spend money to use more than 2 warframes, spend money to use more than 5 weapons, wait 3 days to use a new warframe, wait 24 hours to use a new weapon, how the game puts micro transaction after micro transaction in front of your face every single time you open the game (oh, if you stop playing for a day, the next time you open the game, you win a "random reward", which is ALWAYS a discount on your NEXT MICRO TRANSACTION), then you might like this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/screeches/recommended/230410/","screeches","The Universe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/screeches/","67 products in account","Well. After almost 1,000 hours, I think I can judge this game. I started playing just before Update 12 was rolled out. (I think it was 11?)\n\nLet me start off with the pros:\nNice graphics.\nLarge diversity of weapons (Can be an issue - see below)\nLarge and (mostly) friendly community\nDefinetly NOT pay to win. (Can be difficult at times, though - see below)\nTons of new content (Again, can be an issue - see below)\nIGC purchased with real money (platinum) is available through in-game trading. (Can be VERY difficult to work with.)\nMod system that can slow/speed up progression (Can be an issue, explained below)\nNow to the cons:\nWith the weapons, they get very repetitive, and unimpressive. You do get a few gems rarely, but the amount of bad weapons (in my opinion) is extremely annoying and unfair.\nThe grind. Oh, my. This game is an endless grind. (Explained below)\nNo story line. (Again, explained below)\nCredit farming is a nightmare.\nToo much new content being introduced and long-standing bugs are being ignored.\nConfusing to newer players. (not so much anymore)\nUnimpressive and prehistoric social menus.\nThe (lack) of story.\nWarframe doesn't have a story, at all. This makes it an endless grind to have the best gear and be as rich as possible.\n\nI find this extremely annoying, as this just makes the game, as stated above and endless grind that goes nowhere. The game has no purpose, and is not immersive at all, as a result. (There are obviously more reasons.\n\nAlthough, they did implement a quest system for obtaining certain Warframes. (suits) But due to how the crafting system works, (You have to wait 12h - 24h for most items to craft. 72h for Warframes) quest progression is EXTREMELY slow.\n\nBy no means is this necessarily a bad thing. For one, it stops people from spam crafting stuff, and makes you think and wait before you delete something that's not been maxed.\n\nBugs/improvementsThere are quite a few game-breaking bugs in the game, which DE (Digital Extremes) have refused to fix/ignored, if favour of new content. (Like the one where the camera bugs out when you revive, forcing you to force close the game.)\n\nI have nothing against new content, except when the developers focus completely on that, and only partially on fixing bugs.\nAnd the parkour system - It is absolute trash. (although, there has been speculation about an improved parkour system)\n\nTHE NEW PARKOUR SYSTEM HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, BUT ITS ETA IS UNKNOWN.\n\nIt makes doing what this game is advertised as - being a space ninja - nigh impossible. When you wallrun, you fly off the wall when you let go of space. It is clunky, badly animated, and extremely difficult to work with. (The parkour).\n\nParkour 2.0 is here, and it is a true revamp of the movement system. No more ridiculous 'coptering' (ggwp zoren) and no more ridiculously annoying 'parkour' tracks. It can be quite a jump, especially when you've been so used to the previous system, and maybe, some new players could find it difficult to adjust to.\n\nAnd stealth. Goodness me, I've never seen a stealth system so bad. Just like parkour, stealth is the worst I've ever seen.\nImagine accidentally walking in to an enemy's line of sight. In reality he might become startled, and go to check it out.\nBut never would an enemy instantly start firing and alert the ENTIRE ship. It makes being a 'ninja' impossible.\nThe only way to 'stealth' is to get a Loki (Invis frame) and spam invis.\n\nHence the quotation marks, by 'stealth' with a Loki, I mean go invis, use Hushed Invisibility and spam your Tonkor or Boltor Prime. They really need a rework of stealth.\n\nOh yes, and they completely ruined accuracy. At one point they would fire like stormtroopers, and now, oh, boy, now, the have pinpoint accuracy. They will RARELY miss.\n\nIn-game currencies\nThe in-game currencies work well, and in fact, it's probably the best I've ever seen. The currency that's purchased with real money (platinum) is available to trade, using in-game items.\n\nAs you would imagine, it has its drawbacks. But the only thing Platinum is mainly used for is rushing items that are crafting, trading with other people, and buying cosmetic items. You can buy weapons and Warframes with it, but it's not necessary, as you can get weapons via grinding.\n\nIt can make getting platinum extremely difficult. But, say if, a new player was to buy platinum, most weapons that AREN'T Primed can be bought with platinum. This CAN unbalance the game, but it usually doesn't due to how the mod system works.\n\nCredits can be extremely difficult to farm without a booster, and are spent up far too quickly. For the sake of newer players, the drop rates/amounts should be buffed, or the prices for everything should be lowered a bit.\n\nAnd now, on to the\nMod system\nThe mod system works, because it limits progression. As you can imagine, this has its drawbacks too. It can make higher level missions difficult, or extremely easy.\n\nIn short, it can unbalance the game very, very easily.\n\nSummary/TL;DR\nThis game has quite a few flaws, i.e. the mod system, stealth, parkour, in-game currency farming.\n\nBut it is a real gem, and it has potential. Stick with it, chip in at the forums, and maybe, just maybe, some of the issues may be addressed.\n\n(I may update this later, as new content, and/or bugs are fixed.)\n\nThanks for reading!","July 6, 2015","true","383.3"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","15"

Visually, its absolutely amazing, and the art style is very distinct, with very identified personality between the factions. The combat may be glitchy at times, but it flows and shows a degree of freedom seldomly seen in other games. Movement is also very in-depth, wall runs, slide-jumps, and they can all chain together so that you dont just run anymore, you run, slide, jump, land, slide, attack slide, wall boost, land with an almighty smash of your melee weapon. By this time you commit these moves to muslce memory, your left pinky would be substiantially strong than your right one, so if you were plan to thumbwars with your pinky, i'd highly recommend this game.\nGame play currently is very diverse, with several game modes: assisination or sabotage missions for those who enjoy Hitman; survival or defence missions for those who have nothing better to think about than SHOOT THOSE DUDES for 30 minutes+; boss fights for your inevitable grind for blueprints. Not to mention all the weapons and warframe you have, once you get to the 400hr+ mark, you'd have more suits and accessories than a spoiled-rotten 16 year old with her own creditcard.\nThe bad- unfortunately, being any hardcore tenno require a lot of GRIND, as every weapon, warframe, needs to be grinded to level 30, and then repeat if you wish to forma(make it better). Not to mention all the grinding for material needed to craft the weapons and these awesome suits. Of course, it being a MMO, grinding is tolerated, and since I have 600 hrs in this game, certainly entertaining enough.\nThe really bad- MONEY. credits and orokin cells are easy enough to grind for, but to get to the real end game(OWN EVERYTHANG), you need PLATINUM. certainly, you can now sell blueprints and mods, but that's very inefficient way to get plat. So if you are willing to commit to the game, dunk 50 bucks in the game during a deal, its well worth your time.","June 22, 2014","true","316.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Tenno.) where the Tenno are at war with 2 factions: The Corpus and The Grineer. Both of which are at war with each other and the result is an imbalance in the system which the Tenno are tasked with balancing. There is a fourth faction, the sentient Infected. The technocyte ravaged beings twisted into monsters after years of dividing and acquiring biomass, they pose a threat to everyone in the universe.\n\nThe game itself has quite a learning curve but the community makes it so easy to learn.\nThere are a ton of events and rare items as well as alert missions that allow you to take certain rare items or platinum items that you could buy in-game with microtransactions but the game allows you to get them for free. You don't need to spend unless you want to. Prime frames are the same.

There is a pumping system, with those experiences not only gets the character for whom you play and weapons that you fight. Interesting system improvements. The visual part of the game is full of colors and effects. Lots of explosions, lots of glowing stuff. All very nice. It should say that the game is not PVP, PVE only, can in the future it will be in the game and, well, until .... the battle against hordes of mutants!\n\nPS\nI almost forgot, in the game at first do not understand what they want from you in a mission where to go and who to shoot but eventually everything falls into place.\n\nsorry for my english)\n\n\nНеожиданно очень качественная f2p игра.В кооперативе размером,на 4 человека,как уже собственно давно завелось,вам предстоит отстреливать толпы врагов,будь то роботы или мутанты.

This review is from a very experienced (addicted) member of the warframe community, in-game, on the forums and the wikia.\n\nThis game consists of a unique combat style that allows for fluid change between melee and gunplay.  The enemies are currently a bit dumb, but as is the nature of this game, that may (as been mentioned by devs to most likely happen) change by further improving the pathing of enemies, and differenciating combat tactivs more between enemy type and faction.  The lore is currently hard to find, though based on community smarts, information attained from the codex (think pokemon with some added goodies) and the devoloper livestreams and posts.  Lore will be expanded on, but as the devolopers have said "the game is about making your own lore with some guidelines".  The difference of experience between first playing, having a hold on the combat/movement along with having a decent arsenal, and then what is dubiously called 'end-game' is immense.  Starting off may feel slow, with the generic assualt rifle, pistol and long sword at your desposal.  Enemy factions are slowly introduced as you progress through planets, and bring a different style of play with them.  The grineer follow basic shooter patterns (aim for head, avoid hit scan weapons and some heavies), the corpus is more about reaction to shots than anticipation of them while keeping on your feet, as well as having a 90% resistance to damage taken to the head (so for once, the foot might be better than the face), and the infested, a pridominantly melee faction with pack mentality and zerg rush style tactics.  Once you progress, you begin to make your arsenal unique through mods (extra stat cards) that are dropped vis RNG (Random Number Generater) when you defeat an enemy.  Weapons are not as important as getting mods to start off.  These mods allow you to take advantage of enemy resistances and status effects, as well as pure damage increase.  As you complete missions, real time alerts become available, which is a good way to get credits (basic currency) and items to improve your weapons, and skins and weapon that are either alert exclusive, or otherwise only obtainable from the market for plat (the games premium currency).  Mods affect your weapons ability and to some extent, the playstyle of that weapon, but there is also a large number of unique weapons (with more added almost every week) that will allow you a diverse arsenal of playstyles.  All weapons are attainable for free (throught the market under the blueprint section, or from farming other areas and bosses, or events).  At mid game, the fighting starts to pick up, and more avenues for play start becoming apparent.  At end-game, your mastery will have been substaintial increased (the psuedo overall player level based on number of weapons maxed), your arsenal will be full, you will have tried most of the warframes (classes), mods will not be a problem allowing min-max builds, and you will be focusing on farming Defence or Survival missions.  This, as the end-game gets a little tedious, and at times, unbearable if you can not find a good group o fplayers, or even a single mate.  Enemy level increase (damage dealt, able to soak up, and number of enemies) is really all the diffulcultty increase that there is.  New content is always being added, so the focus on what is end-game may very well change.\nOn a slightly different note, this game has its fair share of bugs (96% are no where near game breaking) and refining damage models, optimisation for more systems, and overall increase in stabilty are always being improved.\nAlthough this is advertised as a co-op, ninja game, co-operation is not a strong focus with the community.  lobby options such as solo, private (only friends can join) or invite only help with getting into the game at your own pace, or with a set group of friends you are chatting to.  Trailers depict a large amount of co-ordination of warframe abilities, but this in practice, is lesser.  A large portion of abilities are pure damage, with a few twist between playstyles, and the abilities that support the team mostly do not need another ability to contribute the most that it can.  Rushers are rampant in online public lobbies, and as there are end-game players only going into missions for a single purpose, they rush past everything else, which as a new player can be a bip, shall we say, disorientating.  The learning curve to be able to play this game is not steep, but the learning curve to master the game certainly is.  Each enemy has their own resistances and vulnerabilities, and modding for certain enemies can be the difference between life and death in this game.  All resistance info can be found in-game, but only after scanning enemy types for information int he codex.\nIf that wall of text was too much to read, then I will sum things up easier before rounding this review off with my opinion.\nPositive\n- Uniqure combat style\n- A plethora of weapons, and customization\n- Warframes often feel unique, but familiar enough to learn to love\n- Damage system offers a large amount of info to get sunk into, further increasing some peoples interest in the game mechanics, and devoloping weapon and warframe builds.\n- Game is constantly being updated, with fixes to community voiced issues, gameplay performance, new weapons and warframes, as well as events, invasions and real time alerts.\n- Everything that is not cosmetic, or convienience can be attained for free.\n- Devolopers are part of our community,\n\nNegatives\n- Farming gets repetitive after a while unless you change play styles.\n- With constant updates, it also brings new bugs.\n- Your personal objective may be hindered by rushers, and their objective.\n- End-game consist of two generic mission types to rank equipment.\n\nIn summation, my personal feelings about this game are tilted towards loving it (when its not throwing a devoloper induced fit) and plenty of patience.  The experience is enjoyable, and there is a lot to go in-depth based on lore or gameplay mechanics.  The devolopers are always answering questions, and taking feed back.  Yes I have put money into this game, but only the equivalent of a low budget disc game.  I highly recommend giving this game a try for at least 15 hours before making a final decision.  Get to know regular players, and the farming can be easily broken up with informal conversation, which I consider great, as the tenno are a family.  I have maxed almost every item in the game, ahve all available mods, and till have an erge to check in every day to see what smal, large, or passive things have changed.  Try this game, and you will never feel the same about any other game after.","January 11, 2014","true","450.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

It has tons of content, customization and overall fun things you can do. BUT\nWith the recent changes post U18, the game has been on a decline. Each update i come to play again, only to run out of things to do within 12 hours. Now, there has been a recent wave of nerfs for certain warframes (The warframes are like characters you play as, think classes), and while i do agree that certain nerfs were justifiable, there haven't been any real updates that increase the viability of other warframes. So we are left with playing with even LESS choices that were presented before the update dropped. But let's move on from there. The overall gameplay is amazing, it's fast paced, interesting, and requires more than standing in open and just endlessly shooting (At least in higher levels, not using certain warframes). The waiting times can be a little long, normally you will have to wait 12 hours to build a weapon. Some weapons and all warframes require additional parts for the item itself. Such as a helmet, a chassis, a barrel etc. If you thought that was bad, you have to wait AT LEAST 84 hours (Considering you start building all parts at once) to build a warframe. Outside of missions, you will be in your ship, which has access to several of other features.\nThe Starchart - Which you can use to select missions to play.\nThe Market - In which you can buy blueprints from which you can construct warframes and weapons, Warframes or weapons themselves (In exchange for premium currency, but you can get it through trading, i will get to it later.) or misc. items.\nThe Foundry - In which you can build items for resources you get through playing.\nThe Arsenal - In which you can select weapons/warframes you built\nThe Mods - Now for the fun part - You can modify your gear with certain ''mods''. These can offer you increased damage, increased range for your powers, added elemental damage, augmenting your warframe powers and so on. Each weapon or warframe has limited mod capacity and slots. Each weapon and warframe has 10 slots (With 2 extra for warframes, for mobility mods and ''Auras"", which give a passive bonus and increase the mod capacity instead of draining it, and 1 extra for melee weapons - ''Stances'' which like auras, increase your maximum energy capacity, and give you combos you can do with your melee weapon in hand.) Now for the bad part.\nFor me personally, this is the reason i am slowly getting to the point where it is not fun to play the game anymore.\nYou see, unless you're using the small number of viable weapons/warframes, you will fall off in higher level content, and fall off HARD. Now, i am not saying that EVERY SINGLE weapon should be viable, because that wouldn't really help either, but from the massive amount of weapons that are available in the game, only a small portion of that can work in higher level content without struggling. There is also an item called ''Forma'' Which allows you to add a ''Polarity Slot'' that cuts the capacity cost of a matching mod by half, while increasing the cost of non matching mod by twice the amount. With enough of those, almost any weapon can be viable really. But the bad part is unless you pay with premium currency to speed up the creation of those, you can safely wait 24 hours for one to build, and seeing you have to use these a lot unless you are using a small amount of weapons that do not need those, you will either pay, or wait a whole lot.\nAnd the waiting times themselves, oh man. If you though waiting 24 hours was bad enough, you have to wait 84 hours in total (And that's considering you start to make all parts at once.) to make a warframe and its parts in total.\nIn conclusion, Warframe is a very fun game, with many annoying things that drag it down, such as the waiting times, or nerfs without any buffs to balance it. I played more than 800 hours (500 here, 300 on other account), I started playing around Update 9, which was about 2,5 years ago. But i had a large break later. Still, i think i do know quite a lot about the game. Do i recommend the game in its current state? It largely depends. If you're going to play the game casually, as a time waster, go for it. If you're like me, and will try to play the game for a longer period of time, i think i have to sadly say no.\nThis concludes my review. If you're an avid fan of the game and will bombard me with negative comments, i do geniuenly like the game, it's just the constant changes that annoy me and finally driven me to the point where i don't want to play anymore. Thank you for reading, have a nice day.\nEDIT : Fixed some typos","June 3","false","594.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","1"

It's just a pay to RUSH yes RUSH.\nThe real money in this game is called PLATNUIM. Used to purchase anything you desire in the Market, Trading Purposes, and Rushing of course items.\n(I've only rushed 4things in a span of almost 5years of playing)\n\n\nThe GamePlay\n\nThe gameplay is smooth, All the Weapons and Warframes make it so hard to choose what you want to be engaged with the most, Reason why i say  Engaged  with is now the modding system, you can create how your weapon works, either making a crossbow shoot explosive arrows, a rocket launcher that explodes and does poison damage, a melee that can burn people?\nThe list can go on about creation AND choices from all the items in the game.\n\n\n\n\nNow the cons\n\nNow the game has many, and i mean many flaws but none are worth saying "This game makes me want to suck my moms ♥♥♥♥" Which is insest you sick ♥♥♥♥s.\nBut the modding and crafting Is really, in my mind is bad too. For the fact that not just waiting time where you can prep ♥♥♥♥ing tons of meals for a beaver dam feast.\nBut not only that, is the fact that most mods that are devoted the best to have, arent really that easy to aquire. Making it hard for some dream mod builds. And some Warframes are harder then others to obtain freely like for me. Especially for Primed Items(Upgraded versions of original) which can get without money too also. Just takes alot of farming for those said items you desire.\n\nNow the farming:\n\nLike I said, most items require some farming and some even tons, If not so lucky.\nHeres a funny story before I start this side of this.\nMy friend did a total of 200ish runs of the same mission(Even though can do any just depends where said item is dropped)\nFor one Warframe part called the Ivara helmet dropped from LVL 25+ Spy missions. I got 7 of them in a span of 8missions. It really is luck based for when It comes down to it.\nNow back to farming; It can be very teasing, stressful, stupid, and even RAGE Inducing the aspect of the farming (Like most MMOs/RPGs) can lead to hating said game at some points in people's mind. NOTE: Again I've traded for everything I have and ESPECIALLY FARMED FOR MOST OF IT.\nMoral of farming in Warframe. JUST DO IT.\n\n\n[Warframes/Weapons]\n\nNow like I said there is many Warframes to choose from around 35warframes now, making it new and refreshing to change up your play style. (Don't be a dickbutt and be Valkyr all your life)...(Please) There is so many and MORE yes the DEVs are there for warframe consumers, and community about 95% of the time thus Updating and Patchs mostly everyday, And still going on about Warframes. There is so many that If you were to stay as one Warframe and not try the others even one bit. Then your fault If you down from a Hydroid In Conclave(PVP) (I don't know how you would though unless only look at warframes and weapons as for style then I don't know If should even play this game since about being smart too).\nAnd for weapons I said before already (Just don't down yourself with a rocket or a detonatable shock grenade...)(Seriously look where you placed that ♥♥♥♥ like the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you unless got short term memory loss then you got no excuse YA DOOF)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a very short review really here but im just lazy and decided to do one on this day cause I had nothing to rant about to my non-existing friends.\nWith maybe my Waifu.\n\nIf got really any questions you can ask me VIA Warframe If do decide to play It. In-game Alias "0FireStarter0" Cause someone already took my blaze...\n\nI have no friends.\n\nAte/tin\n(English dub)\n8/10 Would look up rule 34 of Warframe again.\n(Don't really)\n\nEDIT  REAL  QUICK:\nWhat I meant by hard to get mods is some arent even obtainable other then from trading.\nBUT STILL GREAT GAME AND STILL PLAY IT!!!","February 21","true","853.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/230410/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Warframe is a third person over the shoulder shooter with customizable options. At first glance, this game seems like it has it all. Upon closer inspection, there's a few key elements missing. For a quick first impression, imagine the games Destiny and Halo having a child except they gave them a sword, and the child knows how to run along and backflip off walls.\n\nI have to give the game credit for putting jumping, sprinting, dodging/rolling as well as crouching into the game. Any game that puts basic movements in, make it all the more enjoyable. The wall climbing may feel slightly stiff, but seriously, it's about freakin' time you're given options on how you'd like to dodge. Your weapons can be modified and changed as you please (including armor), but I can't help feel like I'm playing Brink when using the guns in game. It's not necessarily bad, but it can be bland at times. They did provide a secondary handgun though, which to me, the more the merrier. The game itself provides a good foundation for game-play, but if you are looking for over the top missions, doesn't seem quite here. It feels as though your running to point A to point B, press this object then done, onto the next place. Enemies sort of stand and shoot at you when you make your move, they don't quite react to your movements or shots. What was a good addition was the melee weapon (or sword). I feel like a bit more could have been done with it (maybe allowing for more control), but either than that, you're mashing a single button to take a guy down. It does however, also have a double jump feature... sort of, or at least I think. I did a back flip while running full blast at a wall, and sometimes I jump twice (as if I bounce off an obstacle) when trying to climb ridges. Holding the climb button (or A) will make the character run up the wall. These parkour features are definitely what makes this game stick out. This game has quite a bit, but just feels it can have so much more. Put that together with paying to get better stuff, well, that depends on which side of the micro-transaction side you're on.\n\nThe games graphics are good and can ask a lot of your computer depending on what you're running. I haven't noticed any hiccups or glitches, not even clipping as of yet! The textures they used were nice, but in dark scenarios I feel they could have added a bit more light. The sound is good but can be bland to those looking for authentic qualities. The near gun shot misses are on par.\n\nFor a free game, definitely not a bad choice.\n\nRating : 7.3/10\n\nIt could have gotten a 8 easily with the addition of local co-op (and removal of micro transactions). If they were to add vehicles and some sort of practicality to use airships, that would have been greatly appreciated. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW : There are micro transactions in game. If this sort of thing pisses you off or you don't support it, I wouldn't suggest downloading the game.\n\nScreenShots :\nWhat standard shooting looks like\n\nUsing a special attack\n\nUsing a standard melee attack\n\nView from the front of the "menu" ship\n\nSliding my way into the action\n\nBlocking is pretty basic in the game but none the less, it's there\n\nHow hacking goes down in Warframe\n\nStealth take-down on an enemy\n\nYou can literally back flip off walls\n\nIt's not splinter cell sneaky, but it's still sneaky","June 7, 2015","true","2.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","11","16","5","2"

It's a great game. Although i feel that there isnt a lot of story or plot, there is, however, a nice backstory/lore and a unique setting. The game allows you to customize your character (to an extent) and has a large selection of weapons and warframes to suit one's playstyle. In the beginning, the game felt very pay2play; everything i wanted at that point costed platinum(premium currency) and wasn't available until i progressed further and it required (what i assumed to be) heavy grinding. But now, having progressed much further, i've found that most things could be acquired with just time and patience, and the only things that truly required platinum were cosmetics and bundles. And platinum is a tradable currency, so if you really want x that costs y platinum, you could make platinum by trading with other players. But is the game fun? Yes, it's loads of fun. The gameplay is relatively unique, progression freels rewarding, and it looks great. Updates are pulled out quickly, fixes are adminstered hastily. Overall, it's a very refined game (especially one that's in beta)","December 29, 2013","true","854.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","1"

Even if it doesn't, this is an awesome example of how to do Free to Play. Even though most of the maps are randomly generated sets of similar rooms, once you start getting better equipment, you'll start to ignore and possibly enjoy that you know the way through the different rooms.\n\nYou can access nearly everything without spending actual money, instead only having to spend time finding resources in missions and waiting for them to build once you've got the parts you need. If you feel like supporting the developers and getting something sooner, you can buy Platinum (real world currency equivalent) and get things straight away.\n\n(Also, only buy that stuff through the game's official site, Steam's packs of DLC are overpriced unless on deep sale. There are also discounts you can get through in-game login rewards, ranging from 20%-75% off Platinum, so wait for that if possible.)\n\nNow get in here and help me get potatoes, would you kindly?","November 28, 2013","true","440.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

This game has a long learning curve, but when you got the basics there is always something to do, always 1 more mission to play, 1 more thing to craft, 1 more resource needed to find. All these things add up in the big picture and make Warframe much bigger then it seems to players, its not your typical Free to play game or pay to win game, no you can do all free theres no advantage in paying. Its super fun for me and my friends with who i have spent in this games are numerous days. Several h a day and we never got bored, we only runed out of energy to play the game and was super fun to yell at each other to help him and not to run away from reviving a budy, ♥♥♥♥ arround and all that cool stuff. There are numerous guns from mashine guns to shotguns, from pistols to laser rifles.You play on planets arround the solar system, and in each planet there are multiple missions in wich you can unlock mods to upgrade your warframe character and guns, those are called mod cards, wich are randomly droped by enemys or boses. Each warframe, or gun has a lvling system from 1-30 leveling a warframe makes him to have more shields, hp armor etc, but with mod cards you can upgrade him the most you like him to be bore tanky or to dish out damage its all up to you. Theres a clan DOJO where you and you clan buddys can go and build structures like power plant, and reserch facilities. In reserch facilities you can reserch new guns, mostly that enemys use, can reserch warframes but all that takes multiple day resech time. There are game events in wich players allways kinda keep their aye on the game to see if there is a alert mission in wich can be droped a mod card they want, or a accesorie item they want for a warframe wich can be bought only by real money but with alerts can get them free.

We all agreed while it's great for a free to play game containing some beautiful graphical work, some interesting game mechanics, and good controller support, it gets tedious very quickly and nothing really makes it stand apart from a failed third-person action game like Too Human unfortunately. It's also quite a tough game to get a grip of as it contains lack of explaination about how certain aspects of upgrading and customising a character work. Regardless, I'd recommend giving it a bash, it's a good bit of fun at first but nothing I can see myself playing in the long term and spending money on! :)","December 10, 2013","true","2.0"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

When that game is free you should frantically search for the nearest download button immediately.\n\nWarframe puts you in the twisted-space-shoes of a Tenno, who are basically known for their ability to shoot and/or stab anything between them and their next objective. The meat of the game revolves around picking a character, picking your weapons, then picking an area to use them in. The levels themselves are tile based - meaning each level has a random bunch of rooms put together differently each time you play it. You race through the levels with up to 3 other Tenno, killing bad guys and collecting loot on your way to complete each objective. Everything you collect can be used to build new characters, weapons, and more between missions. Each weapon is unique and vary greatly from one to the next, as do the different characters who each have differing base stats and special abilities.\n\nOf course, being a Free-To-Play game, it has a real-money store that uses the in-game "Platinum" currency. Platinum is purchased and can be used for just about everything. Luckily, since the game is primarily cooperative, this benefits everyone and only serves to make your life a little easier. For those of us who don't have bottomless pockets, nearly everything can be built without the need for Platinum with resources collected from each level; admittedly this can be a grind for some of the more pricey items but never feels unreasonable.\n\nWith lots of great support from Digital Extremes and a $0 price tag, there really aren't many good reasons you shouldn't try Warframe out and see all it has to offer.","April 23, 2015","true","664.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Within a month(Possibly even a few weeks) I sunk over a hundred hours into this game. And I would like to say those are the best hundred hours I've had in awhile.\n\nFirst of all, THERE WILL BE GRINDING/FARMING. This game kinda works like that. I understand not everyone has the patience to well grind for a certain items(In the newest update, kubrow eggs will be your worst nightmare in farming, unless RNG is on your side. Then I hate you), but I do think it's worth while because it gives you that feeling of progress towards what you want. And that feels pretty good.\n\nSecond, there are microtransactions, but they are not needed. You will only need them when you want to fully buy/rush something, want to but additional accersories(color packs, armor, etc.), and when you want to trade for certain items. I must say, this game handles microtransactions very well. As long as you don't spend it too fast. Like two of my friends. Which I will not metion either of them.\n\nThird, this game will (sometimes) require some sort of teamwork. Like other people to help you. I used to think you can fully "beat the game" all by yourself, until a certain entity called "The Stalker" absolutly whopped my ♥♥♥. Then I realized, "I need a team to play with...". I'm not sure if you can fully solo the game from the beggining but if you can, i'd be happy to know.\n\nLast of all, it's just fun to explore every weapon and warframe in the game. I mean when I first built a warframe that had the ability to stop ALL damage coming to her, bring out energy claws to rip people up, and gain her health back? I was damn well surprised and I still enjoy the warframe up to date.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is interested in RPG like elements and a game that you and your friends could enjoy. I mean who doesn't enjoy being a space ninja cutting people in half, shootting people up, and jumping all over the place? I enjoy it.

You dont just run around killing enemies and looting from containers; you train yourself to be the best ninja around!\n\nThe main thing that people like about Warframe is that there is a nice selection of parkour techniques that make the race of the Tenno just that little bit more awesome. Theres now Operations (of the mission kind) which involve you deciding whether its best to assist the Corpus or the Grineer in each mission. Finally the best part feature in the game the Modding. Modding allows you to constantly decide what upgrade you want to add to your weapon or warframe on every level-up. This can either make your weapon best stronger versus a certain faction, very fun to play with, or, very simple and sometimes very weak. It can take a while to find the best mods for weapons but when you get them the whole experience changes for the better! What more could you want? Its simply a Masterpiece!\n\nThe game can get repetitive with the constant grinding for weapon or warframe levels, But the difference everytime is that you get to try out a new type of weapon; some are just basic guns, others have unique firing techniques. But it never gets boring if you know what your doing.\n\nBottom line: Its worth playing if your into FPSs and definately worth trying if your unsure. There are a few connection bugs but its hardly noticed. The grinding is fun when you fight in different missions and areas and it helps to play with friends but if you get it, you wont regret it!","February 22, 2014","true","771.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

The game is free, so I highly recommend at least trying it out and deciding for yourself. Invite some friends while you're at it.

While the free running is tons of fun to master, the levels are massive and the combat is fast pace and thrilling, the game is without a doubt a grind.  Get a mod; level a mod.  Get a frame; level a frame.  Get a gun; level a gun.  There are tons of guns, mods and frames to level, but without a team of friends to do it with, I could see the task being a bit daunting.\n\nThe levels you play in are HUGE!  But, The maps are cooky cutter to say the least.  It can take ten minutes to make it to the escape, passing one deja vu after another.  Lots of detail and care went into some parts of the environment while others are dull and uninviting.\n\nThe free running is a blast!  So fluent and fun to play around with.  Tough to pull off in combat, but that's what keeps you trying it again and again.  Unless you look up videos that show all that there is to learn, it will take a long time to figure out all of the techniques.\n\nThe graphics are shiny and clean.  A fun game to look at and it is extremely well optimized.\n\nThe character models have great detail and the colors can be customized... that is If you buy a color pallet, the b***ards!\n\nThe weapons fall a bit short.  There are a ton to choose from, but a lot of them feel very similar; fortunately, the melee weapons are a good balance with the guns.  Each player can also have a "sentinel" that does a number of useful things: attacking enemies and picking up loot items are examples.  All the weapons can be modified through a unique leveling and modding system that I have only seen in this game.  It works well, but adds to the inescapable grind.\n\nThe combat is splendid.  There is a good variety to the enemies, and a solid balancing system that can lead to easy push-over style fights, and intense battles that have the players pushed to the edge at all times.  The free running plays a large role in the combat.\n\nOver all, the game is the perfect addition to any group of friends looking to add another good co-op shooter the their lists.  Plenty to grind and  plenty to uncover and discover.  I recommend buying "some" platinum in the beginning.  It can take a while to get going without it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=221726417","January 29, 2014","true","173.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/recommended/230410/","femboyancy","♥Prince Vaxi♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/","510 products in account","What is Warframe?...\n\nWell, to put it bluntly? It's a game about Space Ninjas...That's really it. A bunch of traumatized space ninjas were forcibly put in some other dimension which is about as close to hell as reality gets. Most of them died, and those who didn't, became some of the most twisted, dangerous creatures ever made. To contain their power, and their deformed bodies, they're encased in War Frames, which also help boost their powers.\n\n...So...Super Hero space ninjas...That's Warframe.\n\nThe silly concept aside, the game is actually pretty good! I cannot imagine starting this game completely on my own. The learning curve is pretty darned steep, and I luckily had an experienced player(Cronxyx) help me out, and get started!\n\nNow, in terms of graphics, and computer stress, this game does require a lot of it. Even at half resolution, my computer's not too happy about it, and I'm playing on the lowest possible settings. If you have an under-par computer which has trouble running games like CS:GO? I'd not bother with this one, it'll be unplayable for you.\n\nIn terms of controls, and mechanics, the game 'can' be fun, but also very, very annoying, and it'll most likely make your wrists hurt if you don't sit 'just' right. This applies mostly to melee combat though, which is my chosen favorite(Why make a game about space ninjas if they can just pull out a space rifle and shoot things!? I have a samurai sword that sparks lightning at my hip, DAMNED RIGHT I'LL USE IT!!!) For example, when going into melee mode, your left mouse button is no longer attack, but is held down to provide an energy draining power boost to your swings, increasing damage(And making you look SUPER cool! Glowy and stuff!), while the E key becomes the new attack button. Meanwhile, Stamina and fatigue is incredibly scarce in this game granted how much movement you need to be doing, thus many people have taken to the art of floor skating...you sprint by holding down shift, and in order to slide along the floor doing sparks and stuff, you have to hold down Ctrl at the same time, and for an added boost, you push E, to make a forward dash slice attack to cover even more ground...If done right, you can cross an entire map instantly(And probably kill yourself as you fall into a pit)\nWhen you do this over and over and over and over, for hours, you'll find your left wrist is burning and slightly swollen, so my advice is to 'tilt' your keyboard slightly to the left, since the arrow keys are useless here. You'll only be using the left side of your keyboard, and your mouse.\n\nHowever, despite the hand breaking controls, the demanding graphics, and the kinda silly concept(SPACE NINJAS! HUA! HIAH!!!), the game is 'tremendously' fun, and quite addicting. The satisfying hack and slash and realistic ragdolling and the steep learning curve makes becoming good at this game a legitimate achievement...I mean...I'm still rank 0 and I've failed my rank-up test 3 times now!(PS: Once you get ready to take the test, make sure you are in the right Warframe...Once you have the option to take the test, if you click no? It'll give you the cooldown anyway :\ )\nThese 'rank up tests' can only be attempted once a day(24 hours), so best be prepared before doing them!\n\nMy advice? Considering this game's free? Yes, I'd definitely give it a try. I've played it for 2 days, and am quite hooked.\n\n(Thanks to Cronxyx for introducing me to this game. You're the best horsie a kitty could ask for <3 )","April 24, 2014","true","163.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","3"

There are similarities to hack and slash, RPG, and stealth/espionage, though the stealth aspect is rather lacking and more of something that's just "there" rather than something that is a large focus. All in all, the game can tend to feel like the developers of Dynasty Warriors, Mirror's Edge, Mass Effect, and any MMORPG game you prefer to imagine, got together and said "lets make a game", then occasionally went to the devs of Ghost Recon, Assassin's Creed, and Hitman for small suggestions on stealth here and there.\n\nBut is the game fun? Is it original? I can honestly say yes to both. I can't say I've seen another game that was exactly like this, and the experience is definitely an enjoyable one. Possibly the greatest part about it is that you don't have to pay a penny for anything in the game, save for aesthetic items, and slots for Warframes and Weapons. But there's an alternative for that too - it's called trading.\n\nHowever, whether or not I recommend this game for you depends on whether or not you have a few friends you would be playing it with on a regular basis. If you don't, then let me be the first to tell you that you're going to get very bored very quickly. If you do, then by all means, you could have as many hours as I do, if not more!\n\nWhy is this, you might ask? Warframe is set up in such a way that the gear isn't "ranked" at all, there's no weapon, nor frame that is part of the "pro gear" that you work up to, aside from Primed items. Primed items are your endgame, and they're a pretty easy endgame to reach. Rather than a long time spent visiting new areas, and slowly working your way up to the "cool stuff", your starter character alone can be modded correctly to take on the void decently, if you know how to use it.\n\nMost planets don't have their own tilesets, and there's only four families of enemies, the Grineer, the Corpus, the Infested, and the Corrupted, the Corrupted of which are limited to the Void only, and Infested only appear during certain quests, specific invasion types, dark sectors, and derelicts/Eris, meaning that you'll really only be seeing the Grineer and Corpus frequently unless you do Void runs all the time, or choose to go to Eris/Derelicts/Dark Sectors/Invasions to fight infested.\n\nHowever, once you reach "endgame", which is the Void, which doesn't take long at all to get to, you won't be seeing the Infested, Grineer, or Corpus all that much, because the Void is where you'll almost always be, trying to get Prime gear, and/or credits, since the Void offers the most credits per run out of any other area in the game.\n\nFrom then on, it's just a matter of first getting a decent set of gear you can use, and learning how to properly mod it to get a viable build for surviving T3-T4 Void, once you can do that, it's just a matter of grinding the void over and over again to get the parts you need for Primed gear, which all lies in the hands of RNG - you go through RNG on the regular worlds to get keys for the void, and then you go through RNG in the void to [hopefully] get the parts you need for the item you're trying to get. Note that on some runs you may not get a part at all and instead get a Forma blueprint, or maybe 5 fusion cores, because that's definitely what you wanted!\n\nBut once you have your primed gear, you'll bask in the glory of having such items, and begin grinding to get more of them - until, that is, you ask yourself the question that ruins the game as a whole; "why?". All that's left for you is making yourself OP so you can do the same things you've been doing with more efficiency, so you can get more gear to grind more with. There is no "content" you're working towards, there is nothing else you're actually accomplishing other than getting more toys to play with, and you're going through heavy amounts of grind to get them.\n\nAll of this can be ignored if you're playing this with your friends, as it's definitely a fun co-op game, but if you're hoping to find something to just do by yourself in your free time, you'll get burned out fast.\n\n\nWarframe also, however, features a PvP mode that was recently "enhanced". However, this new PvP leaves a lot to be desired. Will it be enhanced in the future? Maybe, but honestly the devs will (and should) be more worried about the main game than the PvP, meaning it'll be much like the Archwing mode in the game - a decent concept that does add more to the game, but it has no impact on the main game whatsoever, is lackluster compared to the main game, and there's little to no incentive to actually do it.\n\nHow is it lackluster? Well, for starters, the weapons and frames you're allowed to use in PvP were carefully hand-selected by the devs and worked specifically for the PvP, yet there is still a vast lacking of balance overall. Some weapons and frames are statistically superior to others, limiting it all to an even tinier number of the tiny amount of things you can actually use. Add to this, that the PvP only has around 4 maps, and there's only one mode - CTF. You're not awarded credits, nor mods for doing any of this. In fact, you only get EXP with the conclave if you wear the conclave sigil, which, EXP with the conclave is used to get special mods - mods that can only be used in PvP.\n\n\nThere's also the new "raid", which is what DE believes to be the answer to the lack of endgame it seems. The Raid is where 4-8 players join together to take on a much harder mission than what players normally face. However, unless you pleasure the idea of everyone spamming mics and some kid screaming at you for not being 100% perfect, take my advice and avoid the raids like a plague.\n\nSo, all in all, a good game, but the devs need to focus less on giving us more stuff to grind for, and focus more on giving endgame players more content to enjoy, less RNG grind, and overall providing more incentive to actually play the game. Another thing they should focus on is the quests in the game that provide a bit of story for the game, as those are interesting, but there's not even close to enough of them. It's to my understanding that all of this is planned to happen "eventually", but there's no telling when that will actually be.\n\nI give Warframe an 8.5/10.","April 30, 2015","true","502.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","2"

I played this game way back when, before all the updates and the console releases. After I while, I quit, mainly because of the lack of people in public games. Anyways, I recently picked it up, and there seems to be a lot more players. I was playing the game pretty heavily until I realized that ulitmately, there is no point to playing the game.\n\nLet me elaborate. What do you do in Warframe? You grind procedurally generated levels in order to obtain new weapons, Warframes, Kubrows, Sentinals, mods, and whatever else you fancy. Obtaining these items and leveling them up gives you mastery ranks, which is the leveling system in the game. What do you do with all this cool swag? Use it to grind the same procedurally generated levels, over and over again.\n\nYou might say "well the levels are procedurally generated, so the game will NEVER get old!" Well.... that's not the case. The levels still get extremely repetitive after several hours of playing, same with the enemy types. There's 3 enemy "factions" in this game, and each faction has about 5-10 different enemy types. (not exact numbers, but you get the point). Anyways, the enemies get extremely repetitive, ad do the levels.\n\nSee, this is my major gripe with the game. Sure, theres tons and tons of items and things you can get that are cool and all, but the core gameplay never changes. It's just grinding, grinding, and more grinding. I realized that playing this game really has no point, and even if I got the best weapon, the best warframe, the best WHATEVER, it'll just be used to grind more of the same enemy types over and over again till the end of time.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that this game is fun for a while, but don't get too invested. Maybe it's just me that came to this epiphany, but I hope that I warned you about his game.\n\nAlso I spent like $10 on this game, though I got 100hrs. out of it so I think it paid for itself.","November 9, 2015","false","113.1"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","14","23","3","0"

The cheesy "Ninjas Play Free" motto on the promos also threw me off.\n\nHowever, the fast-paced, third-person shooter & melee, high-tech space ninja, gameplay and creative design are both solid and entertaining. I am thoroughly hooked and addicted now.\n\nI've played quite a few free-to-play titles, and so far, Digital Extremes is my favorite f2p design team, with constant updates (weekly, plus hotfixes) and the right mix of Canadian humor & sarcasm thrown in to their interactions. Their customer support is also top notch (although limited to weekday business hours rather than 24/7).\n\nPeople complain about grind, but I am used to Korean and Japanese MMO grind, so the grind is near non-existant here for me, comparatively.  You'll usually get the drops you are looking for after a few runs, especially as DE continually tweaks and finetunes the drop tables. The procedurally generated levels & spawns keep things fresh, too.\n\nHardware:\n\nNvidia card recommended. It'll run well on GTX 400 series or better. I run it on a GTX 680 on max settings.\n\nThere are issues with AMD cards. You'll need to fiddle with the settings in the launcher and elsewhere to get an AMD card from crashing your game. The same goes for trying to play on older laptops.\n\nSpeaking of settings, turn off Motion Blur from the game settings. Do this now. Warframe Motion Blur is not traditional gaming Motion Blur but "destroy all retinas" Motion Blur, especially when you get some scrub Volt PUG spamming its Speed ability back to back like it is its only power or something and making your screen unplayable.\n\nYou will more than likely need to forward ports on your router to play with others, especially if your router is a few years old. You can select which ports are used in game and go from there. I used to get connection errors from time to time (even with in-game UPnP switched off) until I got a new router with better UDP protocols. Now I have no issues.\n\nGetting Started:\n\nSteam has some excellent Beginners Guides. I also found the Resource Farming Guide invaluable when I was leveling. I also recommend having the Warframe Wiki bookmarked as well. Good hunting, Tenno!","September 14, 2013","true","310.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Space ninjas. In all sincerity though, Warframe is an excellent title, it has great gameplay, smooth visuals, and works well even on somewhat older computers. Being a free to play game, you'd figure there would be "pay to win" items using micro-transactions. While micro-transactions do play a part in this game, it is entirely co-op, not competetive, so you aren't going to get wiped on the floor by someone because they shelled out some cash for goodies, because they will always be on YOUR team. And every equipable item in the marketplace that can be bought with premium cash can be crafted using blueprints, which you can buy in the marketplace for in-game credits. There are even some items only available through finding the blueprints for them in missions. All in all, Warframe is an amazing co-op experience, and while the game is technically still in beta and has a few bugs and glitches here and there, the developers are always on top of the situation, and regularly converse with members on the forums to weed them out. I would definitely reccomend a quick download of this game right away.

Everyone is friendly, even the veterans who are maxed ranks always are helpful. You will occasionally get a guy who just acts like he's better than everyone else and noone can climb his ego, but you get that anywhere. 9/10 for the community rating.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nExcellent mix of gunplay, melee combat, ability combat, and companion mechanics! Being able to slide around and jump 50 meters in the air, while shooting an enemy, slamming a giant axe down on another, then unleashing your ultimate on a group in front of you is just always satisfying. There is a variety of missions, weapons, Frames (basically characters), and items to keep you entertained for a long time, and although it does either take a TON of work and time to get these (this can also be bypassed completely by purchasing Platinum, one of the two in-game currencies), it still will keep you feeling acomplished and wanting more. There is also so many combinations/varieties of ways you can mod your weapons, frames, and even companions, to get some awesome buffs and an overall edge in combat. The combat mechanics gets a 10/10 because they literally give you so many combat options, and it is sooo much more polished than what it used to be a few years back.\n\nFree to Play? So it's Pay to Win right?:\n\nThe game is mainly a co-op game, and there really isn't a competitive aspect to it, so I wouldn't necessarily call it Pay to Win, I'd call it Pay to Skip weeks of hard work and frustration. It is 100% possible to obtain every single item in the game (minus exclusive frames/Items that aren't obtainable anymore, but may be at some point) without shelling out a pennie, but you would be talking months, maybe even a year to complete and catch up with the updates, which they are always adding new stuff to keep it fresh. You are able to obtain Platinum by completing missions and objectives to obtain Prime items (an upgraded version of a weapon/frame) and then sell them to other players in the trading channel for platinum. You could even merch off items if you had the time and bought the right items cheap and sell them for more. All in all, it's not a pay to win game and if you wanted to buy platinum, all you would be doing is supporting the development of the game and thanking them, in a way.\n\nNegatives/Complaints:\n\n-The modding system, crafting system, navigation, and sydicate system is criminally underexplained. They need to make it more friendly to new players and make a quest of some sort that has them upgrade a mod to complete a mission in some way and write a lot of dialogue for Ortis to explain how this system works, because I found myself reading the wiki, watching videos, and asking others how these things worked.\n\n-If you are someone who doesn't have a whole lot of time on their hands, you won't really be able to progress much in this game, because it takes a buttload of hard work and time to progress, without spending money on platinum. This game is all about the GRIND. If you don't have time, it will take you even longer to progress in this game.\n\n-At times, the missions become more and more repetitive and it starts to kill your motivation. They are at work at trying to improve these problems and I have faith that it can be done, with time.\n\nIn conclusion, I would rate the game 8/10. It has those 10/10 moments all the time though, so its a very full cup sitting at 8/10.

The lore is by far the most original thing in the game: how about a well mixed coctail made of space adventures, roman and japanese culture?

It's a Hack and Slash Third Person Shooter Game that it's polished and responsive. Fast paced combat, strong tactical elements and good graphics. To be perfectly honest, this game is really quite addicting that you have to grind items, mods, etc. The best part is that, once you reach higher levels. This is the part where you do cooperation and strategy to execute the plan, the Developers are actively adding content to the game which is quite awesome! make sure you play this game with your friends since players in the public game are always racing to the extraction point which includes leaving teammates behind, doesn't communicate and so on.\n\nGraphics are great and the level of combat is sweet! Downside is that, there is still few bugs left in this game so expect that to happened. Game is also F2P, you can get most of the items in this game by just getting Blueprints and so on. I recommended this game because Gameplay is really great, Graphics are stunning and the fact is this game is Literally FREE, adding more that i'd really recommend to play this with your friends.\n\nRated: 10/10","July 27, 2014","true","402.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is all about grinding. If you hate it, you should probably move on. I'd like to see which kind of f2p games that requires NO grinding whatsoever, even the paid games is having a lot of grinding elements these days.\n\nIf you're new to this, you'll suffer at the early stage of the game because you're lacking of mods/blueprints/credits/resources/level. But all of it will go away once you spent enough time grinding.\n\nIf you've already played this game before and felt like this game is all about pay-to-win and you're not going to reach their level, you're wrong. You can actually trade rare mods/parts/prime warframe parts/prime weapon parts for platinum (in game currency).\n\n[ How to Trade? ] You'll need a clan with a Trading Post in the clan's dojo. Yes, you'll need to build stuff (more grinding+time) in the dojo, you can however pick the easy way by joining a fully built up clan OR build everything by yourself/with friends etc.\n\nKindly use platinums for your slot since you can't get extra slot without using plats, only use plats to buy the Orokin Reactor/Catalyst If you can't wait for the Reactor/Catalyst blueprint alert. Trust me, you'll save a lot more if you wait for the alert. And if I may, please refrain from dropping your Orokin Catalyst on trash weapons, if you're doing it just for the #fun #3op5u #yolo #swag, it's your funeral.\n\nI believe I've gave out the important stuff, and I hope it helps. Have fun being a space ninja.\n\nThe good stuff is over and now i'm going to put on some heat. This game had problems with strictNAT/upnp/udp porting for some people (meaning you can't invite or join a session). And once it happens you'd better pray your fixing works or else you'll have trouble playing with other users. It's all over the official forum and the developers is obviously not going to fix it.

While the game DOES seem very cash-shop-heavy at first (especially to new players) all of the "best" equipment cannot be bought with cash and require a LOT of work to earn through gameplay. In addition ANY cash item can be earned through gameplay though many of them require the player to have access to several late-game missions.\nThe game is very team-based with most missions almost REQUIRING a team to complete.\nYour warframe (character/class),  weapons and sentinel (pet) each lvl up individually, higher lvls mean both higher stats and more upgrade points, which allow you to customise your stuff with various abilities/passive bonuses/etc. such as fire/ice/lightning damage on weapons, larger clips, longer blades, more hp, better shields, etc.\nThere's literally 100s of possible upgrades and you can switch/swap them as many times as you want.\nThe only thing I dislike about the game is the lack of variety in missions, there's a limited (small) number of maps which, though large and randomly setup have a lot of repeated rooms/corridors/visual styles, the enemy AI can surprise you sometimes but generally becomes very predictable in any given room/situation.\nThe warframes available at the start are relatively basic and it can take excessive amounts of time to reach bosses that drop the blueprints for ones you want, though the "best" warframe blueprints are still only available from end-game missions the availability of any other warframes in the cash shop makes you wonder if it's worth spending so much time trying to earn one of the more basic ones.\n\nOverall the game is good, a little repetitive and...while cash-based cash is NOT a requirement. 7/10.","December 13, 2013","true","51.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Space ninjas. In all sincerity though, Warframe is an excellent title, it has great gameplay, smooth visuals, and works well even on somewhat older computers. Being a free to play game, you'd figure there would be "pay to win" items using micro-transactions. While micro-transactions do play a part in this game, it is entirely co-op, not competetive, so you aren't going to get wiped on the floor by someone because they shelled out some cash for goodies, because they will always be on YOUR team. And every equipable item in the marketplace that can be bought with premium cash can be crafted using blueprints, which you can buy in the marketplace for in-game credits. There are even some items only available through finding the blueprints for them in missions. All in all, Warframe is an amazing co-op experience, and while the game is technically still in beta and has a few bugs and glitches here and there, the developers are always on top of the situation, and regularly converse with members on the forums to weed them out. I would definitely reccomend a quick download of this game right away.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laisaniah/recommended/230410/","Laisaniah","Fruitbowl M.D.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laisaniah/","154 products in account","A third person action shooter with a high pace of speed (at least in public games with randoms) that uses gear levelling as progress as well as it's endgame (the game IS the endgame, basically).\nThe crafting system provides you with said gear, while the business model allows you to skip this tedium by purchasing the items directly instead of crafting. That said, some of these can not be bought and in general require thorough effort to acquire.\n\nThe visual quality and other effects basically scream 'Triple A' while new events often keeps the playerbase interested. Many of these events are in fact 'previews' to an upcoming permant feature that eventually gets added.\n\nTo coincide with weaponry being the only way to progress or ‘level’, the developers churn out a steady stream of new weaponry and Warframes at frequent intervals, ready for you to directly buy, acquire a blueprint of to build or research in a clan Dojo lab.\n\nWarframes are ‘combat suits’, with each one differing from the other, primarily in their defensive stats as well as their four skills. Across this review, I refer to them as weapons as well.\n\nEverything that can be leveled can also be modded. This is done through a card system, with every weapon having a limited amount of ‘slots’ to have a card fitted in. These range from positively boosting stats, to adding elements (if the element wasn’t already present) such as fire, ice, shock or poison. In case of Warframes, these elemental additions are replaced with mod cards that represent their innate skills. These need to be fitted in in order to make use of said powers.\n\nThese cards can be leveled using mod cores so that the stats they influence are affected more greatly but requiring more mod points in return. With weapons having a mod point ceiling, a mod can still be put in a slot with a fitting polarity to halven their mod point requirement. These polarities can be added on a maxed weapon using Forma, which in return brings the weapon back to unleveled.\n\nThe main complaint with the game is that the developers seem to Nerf and Buff willy-nilly. Often noticing how a new weapon becomes insanely overpowered (or turns out to be painstakingly underpowered) in a way they hadn’t foreseen. The addition of Damage 2.0 (which makes maintaining optimal stats and damages more complicated) seems to have largely alleviated this issue of balancing, though it may still happen.\n\nThe aforementioned events are the main source of story and/or lore for the game. These progress the Warframe story in a way that never limits the current availability of features, but rather adds features. Such as a invasion/conflict of one enemy faction invading another enemy, allowing the ‘Tenno’ (the players) to support one faction and eliminate the other one on said mission ‘node’. These fights are constantly tallied and balanced out in a figurative ‘tug of war’, with the victorious faction taking claim of the node. Where future missions will involve said faction.\n\nWarframe mainly shines in the satisfaction in both creating and levelling your weaponry, allowing you to perfect your builds using Forma, keeping the player interested with the occasional new weapon or event.","April 27, 2013","true","943.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game is developed & published by Digital Extremes. They are well known for developing games like The Darkness II and hep with the development of the Unreal series. They also made Dark Sector which is basically a failed experiments and it sold poorly. Therefore they tried to make a spiritual successor of Dark Sector and it cames out Warframe. If you have play Dark Sector,you most likely see some resemblance to this game.\n\nGAMEPLAY : 9.5/10\n\nThis game is a mixture of Mass Effect shooting style of gameplay mixed with Mirror Edge parkour style combined together. What not to like ?\n\nAs you begin the game,you are given 3 different type of warframe to choose. Each has their own strength,weakness & ability power.\n\nAs you play further into the game,you obtain items which you can craft different type of warframe and weapon.\n\nIf you don't have the patient to craft that specific part of items,you could always buy a weapon by using in-game money but of course the warframe require real cash to obtain them.\n\nEven though the game doesn't have PvP at all,it is heavily focus on PvE.\n\nBasically there is a lot of planets to choose from however each of the planets is lock depending on how far you can get so there is some linearity on it. From there,it would provide a different variety of mode to play.\n\nAfter you finish those stage,a next one would unlock until you defeat the final boss. After that then you finally unlock another planet to choose from.\n\nYou able to melee enemy like a ninja ( though that will take more risk ) or you can just go gun-blazing. You can even go stealth mode but it not well implemented. Each warframes have their own unique power-ups you can use too.\n\nYou could either play solo ( which is basically like a single-player ) or you can play with random people.\n\nGRAPHICS : 9/10\n\nFor a free 2 play shooter,this game has one of the best realistic graphics i seen yet. The details put into this game are phenomenal such as the character,terrain,textures and weapon details. This game also support Physx which make the game even more beautiful with particles that look ten times better. This game also have gore feature which give feel of the game even more grimmer & brutal.\n\nI don't experience any major slowdowns and most of the time my frame rate is stable which mean the game is well optimized ( not for low end PC though ).\n\nThe interface or UI is extremely well done. You can also reduce the size of the HUD or even remove it completely to give it that cinematic look ( i wouldn't recommend turning off unless you want to be lost and not able to search for your teammates or objectives ).\n\nWhile some of the animations feel a bit off,most of them are executed very well and felt smooth especially performing parkour.\n\nAUDIO : 7/10\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is pretty ok,nothing special at all.\n\nThe guns effect have satisfying sound and it really deliver some impact when you shoot at your enemy.\n\nVoice acting is pretty good for the most part.

There is not much variety put into it despite the game offering you a lot of modes to play. Even playing with friends the game doesn't offer lasting enjoyment.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 7.6/10\n\nDigital Extremes prove themselves that they able to borrow some of the elements from Dark Sector and make their own spiritual successor ten times better. Every updates improves the game even further and it always gives a new fresh look. Despite the repetitive nature of the game,it offer an enjoyable combat and well thoughtful design choices.

Each suit has it's own use and purpose, for example Nova is a AOE suit and Rhino is a tank suit.\n\nThe maps are dynamic; they change everytime you play on them adding more depth to the gameplay. Plus there are tons of different types of enemies from 3 other factions (non-playable): Corpus, Infested and Grineer.\n\nThe corpus are a robot-like race, the Infested are well... Like the flood in Halo (they don't stop taking over lifeforms to take over more lifeforms) and the Grineer appear to be humans who have gone berserk and have tried to remove all other lifeforms in our solar system (With a few planets extra, even Pluto).\n\nDespite it only saying I've played about 0hrs as of today 21/12/13 I've actually played it off steam for over 200hrs...

In one years time the game size has grown from 1 gig to 6. The game population has grown from 100k to 10 million. The core of the game has snowballed and grown without sacrafice. It is legitimately playable for free; you can beat the game with the starting gear; you can obtain any gear in the game without paying.\n\nIt looks amazing, has low requirements, is played as coop or competative based on how you want to play. It brings no new concepts that i am able to observe, however it brings concepts together that have never been combined in mass or on this scale. It combines these pieces with a precision and dependability I have never befor encountered. I would go into description of these details but they are to numerous to name, and are best observed by playing the game.\n\nIf you don't like warframe now, you should check back in one year.

There are only about 4 or 5 different kind of missions to do, and each planet has them repeatedly. The only thing interesting after a while is getting new weapons, which aren't really all that different from each other.

It is constantly getting new weapons and new warframes for you to play with. It's a wonderful waste of time, but it's very intimidating to do if you don't have a good group of friends willing to assist you with goals you want to accomplish. Starting the game, you'll likely be overwhelmed by the choices and the customization, every game starts like that.\nBut once you can get through that, over the hump of the starter warframes..\n\nEverything becomes more entertaining. I used this game as a breaker between tough games I was playing. (Darksouls, STALKER mods, and Hello Kitty Adventures.) and used it as a stress relief, but once I got into it, I saw that they had put much more into it than I had thought. The lore for this game is incredible. I'll just say that right now.\n\nDownsides, though.\nThere's a lot of bugs you will experience, as new content is polished between patches, and there is an overwhelming sense of 'why am i doing any of this' in the beginning. [that's also a part of the lore, imagine that] There's no real variation in where you want to advance through the star-map until you hit earth, and there's just TOO MANY THINGS TO CHOOSE FROM AT ONE TIME. I was lucky enough to have a grasp on the game really early, but I sparsely played it. And some things you might want are only obtainable through real money. (Colours, certain helmets, profile pictures, along with other things) but there are "Alerts" that'll give you occasional chances to find things you want. Helmets, (Nightmare) mods, warframe parts, or just more cash.\n\ntl;dr, as with each game, there are tradeoffs. but it's free, at least try it, you panzy.","March 15, 2014","true","754.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It’s a game which requires you to grind constantly and has a high variety of weapons, dungeons and other ways to entertain you. From level 1 you start fighting killing monsters, and during your progress you constantly learn new things.\n\nThe importance of weapons, cards is not well emphasised on during the game but through time you realize how you can combine and build weapons with things called potatoes, which allow you to put more points for cards on your weapon you can build up and get stronger. You have a high variety of classes, more overpowered than others sure why not especially on duelling when you can just one shot people with certain weapons and classes.\n\nIn terms of the trading system, this game is lacking highly and needs a trading market. Everything is currently done via spamming on the chat channels and it’s very irritating and annoying. Guilds become essential since it’s easier to find things from people in there. Alternatively, the guild system is amazing, you can do so much as a guild and entering your dojo. I've spend probably good few hours looking at some high level guild dojo's and how they are formed. Loyalty is very important so find one you enjoy and stick to it otherwise it’s easy to make enemies.\n\nFinding good weapons is not easy, as mentioned grinding is essential so find friends, share keys you find in worlds and this way you will get your stuff quicker. Some keys are more important than others same way some cards are stronger than others and you need to be careful the way you trade and use them. 1 key = 1 entry of your entire party but if somebody lies and just joins for free entries that could be very irritating, this is why some people ask you to proof.\n\nThere is much more about this game but if you want to learn more about it, feel free to try it out and enjoy it. I sort of got bored at the end but that’s because I’m not that patient about grinding.\n\nIn terms of Graphics, this game has done an outstanding job with all the different worlds, physics and details of every area, monster and pet. There is high variety for everything, it doesn’t require much if you put on low but if you have a good PC and put it on max it shows some outstanding details allowing you to really get into the game.\n\nGraphics – 9/10\nAudio 8/10\nGameplay 6/10 (Only because I don’t like much grinding)\nVariety 8/10\n\nFinal Verdict 8/10 would play again if a friend really asks me to :)","August 1, 2015","true","433.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Though just to make it clear, I might get one or two things wrong about what I know during this so just bear with me.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTHE GAME:\n\nSo how do I explain Warframe? To put it in simple terms, It's a game about some kickass space ninjas.\n\nYou play as a Tenno, You have been in cryosleep for decades until you are finally awoken by a character we known only as The Lotus, Your guide through this journey. As you are awoken, you are giving a choice between three different suits, which are called Warframes that allow you to channel power, and three different weapons in primary, secondary and melee.\n\nYou are a defender of the Solar System and all its inhabitants, You will find yourself travelling to all kinds of different planets in our Solar System, Earth, Mercury, Mars, Pluto and so on.\n\nSo far, There are five different factions in the game, Four of them are your enemies which you must defend the System from.\n\nTenno, Grineer, Corpus, Infected & Orokin, Each with all of their own unique units and bosses. Tenno is the race that you play for, So you will not be finding any other Tenno units as enemies during Gameplay, Unless you count PVP, Where you fight other Tenno warriors in online battle.\n\nSo, You've picked your Warframe and your weapons, you've completed the tutorial, Now you have your personal stealth ship, The Liset, Controlled by your (un)trustworthy companion, Ordis, a computer AI.

Though just to make it clear, I might get one or two things wrong about what I know during this so just bear with me.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTHE GAME:\n\nSo how do I explain Warframe? To put it in simple terms, It's a game about some kickass space ninjas.\n\nYou play as a Tenno, You have been in cryosleep for decades until you are finally awoken by a character we known only as The Lotus, Your guide through this journey. As you are awoken, you are giving a choice between three different suits, which are called Warframes that allow you to channel power, and three different weapons in primary, secondary and melee.\n\nYou are a defender of the Solar System and all its inhabitants, You will find yourself travelling to all kinds of different planets in our Solar System, Earth, Mercury, Mars, Pluto and so on.\n\nSo far, There are five different factions in the game, Four of them are your enemies which you must defend the System from.\n\nTenno, Grineer, Corpus, Infected & Orokin, Each with all of their own unique units and bosses. Tenno is the race that you play for, So you will not be finding any other Tenno units as enemies during Gameplay, Unless you count PVP, Where you fight other Tenno warriors in online battle.\n\nSo, You've picked your Warframe and your weapons, you've completed the tutorial, Now you have your personal stealth ship, The Liset, Controlled by your (un)trustworthy companion, Ordis, a computer AI. This ship is where you will be spending a lot of the game and is pretty much your main menu. From here you select planets and missions, you check the market for weapons and Warframes, You customize your gear in the back of the ship, You craft new weapons from materials you pick up in the game, you select mods to put on your equipment or sell or even transmute them into better cards.

I loved the multi-player in Mass Effect 3 and, for me, this is very reminiscent of that game, but with  more options in mission types, maps and character & weapon options.\n\nBe warned, the character progression can be a little slow at first but really opens up after you collect enough credits, blueprints and resources to start crafting in earnest.  Just keep moving along with the missions. You'll have an generous number of warframe and weapon blueprints after you finish the missions on the first 4-5 planets.  I'd recommend staying in online mode as you can move through the missions more smoothly with a group (and it's more fun).   I've only rarely run into a bad/abusive player as the community for this game is surprisingly good.\n\nDon't spend you Platinum (real world cash) on characters or weapons!

When I first saw it, I expected it to be a run-of-the-mill sort of PvP Free to Play game that is attempting to mirror the style of Team Fortress 2,  a titan of F2P. But, I gave it a chance and boy was I wrong. This Co-operative space ninja game with out-of-this-world graphics blew me away and I asked my friend that surely they would charge money for this but he said, "Free forever, forever fun."\n\nThe customization of this is astounding from various weapons, colors, materials, and even warframes (which are utilitzed as weapons too). The game designers also implemented loot rooms in the more difficult "Void" tilesets that require you to use your Warframe's ability to basically do parkour to go places where you typically wouldn't think. Personally, it feels like if Mirror's Edge and Team Fortress 2 birthed a demigod of a child that had some awesome genetic mutations.\n\nI currently have logged over a hundred hours and with the release of Update 11, I'm predicting many more.\n\nMy rating? 10/10 for superb graphics, engrossing gameplay, and endless customization.","November 26, 2013","true","116.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

It's free to play so you can't complain about it. The game can be played in singleplayer or with other people(max 4 in group). Playing with others makes the game more fun. There is no vs in the game aside from some dueling areas. These are optional though. The rest of the game is co-op. Parkour your way through the levels and find the secret locations on the levels. They will mostly reward you with extra credits from lockers and such.\n\nThere are different planets and different factions. There will be some repetitive rooms here and there that you will notice. But the room layouts is always random. Clear all the levels and upgrade your weapons and warframes. Craft or buy more weapons and warframes when needed.\n\nUpgrades are done by levelling up the weapon or warframe to max level 30. For each level you will get a mod point. With a mod point you can add mods you collect during the levels. Each mod adds something to the weapon/warframe. For example: Fire damage, higher crit rate, more health, ect. Mods can be upgraded to a certain level. Once you reached the max level of a weapon/warframe, you can change the add or change a symbol of one of the mod slots. but this will reset the weapon level back to 0. I will leave a link at the end of the Warframe Wikia\n\nThere is a lot of content in the game that will keep you going for a while. Getting craftin matarials, completing levels, playing hardcore levels and go to the Void. which are harder areas but they repay you better.\n\nThere are 2 different kind of ingame currency. Thos are Credits and Platium. Credits you will get by completing levels or selling your stuff. With the credits you are able to buy blueprints and stuff from the clan you joined. Platium is used to buy the weapons and warframes directly. Without any need of crafting them with a blueprint. It saves a lot of time. But Platium can only be obtained by buying them with real money. Luckely you aren't able to buy the best stuff. There are better weapons and warframes obtainable in the game which requires you to play.\n\nIt's hard to go into the details of the game. It's better to read a guide. Luckely they have an in-game tutorial in the game which explains you the basics. The rest you have to figure out yourself. Reading a bit on the Warframe Wikia is usefull. I did this a lot and I still use it here and there.\n\nI would say you should definitely try out the game. It's free so what do you have to lose. They are updating the game pretty often. Mostly fixes and small things. But every 2-3 months they will release a big update. Check the game out, grab some friends to play with and enjoy the game~\n\nWarframe Wikia[warframe.wikia.com]","November 26, 2013","true","145.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

It can only be used effectively by charging it, but you cannot hold a charge so theres really no point in using it. This wouldnt be SUCH a big deal but....\n-The gunplay is horrible and not at all thought out. It seems to have pulled right out of a dollar bin third person shooter, which reminds me\n-The enemies lack any variety, and are all pretty much just bullet tanks dispatched in massive numbers purely to make up for how utterly stupid they are.\n-The game doesnt explain itself for crap. One issue I keep finding is that im getting missions with level ranges like "11-20" but I have no idea what level I am. There are two systems which act like leveling (one for your weapons and suits, one for...something) but neither are called by that name or identified as being this level the game speaks of.\n-Grind, Grind, Grind. You do NOT put grinding in an action game, what the hell were they thinking? (of course you can skip the grind if you lay down a fat stack)\n\nThe sad part is that many of the games problems are not even hard to fix. Simply making it a pvp game where two PLAYER sides fight for territory would make the game instantly worth playing, but without that its hard to recommend because youll just waste your time mindlessly shooting at equally mindless enemies while flipping and sliding around to convince yourself you can find a new experience in the game.","January 1, 2014","false","20.0"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","3"

The biggest thing that jumps out at you is that this isn't a game that has grind, it's a game that was built around grind as a primary design mechanic, and overall purpose in the game. I don't mean Diablo or Borderlands type grind, but incredibly dull, mindless, painful grind, where often the best option, is very low level missions you can just tear apart with ease, or to just leech away in public games.\n\nWhile it has a number of nice concepts, it unfortunately fails to execute them very well. Worst among those being the painfully grind centric, and RNG related progression mechanic, rather limited variety of loot that feels more like resource gathering, than loot collecting, and the overall poor game balance. Although this is shaping up to be one of those infinite beta type games (with a functioning cash shop), as there's always various aspects marked as coming soon, currently being redesigned, or reredesigned. With some of the changes forcing you to wonder if much thought went into them at all, while others are seemingly focused on just looking cool, rather than if it would be an enjoyable game mechanic.\n\nThe "Space Ninjas" thing is a marketing gimmick, as stealth in the game is not a good option, and only semi-functional in one of the mission types. Although if you play with others they always just charge in with guns blazing like space marines. Mob AI is inept, they like to run in circles, then often take cover while standing behind explosive barrels, things that only cover their lower half, or just right out in the open. The parkour only sort of works, some of the time, the rest of the time it either doesn't trigger, or slingshots you off at mach 10. Warframe certainly has it's fair share of bugs in general. I have all too often had to abort a mission, giving up all my item rewards, because the door to the next area wouldn't open, the last mob was stuck underground, the next sequence didn't trigger, or so on.\n\nIt might shape up to be a really good game at some point along the line, should it ever get out of beta, and they really sit down to figure out how to get everything to work together effectively. Although, as it is right now, I couldn't recommend this to anyone.","January 6, 2014","false","343.4"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","15","26","2","3"

They've managed to make it free to play without making it pay to win, so props to Digital Extremes for that. There's a huge variety of ways to play this game, and there is no single best playstyle. Whether you like to stay unseen and pick off your enemies from a safe distance or you just want to get in your enemies' faces, whether you like to play co-op or solo, you can do all of it, and all of it very well. Its gameplay is an absolute blast. Space ninjas are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. It's a bit of a work in progress, and DE periodically releases huge updates that greatly improve it. I have few complaints about this game, but it does have flaws. The first one is an almost absolute lack of story. It has a good introduction, but then it just kind of throws you out to a solar system filled with seemingly out-of-place boss battles, some of which just seem a too hastily thrown together. It also has numerous logical fallicies, such as how it's always snowing on Venus. My last complaint is that it's pure grind. You spend the whole game farming resources and leveling up your stuff so you can get better stuff. If you're willing to overlook its flaws, and are willing to accept it as a work in progress, you will have a great time with this game.","October 16, 2014","true","215.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not every body suffer the same fate but I am one of the sufferer.\n\n1. How It Likes Gameplay is simple; shooting, slashing, smashing a typical 3rd person shooting game with some decent Ninja elements such as swordplay and wall jumping. Basically,you will doing the same thing (shooting stuffs or smashing them) over and over again. However, the game offers variety by there are so many different characters (we call it a frame) and so many weapons to choose. And most people often refers to a space ninja game. So it's a ninja doing stuffs in a space.\n\n2. Fun Part2.1 Variety\nEverybody have the different fun part. As I mentioned the game is nothing more but shoot or slash. So what make you happy will be what frame you use and how you modified your frame. Each frames have different skills and stats which mean they can kill things differently. You have to find what you like. However, there are some frames which is a must for everyone to have but you can collect so many frames at the same time. And you can switch it between mission upon your need. Same idea with the weapons, there are ton of them.\n\nSo the fun part is about trying it out how you like each frames or weapons. But if you don't have funs with playing with different frames. This game may not for you since the rest is about shooting things. Nothing special.\n\n2.2 Free To Play\nMoreover, the game is free to play so you can try it out any time.\n\n3. Annoying Part3.1 Graphic Options\nFor game graphic, it is about how you like it. Because enable every options on graphic may not be the best for you. You have to adjust it. Basically it's nice but something is too real for game like this. For example, the motion blur. It's not fun when everything around you get blur when you turn around and shooting things.\n\n3.2 Internet Speed\nI know this may be about me but hey ... I'm one of the player. It's about internet connection speed if you play with a people on a differnt region you could suffer a lag. But not so much but still it is annoyting when you have a team but you are on different region and you can't play together very well.\n\n3.3 Game Development\nThe game is on progress project. So something in the game still can change at any moment. But those are for improvement which is understandable but it could annoy you.\n\n3.4 Community Features\nLack of non-gameplay features. Such as community features. Sending in game email to player, auction houses. Something like that. The game offers a chat room and a guild and you can do something in the guild. However, this is a multiplayer game, a community feature is vital but... everyone live like this for years ... it's ok but I feel like missing some features that the other games commonly have.\n\n3.5 Farming\nAs I mentioned the game offers you a veriety of frames and weapons. But these things come from framing it and trust me. Sometime, it takes forever. Hoever, you can buy it using a few dollor so this could be an annoyting part but you can solve it using real money. The choie is yours.\n\n4. Give It A TryTry it, if you like to modifying things. If you love game where you can modify things, the game is for you. There are tons of things to collect and modify. But the game play is simple and repeatitive. So as I metioned the fun part is doing the same thing a different way.","November 6, 2014","true","538.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/THEROBONATOR/recommended/230410/","THEROBONATOR","Robonator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/THEROBONATOR/","245 products in account","There is a reason why this is my all time favourite Free2Play game. It is just badass.\nI think i never had that much fun with a F2P Game.\n\nThe Game changed alot over the past 2 Years and i think there is no F2P developer that is similar to Digital Extremes.\nDE has a very friendly and cool staff, they do lots of Livestreams/Developer Streams, they answer question and actually listen to the community.\n\nThe Economy of Warframe is really fair and you don't have to pay a single cent if you don't want to. You can also earn the real money currency called "Platin" by just trading with other players and selling them parts for Weapons for an example.\nThis Platin is used to buy Skins, Colors, Gearslots and it can also be used to buy Weapons or Ressources but you really don't have to because you can get nearly everything by just playing the Game. There are a few exceptions but those exceptions can't be bought with Platin either. Those are things from Events or from the old Founders Packages.\n\nIf you do decide to buy Platin then its worth to wait a bit because you get discounts from the login rewards from time to time and they go from 20% up to 75% meaning that you can basically buy a 180€ Platinpack for only 45€. You also get alot for your money, for an example: In the Platinpack for 180/45€ you get about 4300 Platin. A Slot for a Weapon or a Warframe costs around 10-20 Platin. Skins or other visual things are at around 50-75 Platin. You might need some Platin if you decide to buy Reactors or Catalyst, which are used to enhance a Weapon or Warframe. Those can be used one time on a weapon and cost both 20 Platin, but there are lots of events and i think one special mission each week where you can get one.\nDepending on how motivated you are this amount of Platin could be enough for a looong time and you are also able to earn more by trading with players.\n\nNow a bit more to the Game itself:\n\nWarframe is a Coop Multiplayer Game that can be played alone or up to 4 other Players.\nYou are basically a space ninja, called Tenno.\nYou are able to use all kinds of Weapons either melee or ranged or even both combined. Machine Guns, Swords, Lasers, Revolvers, Rocket Launchers, Scythes, Axes there is nearly every Weapontype you can think of and new content keeps getting released. You are basically able to play the Game however you want, even though it might be a bit hard depending on your type of enemy.\nIn the first few hours of the game you will grind yourself through different kind of Missions while following a Questline. The tutorials are pretty new and not really good at all, but at least have some kind of Tutorial now. Before that you had a little introduction and then it was basically "gl hf now go"\nEvery now and then you unlock a Bossfight. Those bosses are a special kind of enemy and can be pretty hard, especially for newer players. They also have the possibility to drop Blueprints or Parts for new Weapons or Warframe.\nEvery Weapon and Warframe etc that you can't just buy straight from the market, needs to be build in the Foundry. The Blueprints you need for that can be found on the Market, in Clan Dojos and their Researchingstations, in Bossfights or in the Void. I will talk about the Void later.\nTo Build something you need to gather Ressources or other Parts for it first. Then it takes about 24h or 3x 12h + 1x 36h, for Warframes, to finish. While playing the Missions you will also find Mods for your Gear that is used to enhance it.\n\nAfter a while you might have gathered some decent Mods to upgrade your Gear. As soon as you are strong enough, you want to enter the Void or the Orokin Derelicts. Those are a special kind of Missions and they are basically the Endgame. The strongest Weapons and Warframes can be found in the Void while some of the most important Mods are found in the Orokin Derelicts. Those are Places with pretty tough enemies and maybe even deadly traps.\nDepending on the Mission you choose, you can get a wide variety of rewards.\n\nBesides your Weapons you also have to level up your Account itself. It's used to be able to use special kinds of Weapons that require a specific level before you can use them. To level your Account you have to level your Gear.\nMost people build and gather every piece of Equipment and level them up to their max level to push their own Accountlevel as high as its possible.\nThats why most people try to collect every weapon as possible to level them up to their max.\nThe main focus of the game might be the collecting of Gear and Mods to level up and make ones equipment as powerful as possible.\n\nIf you don't mind spending lots of hours into farming Ressources or Equipment then i would totally recommend this Game to you, but even if you don't like farming stuff: Give it a few hours like 20 or so. Most people i know didn't really stopped to play after they got used to it.\n\nIf you are still unsure: Look at the amount of positive reviews and the average playtime of those people.","February 14, 2015","true","716.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SandmanEnterprises/recommended/230410/","SandmanEnterprises","Shadow Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SandmanEnterprises/","89 products in account","Warframe. This is an peculiar little game. What is so strange or not usual about it is that it's focused a lot on gunplay and ability usage between players across more than 200+ mission map tiles. I will review this game by different mechanics/parts of the game with a rating system of 10 points and I will pull the average for the game. Oh, and before you read, FORGET THE SLOGAN. This game is NOT even Ninja-themed because the stealth elements and the overwhelming amount of brutal killing missions implies that the Tenno aren't even meant to be Ninjas, but instead, somewhat Samurai-based. Even the lore confirms that.\n\nMAP TILES: 3 out of 10\nThe map tiles in the game are really original, and interesting as well as have a bit of an exploration, however, when it comes to variation between planets, they're a massive letdown. What I mean is, they don't fit the planets they're on, they don't offer any diversity by planet and overall they feel somewhat strictly limited.\nEXAMPLE: Mercury is supposed to be this super-scorched planet right next to the Sun, however, the game doesn't offer any visuals on Mercury's surface or the size of the Sun when you are playing on Mercury.\n\nGUN VARIATION: 9 out of 10\nPossibly one of the best things this game does right is the gun variation. You get dozens of different guns, normal versions and Prime variants and all of them are equally exciting. Some are very weak with base damage, but offer destructive critical damage, or are simply awesome in basic damage but lack in critical or status damage. It's shy of a 10 because some guns just fall short of their value entirely and are pretty much useless.\n\nMODDING: 10 out of 10\nThis part of the game is simply awesomely executed, and when I mean awesome is that NO OTHER GAME COMPARES to this mechanic. Modding features mod cards that offer different upgrades for your weapon, for your Warframe, for your Sentinel or your pet Kubrow (Space dog). Your builds are heavily dependent on which mod cards you apply for any piece of your equipment and if at least one card is wrong, the entire build will not work as planned. You can apply only 8 mod cards per piece of equipment, and there is a ''power limit'' of 30 units. The power used is determined by the value of the mod card. Power limit can be doubled by applying an Orokin Reactor (On Warframes, Sentinels and Kubrows, also known as a gold potato) or an Orokin Catalyst (Applied on weapons, also known as a blue potato). Warframes have aura slots which grant an additional passive boost (for example, energy regeneration or armor decrease for enemies) and offer additional power limit boost depending on the mod slot's polarity or the rank of your aura card.\n\nWARFRAME VARIATION: 10 out of 10\nNot a single Warframe feels like a copy of another and that is something I've seen rarely in any other game. For example, you have the Volt who is an electricity-based Warframe and spits out electricity with high damage, or you have Mesa who is a gunslinger and focuses on gun-play and buffs damage and so on. This is a great feat that the developers achieved and that's why it deserves 10 points.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION: 5 out of 10\nIt's not too bad, but it isn't anything to be proud of either. Customization in this game so limited, and, as a matter of fact, ugly with issues, that it barely deserves 5 points. Its only saving grace is the few sets of plates and Syandanas (like discount capes) that make your Warframes appear quite good. The severe lack of any good or real decorations or greaves and gauntlets and stuff also makes me quite frustrated because I can't make damn near any Warframe look good with the given accessories. Personally, I want SPARTAN-IV-esque armor pieces perfectly crafted to fit any Warframe (Like armored greaves, chest sections, gauntlets, thigh armor and arm armor as well as shoulder pads) with greater variation and such, but my point stands, this isn't the best part of Warframe yet. Customization also falls short, because you can't customize your guns to feature scopes, underbarrel attachments, silencers or heavier barrels, flashlights (which just happen to pop out of nowhere in dark missions) or laser points.\n\nPARKOUR: 6 out of 10\nParkour in this game is just basic with vaulting, wallrunning and wallclimbing without any other really awesome feats of physical conditioning and training and such. What would perfectly suit Warframe would be something taken out of the latest Assassin's Creed games - the parkour mechanics that include different vaulting animations each time, as well as enhanced wall-climbing with the ability to grab on to a ledge and hold on to it, say, for stealth, or with the ability to scale high surfaces that would otherwise be unaccessible by typical wall-climbing as well as brand new map tiles to complement the enhanced wall-climbing mechanic and additional stealth features.\n\nMISSION VARIATION: 3 out of 10\nExterminate, Capture, Rescue, Spy, Deception, Defense, Mobile Defense, Survival, Sabotage, Hijack, Hive, Assassination, Excavation, Interception. What do they have in common with one another? Total unoriginality (Murderfest). Sure, Exterminate, Defense, Rescue, Hive and Sabotage are the ones that fit with the overall Murderfest theme, but not the others. The developers continuously say this game is based around Ninjas (Shinobi, for those Japanese speakers that don't fully understand English), but where is this Ninja-themed game that we've been hoping to play? I kind of don't see it at all. There must be a total rework of all game modes.\n\nSTEALTH MECHANICS: 2 out of 10\nFor a Ninja-based game, stealth is severely lacking in this game. There are only two Warframes that can achieve absolute Ninja-level stealth in this game (Ash and Loki, coupled with bows, kunai and any melee). The game is out for three years, in development for far longer, and the most trademarked asset of this game is possibly the worst mechanic out of every one in the game. You cannot hide anywhere, there is a severe lack of weapons with silent fire, or better yet, ABSOLUTELY NO SILENCERS in the game, so you literally have to rely on a melee weapon or pick a weapon that you might not be good with, but want to play with your favorite one.\n\nQUESTS: 7 out of 10\nNow, the quests in Warframe look cheap and they come out once a month, even though it would probably take precisely six days to finish one of these quests at most. That is not to say they are not entertaining as, in fact, they provide some replay value and an interesting change from the usually silent missions and offer a slight increase in overall dialogue and that's the quest saving grace, however, none of these quests really offer an explanation as to why and how you were born/made and so on and instead they act as fillers or something, even though the developers probably didn't want that.\n\nARCHWING (Space sections): 5 out of 10\nArchwings are a really annoying part of the game. They're like jetpacks with Korean MMO-style wings which quite doesn't seem right in an IP like this. It feels out of place on a massive level. Most of the players don't even like Archwing as a matter of fact, and consider it to be a massive shortcoming of Warframe. The most preferable replacement for the space sections would be starfighters with actual cannons, missiles and afterburners instead of this, but Archwings are better than nothing.\n\nTHE FINAL RATING - 6 out of 10.\nWarframe is still a game that's under heavy development (lazy development at that), but it's a perfect filler game while you wait for some grander releases that might dwarf Warframe and its community once and for all. Warframe isn't bad, it isn't perfect, and it's a pretty much slightly-above-average as a game for me, but you can definitely play it.","February 8, 2015","true","292.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

They also have the possibility to drop Blueprints or Parts for new Weapons or Warframe.\nEvery Weapon and Warframe etc that you can't just buy straight from the market, needs to be build in the Foundry. The Blueprints you need for that can be found on the Market, in Clan Dojos and their Researchingstations, in Bossfights or in the Void. I will talk about the Void later.\nTo Build something you need to gather Ressources or other Parts for it first. Then it takes about 24h or 3x 12h + 1x 36h, for Warframes, to finish. While playing the Missions you will also find Mods for your Gear that is used to enhance it.\n\nAfter a while you might have gathered some decent Mods to upgrade your Gear. As soon as you are strong enough, you want to enter the Void or the Orokin Derelicts. Those are a special kind of Missions and they are basically the Endgame. The strongest Weapons and Warframes can be found in the Void while some of the most important Mods are found in the Orokin Derelicts. Those are Places with pretty tough enemies and maybe even deadly traps.\nDepending on the Mission you choose, you can get a wide variety of rewards.\n\nBesides your Weapons you also have to level up your Account itself. It's used to be able to use special kinds of Weapons that require a specific level before you can use them. To level your Account you have to level your Gear.\nMost people build and gather every piece of Equipment and level them up to their max level to push their own Accountlevel as high as its possible.\nThats why most people try to collect every weapon as possible to level them up to their max.\nThe main focus of the game might be the collecting of Gear and Mods to level up and make ones equipment as powerful as possible.\n\nIf you don't mind spending lots of hours into farming Ressources or Equipment then i would totally recommend this Game to you, but even if you don't like farming stuff: Give it a few hours like 20 or so. Most people i know didn't really stopped to play after they got used to it.\n\nIf you are still unsure: Look at the amount of positive reviews and the average playtime of those people.","February 14, 2015","true","716.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Farlander13/recommended/230410/","Farlander13","Farlander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Farlander13/","445 products in account","Normally, when you write a review for a game, it's a one and done sort of thing.\nWarframe, however, has surprised me, because it has proven to evolve so quickly, in the space of half a year, Warframe has transformed so drastically, it has practically become a whole new game.\n\nAnd the changes have only been good!\nAs always, the graphics are impeccible, but efficient. Despite the fact that Warframe still insists it is a beta, this game has more quality then many games I've played that are not betas.\nWhile it still lacks it's story mode, and still lacks its endgame, there's more than enough content to keep anyone occupied for quite awhile.\n\nAs most people probably already know, Warframe allows you to take control of a Tenno, basically a space ninja, and from there you face off against legions of enemies, using both melee and guns.\n\nWith more weapons and warframes then you'll be likely to know what to do with, achieving Warframe's overarching goal of mastering them all will alone tide you over for a long time.\nSome say Warframe is grindy, and it can be, though it is only mildly grindy, and it is becoming less grindy with each passing month.\nThe primary reason warframe is somewhat grindy at the moment, and was even more grindy in the past, is that Warframe is always growing and evolving. Back in Closed Beta, there was virtually no content. There was one map, and 3 mission types. So you can imagine how grindy it felt to level up all the gear, piece by piece, mission by mission, doing the same missions over and over.\nBut they've added to the Warframe experience since then. Now there's many more missions to do, many more places to go, many more things to kill, and many, many more toys to play with.\n(By toys I mean weapons, and by play with...well, you get it.)\n\nSo sure, the game still revolves around killing baddies with an awesome powersuit, but there's just so much to kill, and so many ways to do it....\nThe developers behind this game have proven, time and time again, that there is nothing that they feel is beyond the reach of this game, the most recent example of their ambition being the ArchWing expansion for Warframe, in which the Tenno added deep space flight to their already impressive list of abilities.\n\nTo sum up the gameplay of Warframe, it is an action packed, diverse and highly unique experience, with a broad difficulty curve.\n\nWarframe also offers an admirable monetization scheme, among the fairest I've seen.\nWhile Warframe will accept money in exchance for almost anything, Warframe strives to allow players who are unable or unwilling to pay cash to still be able to have everything the paid players do.\nWhether it's obtained via crafting, rare drops, secret locations, or merely trading items for platinum, with you can then use to buy what you want, you won't find a single pay-wall in Warframe, not even where the costumes are concerned.\n\nIn short, Warframe is a triumph of both game design, and proper execution of the F2P model.\nAs it continues to grow and evolve for another year, if you haven't played Warframe, I highly recommend that you do. And if you have, and for whatever reason thought it unremarkable, then I would suggest that you try it again...you won't recognize it.","December 22, 2013","true","159.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SandmanEnterprises/recommended/230410/","SandmanEnterprises","Shadow Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SandmanEnterprises/","89 products in account","Warframe. This is an peculiar little game. What is so strange or not usual about it is that it's focused a lot on gunplay and ability usage between players across more than 200+ mission map tiles. I will review this game by different mechanics/parts of the game with a rating system of 10 points and I will pull the average for the game. Oh, and before you read, FORGET THE SLOGAN. This game is NOT even Ninja-themed because the stealth elements and the overwhelming amount of brutal killing missions implies that the Tenno aren't even meant to be Ninjas, but instead, somewhat Samurai-based. Even the lore confirms that.\n\nMAP TILES: 3 out of 10\nThe map tiles in the game are really original, and interesting as well as have a bit of an exploration, however, when it comes to variation between planets, they're a massive letdown. What I mean is, they don't fit the planets they're on, they don't offer any diversity by planet and overall they feel somewhat strictly limited.\nEXAMPLE: Mercury is supposed to be this super-scorched planet right next to the Sun, however, the game doesn't offer any visuals on Mercury's surface or the size of the Sun when you are playing on Mercury.\n\nGUN VARIATION: 9 out of 10\nPossibly one of the best things this game does right is the gun variation. You get dozens of different guns, normal versions and Prime variants and all of them are equally exciting. Some are very weak with base damage, but offer destructive critical damage, or are simply awesome in basic damage but lack in critical or status damage. It's shy of a 10 because some guns just fall short of their value entirely and are pretty much useless.\n\nMODDING: 10 out of 10\nThis part of the game is simply awesomely executed, and when I mean awesome is that NO OTHER GAME COMPARES to this mechanic. Modding features mod cards that offer different upgrades for your weapon, for your Warframe, for your Sentinel or your pet Kubrow (Space dog). Your builds are heavily dependent on which mod cards you apply for any piece of your equipment and if at least one card is wrong, the entire build will not work as planned. You can apply only 8 mod cards per piece of equipment, and there is a ''power limit'' of 30 units. The power used is determined by the value of the mod card. Power limit can be doubled by applying an Orokin Reactor (On Warframes, Sentinels and Kubrows, also known as a gold potato) or an Orokin Catalyst (Applied on weapons, also known as a blue potato). Warframes have aura slots which grant an additional passive boost (for example, energy regeneration or armor decrease for enemies) and offer additional power limit boost depending on the mod slot's polarity or the rank of your aura card.\n\nWARFRAME VARIATION: 10 out of 10\nNot a single Warframe feels like a copy of another and that is something I've seen rarely in any other game. For example, you have the Volt who is an electricity-based Warframe and spits out electricity with high damage, or you have Mesa who is a gunslinger and focuses on gun-play and buffs damage and so on. This is a great feat that the developers achieved and that's why it deserves 10 points.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION: 5 out of 10\nIt's not too bad, but it isn't anything to be proud of either. Customization in this game so limited, and, as a matter of fact, ugly with issues, that it barely deserves 5 points. Its only saving grace is the few sets of plates and Syandanas (like discount capes) that make your Warframes appear quite good. The severe lack of any good or real decorations or greaves and gauntlets and stuff also makes me quite frustrated because I can't make damn near any Warframe look good with the given accessories. Personally, I want SPARTAN-IV-esque armor pieces perfectly crafted to fit any Warframe (Like armored greaves, chest sections, gauntlets, thigh armor and arm armor as well as shoulder pads) with greater variation and such, but my point stands, this isn't the best part of Warframe yet. Customization also falls short, because you can't customize your guns to feature scopes, underbarrel attachments, silencers or heavier barrels, flashlights (which just happen to pop out of nowhere in dark missions) or laser points.\n\nPARKOUR: 6 out of 10\nParkour in this game is just basic with vaulting, wallrunning and wallclimbing without any other really awesome feats of physical conditioning and training and such. What would perfectly suit Warframe would be something taken out of the latest Assassin's Creed games - the parkour mechanics that include different vaulting animations each time, as well as enhanced wall-climbing with the ability to grab on to a ledge and hold on to it, say, for stealth, or with the ability to scale high surfaces that would otherwise be unaccessible by typical wall-climbing as well as brand new map tiles to complement the enhanced wall-climbing mechanic and additional stealth features.\n\nMISSION VARIATION: 3 out of 10\nExterminate, Capture, Rescue, Spy, Deception, Defense, Mobile Defense, Survival, Sabotage, Hijack, Hive, Assassination, Excavation, Interception. What do they have in common with one another? Total unoriginality (Murderfest). Sure, Exterminate, Defense, Rescue, Hive and Sabotage are the ones that fit with the overall Murderfest theme, but not the others. The developers continuously say this game is based around Ninjas (Shinobi, for those Japanese speakers that don't fully understand English), but where is this Ninja-themed game that we've been hoping to play? I kind of don't see it at all. There must be a total rework of all game modes.\n\nSTEALTH MECHANICS: 2 out of 10\nFor a Ninja-based game, stealth is severely lacking in this game. There are only two Warframes that can achieve absolute Ninja-level stealth in this game (Ash and Loki, coupled with bows, kunai and any melee). The game is out for three years, in development for far longer, and the most trademarked asset of this game is possibly the worst mechanic out of every one in the game. You cannot hide anywhere, there is a severe lack of weapons with silent fire, or better yet, ABSOLUTELY NO SILENCERS in the game, so you literally have to rely on a melee weapon or pick a weapon that you might not be good with, but want to play with your favorite one.\n\nQUESTS: 7 out of 10\nNow, the quests in Warframe look cheap and they come out once a month, even though it would probably take precisely six days to finish one of these quests at most. That is not to say they are not entertaining as, in fact, they provide some replay value and an interesting change from the usually silent missions and offer a slight increase in overall dialogue and that's the quest saving grace, however, none of these quests really offer an explanation as to why and how you were born/made and so on and instead they act as fillers or something, even though the developers probably didn't want that.\n\nARCHWING (Space sections): 5 out of 10\nArchwings are a really annoying part of the game. They're like jetpacks with Korean MMO-style wings which quite doesn't seem right in an IP like this. It feels out of place on a massive level. Most of the players don't even like Archwing as a matter of fact, and consider it to be a massive shortcoming of Warframe. The most preferable replacement for the space sections would be starfighters with actual cannons, missiles and afterburners instead of this, but Archwings are better than nothing.\n\nTHE FINAL RATING - 6 out of 10.\nWarframe is still a game that's under heavy development (lazy development at that), but it's a perfect filler game while you wait for some grander releases that might dwarf Warframe and its community once and for all. Warframe isn't bad, it isn't perfect, and it's a pretty much slightly-above-average as a game for me, but you can definitely play it.","February 8, 2015","true","292.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Not every body suffer the same fate but I am one of the sufferer.\n\n1. How It Likes Gameplay is simple; shooting, slashing, smashing a typical 3rd person shooting game with some decent Ninja elements such as swordplay and wall jumping. Basically,you will doing the same thing (shooting stuffs or smashing them) over and over again. However, the game offers variety by there are so many different characters (we call it a frame) and so many weapons to choose. And most people often refers to a space ninja game. So it's a ninja doing stuffs in a space.\n\n2. Fun Part2.1 Variety\nEverybody have the different fun part. As I mentioned the game is nothing more but shoot or slash. So what make you happy will be what frame you use and how you modified your frame. Each frames have different skills and stats which mean they can kill things differently. You have to find what you like. However, there are some frames which is a must for everyone to have but you can collect so many frames at the same time. And you can switch it between mission upon your need. Same idea with the weapons, there are ton of them.\n\nSo the fun part is about trying it out how you like each frames or weapons. But if you don't have funs with playing with different frames. This game may not for you since the rest is about shooting things. Nothing special.\n\n2.2 Free To Play\nMoreover, the game is free to play so you can try it out any time.\n\n3. Annoying Part3.1 Graphic Options\nFor game graphic, it is about how you like it. Because enable every options on graphic may not be the best for you. You have to adjust it. Basically it's nice but something is too real for game like this. For example, the motion blur. It's not fun when everything around you get blur when you turn around and shooting things.\n\n3.2 Internet Speed\nI know this may be about me but hey ... I'm one of the player. It's about internet connection speed if you play with a people on a differnt region you could suffer a lag. But not so much but still it is annoyting when you have a team but you are on different region and you can't play together very well.\n\n3.3 Game Development\nThe game is on progress project. So something in the game still can change at any moment. But those are for improvement which is understandable but it could annoy you.\n\n3.4 Community Features\nLack of non-gameplay features. Such as community features. Sending in game email to player, auction houses. Something like that. The game offers a chat room and a guild and you can do something in the guild. However, this is a multiplayer game, a community feature is vital but... everyone live like this for years ... it's ok but I feel like missing some features that the other games commonly have.\n\n3.5 Farming\nAs I mentioned the game offers you a veriety of frames and weapons. But these things come from framing it and trust me. Sometime, it takes forever. Hoever, you can buy it using a few dollor so this could be an annoyting part but you can solve it using real money. The choie is yours.\n\n4. Give It A TryTry it, if you like to modifying things. If you love game where you can modify things, the game is for you. There are tons of things to collect and modify. But the game play is simple and repeatitive. So as I metioned the fun part is doing the same thing a different way.","November 6, 2014","true","538.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zombiechicken/recommended/230410/","Zombiechicken","[ZCC] Zombie Chicken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zombiechicken/","266 products in account","Warframe is a cooperative Third Person Shooter which involves a strange blend of melee combat, shooting, and parkour.\nThere, now that we've gotten the standards out of the way, Warframe is a good game, good meaning that it has its pros and it's cons. When it comes to pros, the graphics quality is amazing for a Free-To-Play game, everything stays moderately difficult (and even harder if you play like you're supposed to, you know, 2 or 3 friends all starting at the same time), and the parkour system is very smooth and easy to use, even for new TPS players.\nSince the last time I reviewed this game, it has changed greatly. Whereas before I was too scared to make a new weapon due to credit and resource restrictions, I've found that resources are much more common in most cases, so I've been free to experiment with guns and find the ones I like. (Latron I love ya baby.) Now I have a set of cleavers, two hammers, a machine gun, rifle, shotgun, several swords, and the list goes on. The best part about this, though, is that, since credits are more easily achievable now, I've been able to experiment without fear of losing much.\nAlso, the way you earn warframes has also changed much. Whereas before, there was a chance that it may or may not spawn once every 5th moon after you've sacrificed your firstborn, now you're guaranteed to get a frame part after fighting the boss that drops them, so I've actually coughed up some plat and now have six warframes, all of which provide an incredible spin on gameplay, forcing you to change your playstyle for each frame. Of course, I've got a favorite, (Nyx I love ya baby.) but each frame is a refreshing take on the game that renews it completely.\nTo continue, the levels are now actually changed. The levels change style depending on who's in control of the planet. Of course, if you play the same planet alot, then you may begin to notice that the levels are the same, but that can be expected of any game.\nHowever, it can still be a tad grindy at times, and several of my friends found the beginning of the game too hard a hurdle for them and quit early on due to the upper levels carrying them through the low levels and making the game boring for them, so if you're going to enjoy this game, it's a NECESSITY that you don't play public matchmaking. Players tend to rush through the levels and not allow the lowers to really enjoy the game or even get a kill, for that matter. If you're going to play, you either need to play by yourself or with friends.\n\nI Recommend this game, (Provided you've got some friends to play this with.)\nZombie Chicken","May 10, 2013","true","898.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Some AI are just faster than others and can perform different manuevers, however, they still lack a logical thinking process. Many will run up to you head-on, or will hide and take cover and allow you to pick them off, without thinking to move.\nBosses have unique prospects, but are still pretty stupid.\n\nGame currently only rewards rushing, stealth is not possible, and few tactical options outside of warframe abilities.\n\nVery few variety between missions, there is defense, survival and extermination, along with another mission type which involves blowing up an object.\n\nThere is also one where you run around and capture points, but that is only one ONE mission.\n\nCould use plenty more mission types.","March 30, 2013","true","735.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It has its ups and downs, but first I'll go over the ups.  An obvious up is that its free to play,  so you can try it out and if it doesnt fit you're gaming style then just uninstall. With it being free to play theres obviously going to be microtransactions, but let me asure you that there is nothing in warframe you cant get (including nearlly all cosmetics), even if you dont put a dime into the game. I havnt payed any money at all and I have some of the best gear, and a hand full of the cosmetic items. This is due to the fact you can trade in game items for microtransaction currency (for warframe its called "platnium"). As far as game graphics, they are amazing, not far cry 4 graphics, but definitely one of the best free to play game graphics I'v seen. Dont let that discourage you if you dont have a high end gaming computer, the game is suprising very optimized, and the devs work to improve it even more. The gunplay is as great, with a third person run and gun parkour style. Aside from guns there are also tons of melee weapons that are just as strong, not just a last resort if you run out of ammo. The depth of melee combat is amazing, collect different melee stances as you progress to match you're play style. Perform combos with the different stances, to cut down you're enemies. And one of the best things about warframe is the devs. The devs are super active and constantly pumping out content as well as streaming on a weekly bases. Their passion for the game is like none other.\n\nOk, so the bad things about warframe. Repetition, this has been a problem for the game for quite some time, and the devs are doing alot to fix this. After playing for as long as someone like me or even far less, warframe will feel like a chore. This can obviously be prevented by playing with freinds or doing unconventional mission play styles, but can still get kind of dull. This is something the devs are taking alot more seriously and they have talked about various ways to improve this. I personally think that the devs can acomplish something to ease or fix this. The second thing bad about warframe is timed events. So what I mean by this is events that offer special prizes like guns, melee weapons, or mods (mods are items that you put into you're character to give them better stats or abilites, each mod has a unique buff), will only come once, and if not will come much later in the year. Meaning if there is a gun, melee or mod that you really want, but wasnt there during the event, you can't get it, unless its tradable, in which case you can trade for with other players.\n\nOver all I love this game and I love the devs, they work hard to deliver a great game and it is definitely one of my favorite free to plays.  If you're still sceptical then just give it a try and see for yourself.","February 7, 2015","true","379.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You gain this by using more variety, using and leveling the different weapons and frames that are availible to maximum and leveling up!\n\nAfter all, you can get every resource in the game for free. Every resource needed is in the game, you just have to play through some missions and find it! There are only a couple items you don't find, but with the active development team of Digital Extremes "DE" They livestream and host a developer stream where they showcase up and coming features, and after these they put up a mission to where you can get one for free. Fancy!\n\nAll in all, the game runs well, looks amazing, the gameplay is fun, super responsive, not too difficult to understand.\n\nThe only con I have about this game is that there are no cosmetic choices for free players really (But you do get all the game for free gameplay and value wise) And the fact that some of the tutorials for inner sections of the game are a bit under-detailed and somewhat confusing.\n\nOther than that I say you pick up the game and see how you like it!\n\nIn the words of a favorite youtuber of mine "If you're even somewhat interested in Warframe, go check it out! ...

The game itself is fun and is also an interesting consept for a F2P game, although rather repetitive after a while. The combat itself is above average, having you equiped with a primary, secondary and melee with a large amount of choice for each catagory. The movement system is what will be most interesting for new players, as i cannot see any reason why Doing a wall run, Gound slaming on a tough enemy then going into a slide and killing another enemy with kunai whist sliding past him wouldn't be entertaining.\n\nNow onto the negative aspect of this game, the 10 Km high barrier for new players that is *Drum roll here* Crafting and Farming. Despite the game puts you in a MUCH better position at the start that it did previously, the barrier is still there. A lot of the weapons that are good to begin with either require unknown and unobtainable reasources for a new player or be locked away from you untill you build the weapons that may as well require literal unobtainium for a new player, however, if you can find a group of people to play with you will have a MUCH more enjoyable and easier time playing.\nThe crafting also uses a automated "This will be finished in..." sort of system, and some of the wait times are somewhat crazy, the worst being 3 days for a warframe, which needs you to build all 3 of it's parts first, with a minimum time of 12 hours if all 3 are crafted at once, So be prepared to wait, and brutaly maim someone with an axe while you wait.\n\nOver all the game does a good job of what it does, and that is to provide hours of play time to build and upgrade a set of weapons so they become powerful enough to kill the entire population of a country in a few minuites, but remember, if you get this game, you will learn to farm. Or get eaten by crazy rabid space dogs, your choice really.","November 22, 2014","true","928.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is totally awesome. Everything you see in that trailer is what you see in-game (minus the big guy ( Let. Kril ) at the end getting cut in half- you cant cut him half in-game.) But from warframes that are more on the ninja-y side, can sneak around while other warframes can be powerhouses and have immense crowd control. Also, Rhino. Get him. Not even trying to hype him up or anything. He's the tank of the warframes and can stop time. I think that's good enough for anyone.\n\nAnyway, as for this game, without spoiling anything, this game has little to no replayablity. DE is still working on making the game more balenced with Lore and a replay aspect (I hope). As for the game, you are Tenno, a race of ninjas(?) that offer balence to the solar system. As you unlock the solar system nodes, you will find harder enemies and it can get... really fun at the end.\n\nHowever, you start out with the worst weapons and it may take quite a long time for you used to the game. These weapons do almost nothing to even the weakest enemies, and since you are so new, you can't just go do one mission and gain credits (in-game earned currency) to purchase better weapons. Sadly to say, it doesn't stop there. Good Mods (Modules that can be used to upgrade Warframes and weapons) may be really, and I mean REALLY, hard to get. So you know what that means. You have to farm for them. Killing the same type of enemy over and over, in the hopes that they will drop a mod. You must keep this in mind when playing.\n\nThen there is the no-replayabilty aspect. Many maps repeat themselves, and you can see this ALOT. By the time you do get the best weapons, you will already played 5/8 of the maps in the game. (The 5 maps are  Grinner Ships, Corpus Ships, Corpus Outposts, Earth, and Jupiter. The other 3 maps are Void, Derelict, and the new {to the time of this review} Hive missions  ) Because of this, most players just give up on this game.\n\nSome parts about the game that are good is that it is free. You get top notch quailty gaming bliss for free. Another good part is a learning company, that listens to you. DE (Digital Extremes) is learning how to be a great company, and has a staff that loves people that play this game. Need something from a staff? Asking does work! And finally, no one is forcing you to do anything. You don't have to farm for the mod you need. You don't need to play online. You may, however, get into a clan as soon as possible xD. And one more thing before I end this. This game is great. Ok? It does have its flaws. Some things from their Star Stek game is in here. The double door thing is here. AI runs in circles sometimes. AI is not... smart. But it is a great game over all. Even, to me, if it has lost a little bit of that Sci-Fi feel by having bosses speak in english, while troops still speak their... language.\n\n\nIn the end, just try it out. You don't like it?

I first joined this game around the start of open beta, and it was very, very spotty and questionable at the time.  Seeing how much it has progressed impresses me to no end; it is most definitely worthy of the AAA video game label even in its current state of still being in "beta", and has so much polish and so many intricate details that really make it stand out from every single other "Free" game I've played yet.  The fantastic movement system, addictive gameplay and crafting system, wonderful orchestral soundtrack, and extremely detailed lore are just a few of the things this game has to offer.  At one point, I was forced to play this game against my wishes; now I happily play it on my own and enjoy almost every moment of it.","March 5","true","536.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Absolutely everything in this game is completely free, while there is the option to buy platnium, it is not needed due to the fact that you can use the trade market to sell/trade/buy items for platnium.

I stopped playing, but revisited it after quite a while. I must say, best free to play game I've played. Why might that be? It's not pay to win. Sure, you could buy a warframe and weapons with real cash. But that doesn't mean you're any good at the game. You actually have to take the time to collect mods, upgrade your warframe and weapons. But - if you play enough, you don't have to pay any real money to get platinum (an in-game currency). You can trade with other players to make platinum. Which is fantastic. But doing that takes time. This brings me to farming or grinding. When it comes to having to farm certain mobs to drop a certain recourse or mod, it's actually fun.\n\nIn summary - the first part of the game may not seem fun. But it gets better. With the various mission types you can do, learning the lore of the Tenno as the story unfolds, the many quests you can do, all the different types of warframe/weapons. Yes I can recommend this.","March 26","true","253.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zombiechicken/recommended/230410/","Zombiechicken","[ZCC] Zombie Chicken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zombiechicken/","266 products in account","Warframe is a cooperative Third Person Shooter which involves a strange blend of melee combat, shooting, and parkour.\nThere, now that we've gotten the standards out of the way, Warframe is a good game, good meaning that it has its pros and it's cons. When it comes to pros, the graphics quality is amazing for a Free-To-Play game, everything stays moderately difficult (and even harder if you play like you're supposed to, you know, 2 or 3 friends all starting at the same time), and the parkour system is very smooth and easy to use, even for new TPS players.\nSince the last time I reviewed this game, it has changed greatly. Whereas before I was too scared to make a new weapon due to credit and resource restrictions, I've found that resources are much more common in most cases, so I've been free to experiment with guns and find the ones I like. (Latron I love ya baby.) Now I have a set of cleavers, two hammers, a machine gun, rifle, shotgun, several swords, and the list goes on. The best part about this, though, is that, since credits are more easily achievable now, I've been able to experiment without fear of losing much.\nAlso, the way you earn warframes has also changed much. Whereas before, there was a chance that it may or may not spawn once every 5th moon after you've sacrificed your firstborn, now you're guaranteed to get a frame part after fighting the boss that drops them, so I've actually coughed up some plat and now have six warframes, all of which provide an incredible spin on gameplay, forcing you to change your playstyle for each frame. Of course, I've got a favorite, (Nyx I love ya baby.) but each frame is a refreshing take on the game that renews it completely.\nTo continue, the levels are now actually changed. The levels change style depending on who's in control of the planet. Of course, if you play the same planet alot, then you may begin to notice that the levels are the same, but that can be expected of any game.\nHowever, it can still be a tad grindy at times, and several of my friends found the beginning of the game too hard a hurdle for them and quit early on due to the upper levels carrying them through the low levels and making the game boring for them, so if you're going to enjoy this game, it's a NECESSITY that you don't play public matchmaking. Players tend to rush through the levels and not allow the lowers to really enjoy the game or even get a kill, for that matter. If you're going to play, you either need to play by yourself or with friends.\n\nI Recommend this game, (Provided you've got some friends to play this with.)\nZombie Chicken","May 10, 2013","true","898.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

EVER!\n\nEdit: 2 years later.\n\nIt's been a while since since I started playing warframe, so I figured I might update my review on this game.\n\nWarframe is a hack and slash, destroy everything, shoot-em/blow-em/melt-em-up.\nWarframe is a grinding, RNG, ragefest.\nWarframe is also free to play with no concept of "Pay to win".\nWarframe is skill based.\n\nIf you do not like the above, don't play it. But because it's free to play, I suggest you at least try it.\n\nI came into warframe with the idea of- If I like the game, I'll put some money into it, because hell, I want to support something I enjoy.\n\nIt's been two years and seven months (as of 5 October 2015) since I started playing, and I've had a blast. I joined the founders programe, met some awesome people, and best of all played dressup simulator 2015.\n\nFor me, warfashion is a game about looking awesome, jumping around like a ninja, and getting rewards as a added extra.\n\nI play the game for the fun of it, not for the seriousness of the grind. Sometimes I notice myself going towards a grind state, and have to pull myself back, because I will not enjoy it.\n\nThe payment system in warframe is to save time, and a little bit of pain. My advice to people who want to buy some Platinum (the ingame currency) is to spend it on warframe, and weapond slots, as those are the only things that limit you, towards the end of the game.\n\nOtherwise, sit back, enjoy the ride, and the regular updates that bring new content each time it'll make your head spin.\n\nAlso remember the developers of the game are human too, I find alot of people hate on them. But for the most, they listen to the community, and bring the best, balenced game they can to us, and for that they've done good in my book.\n\nIf you ever need help with farming, or want to message me in game with some questions. IGN is: TritonZA\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThe game is good. play it, and be ready to adapt. Don't expect to play the game for free. Invest abit. It's worth it.","May 1, 2013","true","833.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The Grineer have come to take you, it is time to do what you are supposed to do, save everything.\n\nWarframe is (again) a Third Person Shooter set in a futuristic style, you are able to control these solid and strong husks known as "Warframes", they range from Tanks who take a lot of damage to the more stealthy types, allowing you to complete missions without being seen.\n\nWarframe has you take on allot of farming at all times as to create Weapons, Sentinels who act as your companion and fight allongside you or even new Warframes.\n\nWeapons vary greatly, from low magazine count Twin Vipers with a fast fire rate and reload speed to Bows and Assault Rifles. There is always a weapon that will interest you, be it a sniper to fire from afar or a bow to get those silent kills.\n\nSentinels are a great addition to the game, each equipped with their own Weapon. From poison darts to a fully automatic assault rifle. They also add a more in depth part of Warframe, each they come with various abilities, for example : Carrier has the ability to pickup loot within a specific radius of you. Whereas Deathcube will Vaporize enemies.\n\nWarframes are ofcourse the husks you control, ranging from Tanks like Rhino who has massive amounts of stomping power to the more silent Warframe like Ash. There is a Warframe for each style of play, so you'll be sure to find a Warframe to your liking.\n\nThe enemies : - Grineer\n- Corpus\n- Infested\n\nThe Grineer : The Grineer are an advanced race using weapons like Assault Rifles, Machine Guns, Cleavers and anything that would use normal bullets or slash through flesh.\n\nThe Corpus : The Corpus are an even more advanced race that use weapons which work on energy like the Flux Rifle and their Electrified Batons.\n\nThe Infested : The Infested as the name says are infected beings whom are mutated, they range from exploding enemies (Kamikazes), Ancient whom can heal their allies and infested dogs whom are fast with a strong attack.\n\nEach enemy has their own weakness leading to some interesting encounters, with "Boss" enemies that have been put into the game whom have the ability to shield themselves with ice to a fire blast knocking you back.\n\nThe Farming : Warframe imo seems to be the game which you'd love to play if you enjoy some fun sessions in farming for resources. Each planet comes with its own resources, one better then the other.\n\nAll in all, Warframe is a great game. Its something you won't find everyday and is defenitly worth it to take a look at and playing it.\n\nWarframe will be the game for you if you enjoy the joys of farming wich come with interesting missions, special bosses for each faction and the joy of brutally murdering enemies in various ways with the different Warframes abilities.","June 24, 2013","true","837.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is awesome, with the seventeen billion weapons, a wide range of warframes to play for (NO, not "pay" for), and various gametyps to play in. The crafting system implemented is unique, as it takes actual time to craft such weapons, keys, frames, gear, etc. And if this isnt enough for you to try a "Free to Play" game out, the game is still developing! thats right, more warframes, weapons, planets, missions, and all of the sorts are to come in the future. The developers are very good with the community, updating on a regular basis and fixing patches on the spot! and when I say pathces, I mean game breaking bugs. the balance issues come after good thinking and a discussion with there design council. In other words, TRY THE GAME OUT! (and if I were a metacritic rater, Id seriously consider revising that score up there, this game is more than grind if you've got the will and the friends).

How do i put this? Warframe is an excellent game and that is putting it lightly. Warframe is basically about futuristic space sci fi that involves humanity becoming mutated and corrupted, the main characters you play as are called warframes, which are like awesome space ninjas. They are basically either super evolved technology that is worn to keep the corrupted humans or (tenno) stable or they are the result of mutations to the tenno. Either way they each have their own unique looks and powers, you can customise your ones to your own liking and desire. You play the game by doing missions, these involve you flying down to a planet in your spaceship, then depending on what mission type you are doing you must complete the main objective. An example of this includes exterminate missions, these missions are your typical and easier missions in my opinion. Basically the main objective is to go all space ninja on all the enemies till none of them are left standing, seems simple enough. The more harder missions can include defense or spy missions, i won't go too much into what they are as to not spoil the entire game for you new players. I've been playing this game for a good few years and it just seems to get better and better as the time goes on, the developers add new content at a decent pace and keep us the consumer interested. It really keeps me enjoying myself to fullest at every corner. However..... there is only 1 problem with this game in my opinion, this problem seems to occur in most free to play games. I'm refering to of course pay to play issue, now unlike world of warcraft and other free to play games, warframe does allow you to get the complete experience of the game for free, they allow this by letting players doing the missions and farming parts of weapons, cosmetics, even other warframes you can build and obtain for no real money what so ever YAY!!!!! and for those lazy players who can't be stuffed to put the time into farming for the things they want, we are able to buy whatever we want for real money. A tactical advantage to the devs but can be worth it for us sometimes. However... there is a catch to those of us who want to get the stuff for free and this is the problem i was refering to, that is how the game works with this. Sure put hours on end to farm the parts and make your new weapons and warframes, etc but... each warframe, weapon etc needs a slot to be placed in within your inventory and guess what... that costs real money to get more HAHAHAHAHA what a messed up catch, sure it's not as expensive as buying the thing you want in the first place but it's still really cheeky on the devs part. Letting people get whatever they want for free only to spend cash for space in their iventory to aquire this so called (free {whatever you are building} ) Oh and when you build the stuff for free it does take real hours to be made, just another set back for some people, me? im not as fussed about that as others. But besides that little cheeky issue with having to buy slots to put the stuff you want for free in I have absolutley nothing bad to say about warframe. It's a wonderful game and like i previously mentioned, it keeps getting better to some degree :D. And as such i look forward to the future sessions of playing warframe that are yet to come. Would i recommend this game? hell yeah! no questions asked i think the majority of gamers out there would love this. if you are a player that doesn't like spending real money on games you already bought then... i don't think you'd like this too much but other then that :D absolutley i recommend this !","July 10, 2015","true","066.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

It has its ups and downs, but first I'll go over the ups.  An obvious up is that its free to play,  so you can try it out and if it doesnt fit you're gaming style then just uninstall. With it being free to play theres obviously going to be microtransactions, but let me asure you that there is nothing in warframe you cant get (including nearlly all cosmetics), even if you dont put a dime into the game. I havnt payed any money at all and I have some of the best gear, and a hand full of the cosmetic items. This is due to the fact you can trade in game items for microtransaction currency (for warframe its called "platnium"). As far as game graphics, they are amazing, not far cry 4 graphics, but definitely one of the best free to play game graphics I'v seen. Dont let that discourage you if you dont have a high end gaming computer, the game is suprising very optimized, and the devs work to improve it even more. The gunplay is as great, with a third person run and gun parkour style. Aside from guns there are also tons of melee weapons that are just as strong, not just a last resort if you run out of ammo. The depth of melee combat is amazing, collect different melee stances as you progress to match you're play style. Perform combos with the different stances, to cut down you're enemies. And one of the best things about warframe is the devs. The devs are super active and constantly pumping out content as well as streaming on a weekly bases. Their passion for the game is like none other.\n\nOk, so the bad things about warframe. Repetition, this has been a problem for the game for quite some time, and the devs are doing alot to fix this. After playing for as long as someone like me or even far less, warframe will feel like a chore. This can obviously be prevented by playing with freinds or doing unconventional mission play styles, but can still get kind of dull. This is something the devs are taking alot more seriously and they have talked about various ways to improve this. I personally think that the devs can acomplish something to ease or fix this. The second thing bad about warframe is timed events. So what I mean by this is events that offer special prizes like guns, melee weapons, or mods (mods are items that you put into you're character to give them better stats or abilites, each mod has a unique buff), will only come once, and if not will come much later in the year. Meaning if there is a gun, melee or mod that you really want, but wasnt there during the event, you can't get it, unless its tradable, in which case you can trade for with other players.\n\nOver all I love this game and I love the devs, they work hard to deliver a great game and it is definitely one of my favorite free to plays.  If you're still sceptical then just give it a try and see for yourself.","February 7, 2015","true","379.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I stopped playing, but revisited it after quite a while. I must say, best free to play game I've played. Why might that be? It's not pay to win. Sure, you could buy a warframe and weapons with real cash. But that doesn't mean you're any good at the game. You actually have to take the time to collect mods, upgrade your warframe and weapons. But - if you play enough, you don't have to pay any real money to get platinum (an in-game currency). You can trade with other players to make platinum. Which is fantastic. But doing that takes time. This brings me to farming or grinding. When it comes to having to farm certain mobs to drop a certain recourse or mod, it's actually fun.\n\nIn summary - the first part of the game may not seem fun. But it gets better. With the various mission types you can do, learning the lore of the Tenno as the story unfolds, the many quests you can do, all the different types of warframe/weapons. Yes I can recommend this.","March 26","true","253.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Ever. It has a very good play style, upgrades that fit every style of player, and graphics that can make many good gaming computers gasp. It is still in development, which means there will be changes and improvements, but that just makes me more excited since it means the game should only get better! I've put in quite a bit of time with this game, and I've been playing since the Beta release. I fully recommend it. It is a FTP that is better than most games I've bought. It supports single players, but is so much fun with a group of friends! The best part is there is no catch with the Free part, it really is all free. The only thing in-game you would ever need to spend money on are aesthetics. There is no content that you would ever need that you have to spend money on. The developers are pretty on the spot when it comes to fixing problems and updates come regularly. They also do frequent livestreams to keep players up to date on upcoming fixes and content. If you are even just a little curious about this game, give it a try!

The gameplay is solid and alot of fun, the design is interesting, the soundtrack is good, and the story went from being nonexistant, to one of the best stories in a F2P. Did i mention that this is free? And not by ''Oh, it's freemium'', but, YOU can potentially play the whole damn thing without paying ANYTHING?

It's similar, but a lot better. The graphics are incredible. The adventure is unspeakable. Most importantly you're a ninja fighting in space and planets with pets, bows, guns, pistols, and most imporantly melee weapons. I love the Glaive for example.. I feel like captain america, throwing his glaive at an enemy and exploding it, killing multiple enemys, then grabbing my glaive back to throw again. It comes with stance mods, and these stance mods let me do different combos with the melee weapons. Warframe uses a mod system that lets you customize your warframe and weapons in unique and different way that help you against different factions.\n\nThe game has Lisets (player ships) which you can walk around in, setup your arsenal before navigating to a planet to fight some Grineer or Corpus. Did I mention you can fight in space now? I think I did.. Anyway, my and my buddy Kubrow (a cute feriocious beat that you have to take care of) explore planets all aroudn the galaxy and I most of the time just sit back while Jubu (my awesome kubrow) rips off Grineer heads, and limbs and tosses them aside. He's very nice if you get know him..\n\nNow lets move on to my favortie part of the game. The dojo. The clan. I have my own dojo, 100 rooms (I kinda maxed out, I cant build any more rooms haha), filled with labs which let you make custom weapons you can't get from anywhere else. I have Dueling rooms which lets me and my clan members duel each other. I have my main room which we spawn in, and an observatory attached to it. I occasionally do my homework while sitting there and looking at the beautiful galaxy (there are spots you can meditate on in the observatory room). I believe they're even gonna bring a shooting range eventually for dojo's so you can test out your weapons and see which one you like the most.\n\nI think I've talked enough..\n\nTime to play Warframe and join my clan! 1916 Rangers!\n\nI hope you found this review helpful.

In the beginning, its grindy but its almost like a good kind of grindy. After playing for about 400 hours I started to get bored, so I took a break from the game for a couple of months. When I came back, so much had been added and improved, it was like a whole new game. Digital Extremes is an excelent developer and is known for listening to its customers feedback. With the upcoming X1 release, I imagine sinking even more time into this amazingly fun and beautiful looking game.","June 26, 2014","true","897.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sir_Kirby/recommended/230410/","Sir_Kirby","My ping is higher than your MMR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sir_Kirby/","64 products in account","As you might be able to see, I have quite a bit of time invested into this game-- and when I say invested, I mean it. It's not some high-risk, yet low-return kind of investment. No. Warframe has managed to create a low-risk, high-yield product, with your only down payment needing to be a bit of time.\n\nLet me put that into simpler, more individual, terms:\n\nWarframe?\nIs a pretty good game. (With a free-to-play model that rocks, by the way.)\n\nThe controls?\nDifficult to pick up at first, but become second nature after a few hours. (No need to worry though, you can stick to basic point-n-click adventure mode till you are comfortable with everything the parkour system has to offer.)\n\nThe graphics?\nQuite a bit of customizable options. Though, I will admit to the game being somewhat demanding, as it is often filled with sparkles and such. I've had people run the game with a potato, yet also people who can't get out of the gate with their own rig. Luckily for you, it's free, so if it doesn't work, you need only uninstall the game and carry on your merry way. (From my standpoint at least, where I hardly mess with options, I'm not 100% aware of the finer aspects of such craft, but that's for you to explore to your heart's desire.)\n\nThe combat?\nThe meat of the game, without a doubt. Pretend you are playing on a little kid's puzzle-piece mat. The world is randomly generated out of the same pool of tiles, but you know, randomly. This is to say that you may find yourself running a given mission a few times, but you won't view it as tedious, because the world is (for all intents and purposes) different. As you become more advanced at the movement parkour system, you will gain access to some rather sweet avenues and can pull off some rather sweet stunts, all while dishing out a hefty serving of awesome to your foes: be it with your primary, secondary, or melee weapon. (Oh, and that leads me into my next segment.)\n\nThere are multiple weapons for you to choose from!\nYes, some are certainly better than others. And yes, the game starts you off with practically two sling shots and a stick, but hey, you'll be able to work through the levels with those sling shots and trusty stick, while collecting various upgrades to slap onto your weapons, and collecting various materials to build new weapons. That's right, everything inside the game is practically attainable via in-game items. (The essential stuff that is.) And as you progress, you will learn the difference between the particular warframe (the variant of Ninja you play as) and weapon set you can use because you like to use them, and the warframe and weapons you use because you feel like a total BA for doing so.\n\nOkay, so, I'll touch a bit on the basics of what a warframe is, but not too much, because this get's more important after you've picked up most of the basics about the game.\nFeel free to follow the lore of the game, but I for this instance, think of a warframe as a cake. You can choose your initial warframe out of a list of three, and you will get to preview the kind of scenarios each is good for. And that's exactly why there are so many warframes to choose from. Each one can tailor the kind of playstyle you prefer (Want to be a tank? We've got that. Want to be a medic? Got that too. Want to quite literally blow up an entire army of enemies? Check!). I'm only breifly touching on this subject, because warframes are a bit of a draw on your supplies in game, and I don't want to bog you down with facts right off the bat, but just know, the customization in warframe is a lot like a DIY cake store. The weapons are the little decorations and such that you will put on whatever cakes you have available, and when the time comes for you to expirement with different cakes? The option is there. So yeah, experiement to your hearts content till you find the make you like! Essentially, your warframe is the cake, your weapons the icing, and the upgrades for both weapons and warframe are the little bits you can sprinkle on :3\n\n\nMy experience with Warframe?\nTo be honest, I saw the ideas of it prior to downloading, and I really liked them. When I actually got into the game, I wasn't really into the game. The controls were frustrating, and I was tired of seeing my veteran friends rush through a level, while slinging me along behind them. What I needed was a somewhat slow-introductory course, so I'd recommend turning off [Online] mode until you are confident with where you are at. But trust me, a few planets into the game, and you'll be busy dreaming of what weapons you want to craft, or warframes you'd really like to use. So when I say give Warframe a shot, I mean give it two.\nI would say satisfaction guaranteed or your money back, but I'm not being paid for this; and if you're not satisfied with it? You have bigger things to worry about than money. (No, seriously, check your pulse, you might be dead.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't like people asking for you to hardly go out of your way to benefit the both of yous, read no further!\n\nNow, some obligatory attempt at me trying to get free stuff from you taking up my offer. If you would please take the link that follows (it's sanctioned, I promise) I get an extra point towards my tiered unlock system. This would be a very helpful way to gauge how well my review did! (and for those who somehow think the game is awful, or just want to spite me? Relax, I only get that extra point when you complete 10 missions, so, feel free to do 9, and then just stop. That will show me :3)\n\nI must also note, if you do end up liking the game, and want your friends to get it, it would be awesome if you could re-direct them through my link... No hard feelings if you do not though\n\nI do get something if you try out the game by going through this copy-pasta advertisement (that is unique to me):\n\n"Recruiting Ninjas! Sign up, suit up and help me take back the solar system to defeat the Grineer in Warframe! Click here to sign up for this awesome free-to-play game and we’ll both receive cool rewards! https://warframe.com/signup?referrerId=524397a91a4d80f80a000007 "\n\nBUT HEY! If I understood it correctly, you might get a lil somethin' somethin' too, everytime I unlock a reward. A bit of "you help me, I don't help you, but at least the Warframe server helps you instead" action! *wink wink*\n\n-See you on the other side\n\n(Oh, and my name is Kirby117101 on the game, so if you'd like for me to drop in and assist you, add me, and I'll do the best I can)","November 24, 2013","true","362.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Players wear a battlesuit called a Warframe, each with its own set of abilites and statistics; and are equipped with 3 weapons—a primary weapon (such as a rifle or shotgun), a secondary weapon (usually a pistol), and a melee weapon (like a longsword). Players earn Affinity (experience points) for killing enemies and completing challenges and missions, which allows them to level up their weapons and armor. Warframes and weaponry have access to modifications, or "mods", that can be installed, removed and upgraded between missions; the higher the Affinity rank of any one piece of equipment, the more mods it can accommodate.\n\nThe camera is positioned over the shoulder for third-person shooting. The player can jump, sprint, slide, and roll, as well as combine techniques to quickly move throughout the level and avoid enemy fire. The game also allows players to utilize parkour techniques to evade enemies, bypass obstacles or gain access to secret areas. Maps are generated procedurally; with prebuilt rooms connected together so that no levels have the same layout. At times, the enemy faction can initiate a lockdown of the area, forcing players to hack security terminals by completing a puzzle minigame within a small time limit.\n\nCredits, ammo, resources, and mods can be found in set locations, such as lockers and destructible containers, as well as dropped by enemies. New weapons, Warframes, and equipment can be purchased in the market (either the items themselves or their blueprints), using either Credits earned in-game, or Platinum purchased via microtransaction.[3] Blueprints can be constructed using resources found during gameplay.","November 29, 2013","true","8.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Quick third-person-shooter gameplay is complemented by interesting free-running and mobility mechanics. Digital Extremes really want you to feel like a space ninja with Warframe.\nPerhaps Warframe's greatest allure is the lack of restrictions many MMO's seem to have taken on as staples. For example, there is no mechanic to explicitly limit the per-day play time of 'free-to-play play'ers, but rather a 4-revive per frame per day mechanic, and players can still continue when these are consumed.\nThis also ties into Warframe's focus as a team game, with up to three  other players present in a squad given time to revive you at no cost.\nIn-game items can be purchased with credits (rewarded for normal gameplay) or Platinum (paid for with micro-transactions). Several rare weapons, rare items and cosmetic skins can be obtained through real-time Alerts and Operations, and certain weapons can only be obtained from special 'Void Runs' made possible with keys found during play. A 'Daily Reward' system offers increasingly valuable rewards for consecutive log-ins, and can even provide players with generous discounts on Platinum.\nThose looking for a 'But...' should be aware that Warframe is still in open-Beta, and still has issues such as the occasional clipping-through-wall trap, as well as some connectivity issues. But these are being discovered and addressed by the very active and actively-monitored community. The growth of the game with each update is obvious, and the developers have regular livestreams to discuss new and upcoming content.\nWarframe is a brilliant action game that is DEFINITELY worth a look.\n\nJust don't choose Loki as your starting Frame.","December 22, 2013","true","766.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Players wear a battlesuit called a Warframe, each with its own set of abilites and statistics; and are equipped with 3 weapons—a primary weapon (such as a rifle or shotgun), a secondary weapon (usually a pistol), and a melee weapon (like a longsword). Players earn Affinity (experience points) for killing enemies and completing challenges and missions, which allows them to level up their weapons and armor. Warframes and weaponry have access to modifications, or "mods", that can be installed, removed and upgraded between missions; the higher the Affinity rank of any one piece of equipment, the more mods it can accommodate.\n\nThe camera is positioned over the shoulder for third-person shooting. The player can jump, sprint, slide, and roll, as well as combine techniques to quickly move throughout the level and avoid enemy fire. The game also allows players to utilize parkour techniques to evade enemies, bypass obstacles or gain access to secret areas. Maps are generated procedurally; with prebuilt rooms connected together so that no levels have the same layout. At times, the enemy faction can initiate a lockdown of the area, forcing players to hack security terminals by completing a puzzle minigame within a small time limit.\n\nCredits, ammo, resources, and mods can be found in set locations, such as lockers and destructible containers, as well as dropped by enemies. New weapons, Warframes, and equipment can be purchased in the market (either the items themselves or their blueprints), using either Credits earned in-game, or Platinum purchased via microtransaction.[3] Blueprints can be constructed using resources found during gameplay.","November 29, 2013","true","8.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NyxCrab/recommended/230410/","NyxCrab","NERF THIS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NyxCrab/","78 products in account","Warframe is a game where you're a robot ninja and you go around with 3 other robot ninja's and prepare to curbstomp the entire enemy opposition because of all the characters unique abilities. This game can also be described as Metal Gear Rising meets Halo meets Dead Space meets Borderlands. You got the fast paced robot ninja action ala Metal Gear, the characters looking like Halo and Dead Space, the infested feel like Halo Flood and the Dead Space Necromorph, and the 4 player drop in drop out co-op and grinding is like Borderlands. Of course, the devs where smart when they designed the grinding aspect, as the map has a unique thingy that allows each and every time to be different so you don't get bored of running through the same place a million times to go fight this boss, which is where borderlands failed. The microtransactions are kinda weird though, but nothing too major unless you like to waste money buying items when it's easier and cheaper to go find the components, build it, and then rush the item. The action is very fast and flowing, where you could go from jumping in the air shooting at people to sliding into people and insta gibbing them with your melee weapon. It's all very fun, and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes fast paced ninja robot action\n\nTL;DR: THIS GAME IS GOOD GET IT YOU AS SHOLE.","September 12, 2014","true","031.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Yeah, it had the cliche flashy trailer with great special effects etc etc, but still, we all know how free to play games are. They're almost always hooked up with that pay-to-win crap that everyone truthfully hates. I must say, after playing this game once with a few of my friends, I was immediately hooked, and still am to this moment enjoying the game's graceful fluent and loose gameplay. The mixture of freerunning with combat, very unique weapons, and lovely little original touches, truthfully made the game quite graceful to me. It doesn't over-dramasize everything, but at the same time, it isn't exactly boring. Everything is nice, balanced, and even the community is fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a nice free-to-play experience, and even recommend it to those willing to spend money. With or without putting real life currency into the game itself, doesn't change the joy of playing it in my honest opinion.
