Definitely worth getting.\n\nPros :\n-Simple yet very challenging campaign.\n-Multiplayer is utilised well(you can't get into secret levels unless you co-operate with teammates)\n-Secret levels!\n-Fluid gameplay, nothing really strange happens under normal conditions.\n-Very nice graphics and in-game music\n-Almost zero random events which kill you like in most platformers\n\nCons :\n-Multiplayer can be very glitchy when the ping between you and the player is higher than let's say 100ms(bullets curving from their paths rather than being delayed...)\n\nThat's all that I can think of for now! Also, one thing to note. You should definitely play this in multiplayer. I found myself playing the game and enjoying it a lot more with others.

(You'll probably be killing each other more than helping each other). Other modes are Race, and Deathmatch, so you don't always have to do the same thing.\n\nIf you are interested in the slightest bit, it's worth the price when it's on sale, and if you enjoy a good challenge, then it's worth the full price.  The game even has a level editor, so once you complete all the levels, you can make your own, or download other people's levels and die even more.","November 10, 2014","true","8.6"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","29","32","2","0"

Fun by yourself, but it's better with friends. Some secret levels you NEED a friend to reach. Some levels are made easier with a friend because you can jump off their heads to reach higher places and you can use them to mess with the trap's timing.\n\nFor a platformer, controls aren't as tight as I'd like, but they're not unbearable. This game is harder than super meat boy, in my opinion.\n\nPublic multiplayer is pretty dead, but I don't exactly play during steam's peak hours. It's better with people you actually know, anyways. It has online AND/OR local multiplayer, meaning if you have some gamepads lying around you can connect them and have some buddies play with you in your house/their house while you play with some buddies off in Sneedville, all on the same screen and in the same game. If you do decide to play with friends online, be sure to set a password for your lobby. Learned that the hard way. Online multiplayer also seems a bit laggy for the host, but my internet's subpar at best so beware, those with average connections.\n\nVery fun with some minor issues that don't detract too much from the overall game.\n\n9/10","January 22, 2014","true","2.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The 'co-opness' in this game is somewhat nullified by the fact that you can easily kill the other players by jumping on their heads, so you end up just taking turns attempting to complete each stage, making sure you don't both reach the same section at the same time and accidentally kill each other. It can be a bit fun repeatedly killing the other play to vent your frustrations at times, though, and the frustration of dying in this game is mitigated by the fact that your character instantaneously respawns at the start of the stage when you die.\n\nAll in all, an okay game if you enjoy hardcore pure platformers.","November 9, 2014","true","16.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

But it has also some flavor from "Jinsei Owata Daibouken" and "Shobon no Akushon" in some levels.\n\nArt style is good and reminded me 90's cartoons. Game itself represent a DOS game with clean visuals. Blood effects are awesome. Tracker musics are great, my favourites are menu music, first level and castle themes.\n\nI read the negative comments about online problems but it seems like online play a little bit fixed since last year but it still has some problems like connection timeouts or connection fail errors (i don't know if it is my dormitory internet or not though). There are enough amount of players and rooms but mostly they are private and they don't play Race or Deathmatch but Adventure mode; i don't know why. Hotseat (local) play is always available.\n\nCooperative adventure mode is a little bit chaotic. You accidentally (or purposedly?) bump and kill your partner and/or prevent them to reach their goal or they do the same to you. Also they distract you because, you know, there is something moving over there or something funny happens. Time by time you or your partners activate a trap and you can't handle the timing of it and die. But these kind of incidents make the game more funnier.\n\nThere is also a level editor named Aftershock but there are no guides about it and it's not so user friendly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaceory/recommended/257750/","zaceory","Zack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaceory/","1005 products in account","This game is most comparable to Super Meat Boy in that you'll die hundreds of times trying to beat levels that require very precise platforming. Like Meat Boy, the load times after deaths are non-existent which is a big plus for this type of game. This game's main draw however is the competetive/co-op. I played through most of the game first with a few friends and then I played all the way through solo. The multiplayer surprisingly never gets too frustrating even though most of your deaths come as a direct result of playing with others. Playing with more than 2 players on the last two worlds can seem ridiculously impossible, as I had  a much easier time playing later by myself.\n\nMy one complaint is that we encountered a few annoying bugs later in the game. One was a case where momentum didn't reset at a particular point after fans in a level. Not too bad, but slightly annoying. The other bug was on a few levels where the spawn was located on top of the door to the previous level, we would constantly enter that door upon death.\n\nOverall this is a fun party game that includes a few other multiplayer modes alongside adventure, giving it some decent replayability. Worth a couple bucks.","June 26, 2014","true","4.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The art style and the amount of blood and gore is just simply amazing, a lot of time has been put into the AI (As is quite obvious) The controls are ok, and they can be dealt with accordingly ;). also enjoy the menus, I know that may not be normal, but they are simple, include what you need, and when you need it, it will provide advanced options, (by opening tabs)\n\nCons►I have had MANY problems with the multiplayer, at first trying to use Hamachi didn't work at all, I couldn't connect to either of my friends, then it worked for one, then cut out as soon as I started to play, next we tried port forwarding (The process where you add the game ports into your internet access) that was just a waste of our time and effort. This may have just been our clients, but I haven't a clue myself, I haven't really seen any 'problems' on google or the steam forums. Moving on swiftly, The controls, having to use the arrow keys were really awkward for me, as I am used to FPS games there WASD is used. There is most likely a way to change them, but I didn't really have the time to check. There was one minor problem, that I couldn't get my head around though, that was the menu not supporting mouse control, this is purely lazy, and more effort could have gone into allowing a mouse to be used in the menu's, but that is the only hiccup I had with the menu's, they may be hard to navigate, but that is fine.\n\nOverall Review►I enjoyed the plat-former/death system, and had a lot of fun jumping around in the air, straight onto the death blocks, but I didn't really seem to achieve much doing so, but I digress, The way the game is layed out is beautiful, and I could spend a lot more time playing this if I had the nerves...\n\nExtra InformationDeveloper(s): 2Play\nPublisher(s): 2Play\nPlatform(s): Windows\nRelease Date: October 27th 2013\n\nSource(s)\nPersonal Experiences\nSteam Forums\nSteam Store Page\n\nWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group","February 11","true","5.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

And I'm not doing those very often, let alone getting such urgent impulse to actually close the game for it. But this game deserves it... I guess. Well, I'm just an hour in, reached only W3-1 but oh boy, it gives me some sweats – sweats of joy!\nNever have I played such a challenging yet achievable plattformer.  Admittedly it's not my preferred genre of choice on my computer, and console gamers could eventually prove me otherwise, but I'm having a blast!\n\nThe gameplay is as easy as it gets – jump, run, duck, avoid deadly objects, just don't die reaching the exit. One lvl is merely one screen, no scrolling. One world has ten screens (plus some bonus stages), as far as I can tell, I'm in the last lvl of the 2nd world. For the adventure mode that is. There are also a race and a deathmatch mode which are obviously multiplayer modes. I've only tried adventure so far, as I'm testing candidates for the next local gaming party, but lacking a buddy right now. And this one looks very promising although you might gather a more experienced crowd. Now, it is hard as stated before and on entering a lvl you might think “how I'm ever going to make this?!”. But you are! It may take a while though*g* It's always doable, never unfair. It takes some plattfoming skill and timing. Controls are precise and responsive. Levels are riddled with – well – traps... where some of those aren't visible when you enter a new screen. But you won't succeed on your first attempt anyway... so.\nThe graphics are – as you can see on the screenshots – retro styled, inspired by the 16 bit era. They're not particularly unique, but by no means dull or ugly. The gore effect which covers the environment with more and more blood as you're being constantly crushed by the fist of doom or saw blade of horror gives a weird sense of accomplishment. It's got a great soundtrack, I don't like the soundeffects though. Often they don't fit or sound awfully generic.\n\nI definitely recommend Bloody Trapland for solo players and I will vote for it on the next game night with friends.","April 19, 2015","true","4.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It isn't a "bad" game per say, it's just that the game in general is somewhat lacking. The levels aren't very difficult or too different from one another. They have added a level editor, which is pretty nice i guess, but there are much better platform games to do this in. The music is pretty great, i'll give them that.\nThere isn't anything about this game that makes it stand out from any other platformer on the market currently. The controls are very simple: Jump, move to the right, move to the left and crouch. The options menu is also very lacking, not that the options menu needs to be grand for a game like this, but it helps if some things can be tweaked. The only things that could be changed regarding graphics was the resolution and "effects", whatever that entails. However, you could turn the effects all the way from ultra to off, with no noticable difference, so i am still confused as to what it actually does. The texture quality makes this game looks like it should be on a flash games site, like Newgrounds or Mousebreaker, not a site like Steam.\nOverall, this is a game that could be played on co-op with a friend, but it doesn't have much about it that is compelling. It's more of a "Get drunk with your friends and bugger about on a game" kind of game, if you get my meaning.\nAnyway, mediocre game with nothing that sets it apart from other platformers. This game was the winner of the Game Concept Challenge 2011, but it doesn't seem like the devs have added anything much to the original game back in 2011.\n\n\n(This is the opinion of someone who doesn't enjoy or play many platform games, so take my opinion with a barrel of salt.)","January 28, 2015","false","1.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

Was worth picking up, as it was on sale.\nIt is NOT, however, worth the money, if it's NOT on sale. Why?\nWell, for one the multiplayer system is extremely flawed. To connect to a friend without getting connection errors one must either port forward or use hamachi, which for a steam game just isn't acceptable. And even then, there are constant time outs and if you're playing with three or more players one or two of them WILL lag out and spazz around the map, which is extremely disorienting and just plain annoying. Playing alone just isn't fun. So connecting these two points makes for a kind of mediocre game. Were they to fix the connection issues, however, then the game would be 100x more amazing and I'd definetely play and record some of this for my channel.\nI'd give it a 6/10.","February 10","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's quite buggy in general, has a fair few of exploits, online is glitchy, some features are quite obviously unfair (like the fireballs, which are completely random on your level, meaning it can be way harder / easier by chance), etc etc.\n\nBut when it's got an awesome soundtrack, is fun to play, and is a truly difficult game (don't see many of those anymore now, do we!), who cares?\n\nYou need a lot of determination to get through this. And no; I don't mean because of my name, but because you really do. If you get angry on difficult levels in platformers, it won't aid you much in a game like this. Unless it keeps you going. Then it probably will.\n\nBelow is a video of me doing a runthrough of the game. The last two 'worlds' are the difficulty that the game eventually gets to. There are also "Race" levels - some which you'll not even attempt to go quickly because of the sheer difficulty!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/O0YcFHBQObE\n\nDo keep in mind that there are custom levels in the game as well, which are typically made in this same kind of difficulty.\n\nIf you want to try out the game online in your browser before buying, you can do so with the link below. I tried to get the game mechanics as close to the original as possible.\n\nhttps://frisk.itch.io/trap\n\nBloody Trapland is a great game, with or without friends to play it with.","May 6","true","52.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I just tried to make game screenshot, because all 4 of us managed to get to harder part of level, but when I pressed F12 game CRASHED.\n\nThis title has potential, if it was on Early Access it would deserve recomendation, but now?\nHere are things that are in my opinion UNACCEPTABLE for a "finished" Steam game:\n\n- buggy, sometimes cannons stop shooting, game doesn't recognize that you finished level, taking screenshot for some reason clears level blood or even crashes game\n- NO KEY BINDING CONFIGURATION AT ALL and moving with arrows on my keyboard is not comfortable\n- only XBox controller is supported, I tried using emulator x360ce and it doesn't work\n- on game chat you can't use special characters such as question mark - why?\n- it's hard to find online games, because:\n.......1) list shows both passworded and open games and you can't filter it\n.......2) most open games are impossible to join, because you get "timed out" error, also game doesn't ping such rooms, most pinged (so I assume working) rooms are password protected, very few open games are pinged and working\n.......3) there's no refresh button on list, to do it you have to go back and open online menu again\n- with 4 players in game, most of the time you die, because somebody jumped on you, people often do it on purpose, it's irrtating\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=467906215\n\nI guess it won't surprise you that I think this game is frustrating. But the problem is, it's not dying or difficulty that is causing it, but lack of features and bugs. This game is not finished and I can't recommend it.\nJust look on game forum and see how many people got problems with it.

You have endless lives and just throw yourself at the traps until you can get through. You can play up to 4 players on the same map, but there is little you can do to help each other. Instead, if one of you beats the level, you all advance to the next level together. So sometimes it can end up as a bit of a race rather than cooperation.\n\nFun in short doses.

At first glance I thought the game would be similar to the Rage Game "Cat Mario" but this just proves the saying "Don't judge a book by it's cover". Bloody trapland has the uniqueness of a game that no one has created before. The puzzles do in fact get more and more challenging as you progress through eash level, but they're not impossible to complete.

So i was looking for a challenging game on Steam. The problem is that there is more crap than anywhere else. But i still kept looking and I finally found this. I already saw that a year ago on youtube but back then it wasnt on steam so i ignored it. Took me quite a long time to accept that the price was really high, but i took the risk. I have to say that the first world of the game is realy easy and you should not take it as a full reason to judge the game. But if you continue this game, it will kill you mentally. Seriously, world 5 and 6 destroyed us beyond our imagination. I see myself not as casual player and i still had some trouble in 5 and 6. There was one level in world 5 where we needed 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hours to complete it. I personally think that you get a lot of good challenges for the relatively high price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knifedera/recommended/257750/","knifedera","Knifedera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knifedera/","46 products in account","First off, the game has an amazing soundtrack in my opinion.

And i dont even play this game like it's Garry's Mod.. I more of play it when i dont feel like going on my Playstation... Even when i do play this game, i see myself on a level anywhere what seems  like 30 seconds to a minute and you think its easy.. .Then you see your self on a level for 10-15 mins and you feel like your so stupid, but at the same time you dont want to stop, you just want to beat it.

You have more than just going through obstacles, and these courses are more than just trying to survive and speed through at the same time, you have to slowly progress and take your time with these courses, so it requires some thinking effort. Like I said, you have more than just going through obstacles, theres a racing mode which is the main game, but the first person to get to the end of the level wins that round. Theres also a deathmatch mode where you kill each other by jumping on your enemies heads (which can get really fun). This game is a must play for you and your friends.

But still can't put requirements for this game, because this game is cheap and i can't push to the limits and ask something what i can't get.

But alot of bugs and fails.\nThe game has 4 characters, which are free to play. The servers have a maximum of 4 players, so if youre with more youre pretty screwed. Now there are alot of bugs and fails in the game, now let me give you an example, the servers. I don't know how the developers did this, but they really screwed up with the servers. It is almost imposible to play with your friends without Hamachi, or port forwarding. That is really bad. The second important one, is that the game is broke. The side-levels do not work, so everytime you try to go to a special level you mess up the previous level and have to do it again, developers, fix this! The third and last important one is when you finish the game, which is the last level, the game will just break and nothing will basically happen for the other players in game, only the host! Now say you are playing with you and 3 other friends, which means its a full server. Now you are at the final level and one of you gets the level, only the host will get a screen which says ''Congrats blabalbabla'' not the other players! Alot of things to fix Developers, but overall great and ragy game. I don't recommend you buying it for that price, but if you do make sure to port forward or have hamachi.\n\n","July 23, 2015","false","13.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Every time I try to join my friend's game (Which he spend many hours getting to work) I get stopped with a big bold "Too high ping" message.\nThere goes my ability to enjoy this game, considering I usually get 300+ ping in games. In other games my internet functions fine but in bloody trapland I can't even play.\nAs stated earlier: If your internet is fine, then you can play. But the simplistic controls and levels really took away from the game even when I tried solo. It's fine to be fooled by my low amount of time spent on this game but please note the fact I can't even play this game due to the way it was constructed. I highly recommend you check your internet speed carefully before getting this game. Because if you don't- You might be screwed.\nI can't list any pros or cons on this game- You know the reason for that so I won't explain it again.\nApologizes for focusing on one bit of this game which only affects a small group of people but even so it's no excuse for denying that small group any enjoyment out of this game.\nI honestly can't recommend this to anyone with bad internet or who hate simplistic games.

When someone completes a level in multiplayer, you have to go with them, even if you are at the start. That doesn't make any sense to me. And the servers are terrible.

A játék alapvetően egy rage game. Ha sokat játszol vele persze kikupálódsz és eszméletelen látvány lesz mások számára hogy hogyan viszel végig egy akadály pályát. Ha túl sokszor halsz meg persze egy idő után felbasz. Csak nézni jó, ahogy más játszik vele, mert akkor legalább lehet röhögni. A játék kivitelezése nem rossz, főleg hogy pálya készítője is van, ami igen kevés játéknak adatott meg mint áldás. A játékban ha többen játszanak, alternatív megoldás gyanánt lehet leküzdeni egy akadálypályát és másik irányt vetve a térképen. A csapatnak, főleg ha 4-en játszák, nagyon összeszedettnek kell lennie, mert naná hogy legalább minimum 25-ször le lehet halni a legkisebb akadályba is ha a cspattársunk útba van. A játék átlagát tekintve szórakoztató, a szivatások pedig csak egyre nehezebbé válnak ahogy mentek befele a pályákon.

It is not worth the money(at the time being 10 euros).\n\nP.S. The chatting system is awful as well, because you cannot even use fullstops or even question marks! By the way, to type something, you must press "Enter"... The letters are very BIG and in the playing area.\nThe connection to an internet game is virtually impossible, due to connection problems all the time.\nThe keys are not redefinable.\nAnd lastly(for now at least), the maps in the game are sort of wrong-invisible to some players, making them unplayable.\n\nThat' s all for now.","February 11, 2015","false","2.2"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","7"

I'm glad I only wasted $2.50. The game claims to have Online coop but the only problem is the programmer failed badly at setting up a friendly interface for it. It's very difficult to have your friends join the game you host. You have no options at all when it comes to hosting a game. Also you can't just simply host a game then thru steam have your friends click on "Join Game" That feature does not exist. Your friends have to try to find your server that you hosted in the servers list and of course like I said you have no options for setting up a game so this means you cannot create a server name. The server name is your User Name. It's very unlikly your friends will even see your server being hosted. Another way to join is by Ip Address which one isnt giving to you.\nOnline Coop is very diffuclt to set up. Bad programming skills. Also 9/10 times it will have a connection failed or timed out for joining servers on the server list.\n\nThe actual game play is bad as well. Yes it's a simple game but its missing a lot of physics and basic math. Things don't line up quite right and it's difficult to control your character. If your okay with a very very VERY basic and dummed down game then this is the game for you. I suggest buying it at $1.00 not for $10.00 or even $2.50. The programmer lacks basic programming skills but I can't complain too much because well....The game shows how far the skills went.\n\nOverall I say 3/10. Yeah its thats bad. It can be fun if your super bored but you might get more entertainment by playing with your toes.

It's themost rage inducing game that you will most likely ever play. With all the rage yuo have, you will then go and drink a jug of Tide and then destroy your laptop/pc. The single player on it is insanely difficult and almost impossible to accomplish anything, except getting past the first trap in the first and second world. The Co-Op is not what you would expect. You would expect it to seem even harder, but its actually easier. Most of the people in the bloody game either team-kill you right when you spawn. The game is un-playable at that point when there is a troll not even caring about your hard and dedicated work to this frusturating game. Whenever you pass a mission, its the best feeling. Then you see what hell lies ahead of you, and you just leave the game for the night. The next day you and some friends play the game but the almost coming to beat the mission then being demolished by a Miley Cyrus wrecking ball or being goomba stomped by someone on your team. This is a terrible feeling. Sometimes you will just give up a mission and get very angry. This game is fun in the beginning, but then it becomes a living hell with the nearly impossible missions that the satanic developers made. Im always somehow being dragged into this game and end up having fun for the beginning five minutes, then realize that its a total disaster.  And don't even get me started about the idiotic custom games that are just a waste of time....\n","November 17, 2014","false","12.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

That in itself is not a bad thing, but Bloody Trapland is not designed around fair challenge, it is design to unfairly kill you and frustrate you.\n\nThe mechanics are serviceable and the controls are responsive, though this does not help the game much since the levels themselves are designed to screw you over and constantly "pull the rug" from underneath you. Also, the graphics are ugly. The graphics are low fidelity, and the estethic just looks like a cheap game taken from Newgrounds anno 2008.\n\nThe game does become fun if you have some friends to play with however. Getting frustrated is not much fun, but hearing/witnessing others losing their marbles over this game is hillarious. You'll learn a bunch of new swears, have a great time making fun of your friend's suckage, and enjoy watching them suffer. Comedy gold!\n\nDespite the fun in multiplayer, i feel the game does not offer enough for the current price tag. There is just not much to it if you are forced to play alone, and there is little variety to be found (normal platforming levels, races, and deathmatch. More similar to eachother than one might would tink). Therefore, I cannot recommend this game at the current price tag. If you can get it on sale and get a few friends to join you, then sure, go ahead. Otherwise, it is better to just stay away.\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED, unless you have friends to play with and it is on sale.","March 5, 2015","false","5.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The game is no more difficult than any typical platformer, with its "difficulty" originating from unclever traps (blocks you cannot see crushing you). Instead of the skill game you would expect from a "difficult platformer," the game feels more like a memorization game - memorize the location of the traps and develop a muscle memory to work through them. Also, multiplayer is mediocre at best - it's far too easy to accidentally kill your teammates in adventure. For those of you seeking the deathmatch option, it really doesn't work with less than four players. In my experience, two players just led to a spawn camper (with correct timing you'll instantly die upon spawning) and with three two players can easily team up and ruin the fun for another player. Finally, the ambience of the game is lacking a great deal of work. The tiles, music, and characters feel childish. No particular theme is accomplished, as many games which choose a more "retro" look. I would avoid Bloody Trapland - It's not worth the cash. Maybe pick it up if it ever goes on a super sale.","May 3, 2014","false","1.6"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","0"

Why would you want to get a game that is frustrating? Well, no matter how frustrating it is, you keep playing. Addicting. Especially at the end of a long series of death in a level, you are satisfied with complete relief but, keep going. This game is a series of levels/stages. In which you are some sort of cat, you play through frustrating stages that brings usually death. There is a reason why it is called "Bloody Trapland" because when you die, there will be blood. I would recommend this game because it can be fun some days and god awful other days though. It is worth it's low $10 price that brings a feeling from the unfair flash game series, if you are familiar, as they are as well a platformer.","June 14, 2014","true","56.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gorshum/recommended/257750/","Gorshum","Gorshum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gorshum/","386 products in account","This is probably going to be my final review update for this game as I don't believe any further patches are coming. On the off chance it does change though I will update this again, as I have done since March 2014.\n\nLet's start with the TL;DR\n\nCons:\n-You literally cannot get all of the achievements or 100% the game without hacking the game. It was brought to the attention of the devs 10 months ago as of today (April 12th 2014) and it has been acknowledged as needing to be fixed but it is still broken.\n-The leaderboards, as always, are filled with hackers and impossible scores. Yay.\n-Fireballs in later levels feel very unfair sometimes. They will often kill you even if you have the rest of the level down to a science.\n-Level select is so tedious in singleplayer. There is no reason for it to be like this.\n-Overly sensitive keyboard controls (prepare to take multiple steps when you lightly tap movement, causing you to walk off many edges and into many spikes). Similar issue with trying to do small jumps. You will just randomly jump high and smash into death traps.\n-A lot of the level art looks like it was simply copy/pasted with a brush tool over and over...which I actually think it was but of course I can't verify that.\n-Good music but you will be stuck on levels for so long that you will get absolutely sick of hearing it. So this is a bit of both categories.\n\nPros:\n-Over 100 levels (counting the race levels) that get harder as you go along. Good for those who like a challenge. You will want to throw your controller at points so don't be surprise, that's the type of game it is.\n-The 4 player online/offline co-op, which doesn't always work if you live really far away, can be very enjoyable because you can split the rage and success between you.\n-Good music but you will be stuck on levels for so long that you will get absolutely sick of hearing it. So this is a bit of both categories.\n-The devs are genuinely nice and are willing to offer advice and help if you get stuck.\n\n\n\nAlright so you've gotten past he highlights and you want my in depth thoughts? First let's cover what was the biggest reason for me not recommending this game despite putting so many hours into it as this is the big one. There is a race level that cannot be completed within the par time without hacking. "Why is that a big deal?" I hear you ask and that's fair. It's a big deal because it is tied to not one but two achievements. Collect all the race stars and 100% the game. That level is the only thing stopping me from getting this achievement and I told one of the developers about it 10 months ago today, (April 12th of 2014). I even supplied them with a video as proof. They agreed that it needs to be fixed but 10 months down the line all that I've ever heard is, "Later". I don't think later is coming. I didn't pay for an unfinished/unbeatable game. I paid for what I expected to be a full product and this is not it. It pains me to have to recommend you away from this game because the devs are genuinely nice but I paid for a product and I have a reasonable expectation that it should work. Had I known this in the beginning I wouldn't have bought it but it's too late now.\n\nI also mentioned that the co-op can break sometimes. In most cases you will be fine but if you have friends overseas like I do and you want to play with them? It's not going to happen. You will be teleporting all over, disappearing, and flat out crashing sometimes. I have no idea why but it caused my friend and I to give up on trying to play together even though other games work just fine.\n\nThe fireballs aren't as bad as they originally were. I'm not sure if this is a result of one of the patches that came along or if they had a pattern all the time and I simply never noticed. They are still going to kill you constantly though once you get to the last few levels or you start taking on the race levels. "The game is supposed to be hard and kill you though." Yes and it's supposed to feel like it's your fault. Half the time when you die to these you're not going to learn from it and you're not going to feel at fault for it. When you first run into fireballs it's fine and for a good while they implement them well but at some point it feels like the idea simply became, "More fireballs, more places, especially in almost impossible to dodge spots!"\n\nThe music is really good, I genuinely enjoy it, but because you can spend so much time on worlds or even single levels you will be hearing it again and again and again. Did you like that tune the first 30 minutes you heard it? How about the next 5-10 hours?  I feel this could have been alleviated by adding in more songs for levels/worlds simply because you are going to be there for so long.\n\nThe difficulty does a really good job of starting out small and building incrementally as you go along. They rarely throw something at you without teaching you how to deal with it first, which is glorious and it's how games should be. There is no 20 minute tutorial or annoying narrator telling you how to do things. It teaches you directly and then it starts putting those skills into practice.\n\nThe art looks like it was copy/pasted everywhere. There really isn't a lot more I can add onto that statement. The good news is though it's mostly the background and you'll often be so focused on the foreground/traps that you aren't going to notice it. The reason I noticed it was because I played with a friend and had several occasions to wait for them at the end of a level so I started looking around.\n\nThe level select, how could I forget this. In the singleplayer mode it's sort of like Super Mario World in that you hop from spot to spot on the map. That wouldn't be as bad if it allowed you to swap between worlds quickly or if it saved your location when you exit the screen. Every single time you go back to level select you start at 1-1 and have to go through each level individually to get back to the one you're on. Are you on level 58 and have been stuck there a couple weeks? Well get ready to cycle through 50+ levels every single time you come back. Not only that but it's not a straight line! You'll be going right, right, up. left, up, righ, down, right, up, right, right, down, right, down, etc etc. It feels like I'm trying to put in the konami code every time I simply want to play a level. Why is it designed like this? The multiplayer has a very simple and much more efficient method. Why can't this be put into the singleplayer as well? I don't know but it is absolutely tedious.\n\nI don't feel this one really needs explaining but better safe than sorry. The leaderboards. If you've ever played an online game with leaderboards you should already know what to expect. Levels with par times of 20 seconds completed in 1.2 seconds galore. Levels where a perfect run gets you 16-18 seconds are finished in 5.\n\nI suppose the final point to tackle would be that the devs are nice, which is a good note to end on. I first met one of the devs, who shall remain nameless for the sake of their privacy, when I sent them a very angrily worded message about how impossible one of the levels was. They calmly replied that it's not impossible, just very hard, and even sent me a video to prove it. After that I calmed down and apologized and they were very friendly and polite about it. They've always been very friendly towards me from the very beginning which makes recommending no on this game very hard. Honestly I do feel rather guilty about it but as I mentioned above this recommendation isn't based on friendship or lackthereof, it's about where to spend your money. I try to base my reviews on how I feel about the game, not the people behind it. I'm not usually a completionist but when I do get into that mode, I hate when I am unable to complete a game not because I am bad but because the game is broken. For me that will always turn me away from a game.\n\nThanks for reading.","March 14, 2014","false","75.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because it makes u smile so hard that u ♥♥♥♥ ur pants and go to jail for playing to much.\nAdventure : This is funny too because u can jump on ur friend and kill the ♥♥♥♥ out of him , or u can annoy him by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stories example (LETS SS) and u kill him and he rages quit and he leaves the game , so yeah dont do that.\nAnd the last one Race: U just race with ur friend/s and get through the trapland.\n\nWell this is for me and yes , i suggest this game.","June 13, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Recommend it if you like punishing platformers. I have one major and a couple of minor concerns with the game that makes it hard for me to recommend it at full price however:\n\nCrouching mid-air\nIf you crouch by pressing down mid-air you lose the ability to steer and drop straight down. This means that touching down will kill you instantly on any jump or any time you need to dodge traps while falling down. The only explanation I can think of for this is preventing people from cheesing certain levels. It plays no part in any puzzle and has killed me more times than I can count.\n\nThe Overworld\nI haven't found any way to skip between the worlds. Every time you start up the game you need to move through the entire game world to get to where you left off. A minor annoyance.\n\n"F you"-moments\nHidden blocks smashing you out of nowhere. Not a lot of these and you learn them quickly, but they deserve a (dis)honorable mention as not having random deaths is game design 101.\n\nMultiplayer\nNot being able to access the entire game without playing with others is a choice I'm highly skeptical of considering the active player base will dwindle (and probably has already).\n","September 13, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a very challenging game, and I was not able to complete the last level, however I was able to get there and play it for a while in about 5 hours. I feel like the playtime will mostly come from having to repeat the challenging levels over and over again. If you are not up to the challenge, this will probably just frustrate you.\n\nThe levels are designed well in that they will make you think very hard in how to approach the different parts of them, and you will get penalized heavily for making mistakes. The game is very cycle based, which is one of my main gripes about the game. If you aren't familiar with cycles, it basically is the concept of things being time based such as moving platforms. The game is full of traps, and a very large portion of them are on a time based system. Because the game is cooperative, the timers are always going, the level does not reset at any point. This can be extremely frustrating. It is normal for cycles to be in platform games, but here it adds to the challenge in an annoying way. Let's say you attempt to do a level right when you load in. You die because you were 2 seconds too fast getting to Trap A. Now you start the level 2 seconds later, however you die to trap B because you were 1 second too slow. This is a constant process of trial and error that becomes more obvious in later levels. There is still a large amount of normal platforming challenge, but I feel the emphasis on cycles as well as the tons of layered time based traps in later levels, adds to a game you will want to stop playing. I feel like this would be made impossible in coop play. Cooperative play would be very fun but I can't imagine you would enjoy it at the end of the game, where you have to make extremely careful decisions about cycles to move on.\n\nThere are also a few other multiplayer modes, but as I was playing this solo it wasn't really of interest to me. It still might be fun to try those out with some friends. There is also a level editor, which is always a really cool thing to have in games to keep things fresh and try out your ideas.\n\nThere is the main set of about 60 levels but there are also secret levels you can find which can be a neat way to get through worlds.\n\nI don't think there is any story in the game. You're just a bunch of cats jumping around.\n\nPros\nCooperative Support\nVery Challenging\nSolid Platforming Mechanics\nLarge amount of levels including hidden worlds\nExtra Multiplayer Game Modes\nLevel Editor\n\nCons\nUnforgiving or downright impossible to casual players\nMultiplayer might be more trouble then it's worth\nCycle Based Level Design\nNo Story\n\nAll in all I did enjoy the game, but I really hated having to "watch the clock" per say just to beat levels. It made me want to stop when I got to the last level just because there were about 20 different timers I had to keep an eye on. If you have some friends that want a very difficult platforming experience, or you yourself are a hardcore platformer lover, you should pick this up\n\n7.1/10","July 5, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The outer ♥♥♥♥♥♥l opening may be partly covered by a membrane called the hymen. At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ allows for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and channels menstrual flow, which occurs periodically as part of the menstrual cycle.\n\nThe location and structure of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ varies among species, and may vary in size within the same species. Unlike mammalian males, who usually have the external urethral opening as the only opening for urination and reproduction, mammalian females usually have the urethral opening for urination and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥l opening for the genital tract. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥l opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans. In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary and reproductive tracts.\n\nWhile the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plays a significant role in human and non-human sexuality, its role with regard to human female sexuality (including heterosexual and lesbian sexual activity) is especially documented. Less is known about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of other animals. In human females and a number of other female mammals, ♥♥♥♥♥♥l moisture is increased during sexual arousal by ♥♥♥♥♥♥l lubrication, which reduces friction and allows for smoother penetration of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ during sexual activity. The texture of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥l walls create friction for the ♥♥♥♥♥ during sexual intercourse and stimulate it toward ejaculation, enabling fertilization. In addition, a variety of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other disorders can affect the ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Because of the risk of STIs, safe sex practices are recommended.\n\nCultural perceptions of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ have persisted throughout history, ranging from viewing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the focus of sexual desire, a metaphor for life via birth, inferior to the ♥♥♥♥♥, or as visually unappealing or otherwise vulgar. In common speech, the word ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is often incorrectly used to refer to the ♥♥♥♥♥.","December 5, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Recommend it if you like punishing platformers. I have one major and a couple of minor concerns with the game that makes it hard for me to recommend it at full price however:\n\nCrouching mid-air\nIf you crouch by pressing down mid-air you lose the ability to steer and drop straight down. This means that touching down will kill you instantly on any jump or any time you need to dodge traps while falling down. The only explanation I can think of for this is preventing people from cheesing certain levels. It plays no part in any puzzle and has killed me more times than I can count.\n\nThe Overworld\nI haven't found any way to skip between the worlds. Every time you start up the game you need to move through the entire game world to get to where you left off. A minor annoyance.\n\n"F you"-moments\nHidden blocks smashing you out of nowhere. Not a lot of these and you learn them quickly, but they deserve a (dis)honorable mention as not having random deaths is game design 101.\n\nMultiplayer\nNot being able to access the entire game without playing with others is a choice I'm highly skeptical of considering the active player base will dwindle (and probably has already).\n","September 13, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're looking to play with friends over Wi-Fi. You have to have a really good internet connection with the time to port forward. Unless you meet the above requirements and have alot of time for setup, you're basically ♥♥♥♥ out of luck.\n\nThe game itself is OKAY. It's certainly no Super Meat Boy, with deaths and level designs progressively feeling like it's not your fault for the cheap death the game decides to throw at you. Some mechanics like the abillity to jump in mid-air if you drop are suprisingly refreshing, but that's about as much "innovation" you'll see in this game.\n\nIf you're looking to play solo, buy this game at a discount. If you wanna play with friends over Wi-Fi and have no time to learn and spend on setting up servers, stay away from it.","December 29, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The outer ♥♥♥♥♥♥l opening may be partly covered by a membrane called the hymen. At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ allows for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and channels menstrual flow, which occurs periodically as part of the menstrual cycle.\n\nThe location and structure of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ varies among species, and may vary in size within the same species. Unlike mammalian males, who usually have the external urethral opening as the only opening for urination and reproduction, mammalian females usually have the urethral opening for urination and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥l opening for the genital tract. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥l opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans. In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary and reproductive tracts.\n\nWhile the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plays a significant role in human and non-human sexuality, its role with regard to human female sexuality (including heterosexual and lesbian sexual activity) is especially documented. Less is known about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of other animals. In human females and a number of other female mammals, ♥♥♥♥♥♥l moisture is increased during sexual arousal by ♥♥♥♥♥♥l lubrication, which reduces friction and allows for smoother penetration of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ during sexual activity. The texture of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥l walls create friction for the ♥♥♥♥♥ during sexual intercourse and stimulate it toward ejaculation, enabling fertilization. In addition, a variety of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other disorders can affect the ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Because of the risk of STIs, safe sex practices are recommended.\n\nCultural perceptions of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ have persisted throughout history, ranging from viewing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the focus of sexual desire, a metaphor for life via birth, inferior to the ♥♥♥♥♥, or as visually unappealing or otherwise vulgar. In common speech, the word ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is often incorrectly used to refer to the ♥♥♥♥♥.","December 5, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
