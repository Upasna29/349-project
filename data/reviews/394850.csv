If you dont know what Nidhogg is, then look it up.\n\nFirst off, like Nidhogg, Square Brawl (SB) has graphics that are very... square. Unlike Nidhogg, however, SB takes advantage of its art style, and somehow makes it look beautiful. That, combined with the screen shaking and other interesting effects, make the game very pleasing to the eye.\n\nAlso like Nidhogg, SB is an indie game. That means that only a few people are working on it, and it has a very limited budget. However, unlike Nidhogg, SB actually has a decent amount of content. In fact, it has way more content on release day than Nidhogg has now, almost 2 years after it was released.\n\nSo, all things considered, SB should cost at least 2-3x the amount of Nidhogg, right? Wrong. SB costs 1/3 of Nidhogg's price, and in my opinion, is way more enjoyable. If I had one gripe with this game, it would be that there needs to be more variation in weapons. I think that the best way to solve this issue would be to create more weapons, and keeping the current ones as well. I think perks would be intersting too.\n\nOverall, I rate this game an 8.5/10","October 22, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

It seems simple and almost too minimalistic in its graphics, but in reality it's alot more fun than it should be.  I went into it not knowing what to expect, and by the end of it I found myself wanting to get some people involved.\n\nSo the game is straight forward. You get up to four players on a level, each one picking two weapons, and you try to kill each other.  Generally it's first to ten but you also can play in teams and do a one life run. The weapons all play rather uniquely and make your strategy different with each one.\n\nOn the plus side it's got local multiplayer, something missing alot these days. On the negative side is it doesn't have online multiplayer, something that really would make this game absolutely worth every penny. Additionally, while you can play with bots, it seems that their reload and damage rate is set differently from yours. For example, in the video above one bot had shield and could instakill with it. It wasn't until I was equipped with shield that I figured out that it dealt twice the damage I was dealing.\n\nRegardless, at five bucks this game is a definite recommend.","November 13, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

I don´t know if it is a thing of my PC, but the game flickers in all resolution but in the 1900 one.\n2. You can't see the score.\n3. When playing with 2vs2 there is a moment on which you can't really tell who you are.\n4. Random events on which the game would close.\n***5. Please add Keyboard support.\n6. Even UI is simple, it can get really hard to understand in the beginning, there is a lack of information about each game mode when you are trying to pick one.\n7. Some power ups are useless.\n\nAmazing gameplay, fun with friends, its a simple game.\n\nWould recommend the game because it is cheap and even with some little issues it can be played.\n\n****** Issues with three ''*'' means they have been fixed. ******\n* issue #3 might be a gameplay thing and not actually an issue.","October 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

It is a simple yet fun concept which is sort of like a simplified version of Super Smash Bros. It has a good variety of weapons and maps and even an option to create your own levels! There are 4 main game modes and some conditions, I suppose that is how I'd call them, which give quite some variety to the game - things like double health, double speed, random weapons etc. You can play with bots, though the real fun comes when you play with a friend, either against him/her or with him/her against bots (I'm not sure how many players can play on 1 PC, though). However, there are some flaws. Mainly, spawn points. Sometimes the game spawns you to your, often inevitable, death. I think the main maps should have fixed spawn points which randomize so you can spawn in a different location each time you die. Also, I did encounter a few bugs. One I encountered was me being stuck in a... rectangle or something. It happens rarely from my experience, though. I did encounter some freezes but they are fixed by pausing and then unpausing the game. There also seems to be a lack of balance between some of the weapons. Overall, the game is nothing amazing but it's worth the 5 bucks in my opinion. I recommend getting it if you have friends coming over at your house. It's a good game.\n7/10 for me.","October 31, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s focused, fast paced and most importantly a whole lot of fun.\n\nThe meat of the game comes from the variety of weapons there are twelve different weapons of which you can pick two for any match. Each weapon offers an entirely different style of play. Weapons range from a standard gun that allows you to consistently shoot to a shield that briefly blocks incoming attacks and can damage enemies you collide with, or a bounce to get you swiftly out of (or into) trouble to a charged shot that shows the arc of fire requiring tactical placement. Whilst playing I quickly found myself favouring the rocket launcher and shotgun which meant that I only needed one good hit to wipe out my foes but left me with a tonne of downtime between each shot.\n\nThere is a decent map pool right from the start where some maps clearly favour certain types of play over others and environmental dangers such as pit and saws force you to pay attention and adds to the overall experience. The game also offers a fairly simple yet robust map editor which allows you to create and share levels. Square Brawl also offers a couple of different modes such as team play and one life bouts alongside various modifiers like double speed, health regeneration and sudden death.\n\nTruthfully one of the main problem it suffers from the same problem that most PC co-op games do. Namely that local co-op doesn’t really work on a PC. Whilst I was able to get a few people playing together it would have been much better suited to a console and maybe with the rise of the steam machine maybe this game will become an even better purchase. I should point out that the review key for this game was provided by the developer free of charge. In terms of other complaints there really aren’t many the music is fairly uninspired and it becomes a little repetitive after a while but in all it does what it does really well.\n\nIn all Square Brawl offers a fun couple of hour and could really work as a party game. It’s a cheap and cheerful experience that appeals to a wide audience and is well worth a look.","December 5, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You take as much fun out of this game as the effort you and your friends are willing to put in.\nThis game allows you to create maps for you to play in with your friends or bots, but I haven't seen any Steam Workshop compatability. I don't know if I just didn't see it or it is not implimented at all.\nThings for the developers:\nIf you go out of the maps boundaries on the Top, Left or Right, you will stay out of bounds until you can feel your way back in or make it to the bottom of the map so that you can respawn. Please make it so that if you leave the screen on the left, you arrive on the Right or keep it as is it, but make it so that you are still visable, whether that requires the camera to be pulled back or it moves with the players.\nAdd the choice to pick and use different colors for the enviroment, whether it's a basic color set or a RGB color wheel, it would be nice to have more variety than just white blocks.\nPowerups? maybe it's pushing the boundaries of Smash Brothers, but it would be a nice game mode to have to keep the game interesting and keep some variety.\nConsider a way of adding online co-op compatability. Don't host servers yourself as they will be high cost and there will be a high latency, which will not suit this game very well. Rather go with the approach of allowing players to create servers themselves and then allowing other players to join to said server. Whether that requires adding a Dedicated Server option where you download another software to host or you can just host as you play.\nOverall this game is a great time killer, I play it when i'm rendering a video as it doesn't take that much CPU or GPU power. It is okay to play with yourself and bots, but if you really want to enjoy yourself, get some friends over to play. Great job on the game so far! I would love to see where the development takes this game.","October 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Square Brawl is a decent local multiplayer game.\n\nThe last time I played the game there were a couple of annoying bugs that kind of affected the game. Players would regularly spawn over pits killing them with no chance of saving themselves. Guns would also randomly start shooting even if I wasn't pressing any buttons. These bugs may have been fixed though and they don't ruin the game so they shouldn't be a reason not to purchase the game.\n\nThe gameplay is decent. You can have some fun with the game. The guns are not that balanced though. The machine gun is by far the most powerful in my opinion making it not worth using any of the other guns. If you use the random weapons mode though you can have quite a bit more fun with the game since it is more fun not knowing what weapons you will be able to use at a given time.\n\nIf you like these local multiplayer arcade games you can have some fun with Square Brawl. It just wasn't that original in my opinion so it is not the type of game that I would play for long time. At only $5 though the game is pretty cheap so if you are looking for a local multiplayer game you might have some fun with Square Brawl.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","2"

This game aims to be something you play with friends (assuming you had any) on your couch. This game might be slightly better than getting purple-nurpled by the Hulk on a day below zero if there was a couple issues fixed that the dev will most certainly not fix. I didn’t expect too much from this steaming pile of horse ♥♥♥♥, but I expected the same level of quality presented by Towerfall and Build ‘n Bump -- both fantastic couch play games. But I can’t rant about it forever, you gotta know why it’s garbage.\n\nWhy is it trash?Because it’s unbalanced. I played it for five minutes when I first got it, and it was okay. I plugged my laptop into a tv (Because having multiple people huddle around a ♥♥♥♥ing laptop is the ♥♥♥♥♥ when you share the same outlook of people as Kurt Kobain.) and me and my sister played it. We quickly found out that playing with bots is not the way to go because their reaction time is superhuman, and they know the good weapons. I of course go for the shotgun and sniper, since you’re either on top of someone or far from them, only to find out that I brought a confetti gun to a hammer fight. Yes, the AI decided to go with Spanish Inquisition torturing devices that somehow do more damage than a ♥♥♥♥ing shotgun burst point blank. They had a weapon that would only damage you if you were touching them, which doesn’t sound bad, but the screen is so ♥♥♥♥ing small, having a volatile little blue square chasing you with firecrackers in their hands isn’t the easiest ♥♥♥♥ing thing in the world to deal with. So this orb of death is more powerful than the sniper, and I know this because I’ve never one shotted someone with the sniper, but have been one shotted from the volatile little ♥♥♥♥ chasing me wreaking of uranium. So there is no ♥♥♥♥ing way I’m gonna play this game until it gets balanced the ♥♥♥♥ out.\n\nSecond major issue is the lag. I know I have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC, but, I mean, the game is called “Square Brawl.” Square Brawl. SQUARE Brawl. The game is LITERALLY 32*32 blocks attacking each other with slightly lower res bullets. Unless the physics engine is made in Brain♥♥♥♥, why is it lagging? What the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing to make the menus lag as well? What is going on that is making the ♥♥♥♥ing menu lag? Fix this ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnything good?Assuming you can run the game and you never play with bots and you tell your “friends” that they can’t choose the OP orb of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry, then it’s alright. Not bad, But also not as good as Towerfall. That’s pretty much it. I’m cutting off my review at like 550 words. It’s usually over 1000. The gameplay is what you see in the trailer, just slightly more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and way less fun because you don’t have friends to play with. So ♥♥♥♥ it, do what you want. I don’t give a damn.","January 12","false","0.3"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","4","17","2","16"
