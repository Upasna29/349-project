What can purchase for $2 these days? Now, I’d like you to narrow that list down and ask yourself what you can get for that $2 that will provide you several hours of entertainment. That is one way of looking at games such as The Amazing Adventures of Ash – Afterparty, Z3roram’s debut game on the Steam platform. To be even fairer, the idea behind the game came from one of their team’s first time developers, Lisa, and this is the very first game that she has developed. But my gosh, what a fantastic first effort.\n\nMy expectations weren’t high entering the game. Thoughts of ‘meh, just another crappy RPGMaker game,’ ‘good grief this is just a cash in for the female gamer crowd,’ and ‘It’s so cheap that it has to be nasty’ filtered through my mind. I couldn’t have been further from the truth. The game immersed me into its creepy little world almost immediately. The puzzles kept me firmly entrenched. I struggled mightily early on trying to work out just what I had to do.\n\nThe lone negative review on Steam to date pinpoints the problems that some players have with RPGMaker — the technology is old and games have a tendency to look generic. However, I find that there is a certain charm that helps build immersion in the good or better games built in the engine. I do have an admission to make. I was not a fan of the engine before the creation of this site. I didn’t appreciate the games that were made in them nor the developers who made them or the publishers that published them. Steamified have now featured several games in the engine and those games have shown me that if you put your heart and hard work into the creation of your game that there are a number of different intricacies that you can make. I wont forget the unique battle system that was a huge addition in Pale Echoes, for example, or the delicate manner in which Beyond Reality handled important issues relating to science and mankind. I can say again with ease that The Amazing Adventures of Ash utilizes the RPGMaker software with bravado. It’s so much more than a generic RPGMaker game if you’re willing to give it an opportunity.\n\nThe narrative, the story and the puzzles are just flat out fun. The game had no right to suck me in the way that it did. A lot of hard work and thought went into its development. It’s a shockingly debut game for a single developer. I have to think that at some point in the future we could be hearing a lot more from Z3roram’s Lisa. There’s not much to criticize and there isn’t much to point out other than the superlatives that I have offered herein already. It’s just a really good game and at $2 you owe it to yourself to pick it up – or at the very worst pick it up when or if it ever sees itself added to an indie bundle.\n\nIf I could offer some advice it would be much as it always is. Please take full advantage of Steam as a platform. You would see sales rise if you were take advantage of adding Steam achievements and trading cards. Further, you would further gain monetarily through the Steam community marketplace with people who sell the cards. I do not understand why developers and publishers fail to take advantage of Steam. I would happily play through the game again if it allowed me to unlock achievements. As a badge collector I would certainly play more to unlock trading cards. As an open question to developers reading this, why do you not utilize what Steam offers? It seems like a no brainer from a monetary perspective and selling your games, regardless of whether or not they are a passion project (which I would hope for most indie developers it would be the case more often than not), is a business.\n\nIt is my genuine hope that Z3roram give Lisa the time and the freedom to complete more episodes in this series. Although it wont appeal to every gamer there is a player base for this game and that audience will appreciate what this game has to offer.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","February 1","true","1.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

This game makes you think and be methodical in solving the interconnected puzzles throughout the game. The graphics are carefully thoughtout to add to the atmosphere. It's tricky in some places and maybe a little too simple in others, but in a way, that makes you have to pay more attention to decide if you're missing something or not.\nThis is a pretty simple game, but I am enjoying solving the problems. It is well worth the little bit of money spent and I have a feeling it will keep me busy for a while. To me, that means money well spent! I would definately recommend this game for anyone who likes puzzles.","February 23","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FroggeDev/recommended/437170/","FroggeDev","Frogge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FroggeDev/","132 products in account","Before starting the review, I would like to point out that my long playtime is because at one point I put my computer on hibernate and went to sleep without closing the app. Now let's move on shall we~\n\nThe Amazing Adventures of Ash is an okay game. It's not the worst game out there but I can't recommend it either. It is supposed to be a puzzle game, however it fails to deliver good puzzles as most of them are just running around and interacting with everything. The most you are going to get is finding passwords which is easy because you do not need to figure them out yourself, they are simply given to you. There is a lot of looking around as sometimes the items aren't obvious at all. I had to look at the screenshots to actually figure out that I can get a candle. Most of the time you are clueless about what you need to do because the game does not point it out to you. It's like giving a pear to a baby and expecting him to turn it into a key and use it on a door. You get what I mean :P\nThere is barely any character development. We don't know much about even Ashley's personality. We know very little about Emily and his dad too, it's like they are just there to fill in the plot and nothing else. They don't feel real. But there are also some things that never get explained. For example, who is the lady with the blue hair? A friend of Emily? Another person the dad sacrificed?\nThere are also quite a few things in the game that never get explained. Why are there spirits in the house? Did some one die there before? Why are there weird places like a playground and a maze in the house? What about the ''He Watches'' message?\nThe mapping in the game was not too bad. Larger rooms were a bit empty and some tiles were used incorrectly, but overall it was pretty good. The art was pretty weird and looked like something in MS Paint(in cases like these I actually prefer games without custom art). The battles are way too easy. I was able to get past them just by mashing the attack button. Even though there were only 3(I'm sure there is more but maybe I noticed to avoid them)I still thought they could present a bigger challenge.\nThe game is poorly made in cases too. You can interact with things even when you aren't facing them and that seems to be a common bug in newbie devs' games. It's really really easy to fix. There are also unwanted options in the menu which the developer didn't get rid of, such as equipment. I feel like for a game that is planning to go commercial, the developers would at least bother to google how to do it. In fact there is a forum post with a tutorial on how to remove them and it's literally the first thing that shows up when you google ''rpg maker vx ace removing menu options''. There are even scripts to do it!\nThe story is not really anything too amazing or new. I won't spoil anything for you but just know that there are games with similar plots(ex: Dear Sister). And as I mentioned earlier in my review it does have quite a few plot holes too.\nThere was graphics clash since the developer tried to use realistic sprites and RTP together. One of the resource packs used is meant to be for taller characters so there were objects like beds 3 times the size of the player.\nThere were things I did enjoy in it too. The length was just about perfect(BE WARNED, the game takes 1.5 hours or so to beat. I know some people consider that short. I don't, but I thought I'd point it out)and the price was reasonable. I liked exploring different parts of the house and I liked the little secrets hidden around the place, like the teddy bears.\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game. While it could be a good first game it shouldn't be commercial. For the developers, try uploading some free games and getting feedback on them before going commercial. I heavily recommend Rpg Maker Net or Rpg Maker Web as there are a lot of rpg maker experts that would be willing to give feedback to help the game improve. This developer clearly has potential but needs to improve. I'm sure Episode 2 could be better since the dev will be getting feedback for this game.\nFor the dev: I'd be willing to help out too whether it's giving feedback or helping with eventing. I'm sure you will improve so please don't take my review harshly :)","February 12","false","13.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Track all over, finding key items with little mysteries hidden. It actually can be tough at times. It's not at too bad of a price either, so I would recommend it.\n\nThis is a good game. There's room for improvement, I'm not denying that. It's a great stepping stone and I see the hard work that went into it. The areas are full of exploration with descriptive surroundings. You're immersed, even if it's for a small amount of time. I hope more people pick this up, because it's a nice alternative to classic RPG's, but still has the sense of one.","January 29","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Play as Ash[ley], an amnesiac klepto who only takes what will most certainly be convenient to her later. Good sound design (even though some of it doesn't really fit the theme), artwork could use some work though. Game's an okay first game. Would be better if it was made from scratch and not through rpg maker.

This game is full of riddles some harder than others. I have to admit I was stumped at times. The idea behind it all is a great one. The character "Ash" she is a cutie. I like the different rooms that this gamer has put into the game. I also like that when playing not all riddles can be solved in just one room. I do think the lighting is a little to dark in some of the rooms making it kind of difficult to see at times","January 25","true","5.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"
