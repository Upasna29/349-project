"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/recommended/392610/","somnivore","Chewable C++","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/","2644 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTricone Lab is a unique, "pure" puzzle game by a "microscopic indie developer". Pick it up if you are looking for an original puzzler to challenge your mind in new ways.\n\nThe "pure" refers to the focus on the puzzles. There is no story. There is a sort of biochemistry theme, but aside from the visual aesthetic, there's not any "actual" biochemistry going on here (so don't worry if that wasn't your favorite school subject). The visual "biochemistry" presentation is quite nice, unique, and carefully crafted (surely no small feat to program).\n\nThe gameplay is a sort of turn based resource management. The game is split into maps, which are split into several single screen levels. For each level, you must figure out how to get from the initial configuration to one satisfying the level requirement (producing some amount of tricone).\n\nAlthough the puzzle mechanics are turn based in essence, the presentation is not static. The pieces you can interact with float freely inside of cell structures in real time. You interact with them by clicking and dragging - which does convey a sort of feeling of playing with microorganisms.\n\nThe mechanics are elegant, logical, well designed, and clearly introduced. There are three basic categories of pieces you can interact with: resources, catalysts, and compounds. Drag resources onto catalyst receptors to generate compounds. Compound pieces can be activated to manipulate the cells or other pieces.\n\nI'm not aware of any other games quite like this, although it reminded me vaguely of working out chess puzzles. The mechanics are of course quite different, but there is similarity in satisfying a goal condition from a starting position using a set of pieces via a sequence of moves.\n\nLike other resource management games, as well chess problems, the process is primarily deductive, but trial and error can sometimes be used as a crutch to a limited degree. The mechanics of tricone lab are quite clever, though, and require a higher degree of "lateral thinking" than most resource management games.\n\nI am quite pleased at how tricone lab made me think in new ways ("lateral thinking"). This is very valuable to me in a game. I did find myself getting stuck on some levels a few times, but I moved on to other levels or took breaks, and eventually was able to get through all of the standard levels on my own, and felt quite good about that. Having the achievements to commemorate that is nice too ;)\n\nThe play time through the standard levels is roughly 10 hours, but will vary quite a bit up or down depending on how readily you pick up the mechanics.\n\nThe game includes a good level editor, and thus hopefully there will be quite a few more levels to play later on (there are already a few user maps that are quite decent).\n\nThere are a few rare glitches (and a common one), but none are gamebreaking - just a bit annoying sometimes. Hopefully these will be fixed eventually, but they hardly alter my positive opinion of the game at this point.\n\nWhile technically still in Early Access, the game is complete and the difficulty is quite well tuned at this point. If interested and price not a factor, there is no reason to delay.\n\nDisclosure: I received a free copy expressly without any obligations.","March 20","true","125.9"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","32","32","0","3"

It was expressly not in return for any consideration other than general non-review feedback. But since I've enjoyed it, here we are.\n\nTricone Lab is an untimed puzzle game. The setting is a view of stylized cellular level organisms, presumably looking through a microscope in a biochemistry lab. In each level, the object is to produce a specified quantity (generally 1-3) of a "molecule" called Tricone. This is done by moving red, blue, and green cone objects into the same cell as a catalyst object. There are many other objects that can make this process easier or harder. There are objects to break cell walls, to make new walls, to transport objects through walls, components to make other objects, to break things down into components, etc. So each level is about using the resources you have available to get the right quantity of cones through the present cells to a catalyst. I find the puzzles to be quite well designed.\n\nIf I had to pick a game to compare the mechanics to, it's probably Divide by Sheep. Both have a fixed quantity of resources that you have to carefully maneuver around the level to get them where they need to go. And both are very solid games.\n\nDon't be concerned by the Early Access tag. While still technically a beta, this is a polished, fully working product. The core levels are already done, with possibly some slight future changes to get the learning / difficulty curve right. And with a level editor, the developer is also hoping to build up some user submitted levels. But in my opinion, the Early Access designation could be removed today and the game would be fine.\n\nStory: You're making a molecule called Tricone from cells. Presumably in a lab. That's it and that's fine. It's a puzzle game, not a visual novel, adventure game, or grand rpg.\n\nVisuals: Minimal 2D, but fitting the game. Cell walls are black with grey, black, and white backgrounds and resources. The exceptions are the cones and Tricone, which makes them stand out as the main objectives. The cell walls are a bit squirmy to sell the concept.\n\nSound: Also minimal but fitting. It's just a few short bits of music and sounds that sound unobtrusive and vaguely scienceish. Feel free to play your own music.\n\nLength: I'm currently at 6.5 hours, about 85% through the stock levels. The remainder will probably be slower, and I suspect I've been faster paced than most will be to this point. There are also a couple of sets of user created levels available now, with more presumably being added over time. And you could choose to create levels. Update: I finished the stock levels (and got all of the current achievements) in 9 hours. It sounds like that may be on the quick side.\n\nDifficulty: Challenging, but I've never been really stuck at any point yet. So in a nice spot for me. Others milage may easily vary.\n\nAchievements: Straightforward, simply for completing each set of stock levels. 100% the stock levels and you'll get all of them. Possibly subject to change as it is Early Access, but the end result should be fair and reasonable.\n\nTL:DR: I like it and recommend it. If you like puzzle games with a solid but not overwhelming challenge this is a good choice.","March 14","true","9.2"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","2"

While inside the sick person hi-jinx's ensue as you travel around fighting mysterious illnesses..   You eradicate the illnesses one by one, and eventually save the man's life.  You exist their body via a sneeze and manage to be made your rightful size again. You've not only gained the acceptance of the man you saved but you get to lay with his sister.. I'm not talking about the movie innerspace with Dennis Quaid (prior to getting old and becoming a drunk,,, ok I don't know Dennis Quaid is a drunk, I think I was talking about his brother Randy Quaid)  and Martin Short...  (Has somehow managed to maintain a career after his stint on Saturday Night Live, not to be confused with Jon Lovitz, who failed to have a long career and was last known as the man who was mistakenly identified as being deceased, when he was actually still alive)...\n\nWhere was I at again?  Oh yes the game Tricone Labs, a unique Puzzle game, designed with the thought of allowing you to interact with a microscopic organism.. Nothing says amazing game like manipulating ♥♥♥♥♥♥ism, (intentional misspelling. the answer is YES!!!)  This game has a very simplistic style, you solve puzzles by completing the Triforce.. (Zelda reference, will probably fly over the heads of many PC gamers.. since we've never been blessed with a zelda game..).  The gameplay is simplistic but the puzzles aren't, even the most accomplished puzzle game player will be baffled, and find hours and hours of challenge.\n\nThe game will require you to use your mental prowess to get through stages, the increasing difficulty was a breath of fresh air, I was quite thankful that my hand wasn't held the entire way through.\n\nPro's\nChallenging\nSimplistic game play,\nDecent length to fully finish the puzzles\nLevel Editor\n\nCon's\na bit repetitive\nmusic can be a bit annoying\nachievements seem to be broken (didn't unlock for me..)\n\nOverview\n\nThis is a must have for puzzle game lovers, if you enjoy sitting down, and using your mind to analyze and figure out a puzzle you'll love it, it will challenge even the most seasoned puzzle game enthusiast.  If you can't sit still for 5 minutes, or like my cousin Vilo have ADHD or, if you're idea of a good video game is an FPS shooter, fist pumping, and saying woo, woo woo, this game probably won't be for you.  If you suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder, you may very well find this game amazing.  It'll give you something to compulsively obsess over..  I'd suggest picking it up, playing it, beating it, and donning some underwear on your head, a white twin throw sheet around your neck, picking up a plastic sword and calling yourself Louis, because you'll fell like Louis Skolnick when he mounted Betty in the classic movie Revenge of the nerds..  NO playing this game doesn't make you a nerd, but gosh darn it, everyone knows Louis ascended from his nerdom, the moment he bedded Betty...","March 25","true","13.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","14","14","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/392610/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA Lateral-Thinking Puzzler for people who like to think outside the box. Tricone Lab performs a  fairly substantial technical challenge in the floating interface. Then, there is the geographical challenge of matching math to shape and space, in puzzles crafted by hand.\n\nGeometric Interface/Graphics\nMost puzzle games are on a grid, which is much easier to program. But, Tricone Lab’s cells are floating, amoeba-like structures that gradually change shape while you play. As you pull and drag lines, and the nodes interact with one another, it looks like drawing with a pencil. These long projections can become quite comical when structures called “anticatalysts” start grabbing the nodes you needed to complete the puzzle. Some cells have positive or negative charges, and that may break down larger units you have constructed, all in all causing you to laugh, or cry depending on the difficulty of the map. It certainly brings to mind Dante’s various levels of paradise, purgatory, and hell, all in one game.\n\nGameplay:\nThe interface looks like a cell body floating in space. Within the cellular bodies are nodes, or individual puzzle pieces that work in very specific ways. These pieces have functions; as in movement, transport or carry, cloning, charge (+-), breaking cell walls, and slightly larger templates. The templates are to be pieced together with correct nodes to form more powerful tools. A standard level starts out with a variety of these nodes subdivided in different compartments of a cell. Somewhere in there are colored cones and a Tricone template. The goal is to connect one of each of 3 color cones to a template and form a “Tricone.” All of the other pieces are to help you get the cones together with the tricone template.\n\nThe parts are constructed using formulas that are available by simply pressing the “Describe” button when any node is selected. The formulas are not only visible at all times, but they are rarely complex. The complexity is more an aspect of the number of nodes, and the number of node functions.\n\nThe game has 23 maps. Each map has from 3 to 5 levels, making a total of 100 levels. The menu places the maps in alphabetical order at the moment, but that will probably be changed, because 4 of them are labeled as demo maps. It is best to pick these out to play first, as they are like tutorials, and are out of order: Balance, Breakers, BreakerMaker, and Tricone. The most difficult maps are all at the end, and are locked until completion of all the previous maps.\n\nMath & Logic\nWithin maps, the levels progress in difficulty, but most are solved quickly. In the locked levels, the “boss level” for each map is often difficult and may be quite time-consuming to complete.  They require higher-order thinking skills, and you must first analyze, then synthesize to complete those locked levels. My (adult) son became absorbed in the game over my shoulder and ended up downloading the game himself. He’s progressed much faster through the levels than I have, even though I spent many hours in-game while he was at work, just trying to keep up with him.\n\nNarrative:\nThe puzzles are wrapped in the narrative shell of a human cell. Without a written story, you are left to picture and experience the puzzles as if you were inside a cell performing the functions of cells. It becomes almost a metaphor for cellular biology. You basically have a math game inside a science game.  I honestly see no cons to this game. “It’s all good.”\n\nPros:\n+ All of the puzzles are hand-crafted (no randomly computer generated levels)\n+ The game includes a level editor for sharing your own maps & levels in the workshop\n+ Higher Order Thinking skills are demanded to complete the more challenging levels.\n+ Challenging for all ages\n+ One man developer is active in the community and responds to screenshots, workshop levels, and will accept feedback.\n\nCons:\n- Tricone Lab is still in early access and may change over time.\n\nI recommend this game for those who enjoy spatial math puzzles.  As of now, I’ve finished 85/100 levels, lacking mostly the boss levels for the last few now unlocked maps. These will take me quite a bit longer, though some gamers could probably complete this game within 9-12 hours.  With the “Paparazzi” map I’ve submitted to the workshop, & the user levels I’ve downloaded, I’ve already spent 25 hours in this fun & challenging puzzler. I’m sure I will spend another 25, so the game is definitely a fun use of time and I would rate it a 9/10 in the Puzzle genre.","March 28","true","30.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","4"

For this you should combine 3 different colors. The whole game plays in a microscopic organism. The game has a very interesting gameplay mechanism. You are changing the cell structure, breaking down cells etc, doing anything to reach your goal. The most useful thing in game is your logic, as the game requires some thinking from the start, and then new and new things needs to be used to solve the levels. It will force you learn to think in a more and more strategic way, it will get gradually harder as you learn the new features. The game have a minimalistic style. The game also features a level editor, so we can create our own levels and share it with the  community, and of course you can play community created levels as well.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+a lot of levels\n+level creator\n+community shared levels\n+interesting gameplay and concept\n+simple and clear design\n+steam achievements\n\n-if you don’t like thinking after some levels can be frustrating for you\n\nSo this is interesting puzzle game with unusual concept.

Many interesting mechanics in this game (break a cell wall to neutralize a negative charge in order to build tricone, or build up a negative charge inside the cell to break apart a tricone in order to clone its components, required when the level requires you to build several tricones). Strategy comes into play in later levels as you may have to use different tools provided to beat the level. For example, you may have to break down the walls of a cell in a certain order, to neutralize the cell, etc.\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nMix of easy and challenging levels\nAbility to design/share levels (coming soon)\nInteresting concept of a game (mixing biology and puzzle solving)\n\nCons:\nSometimes requires a lot of trial and error to beat levels\nNot too much content currently\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\n\nSolid and novel take on the puzzle genre.

The idea seems original to me, only thing that concept reminds me (in a way) is SpaceChem - but don't worry, Tricone Lab doesn't have such high learning curve and it's immediate fun from beginning, with short and practical tutorials for every gameplay mechanism. Levels are balanced and everytime you start to get bored by repeating mechanics, a new one is presented.\nA huge surprise comes with the Java engine that the game uses, because many indie Java-based games end up being buggy and not polished. This is not the case!\n\nPositives:- New gameplay mechanics introduced after every few level sets (with included a tutorial level set every time).\n- 100 levels. And the game's yet only in early access, so we can expect more levels later.\n- Nice and simple graphics that doesn't distract you from solving the puzzles.\n- If you make a mistake, you don't have to restart the whole level. There are undo/redo buttons.\n\nNeutrals:- Later levels may be frustrating for players expecting easy puzzle game - you can skip some levels though!\n- Steam achievements are only gained for unlocking new gameplay mechanics (completing levels) - there aren't any special hard achievements.\n\nNegatives:- The price (11,99 €) for a puzzle game may be too much for some people.\n\n\nNote: I've got a review code for Tricone Lab directly from the developer.

Difficulty is always a subjective matter, even more so in the puzzle genre, but the puzzles felt appropriately teasing without putting me in a guru meditation state. I liked the presence of not only a snappy 'undo' button, but a 'redo' one; I never felt any frustration navigating the puzzles thanks to them.\nThere is something really right with the game: I usually am fed up with about any gaming experience after an hour, yet I played all the levels in a couple of sessions in less than a day time.\nI wished I could have gone on playing more.

I personally regret being inept at designing anything: there seems to be so many mechanics interplays to explore still.

I was given a key by the developer who told me that I don't need to leave a review but to check out their game as they thought I'd like it based on games I already own. After playing for about 1.5 hours I feel like I can write up how I feel about Tricone Lab so far.\n\nSo first of all I'd just like to say that it reminds me of Spacechem quite a lot. This is definitely not a bad thing as Spacechem is an extremely good puzzle game. I do believe that this is also different enough to be entirely its own game which is also nice.\n\nThe first few levels are reletively simple but there's a few which give you some nice satisifaction for completing (I haven't reached the inevitable 'impossible' levels yet but I'm sure they'll present some tricky challenges).\n\nThe music and sounds in the game are all very nice and fit in well with the atmosphere. The graphics are basic but good to look at.\n\nI do however have a couple of negatives which I should point out. The game crashed once but this is understandable as its an early access title and the game saved up to the level I was on automatically anyway so this was prety small of an issue. I would also like some kind of story to go with this (maybe something like Spacechem's) as I personally feel like its lacking without one. Finally I also believe the full price may be a little steep for my liking but I'm sure this feeling will diminish as I progress further in the game.\n\nOverall Tricone Lab is a pretty great puzzle game which hardcore puzzlers should be able to dig into and have some great fun solving.","March 24","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This review is simply because I genuinely enjoyed the game.\n\nTricone Lab is a 2D puzzle game where you seek to create a certain number of "tricones" by joining three individually cones into a catalyst. A variety of obstacles may be in your way, whether barriers, other catalyzers which will steal the cones, or needing to transport/clone/etc various tools in order to establish the final set of cones necessary in the proper location. A few of the levels are quite difficult, but there's an excellent series of tutorial levels which ramp the difficulty in a way that allows you to explore each newly-introduced mechanic.\n\nThe game is still in early access, and there's a few known bugs on the forum which are getting ironed out, but none of the ones which I ran into are gamebreaking or mess with the experience whatsoever - typically a graphical glitch, or the like, which can be solved by reloading the level.\n\nThe game has a complete set of authoring tools, allowing users to create their own levels which can be shared via the Tricone Labs website.\n\nAll in all, it took me roughly 5 hours to complete all the levels that came with the game, and it left me wanting more - I'm actually trying my hand at making a level or two right now, which is something I practically never do, and as I got the game for free, I bought an extra copy to gift to a friend, which is some of the highest praise I can offer. If you enjoy puzzle games, this is likely right up your alley.","April 2","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Maybe it's the way all the individual parts undulate and wander about or maybe it's the fact that nothing can be moved, only combined or separated, but every part seems to have a life of its own. They all want to return to order, to be rearranged so that the tricone can be formed. Each new piece is introduced one at a time, in its own series of levels. That tutorial, if the process can be called that, lasts for about half the game. But because each piece has presented its own distinct motivation so well and the end goal of any puzzle is so simple, the entire game becomes completely modular. Pieces can be positioned in almost endless variety making the inclusion of a full level editor an act of great foresight. Community maps, which appear to go through an approval process from the developers, are already being made and are extending the game with a creativity that only crowd-sourcing can produce. This is a good thing; for though the official levels are a full taste of what Tricone Lab has to offer, a taste often leaves one only wanting more, as it does it in this case.","March 30","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a great example of a few rules and conditions that multiply together to something really complex. I've been playing for 6 hours or so, unlocked 33% of the achievements, so still have a lot of playing to go. Pretty good value for £6.99.\n\nI am getting to the levels where you can draw new membrane walls to make partitions and protect/isolate some of the pieces you're playing with, and each time you get a new type of 'piece' to play with it gives it more depth.\n\nThe game also introduces you to the mechanism of play very well - it doesn't teach you what to do, so much as put you in the right environments to learn what to do, before it throws the harder problems at you.\n\nI'm also playing on a touchscreen, which makes the whole thing quite tactile.\n\nSo if you're into thinking and problem solving, give it a try - if you get past four or five levels you'll be hooked into finishing it - while it gets more difficult as it goes on, it's always possible to solve.  :)","March 28","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To this day, one of my biggest gaming achievements is fully completing all six of the Professor Layton titles. But recently, it’s felt like every puzzle game has had to be multi-genre: puzzle platformer, exploration puzzle, puzzle brawler, the list goes on. I still think there’s something to be said for an unashamed, pure puzzle game. So does Tricone Lab fill that gap?\n\nTricone Lab follows your classic puzzle style. Every level has the same goal – in this case, to connect one of each coloured triangle to the connector to make Tricones. As the game goes on, more and more mechanics are introduced, making it more and more difficult. However, where many games introduce this in a very linear way, Tricone Lab instead offers a series of tutorial-esque levels for each mechanic that, upon completion, provide you with key for that puzzle piece. Beyond these levels, the rest of the levels are grouped by what pieces the puzzle contains and can only be unlocked by using the keys.\n\nThis is a fantastic idea: not only does it mean that whilst looking for harder puzzles you won’t accidentally stumble across something you’ve never seen before, but also that if you come across something you don’t like (for example, I didn’t get along with the anti-cones) then you can easily see which puzzles have them and avoid them.\n\nWhilst there is no music while solving the puzzles (a gameplay decision), the general feel of the game is great. It has an unmistakeable, and presumably intended, feel of messing around with cells in a lab, although since I’m not a biologist I can’t claim to have any specialised knowledge on the subject.\n\nAnother thing that I should praise the developer for is the Colour-Blind Mode. The game relies on moving certain coloured triangles, so to anyone with colour deficiency this could prove difficult. Whilst it only affects a minority of a player base, it’s always great to see an option like that included.\n\nAlongside one hundred standard levels on launch, Tricone Lab also has an editor that allows for very simple creation of puzzles. I had a good play around on it and discovered two things; firstly that the editor is very robust and allows for a large number of things to be happening at any one time, and secondly that I’m really bad at making puzzles!\n\nSo how is it overall? In all honesty, aside from the music and perhaps a few minor GUI elements that could do with a bit of cleaning, the game’s really great. I only discovered that it’s in early access whilst doing a bit of fact checking for this review, so that tells you just how polished it is. And whilst puzzle games aren’t for everyone, Tricone Lab stands out as one of those that even on a relatively simple premise provides both a lot of playability and for a lot of challenges, even for puzzle veterans.","November 24, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

One very small issue i had and it could of been my system is it would not launch when "in game cursor" is turned on and when turned off it worked fine.\n\nI like the concept of the game where you need to fuse those tri color thingies but with some obsticals in between. Now i am yet far in the game to know more about it but lets just say some puzzzle can really stump you if you don't think properly! You have to have an open mind and think outside of the box to solve certain levels. Took almost an hour and a half to do one particular level! Now others would laugh on how long it took to do what seemed a simple level now but not all brains are created equal #kappa.\n\nThe game lacks of a co-op mode but after thinking about it this game can be a collective thought type. For instance you are a livestreamer and viewers are giving hints or suggestions. Hell a lot of us were just as stumped and we all raged together but we seemed to pull through and solved the puzzles as one.\n\nI've yet played with the editor but my friend did earlier tonight and the possibilites are endless if you are creative enough to make a hard but fun map.

It may look simplistic for the first few levels, but as each level progresses through they add more simple mechanics that make the game that slight bit harder each time.\n\nGameplayTricone Lab is a cool puzzle game, It's starts off fairly simple, with the first few levels basically just explaining how each mechanic work. It's nice that the way that they produce the first few levels as a tutorial, but it doesn't really feel like it's a tutorial. After the first few levels of explaining the game, the game then throws you in without any or much help at all. The game mostly focuses on the basic trial and error way of solving puzzles, if you can't mentally work out how to solve each of the levels.This gives each level a nice feeling of satisfaction once you have completed each level, as some of them are feedishly difficult and hard to figure out. This really helps a puzzle game, with a nice satisfaction of completing each level. Apart from that, there's not much else to talk about gameplay wise of this game. I would personally like to have some sort of story involved in this game, just as a bit more of motivtion to try to complete each level and see what happens next in the story.\n\nThe music and sounds are very fitting for this type of casual puzzle game. It has some really calm and satisfying music that plays as you try to think through, or trial and error, on each level. The sounds that are produced throughout each level are very well fitting with the music itself. It compliments the music very well, along with the satisfying level completion it has a nice ending sound to each level when you complete it.\n\nPros+ Nice difficulty curve\n+ Many mechanics to learn\n+ Satisfying music & sounds\n+ Achievements\n\nCons- No story\n- No trading cards\n\nResult / Final thoughtsFor the time being, Tricone Lab is a fun and addicting casual puzzle game to play. There are loads of mechanics to learn as you play throughout the game, making the game increasingly more challenging and difficult as you play through more levels of the game. The music and sounds work really well together and work well with the satisfying completion of eahc of the levels.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Good Games Giveaways & Reviews curator group here.","March 25","true","0.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It’s for this reason that I find myself not only drawn to Tricone Lab but also a big fan of the game. Now, although I’ve got a pair of university degrees neither of them are in the sciences. I consider myself only of average to above average intelligence – some would argue both ways (I can have the intellectual laziness of Homer Simpson yet other times people have asked me to tone it down on the intellectual quotient) but there is something immediately accessible about Patrickhill’s game that I will claim would have some appeal to the majority of gamers.\n\nThe tutorial levels are well designed and teach the player everything that they need to know to progress throughout each series of puzzles. From there, however, each of the one hundred original levels can vary from stupendously easy to infuriatingly difficult. Each level is fair. There is, of course, a solution. It’s simply a matter of discovering the solution. Hopefully without searching for an answer online – that would be cheating not only the game but yourself. At times you will feel like you’re the smartest little biscuit and at times you will believe that you’re lacking in the most fundamental of ways. It’s a real mixed bag and it’s beautiful. Very rarely do puzzle games reach this level of excellence. Tricone Lab is nothing if not meticulously designed.\n\nThere truly isn’t much at all to criticize. Every aspect of the game at least delivers in some way or another. The presentation is suitable and the sound effects and soundtrack are quite charming and add positively to the game’s aesthetic. Patrickhill has even thought about the implementation of Steamworks to strengthen his title. There are achievements which I believe is a must have for any Steam based puzzle game. There is even a level editor so that players can upload their own levels to the Steam cloud and share with other players around the world which gives the title the length of lifespan only limited to the game’s player base. Which is an issue. SteamSpy currently estimates the total number of owners in the 17 (that’s seventeen!) to 1,463 range. This may have something to do with the $11.99 price tag which is higher than other puzzle games on Steam. The game has not yet enjoyed a sale. However, I would urge Patrickhill Games to consider adding Steam trading cards to the game and when that is done putting the game on a 25% discount for a week before considering a permanent price drop. This would capture those who buy up on trading card games the moment that they are added to the program which in turn should lead to increased word of mouth.\n\nI personally cannot recommend Tricone Labs enough. It’s a wonderful puzzle game that will improve your logical thinking.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 28","true","14.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The puzzle mechanics are unique, and although there are 100 levels, the first 20 or so are basically tutorial levels. On top of that, the game has a level editor so that players can create their own puzzles and share them with each other. With this foundation, you will definitely get bored of the game long before you ever solve all of the puzzles out there. The game also does a good job of adhering to it's organic chemistry theme, both visually and fundamentally. Additionally, the game draws very little wattage and can be played with just a mouse, making it good for study breaks and play on laptops without charging. I've actually put in most of my play time on the road rather than in my living room.\n\nThis all sounds good, but the greatest criticism I can give the game is that the puzzles generally aren't fun. They are unique and plentiful, but this isn't enough to make them fun (at least for me). Ultimately they fail to deliver the "ah-ha" moments that define the puzzle genre because the puzzles - even the most challenging ones - never succeed in challenging the player's perspective. Solving puzzles is a matter of bookkeeping and mental RAM. The developer's approach to increasing the difficulty of puzzles is to just add more steps and more components to the puzzle. The hardest puzzles I have come across are cluster♥♥♥♥s on my screen and it takes several minutes of staring just to recognize all of the components involved. When I finally solved some of the hardest puzzles in the game, it wasn't because I finally stumbled across the crux of the puzzle or had some epiphany of how to approach the problem, but rather it was just a matter of finally finishing the mental  processing all  of the steps that were required to do. There are a few rare gems that break this mold, like the level "BalanceMix" in "ConstructConfuse". Unfortunately, after much playing, they seem few and far between.\n\nFor this reason, Tricone Lab feels more like a sudoku book or daily crossword puzzle, which is fine. If you are the kind of person that enjoys these kinds of puzzles (and I know there are many who do, which is great!), then I highly recommend Tricone Lab. For me however, the experience of playing the game comes across as mundane and I wouldn't say I got $10 worth out of the game.

Honestly, it made things worse for me. Notes as I go:\n\n1. Alt+Tab crashes my game 70% of the time which is horribly annoying.\n2. There is a glitch that occurs ~20% of the time when you try to connect a breaker to a wall, but it doesn't connect, yet you lose the orbit or ability to break causing you to have to reset.\n3. While the developer claims its not brute force, I have yet to see otherwise - but I have only played to the tune of 2.5 hours. My 2cents is to show this earlier in the games progression.\n\nYou have to keep in mind that even Zachtronics, who has a rich history of designing brilliant highly successful puzzlers, doesn't even command this price for a majority of his games (both TIS-100 and Spacechem are cheaper - Infinifactory is more expensive). Price weighs in alot here!\n\nOriginal review below:\n\n---\nThank you to the developer for very generously supplying me with a review key.\n---\n\nTricone Lab is a coffee break logic puzzler in the same vein as Hex/Squarecells and Lyne, among many others. Each level is fairly short, requiring about 5-10 minutes to complete on average.\n\nEssentially, the game plays out as a series of 'locks' and 'keys'. You build keys, which are some sort of 'molecule', to open locks which are supposed to be opening cellular compartments. Don't get me started on the biology of it - it makes no sense. These look nothing like organisms, and the locks and keys aren't comparable to anything in reality, either. Anyways, this is neither here-nor-there. The mechanic boils down to strategically opening cellular walls in the right order to construct or 'complete' molecules to complete the level.\n\nPros:\n+Intuitive interface, requiring only a mouse but having keyboard shortcuts.\n+Nice launcher with lots of options.\n+Gameplay is fairly fresh, albeit simple (or one-dimensional may be a better descriptor).\n+The music is quite appropriate.\n+User created content certainly adds life and hours to the game.\n\nCons:\n-Overall, the mechanic is too simple, and not addictive enough. You can brute force puzzles quite easily (although I only played a bit over an hour - thats all I needed to decide I don't recommend). I had to force myself to play that much. Its not terrible, just not addictive enough to compete with others in this genre.\n-$11.99 is wayyy too steep for this game, at this stage. It also says the price may increase after release.  - developer has commented, correcting this.\n-Why all the grayscale? I like it, but variety might be nice.\n-The 'meta' maps that open new levels are fairly pointless. They should have more of a function. Otherwise just list the levels in the order you want people to play them.\n\nThis game is Early Access right now. I will certainly be back to re-evaluate after the full version is released. Its not a bad game by a long-shot. In fact the developers should be proud of this creation; it feels fairly polished and definately brings something new to the genre. The million dollar question: Would I recommend to my Steam friends: Nope. Not at this price and at this stage in the game.\n\nPeace,","March 11","false","2.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","6","14","2","5"

I had fun with the game but it is not going to be for everyone.\n\nAt first I found the game to be kind of boring. As I continued playing the game and new mechanics were added, the game really started picking up. While I have only played the game for around three hours and have only completed some of the game, the game really started to grow on me. The puzzles are really well designed and really make you think outside the box.\n\nDifficulty wise I would say that the game is moderately difficult with a couple of the puzzles being pretty challenging that require you to really think outside the box in order to solve them.\n\nProbably the game's greatest weakness at this point is the visuals/presentation. Graphics don't really matter that much in puzzle games but I think the graphics and presentation could use a little polish.\n\nThe true longevity of the game will come down to the community. If the game creates a strong community that makes a lot of levels the game could flourish. If not I am guessing you could get around seven to ten hours out of the puzzles included with the game.\n\nIf you don't like abstract puzzle games, Tricone Lab will probably not be for you. If you like puzzle games though and after watching the trailer you think the game looks interesting I think you will enjoy the game.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review	[www.geekyhobbies.com]","November 12, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShanSanear/recommended/392610/","ShanSanear","Shan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShanSanear/","529 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKey for this game was provided by author\nBear in mind - its still early access, everything can change... blah blah blah, you know this, right? So lets get started.\n\nVery unusual 2D puzzle game with specific mechanics and graphics style - that's the shortest I could describe it.\n\nMain goal of every level is to create set number of tricones - symbol made out of three cones, thats also the icon of the game. At first its not that hard - directly connect every cone to another specific symbol - connector, double click it and its done. Thanks to nicely done small tutorial its easy to get how exactly game works.\n\nAfter that obstacles are appearing - walls that you need to break, anti-connectors that "steals" specific symbols that you sometimes need, areas that will "disconnect" your more complicated symbols into their parts, creating walls... and even more. Variety is already quite high.\n\nEvery level takes from mere seconds (click here and drop there and you are done) to even few minutes if you can't find solution. Because of that, it may become a bit frustrating later on, but thats something specific to the genre itself I think.\n\nAbout graphics - dont know why but it reminded me a bit about World of Goo, probably because in it everything was constantly moving - just like here but certainly not in a way game looks. Its... lets say minimalistic in a sense. Levels looks like some kind of multicellular which is nice idea to handle game mechanics. What appeared strange to me was the way blindcolored mode was implemented - everything appear to look the same... besides cones themselves - instead of red/green/blue there is gray/white/black cone. Well, thats one way to deal with it but in general game looks slightly dull because of lack of any kind of colours besides mentioned earlier cones. Of course thanks to that games work on every toaster you can imagine which is nice.\n\nMusic is quite nice but what "hit me" the most was complete lack of it during solving puzzles. It is in menu, during level selection but not while playing core game which is quite strange.\n\nWhats big advantage of this game over quite a lot of others puzzle games is complete level creator - from creating cells to putting symbols - its exactly what I would think author was using creating every puzzle.\n\nAnd when I am at it, levels themselves are all done nicely and all but at least for now I didn't encounter something I did in for example The Talos Principle - that there is part/element unused/left after solving puzzle. Or multiple ways of solving it. No mindgames with player makes it slightly less interesting than it could be but thanks to level creator it can be solved by players themselves.\n\nPlayer statistics are something I liked the most in Zachtronics games (Spacechem, TIS-100) is also implemented here, but to a bit smaller extend - it takes into account average solving time, number of retries and how many people tried/solved it but not much more. I would say its understandable due to how the game works - when you already played specific level once you could solve it again in almost no time, "beating" your previous "try". At least in games mentioned earlier (Spacechem in particular) I had incentive to beat every level over and over to see how I could beat it faster etc; thats not the case here sadly.\n\nTo sum up: I like this game... but probably wouldn't pay full price for it. Yes it has quite a lot of content, but its finite in a sense you don't have incentive to get back to it by yourself. Level creator helps with that tho, letting you create your own puzzles or get somebody's map/levels to play.","February 6","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
