But the five chapters (about 25 mini-games) can be completed in 2 hours. And even if you can continue to play after the end to unlock all clothes, it's still short for the price. So get it in discount if you want to play it.","February 19, 2015","true","2.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","6","13","5","1"
