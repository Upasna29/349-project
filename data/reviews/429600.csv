And sorry to say, this game is nowhere near to be the lovely Artifex Mundi magic, which made me a die-hard fan.\nI  might finish this, because I bought it. And to get some achievements. And because it is ok in a so-so way .\nWould I have fallen in love with Hidden Object games, if this was my first game in that genre ? Nope. I would probably have kept away forever.\nBecause it is boring. Story is boring, and there is nothing new. Too many hidden object scenes, which do not fit in, do not make sense, and same old - same old.\nI am supposed to save a bunch of children from the evil puppet-master, but the story is so bad, I am unable to even care.  Scary scenes ? Nah. None. Need to know what happens next ? No.\nSo why play through ?\nI am a die-hard fan, - that`s probably why.\nAnd mentioning that :\n\n- Artifex Mundi IS making a lovely new game - mainly Grim Legends 3, The Dark City.\nI was lucky to play the Beta, and I can tell you all :\nDon`t waste your money on The Puppet Thief, - Buy Grim Legend 1, 2\n- and wait for 3 ; Those games are brilliant, and makes you fall in love :)))\n\nAnd please, Artifex Mundi - make some new interesting achievements to reach - add the parabels and hidden stuff to find, and make your games look new ?\nAnd do not take away the colors, like you did in The Puppet Thief  :(","April 12","false","2.9"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","50","54","0","9"

Indeed, publishers changed: it is now in Artifex Mundi's catalogue and I can understand why as they have the sequel already in it. Anyway, apart adding trading cards and taking time to put achievements, I didn't see any difference between the previous and this game. Anyway, I don't care having paid for this one. A -40% is a nice discount and the game at full price is less expensive than previously.\n\nAllow me so to take my previous review and to put it here.\n\nFor your first investigation, you have to solve the mystery of several children's disappearances in Charmeville. But what to do when you realize that your main suspect isn't maybe as malevolent as you thought?\n\nI should have began by this game first before playing the sequel. The gameplay is the standard one (hidden objects scenes, puzzles, items to find) but at least, it's easy to find the items needed, even in the hidden objects scenes, compared to the sequel. Anyway, or I was blind in the previous release, or it was added because I found finally a map, which is easier to go through scenes.\n\nThe graphics are correct, I love the fact that it's set during one night and that you're visiting locations like a crypt, graveyard, sewers, etc.. I love mainly when Artifex Mundi publish games that are supposed to be dark and creepy. It's better when they're writing and developing games but well this one is good enough. Besides, cutscenes are perhaps not animated but the people speaking are. Voice acting is also good.\n\nGiven the price tag, I would say that now, you can go ahead. Even if you already own the previous game, it's still a good bargain. Anyway, I don't know if owners will get a copy. It's the same game, without improvement, apart for cards and achievements. It's just a change of publishers. True, games that were re-released were or given for free for owners or with a very interesting discount (Sleeping Dogs, Zombie Army Trilogy, Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey are fine examples of that). But I didn't mind buying it again. I've quite a soft spot for Artifex Mundi.\n\nAnyway, free copy or not, the game is still worthy for any newcomer.","January 8","true","3.2"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","34","39","0","0"

The graphic could be better but has its charme and searching screens are most time many objects. The sound is good. The hidden object games are sometimes a bit tough if you want do it without help, some items are really good hidden. Puzzles are normal standard but some like the bonus chapter are really a bit tricky. The game length could be longer. Get this game with 50-70 % discount.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/429600/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","The famous Grimm Brothers who wrote many of the fairy tales we still love today help bring to life this delightful hidden object game. Fairy Tale Mysteries: The Puppet Thief is the story of your character’s first investigation while working with the Grimm Brothers who -in the interest of a fun story- have magical powers. It’s your job to save the children from an evil puppeteer with your wit and cunning.\n\nThe story itself is very straightforward. A bad guy takes the souls of children and it’s your job to save the day. Though the Grimm Brothers are magic users, you are not, as you don’t use any magic in the game. Instead you use detective skills to get stop the evil curse. There aren’t many twists and turns in the plot, what you see is what you get.  I found the story in the bonus chapter a little confusing and somewhat pointless.\n\nThe Puppet Thief plays like your standard hidden object game. There are plenty of scenes to work with, some you even go to twice. The artwork in the scenes, as well as the entire game, is lovely. Items are easy enough to see which I appreciate with my less than stellar vision. In fact, they were a little too easy. This game is not hard at all. The hidden object scenes and mini games don’t offer much of a challenge to veterans of this genre. I found maybe two of the mini games annoying but that was my personal preference -you may love that style. None of the puzzles were frustrating at all, the game was very easy but also relaxing.\n\nHowever, this also means the game is short. I beat it under two hours, bonus chapter included. All of the achievements are easy to collect and there are also card drops. This game is perfect for children or people new to hidden object games, it’s also great if you don’t want to play anything stressful. It is a bit too easy and short but still a pleasant experience and it leads right into Fairy Tale Mysteries 2: The Beanstalk, which I also recommend playing. Lovely series so far, I hope there will be more!\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","January 18","true","2.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I was excited to play another hidden object game published by Artifex Mundi.  The story had a great premise and built well on the scare factor.  I enjoyed the flow of discovery and unfolding of the story through the use of the letters from the Brother’s Grimm.  The graphics were less dramatic than previous works and I found at times during the hidden object scenes that a couple of items I found quite difficult to make out at all.  There seemed to be a grainy quality to the scenes that at times hindered discovery.  I found myself using the hint option more than I have previously and the skip came into play quite a few times when it came to the mini games, which disappointed me.  The Puppeteer character was well thought out and used to great effect and the Brother’s Grimm was  fantastic addition.\n\nI feel this game almost feels like an initial phase of a franchise and with the sequel already being available on the Steam platform goes someway to proving that.  I believe that there are so many aspects that could have been built on further.  For instance how did you become connected to the Brothers Grimm?  How did the Puppeteer become evil?  Where were the children’s souls held?  What happened to the angry mob? What is the story of the wizard with the crystals?  I found it handy to check your journal for progress and hints when I couldn’t figure out my next move.  I enjoyed this game and was proud to have completed it I just feel it could be built on to be better.\n\nI would recommend Fairy Tale Mysteries: The Puppet Thief to casual gamers who want to spend a couple of hours playing through a hidden object game with minigames and a connective story.\n\nFor reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 18","true","11.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It has a bit less of the later bells and whistles, but the art is beautiful, the minigames interesting, and the voice acting is excellent. It's all very linear path, as expected of a casual point-and-click / hidden object game. I liked the creepy Puppet Master villain and the reveal that one of the scary puppets is an ally.

I am looking forward to them and buy them as a treat. They have so a high standard for games both on the story side as well as the minigames and how both is put together.\n\nRegrettably this game falls below their standards. The story as such has a lot of potential. But it remains shallow. While one normally is told some backgrounds and often enough there are some twists in the story, both is missing in this game. Anything that happens is more or less happening to you, even as it is meant to be, it does not feel as if anything is really happening because of what one did.\n\nAnd while there are some good mini-games they are seldom integrated well in the scenary. And the farther you go the longer the sequences of just repeating missing object mingames. Which would be ok, if they would not just pop up anywhere you look. If there would be something else to discover.\n\nYes, there are some good ideas for rooms or scenery. But while I liked some of them I never had any idea why I would go there in the first place and why anybody would buils anything like this.\n\nIt is really hard to vote on this. Because, would it not be an Artifex Mundi game I would say: Well good try for a game, not Artifex Mundi, but good approach. Try it to support the effort people have put into this.\n\nBut it IS labeld as Artifex Mundi. And they have proven multiple times that they know how to do it much better then this.\n\nAs there are so much better games there to play from Artifex Mundi, I would advise to buy one of those others. You will love those others. But if you have already played one of those excellent games you would regret to have buyed this game at full price.\n\nTry it if you have either played none or all other Artifex Mundi games and you get it on discount. But do not buy it if you are addicted to their games and have other options.","February 15","false","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I received a roughly a hundred of these for about three fifty from one of those ever present online bundles, and it seemed like a good time to try the genre out as I have someone missed out on them up to this point. And while I might not know much about hidden object games, I can still tell that Fairy Tale Mysteries: The Puppet Thief isn't a very good one.\n\nThis is a hidden object game, so it makes sense that the core gameplay feature is hidden object scenes. Between the main game and extra quest, there are over thirty of these scenes in total. The game will present you with a cluttered collection of objects, which tells you both that it's time to find some stuff and that the game may have a pretty serious hoarding problem. Each scene gives you nine different things to find (with some objects appearing more than once in the scene) and you need to scour the scene to find them, or give up and use some of the copious hints the game gives you if you really like hidden object games but hate hidden objects for some reason.\n\nThe scenes themselves are fine. Thirty in total is a decent amount (especially in comparison to the paultry amount offered in the sequel to this game), but it feels like another ten to twenty were needed for the price they're charging. The scenes themselves are fairly bland and while the objects themselves are fairly well hidden, the overall scenes are simply uninteresting. Furthermore, the game doesn't really integrate these into the gameplay very well, and they just sort of pop up every once in a while when the game gets bored. They also reuse the same scene frequently, and after you clear a scene the first time, about half of the time you need to come back later in the game to do the very same scene with some new objects to find. Not only does this just seem lazy, it requires pointless backtracking and if you ever get stuck, the solution usually is to poke around all your old hidden object scenes and find out which on is open for business again.\n\nBeyond the hidden objects, the rest of the game is flat out bad. There are a handful of logic puzzles, but there isn't a single one that is even mildly clever. The very best can only be described as "mildly annoying" requiring you to rotate things to get them in the right order, while the most are so simple it takes all of ten seconds to figure them out. "Match the colors" or "figure out the simple pattern" isn't a logic puzzle - that's something you do to make sure you're ready to pass the first grade.\n\nAnd the story is just absurdly bad. It has an interesting and spooky premise, with some evil force kidnapping kids and cramming their souls into puppets. How terrifying does that sound? How does this game manage to make that concept so boring? They really deserve a reward for making the terrifying mundane, because this level of botching a story really needs to be recognized for how acceptional it is. It could be that the visuals are laughably bad, but it really is more than that. There is no development, no real world building or anything like that. Sure, this is just a silly little hidden object game, but why put in a story if you aren't going to try and make it entertaining then?\n\nSo the hidden object scenes are only "okay" and everything else is terrible. This may find some appeal if you are an absolute, die hard hidden object game fan, and have already played every other single hidden object game. Beyond that demographic though, this simply isn't worth the price. Maybe if you find it in a bundle. But, hey, I found it in a bundle and wish something else had been bundled with the rest of the games instead. Like a rock or a root canal.","May 20","false","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
