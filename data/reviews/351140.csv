"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000514622/recommended/351140/","76561198000514622","[Mops] TENTACLE BOSS","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000514622/","620 products in account","Pros:\n\n-This game is fun as hell.\n\n-The art style is fitting and in my opinion enjoyable.\n\n-The classes despite some TF2 inspiration are mostly unique in their own right and have very strategic uses.\n\n-There is a unique death system where enemies have to drag your carcass back to their base and throw you into a scrapping machine before you can respawn (and run off) in order to gain points. This makes the mechanics surrounding death and gaining points more interesting than just about any other shooter. (As well as leading to some comical situations.) I wish more games would be inspired by this mechanic.\n\n-There is no mouse use and the shooting functions much more like a classic shooter, which is a nice change and controls well.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. This game has the worst netcode of anything I have ever played. This game should have released in early access because its netcode is beyond broken. 99% of games will lead to nonsensical disconnects in matchmaking and custom games, the 1% of games that do work will generally lead to either everyone jumping around the map due to lag or the enemy team will quit when you are beating them.\n\n-There are no options to party up with your friends in matchmaking. You can only play with friends in custom games which will never work, and you will barely see any listings. The matchmaking is automated trial and error and at least succeeds some of the time. So in short if you do download this, expect to play by yourself.\n\n-There is no chat box anywhere. In lobbies to determine if a host is AFK and promptly yell at him for being the host of the one game you could actually connect to, or in game to co-ordinate strategies with your team.\n\n-You cannot invite people to games in progress. While this in a way is a good thing it means players wont fill places when someone rage quits, or if you enter a rarely functional custom game and someone starts the moment they see another player join the other team then too late! You're stuck playing by yourself without the friends/anyone you planned to play with.\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nExtremely fun when it works with massive potential, but whoever is behind the netcode deserves to be shot. This game was not ready for full release and they have probably killed their long term player base by releasing the game fully with the multiplayer in a multiplayer only game in such a downright unacceptable disgusting state.\n\nIf the developer has the competence to actually fix this I would highly recommend playing the game as it can be brilliant, but so far (10/05/2015) the only developer responses regarding this issue have blankly said "we're working on it" with absolutely no eta on when the issue will be fixed with zero public announcements regarding the issue.\n\n\nTL;DR: Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ed and rarely works, nobody knows if it will ever be fixed, otherwise really fun game, check it out if the multiplayer gets fixed.","May 9, 2015","false","6.0"," 91 of 112 people (81%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","81","91","112","19","6"

You kill another player, he becomes a bucket and you have to carry him to your side to build your robot. But there is a time limit in which you can carry them before they turn back to players, getting longer each time they die. Meanwhile there are regular buckets spawning on the map which can also be taken to build your robot but give less points.\n\nI have just played one of the classes, but have seen most of them in the battlefield. And they all seem to have their own qualities, which seem to fit in nicely and bring out some very tactical plays. You can notice when you play against an experienced team!\n\nGame did crash a couple of times, and matches don't always start right away. But overall it didn't bother me to much. The games where fun to play (except for the ones against pro teams, but o well.. got to swallow that I suppose). And its pretty easy to pick up.\n\nIf you like a tactical game, combined with fast paced shooting, this is definitely worth a try!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CSnvy7KHZ0","May 4, 2015","true","2.1"," 51 of 72 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","51","72","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Ghost_Gamer/recommended/351140/","The_Ghost_Gamer","Ghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Ghost_Gamer/","32 products in account","ONE SENTENCE REVIEW:\n\nRustbucket Rumble is a 2D team based shooter with dated visuals, poor controls, and overall bare-bones gameplay that does not bring anything new to its genre and lacks content when compared to others in its genre.\n\nLONG REVIEW:\n\nRustbucket Rumble feels like an Early Access Game. Don't get me wrong this isn't a rant on Early Access Games (fairly enough some of them are really good...*cough* Don't Starve Together *cough*), but sadly it does feel like one. First off when you start the game you're greeted with a tutorial explaining the mechanics of the game. Now the game has 1 mode, and its basically this: Kill Bots, Grab their Recycled parts before they turn back into bots, so you could make a Big Bot. Sounds fun? Believe me it gets stale really quick. As the two free characters of the week quickly lost its flavour (currently its Clancy and Daisy at the time of this review) as you are completely stuck with them for the rest of the week. Now most you MOBA players might be used to this already as every MOBA I have played it has a weekly character rotation. But here's the thing, with this game, unlike MOBAs which has at least a dozen characters, this game has only 6. And to top it off unlike MOBAs where you can get you're character by grinding for coins, the only way for you to get the characters PERMANENTLY is to PAY the DEBUT BUNDLE which includes all Characters at launch which is roughly 300 PHP (which is around 5-10 USD). Meaning you can only get these characters permanently by paying, if you don't want to pay then you can always win around 10 matches (if I'm not mistaken) to unlock the character... FOR A WEEK. Yep after that week the character "expires" and you have to wait for the game to make them free again. Albeit you can argue that the game is just trying to make you play all the characters, but that just not the case. I found Daisy to O.P. since players just put turrets everywhere and kill you, and Clancy to be your generic dime a dozen soldier. Nothing special about him.\n\nMy second and overall problem with the game are the controls. Since the game does not let you utilize your mouse either from shooting, it feels awkward to shoot with your keyboard (W and S to shoot up and down? Not jump and crouch? that's weird), maybe if you guys use a controller then you might be able to get through the controls. But at the moment of writing this review I DO NOT OWN A CONTROLLER. I play with my keyboard and frankly because of these controls it feels like a Console Port even though this game was created for PC.\n\nSo overall Rustbucket Rumble is a bare bones 2D side scrolling shooter with little redeeming value.\n\nDo I recommend it? NO.","May 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","22","41","3","1"

Interesting way to win- you have to be carried back to the other base, makes spawn killing much less attractive\n2. Free- No need to sink money into it.\n3. Fairly active developers\n\nCons-\n1. Some pretty bad controls. Unlike most 2d platforming shooters, you don't aim with your mouse. You aim wherever your character is pointing. Makes the game very difficult to learn, and even harder to like.\n2. Very little variation- The maps seem very similar, just a few platforms to jump around on. On top of that, all I've seen are the two free to play characters ever played. No one else.\n3. Matchmaking is slow. It takes way to long to find 6 players, and half the time someone leaves and doesn't get punished for it.\n4. Not the best graphics, although I don't actually care that much.\n\ntl;dr\nI personally don't like the controls, and the matchmaking is bad, and there isn't a whole lot of class variation.

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.\n","June 11, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Simply put it doesn't work most of the time. There is a server browser with no servers, you can join a matchmaking queue and watch as it toggles betwen searching for players, players leaving, and connecting to hosts, for a few minutes until you are connected to a match. Then you have to hope that when it was in the selectign host stage that it selected a good host, or you are just going to lag so bad its not even funny. Then you have to hope that the host doesn't leave the game, otherwise your back to watching the queue.\n\nThe few times that I was able to play the game I had a lot of fun. I do play with a controller and I think the game controls very well. The capture the flag to build a giant robot to destroy the enemies goal is really interesting to me, and seemed to work well for this style of game.\n\nThe bottom line, Netcode/multiplayer is bad, and the game only has multiplayer to offer.","May 7, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a free game - it's not exactly too bad, but I feel like it's gameplay is just a bit awkward and there's not much tactical thought into the combat which is the jist of what I get you're supposed to do in this game.\nOne of my biggest gripes is the aiming mechanics. Aiming with the movement buttons is just ridiculous and something I've never liked, sure you can hold shift to aim with it and not move but I feel that takes away from the "skill" factor and it's really just silly. I find most of the time that if people die once or twice, they just leave. This isn't the games fault, but I'm just warning people now if they decide to play - before I'm able to gain anything from winning the match (to unlock characters or whatever), the match would end because there's no more enemies or my whole team left and I lose 1v3.\nI really like the concept of this game, I really do  - maybe it's just my personal gripes that hold me back from playing it. I don't recommend it though, it could be so much better with some small changes.\n\nTL;DR\nGood concept, awkwardly executed. Play at your own risk, it's free - so all you lose is a little time if you don't like it.","May 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/durkcherr/recommended/351140/","durkcherr","DarkTree","http://steamcommunity.com/id/durkcherr/","78 products in account","Allow me to start with the main reasons why I in fact, did not like this game:\n\n- Lag. The trailers look promising, 30+ fps, but in the game, that's downgraded to about... A 15 fps. at best. If you're thinking: "Oh, he uses a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 80's computer" No, no I don't. I have 16 gb of ram and this STILL RUNS at 10-15 fps. I have no idea why.\n\n- Pay 2 win. It's bad enough when a game has barely any balance at all, yet... You put in p2w elements? Maybe not p2w, but still, you're paying for stuff that basically makes you more powerful. Maybe "pay-2-cosmetic" is the thing i'm looking for, but in my eyes, it's "pay-2-variety", as in, you must pay or the game will get boring within 5 minutes.\n\n- Imbalance. It might not be as bad when everyone plays the same class (which they all do, by the way. It's some kind of weird "engineer from tf2" kind of class, but has a grenade launcher that kills sentries in 2 hits, and they can build up to THREE SENTRIES. However, this is semi-balanced by the fact that they can't turn around, and they do barely any damage.)  but when there are 3 engineers, sentries everywhere, drones flying through the sky that you can barely hit because of the stupidly low range of the grenade launcher, and everything just becomes insanity, all while you only have 5-15 fps.\n\n- NO COMMUNICATION WHATSOEVER. For a team-based game, it's terrible. Well, I mean, there ARE "rally here" and "attack" and "Defend" commands, but... Would it REALLY be that hard to put in a simple chat system?\n\n- Leavers. If you join a game, it's likely 1/2 of the team will exit the game by the time the giant robot is done.\n\n\nNow, the good things:\n\n- THIS CONCEPT, OH LAWD. It's very good for just a simple variation on the "multiplayer shooter TDM bangbang" genre. When you kill enemies, they drop scrap. Depending on your character, you carry them different ways. For example, if you're an engineer-type class, you have a drone to pick it up and fly it away. If you're the bland soldier class, you just carry it. Once the drone reaches your spawn/you carry the bucket of scrap to your spawn, there's a big recycling machine. Standing near it heals you, and putting scrap into it starts building a giant robot. Upon collecting however many peices, your giant robot comes along from your spawn and walks in the background until A: finding an enemy, at which point he will bomb it until he dies or the enemy dies, or B: walks straight to the enemy base and starts smacking the enemy recycling machine. Upon the machine exploding, you win. The main problem is that if he sees ANY ENEMY AT ALL, he will chase them down until they die or it dies (again), even when smacking the machine. Since the spawn timer is 6-3 seconds, there's not a lot you can do to help make your robot destroy the machine.\n\nOverall, 4/10, needs work.","May 9, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","1"

My YouTube subscribers want something other than Minecraft, and so do I. My friend's playing Don't Starve Together, and I want to play Team Fortress 2 with him. He says no, TF2 is getting boring, so naturally I find an alternative.\n\nWhat is it?Rustbucket Rumble is basically two-dimension Team Fortress 2. It is set in a world where humans have left to go murder another planet, and Robots (and possibly trees) Rule the land. Apparently, Earth was deemed unsafe to live on (Again, Trees and Eco-Friendly Bins), so Robots were left to slowly take over. The aim of each team is to collect enough scrap (Yay, let's murder our friends) to create a giant robot. Why do they need to make a giant robot? I dunno. What's the aim of the giant robot? Possibly Politics..?\n\nGameplay and VisualsRbR has good visuals, ranging from trees that I've always wanted to design like that to trigger-happy robots. It's sort of cartoonish, which suits the game. I found it a little odd at first because I thought that left-click was the only shooting mechanism, and I couldn't get my head around hitting L to pick up bins, when I could press another closer key. Then I discovered J. Haha, that was a good time.\n\nPerformanceI have a good enough computer, to say the least. I however have a few problems with this game.\nNumber one being that sometimes when playing the left side of my screen turns into a blue tint, with some visuals in that area disappearing entirely. Another thing is the server connection. When I go to join a server, occasionally it won't allow me to connect. And then I have to restart the game, because the game won't let me connect ever again during that play session. I get lots of server-wise lag when hitting Play Now, but when I play on a custom server most things go without a two-second delay.\n\nOverallTo conclude, RbR is a good enough game when looking for something small, fun and free when playing with friends. I can see how it can develop further, and I am going to follow it for a little while. Though laggy and sometimes a bit weird, at least I know how the controls actually work, how to shoot, and how to laugh at my friend while he's being helicoptered to my recycling plant.\n\nMy RatingI give this a 7/10","May 9, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers have combined mechanical elements from games like the Smash Bros series and arcadey 2-D shooters, and polished it off with a nice clean graphical style, akin to something like Team Fortress. In a first play through, the game may seem a bit simple, but the joy of the game really comes in the way the various classes can be utilized for great teamwork. In particular, I feel like there is no better feeling than chain passing the scrap of an enemy back to your base JUST before the player can respawn. Snag the scrap with the sniper's claw, toss the scrap farther along with the big spikey guy, and then dash the scrap into the base just before it respawns with the ninja character. Feels good! There's actually a fair amount of strategy and complexity there for the players that are willing to dig in and discover the nuances of the classes, and how they can interact in the game.\n\nSome reviewers have talked about connectivity issues, but I haven't had any problems at all. Played plenty of games.\n\nI think there's some polish that the game could afford in the future, but it's absolutely worth playing right this second.

This one deserves a postive review in my opinion.\n\nShort version:\n\nStandard but fun side shooter, with a brilliant concept that makes this game great! Classes actually feel balanced so far in my opinion (this coming from a player that played the so-called weak rifle character). Controls feel nice, and the no-mouse aiming actually feels like a nice change of pace from many other games.\n\nLong version:\n\nPeople claim this is a rip off TF2. Because it has classes like many games? Because of the capture objective like many other games? Not sure. What I can say, is that capturing your defeated opponents, ending in what is essentially a fun boss battle, is a unique and creative concept that deserves attention.\n\nClasses feel balanced so far, and the game feels highly skill based. Little luck or class choice involved.\n\nI have thus far not encountered the connection issues others have ran into. However, even if I did, I am keeping in mind that this game was just released. Server issues on release seem to be relatively common, even on big-name games.\n\nI'll refrain from commenting too much on the character availability issue at this time, as my experience there is limited as of the time of this writing. What I can say, is that I don't mind a rotation system as long as the classes are balanced and fun, which they so far seem to be.\n\nOne of the best parts? It's free. Can't go wrong with free. If you like Contra-style side shooters, then perhaps you should give this game a go, and perhaps you'll find this to be a hidden gem.\n\nThank you for your time. I hope this review has helped. =)","May 5, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I dont know how to address this game. It sucks on so many levels. It could be decent IF THE CONTROLS AND CONCEPT WORKED!  Let me explain how you win. After you shoot someone who knows how many times, they somehow fold into a nice little crate of scrap for you to pick up and carry back to the machine-thing. Sounds easy right? Wrong. As a scrap heap, there is a timer that flies like nobodys buisness and once said timer deminishes, the scap becomes robot again. This means you have to sorta "taze" your enemy RIGHT IN FRONT of your machine. Or make them jump into it, whatever floats your boat. Some robots are nearly impossible to kill with one class of robot. Others make you want to catch the plague because of how easy they are to die as. A friend and i played this game together and let me tell you readers this, it was not fun. Funny maybe but not entertaining. We just ran around killing each other and trying our hardest to get the heaps into the grinder.

The amount of time it takes to find a match is about 10 minutes, which is ridiculous. And then, because I have an O.k. computer, I lag out. I have not managed to find a game yet where my computer could last the whole round.\nFor the controls, let me compare this game to a little-known game called Raze. Raze is a 2-D shooter made by armor games that uses a simple mouse-guided aiming system, a wasd moving scheme, and the fact that accuracy changes whether you are crouching, jumping, or standing. Your simple, standard controls that does not feel the game feeling, for lack of a better word, clunky. For Rustbucket Rumble, it takes like 5 seconds to do anything, so the best strat is to just aim ahead. This leads to some hard-to-hit locations.\nOn the plus side, the idea is fantastic! Even if something is strong, It takes like 5 lives before you lose anthing. And teaming up onto people is the best strategy, which isn't always the case in little games like this.\n\nOverall, just fix the controls so the aim buttons are seperate from the move buttons (a.k.a wasd for moving and the arrows for aiming) and fix the connection.

I dont know how to address this game. It sucks on so many levels. It could be decent IF THE CONTROLS AND CONCEPT WORKED!  Let me explain how you win. After you shoot someone who knows how many times, they somehow fold into a nice little crate of scrap for you to pick up and carry back to the machine-thing. Sounds easy right? Wrong. As a scrap heap, there is a timer that flies like nobodys buisness and once said timer deminishes, the scap becomes robot again. This means you have to sorta "taze" your enemy RIGHT IN FRONT of your machine. Or make them jump into it, whatever floats your boat. Some robots are nearly impossible to kill with one class of robot. Others make you want to catch the plague because of how easy they are to die as. A friend and i played this game together and let me tell you readers this, it was not fun.

First, note that the devs are trying to get people to join so the community is small but if people keep playing and telling others maybe the community will grow :D\nYou only get 2 robots to start off with and they change every week. The rest you can buy in a pack.\nIn the game your goal is to build a giant robot using enemy player's scraps or scraps that spawn around the map. When you die you turn into scrap. Your health slowly regens but while in this scrap form the other team will try and take you to their factory which will go to building the robot. It gets really hectic with 3v3 and even 2v2.\nPros\nFun game\nNeat mechanics\nSimple idea\n\nCons\nSmall community\nhard to find a game\n\nIf you wish to see my first time playing check this out!\nI'm in at the 45 min mark\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDJGubEzIj8","July 31, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
