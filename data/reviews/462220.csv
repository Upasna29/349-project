"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/462220/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Mahjong Deluxe 3 is a challenge of memory, attention to detail and the ability to differentiate depth perception.  I initially played the basic easy puzzles and found that Iâ€™m not quite as quick as required to be a three star winner.  I decided to take on the challenging puzzles and this is when the game took on a different light.  I appreciate a challenge and found these puzzles required time and patience.  My favorite thing with the challenging puzzles occurred when you reached a point of stalemate.  The game shimmers and rearranges the tiles to allow you to find the remaining matching pairs.  This is a great addition and allows for continued game play and limits frustration. The graphics for the tiles are intricate, bright and eye catching, the backgrounds  lend atmosphere to the game play and take you on a journey.  I quite enjoyed the small cute noises made when each tile is selected and the joyous noises made when a selection was correct.  These also differed depending on the genre of tile which is a sweet little touch.  I would recommend this game when you want to activate and challenge your mind and memory potential.","May 2","true","1.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The puzzles themselves are done with the mouse, and you can work through level selection using only the mouse, but as far as I can tell both neither pausing during a puzzle nor exiting the game from the main menu can be done using the mouse and instead require the ESC key. This isn't impossible for people to figure out, but especially for a game like this with a large casual audience it could stand to be more straightforward by adding clickable buttons for pausing and exiting.\n\n-Secondly there's the timer, or rather the focus on score. Having this is fine, but I feel like there should at least be an option to hide the timer. Having it constantly counting down and flickering in the corner is really distracting, and a lot of people playing this game aren't going to care about getting 3 stars or any stars on a given stage. I feel like there should either be a setting to disable/hide the timer, or else a separate mode where the same puzzles are available but score isn't kept at all.\n\n-Thirdly, I had a weird experience in one level that went completely unexplained by the game. In world 1 level 80 I was approaching the end of the puzzle when suddenly the puzzle disappeared and was replaced by two columns of 4-5 tiles each (they were the same number, but I don't remember which one). I matched these tiles and then the puzzles ended. I've never seen this happen in Mahjong before, and the tutorial didn't say anything about it. If this is intentional behavior then it should probably be explained in the tutorial to stop people from being caught by surprise, and if it's unintentional then it should be fixed.\n\nFinally, the 3D mahjong controls. I think the 3D puzzles are actually super neat, I've never seen them in any other game. Unfortunately the controls are a problem. The tutorial says to click and drag the mouse to rotate the puzzle, and I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the puzzle to follow the mouse movement. Instead, clicking and dragging just sets a direction and a speed, such that if you stop dragging the puzzle will just keep spinning wildly until you release the mouse button. This feels counterintuitive to me, and makes it rather difficult to preform precise rotations.\n\nIf these issues were fixed it would be a decent game that I could recommend people to buy. Until then, I would rather suggest people avoid it.","June 3","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has very calming music which doesn't distract, decent graphics as well as effects and enough stages to choose from.","April 24","true","0.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
