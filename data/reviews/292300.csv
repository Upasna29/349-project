I remembered the Spy Fox games being a bit more fun and I remembered being able to walk around rather then just flying around shooting at robots. Its not that fun, but if you don't mind just sitting there doing just that and ever level being pretty much the same then, this maybe the game you want but I thought it would be a bit more then just that but I guess I was wrong! there's money that I can't get back from this.","December 21, 2014","false","22.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

The plot is about a mustard company CEO named King Konglomo(yes he is a parody to King Kong) who is fed up that cosumers are preferring ketchup over mustard. So he crafts a crazy plan to rid of the world's supply of tomatoes so that way consumers will have no choice but to choose mustard for their burgers, hot dogs, pretzels, etc. Word of the scheme is notified to Spy Fox who is aided by Quack & Monkeypenny to stop King Konglomo's insane plan. By piloting a hoverpod called the M.E.S.S., Spy Fox must go on a global quest to destroy all of King Konglomo's robot probes that are stealing all of the tomatoes. Like the Cheese Chase game, it's an arcade style game except instead of it being a rail shooter it's a free roaming style game. In each level you control the M.E.S.S. and must destroy as many robot probes as possible in order to proceed to the next level. Most levels are challenging when the number of robot probes becomes overwhelming. While certain levels are easy when the objective is not to destroy the robots but instead destroy a control center that is controlling them. There are various power up items that can help you out for a limited time. If you played the Cheese Chase game, then you'll know what to expect with this game. The game play is very fun, and highly recommended for anyone who likes Spy fox or the Humongous games in general.","April 10","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What was going on in HE's heads when they made this game. I cant bear to play it which really bums me out.\n\n\nThe controls are nice but the ship you ride in is slower than a turtle.\nYou basically try to get to the end continously filling up your fuel from these humongous nearly missable Spy Corp fuel tanks.\nThis game is a Mess. I should have figured it out after the main vehicle you drive in was called the M.E.S.S.\nThe story is just wierd.\nThis gorrila doesn't like that everyone uses Ketchup so he sends out some Robot Monkeys to crush all the tomatos. Why you ask. So everyone buys Mustard. Fantastic Plan.\nIt's them trying to make another Cheese Chase and then utterly failing at every single aspect. If you are buying this with all the other games in the Spy Fox pack it's technically not a ripoff. But if you attempt to purchase this on your own you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nWhile Cheese Chase, was fun and the gameplay was variable. Hold The Mustard just throws some basic bull ♥♥♥♥ out for you to take in. This game is not worth it.\n\nAll other Spy Fox games are fantastic, this one is ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThere is not even a Quit Button!\n\nYou have to Ctrl+Alt+Delete and then use Task Manager to shut the ♥♥♥♥♥ down.\n\nDon't buy this game on it's own. WIth the pack. Yeah Alright. But never touch this game on its own. And if you just heard of The Spy Fox series start with the triology first please and then move onto Cheese Chase. Then see if this abomdniation tickles your fancy. Which I assure you it most likely will not.","February 6","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
