Maybe it has bugs, maybe it's not the best game, but do you have any idea how old this game is? All the missions are the same? Oh yeah well It's not like they had the best programming capabilities back in the day this was created. You can judge a game how you want, it's really up to you. But it's not fair to judge a game on modern standards. Even so, this game is important to play if you either A. care at all about the storyline of the series or B. Which should apply to a lot of us, but to see how far things have come. I don't see a bad game, I see a masterpiece of it's era. An era of innovation and a growing game industry. Maybe it's a clone of games like Dune 2000 and C&C but who cares. It's fun for me and I love the storyline of this series. A ripoff of Dune/C&C is just like all the COD ripoffs we see today, you find a market and appeal to it. The market dies and you move on. Business 101. Addressing the bugs, there are plenty of problems in the original C&C and you don't hear me complaining. Now why would that be? It's an old game and I expect it to happen.\n\nEdit: I mean yeah, it really sucks they broke the A.I. and yes it would be nice if they fixed it. I still can't change my stance on the grounds of a non-existent A.I. it's still a nice game with an enjoyable story. I always wondered what the previous game was like while playing 2150 and even if we can't enjoy the game as a game we can enjoy it as a glimpse into the lore and as a unique experience.","March 16, 2015","true","3.1"," 84 of 102 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","84","102","7","4"

It's an all round awesome RTS (for it's time). Great graphics, sound, lengthy and thrilling campaign, awesome units (laser tanks FTW!), interesting story and setting. It's a pity that the sequels got progressively worse. The last iteration of the series (2160) was a complete disaster and the 2150 was just meh.","November 15, 2013","true","2.3"," 67 of 84 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","67","84","3","4"

It was pretty much my favourite RTS of all at the time! Went straight from Dune 2 to Earth 2140 to Dawn Of War!\n\nY'know, a decade and a half ago.\n\nSuffice to say, it's aged a bit. It really doesn't have all the standard features RTSes have. Heck, you move with the left mouse button. So yeah, don't expect it to still hold up to games today.\n\n\nAlso, the AI seems to be really bugged in non-DOS versions.

"Unplayable and boring" is a harsh but accurate description that's frequent on the Steam forums.\n\nThe original game is an underrated and magnificent game with great unit variability and faction balance. The missions were definitely challenging, even for seasoned players, and the adaptive AI really kept a player on their toes. The combat mechanics, friendly AI "Generals", resource/production nuances, and other features were well polished and supported a variety of strategic play styles.\nThe HD version includes two Mission Packs, each with a selection of well-made missions and short campaigns, but without an AI for your opponents or friendly generals the missions just become a slog of whittling down the auto-produced horde milling about the enemy base.\nMy recommendation is to go buy an old CD and install it on a machine that will run it instead of buying the Steam/HD version; This was a great game, and it needs to be played in a version that will do it justice.","May 30, 2015","false","37.4"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","25","26","5","1"

So naturally I started with Earth 2140 with some decent expectations. Got the entire series for a around 3$. Figured they are very old games and the price cant go any lower than that.\n\nI was excited to see that 2140 has an HD version,but was quickly disappointed to see that HD means that it can be played on newer machines and some new resolutions are supported.\n\nFrom the intro of the game I saw that something was off. There was a product placement for a popular beverage in the somewhat distant post apocalyptic future and a display of different type of robots and machines that was suppose to set up the story. I did not make anything out story wise from that.\n\nOnto the main screen was excited to see the way it was created, like you as a character shifted your vision from left to right and was a bit riddled about the games factions (which are two , your typical Europe vs America factions). Nothing too bad about that. Was thrilled to see that there are two mission packs included as well. Hey ,more content,that is always nice.\n\nWas very excited to see a database of all buildings ,vehicles and soldiers in the main menu. After browsing through them, everything was looking pretty good.\n\nUntil I actually started playing the game. I can understand that this is an old strategy game that may have been a pioneer at its age,but hey, so was Starcraft or Red Alert. This game disappointed in almost every expect imagineable to me.\n\nLet’s start with the story, which by the way I had to research it to get an understanding on what the hell is going on. Basically some big war went on and most of the most continents except Europe and America are wiped out and now these two factions fight for the remainder of Earth’s resources by destroying everything in their path. Not THAT bad, really hoped that the story would develop somehow, but it didn’t.\n\nEvery mission starts with a radar like briefing with a terrain background that has really hard to read text that makes you want to skip the briefing alltogether. Even when you read it , every mission is bascially destroy the enemy base or capture some random buildings. The variety is almost non-existent.\n\nPressing on to the cutscenes,that I really hoped to bring some plot into the game. Nope, did not happen. Every cutscene in the game is basically pointless. It just shows some random units atacking each other or patroling some buildings. No story info whatsoever.\n\nProgression wise (I played as Europe) you basically just have to retake some huge chunks of Europe and North Africa Back and then go conquer America. Again this is not that bad (most strategy games have this) but this time it is so poorly executed and implemented that it makes not care at all what happens in this game.\n\nGoing towards graphics,well nothing to complain, the usual 2D sprites that were specific for that time.Good enough. But damn, there are like only 2 animations for fighting in the entire game (that I have recognized), one of wich ( the rocket with the smoke trail) beeing so overly used and annoying to see to some extreme repetition.\n\nYou jump into the game mission and you are left to figure everything out by yourself. There are no tutorials (which is kind of ok, this beeing specific for that time when the game was launched). That would have been a good idea, IF the menu that is a C&C/Dune type of menu was not so completely counter intuitive and lacked actual ease of use.It took me several minutes to just figure out how to get resources in this game, which could have been exciting, but to me personally it was a disaster.\nWhen you do manage to set up your resource gathering buildings and your production buildings, you just spam random infantry and tanks, in masses, and you go roflstomp the enemies.\n\nOh and speaking about enemy AI. With the HD version, they somehow managed to break it. Enemies rarely attack your base and aparently don’t produce units of their own at all. This can only result in zero lack of interest in replayability or sense of beeing challenged or beeing a strategy game, SOME STRATEGY. You just build up some random piles of units and go kamikaze with them until the mission is accomplished.\n\nThe units design is kind of interesting,especially for that time. On the other side the unit voiceovers are basically the same for ALL units,which makes everything utterly annoying to click,really fast. Also unit wise,the pathing system and the way each unit atacks or finds the enemy is completely rubbish and painful to watch. The unit selection is clunky and feels un easy as well. The selection method gives you almost no info about what type of units you have (It just briefly shows the name of a unit and immediately disappears).\n\nWhile searching through the menu tabs, I found everything to be placed so badly . Buildings menu is a mess. Units selection menu (yes you have to click a different tab to see unit selection menu), feels useless. Unit behiavour menu set some interest,but considering the overall gameplay,it completely failed to me as well.\n\nOn to the next part, which is ,yes , music. The music is decent,but NOT for a damn strategygame. Each track feels so randomly generated that it feels like it doesn’t have anything to do with the gameplay. On some occasions I noticed some type of music that you would normally find in soft porn or lounge bars. Good music,really bad implemented for this type of game.\n\nUltimately I really wanted to like Earth 2140, but it just could not happen. It tries to do several things but accomplishes almost nothing and you are better off with a C&C/Dune/Starcraft like experience when it comes to RTS. This game fell so far behind the back that it really doesn’t deserves such a lengthy review.\n\n4/10. Not Recommended. Don’t bother with this one if you cherish your free time!","September 2, 2014","false","13.8"," 69 of 101 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","69","101","3","7"

Unfortunately the user interface and controls leave something to be desired, resulting in a bit of confusion when you are trying to build and manage your base and units.\n\nBut the weakest link in the chain is the behaviour of the A.I., and its urge to accumulate as much units as possible around the base, leaving you with the challenging agenda to confront and destroy a massive defense. Especially in the first levels this kind of tactical approach can be frustrating.\n\nNevertheless it remains a classic RTS experience with an interesting unit design and combat system.\n\nAchievements:\n\nThe game has no Steam achievements.\n\nChronology:\n\nEarth 2160 (PC)\nReal-time strategy game\n(Science-Fiction) – 2005\nLink to Steam review for Earth 2160.\n\nEarth 2150: Lost Souls (PC)\nReal-time strategy game\n(Science-Fiction) – 2002\n\nEarth 2150: The Moon Project (PC)\nReal-time strategy game\n(Science-Fiction) – 2000\n\nEarth 2150 (PC)\nReal-time strategy game\n(Science-Fiction) – 1999\nLink to Steam review for Earth 2150.\n\nEarth 2140 (PC)\nReal-time strategy game\n(Science-Fiction) – 1997","January 6, 2014","true","27.9"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","29","42","0","0"

Building a base is simple enough, find a patch to lay the transport down on to convert it into a building. And that is fine unless your base is getting attacked and for the most part, that happens constantly and it gets even worse by the end making the base building just an absolute chore. To get resources,you must mine which again sounds fine but it is annoying when you do not know where to mine because the game never tells you so you have to get the mine to search around that could actually expose itself to the enemy and it is done for then because the transports move slower than a snail.\n\nAt least in good RTS games, it actually indicates where you can mine rather than guess so that is poor usability for the player there. Another thing as well is the processing of building an army as it can take up to 1 hours alone to build a huge one and even then, it can get decimated instantly by the enemy but when your army tries that, it barely damages them meaning that your army is as weak as a child and the enemy has as much armour as the fear bullies have on people so it can be done but just in a horrible way. The gameplay is an absolute mess and there have been missions where it has took me 4 hours alone to pass because of how poor the maps are meaning that the levels are longer for no reason.\n\nLet me set the scene, there is a map where 75% of it is land and the other 25% of it is water, again sounds fine. Well to get your land troops across water, you have to order these boats where they can only take 1 mech or 6 infantry units so the process is long and the water strech is not far either, we are talking 50 years here and there is even a ledge where at least the infantry could cross but no, it is not the case at all and you have to do the tedium of getting 1 group over, get the boat back to the other side and repeat. I guess I could accept that situation if it was only done in 1 mission but nope, it is set in at least 6 of the missions and cue the anger and the annoyance.\n\nAnother annoying thing is how the enemy structures are built as there are rocket towers all over some parts of the map in many levels and then you have mines to deal with in the later levels. The devs were seriously mine-happy in this game as there is literally about 50 of them scattered inch by inch to each other and you can only have a miner unit to sweep them but it is as riveting as cleaning rubbish up someone else has made at a club at the end of the night, it is not fun AT ALL. There were even parts where I had to save almost every 5 seconds I did something so I can continue because resources is so limited that it can make a mission go unnecessarily complicated very quickly especially when you are down to your last few units. It is ridiculous and I should not have to do that but nope, I had to do that for several missions.\n\nAI: The AI is also awful because the enmy is just cheap because when you are taking over a base, enemies out of nowhere just appear and attack your base so you have to make sure your base is well defended otherwise it can be destroyed very fast by infantry units of all things. The AI for your team however is seriously some of the worst because when you point them to somewhere, they do get there for the most part but there have been loads of instances where the units go a different direction that could expose them or they just do their own thing such as keep moving somwhere which gets them killed and this becomes a lot more common later on in the game making the controls annoying.\n\nThe music: Like I said before, there was one good song and that was it. Well unfortunately this was the case as there are only 9 songs in the whole game and there is just not enough songs here making the music monotonous very quickly after it's first loop. Unlike in Command And Conquer where you can loop a certain song over and over and the fact that the quality of the music is 100000x better than the music here is non-existent because you can choose a track but you cannot loop it over because it is already on a set path to loop the whole soundtrack over and over again, I am not impressed.\n\nAnd then comes the quality of the music, it is BAD and I mean bad because the songs are either too boring to listen to, too inspired to listen to, or the songs do not fit in the game at all. Seriously the one song sounds like something from a prime time TV programme for old people and does not fit this game AT ALL. If you want to make a soundtrack for an RTS, THEN MAKE IT FITTING BY GETTING THE SONG PUMP YOU UP TO TAKE DOWN THE ENEMY BASES AND NOT SONGS THAT FIT FOR GARDENING SHOWS! The music is awful, concluded.\n\nThe story: Okay, I was not expecting some deep story but there really isn't one because your faction are taking over countries and that is it. What is bad is the cutscenes as they are pointless since it just shows random artillery doing something and it does not set the scene at all. When you conquer a country (via 5 missions each country), it just takes you back to the world map so you can enter another country and there is no cutscene at the end of each company and it just make me feel so empty and made me feel like I achieved nothing and I wasted my time and I really did because 40 hours on this damn game is overkill! There is just no lore to this game, no background, no idea how it came to two faction in war of each other, absolutely nothing.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is not only a mess but an absolute disaster as almost nothing comes out of it and just because the price of this game is cheap, it does not mean you should buy it as you should put it on something a LOT better than rubbish. This is easily one of the worst games I have played (and that is saying something as I play lots of games) as it fails to be a RTS game, it fails to be interesting and most of all, it fails to be a playable game.\n\nAvoid this at all costs, save your money and save your time as this game just wastes it!\n\n0/10 - an absolute piece of turd","November 26, 2014","false","40.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

It seems whomever designed this had never played a game much less an RTS game before. I'm guessing this was a mobile app game port to PC even? If not, this is the level of quality of game. This is definitely NOT set up for HD or using on a flat screen even though the resolutions are there...the font all but disappears when you play anything but lowest res. Unfortunately, that also makes the battlefield map zoom in so tight you feel like you're fighting an entire battle using only the view out of a telescope. But if that wasnt bad enough, they put same colored font on top of same colored backgrounds for mission statements...sooo  good luck playing blind as far as background story / mission goals. But that's not really that hard as the battles are so simplistic that you can literally mass clump all your troops into one group and just push them around the screen to clean up everything on the map. There is no point the different units or any use for strategy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/253860/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Earth 2140 is old lesser-known Real-Time Strategy that was released in 1997, with Command And Conquer-like approach to design, not unlike many other RTS back then. Released only on computers, original version was DOS version. It was later ported to Windows, with a huge flaw: AI wasn't working properly.\n\nSo, what Steam version has going for it?\nSteam version lets you select if you want to play Windows version of "HD" version. Main differences are quite simple, HD works more reliably on modern systems. Intro movie was changed as well, scenes mixed around. Multiplayer isn't available in both, you have to search for DOS version for that. It also already comes with 2 mission pack, with 14 missions in total. Got to say, intro movie in the first mission pack is cool.\nAnd supposedly, HD version fixes WIndows AI bug. Yet it doesn't, thus you still have a screwed up game.\n\nPlot is quite simple. It's that you don't understand anything in intro movie, but it's cool, for it has androids and terminators.\nOk, more exactly, it has United Civilized States, which is nation where robots do absolutely everything and people turned into complete "pigs", and it has Eurasian Dynasty, which is more of dictatorship using outdated technology of tanks and such. And all of them fighting to take over Earth surface for recources. Pretty much both sides are "evil" in their way, which is quite unique.\nAnd that's pretty much what you will get, just war, with no real story between missions.\n\nAnd yes, mission objectives are quiet varied, even though majority of them is "build base, destroy enemy base". It got you destroying all enemies in map without your own base, finding lost machine, capturing bases, or even has you in the center of the map, with limited recources and surrounded by enemy, making you go offensive immeditly. Also, no skirmish, campaign only.\nBut once you get to more classic "destroy enemy base" mission, that is majority, the AI problems will surfrace.\n\nEarth 2140 playes like a C&C era game, having you press left mouse button to order units and having building/command/menu commands bar on the side of screen. And a very clunky one at that, controlling with only mouse is quite a chore, better learn some hotkeys. There is no good tutorial, so thsi game will require effort to get into.\nAnd yes, it got power plants, it got resources, which you can by building mines (and refinery and then have trucks move boxes around) over the yellow-painted parts of grounds, that you can see only on minimap (or when placing mine)... Jolly.\nAnother unique thing is how research is done. You just build research center and it gets done qutomatically. Can't say that it's a good idea.\n\nBoth factions get to have their own units, which are kinda different, in looks and a bit in stats, but otherwise fill same niches. There are 4 types of units: soldiers, who are good at dieing in numbers and capturing buildings, venichles/mechs that are the main part of army, water units and air units, which zip around fast. All of them have various weapons, rockets, napalm bombs, laser... though laser ones are the best. But they all seem to be balanced stat-wise. Or not exactly balanced, it's hard to tell. There are no strategy guides and nothing in the game explains what is best for what situation. That, and it may turn out that best tactic is to spam most effective units anyway, seeing game's age.\n\nAnd so comes main flaw with AI in this version, that ruins most of mission into dumb unfun session. He can't go offensive. He will not build new structures. He will repair though. He can't go offensive. He will only attack you once, as if scripted, if you discover him out, but once you do, he will remain defensive. And most importantly, he will produce a huge army for defence without stop, from what I gathered. And that isn't exactly fun, as you have to try to build a bigger army before AI does. Otherwise it will be a continuous attempt to kamikaze your way into, wall onto wall.\nI will be honest, I didn't figure out how to beat some of these missions.\n\nEarth 2140 even had an unique feature that was dependant on AI: Virtual Generals. You could select a bunch of units and then put them under "General"'s control, making them scout or even attack through the map without you paying attention. I doubt that it had much of use, but in Steam version it doesn't even work at all.\n\nGraphics and setting are quite nice for it's time, nothing fancy though. Music on other hand is worth mentioning. It doesn't exactly fit the game. Tracks are nice, but they don't blend in. It got one or more jokish peaceful or jazzy tracks in it, with bird singing. Nice idea, but hearing it among one of few tracks in a game feels quite weird.\n\nI can't really say if original DOS version was bad or not, quite possibly I didn't understand this RTS yet, I didn't manage to beat whole campaign after all. And I did have fun here and there, on small maps at least.\nBut what I can say is that it's unfriendly and Steam version's AI refuses to give a fun kind of challenge.\nIf you want to get familiar with this title, you should find it somewhere else, aiming for DOS version.","May 9, 2015","false","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
