Graphics are ok and overall presentation is average.  The huge interface graphics and nonwidescreen look of the game make it pretty obvious that this was ported from ipad or something like that.  You can kindof tell that's what happened because of how simple the game seems to be compared to other games like it.\n\nOVerall its ok but seems like it belongs more on a flash games site than on steam","August 21, 2015","false","1.4"," 65 of 97 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","65","97","6","9"

It’s all told with text.\n\nCons: Buggy. This game contains game-breaking bugs. It can suddenly make you unable to advance halfway the game so that your only resort is to self-destruct. It can also make you go out for a spin in an infinite loop so that the only recourse is to Alt-F4 out of the game.\nCombat sucks. It really does. It’s a trigger-happy clickfest for the mouse without any form of strategy or stats. Buttons are placed apart and you have to select the weapons first before you can use them while you’re already being pounded by enemy fire. And in almost all cases you’re totally screwed, might as well just tell the game to kill you before combat starts.\nChoices are very limited. After a few play sessions you kinda know what to expect. And then you start to get annoyed that you can’t choose C out of given choices A and B.\nAre we there yet? You’re supposed to go to some wonderful place for your people, but you don’t know how far you are. All you do is click to warp to a new place and get a random encounter. If you survive, you can repeat the warp for another random encounter. How many warps left? No idea!\nThere is no feeling of progress. Sometimes you get some random freak crew member added, or something to populate your ship’s hold. Sometimes those will be of use in the random encounters, but in most cases there’s no feeling of accomplishment. It was just Yet Another Random Encounter.\nRogue-like? What the heck is rogue-like about this game? There is not even real exploration involved, just click ‘next’ towards the next random location! At best this might maybe be a ‘choose your own adventure’ thing. And even then, it is not that. It is just a game where you have to survive random encounters.\nBright! All the bright white flashes when you go warp is headache-inducing. I am migraine-prone. :(\nPros: It can be funny? Sometimes it has a funny random encounter. That’s pretty much all the pro I can say about this game considering the state it is in.\nConclusion:The idea was nice but the execution’s done very poorly as if they rushed and then didn’t quite finish their concept and you feel a lot more could’ve been added.There’s also too many game-breaking bugs to make this game really enjoyable. On top of that, you have no idea how far you are in the game. I don’t know if I ever got near the end, not even on one of my good runs. I start to suspect there’s probably not even an end and the only goal is to get as high as possible in the high score charts.\n\nI have the feeling this game was trying to be like what Orion Trail is going to become but fell flat bigtime. I only have tried the demo of Orion Trail but that is already a lot more promising than this game.\n\nQuantum Flux isn’t even worth 1 buck.","September 12, 2015","false","1.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","1"

I played it a few times and found that with Advance Scanner it was easy to get the positive outcomes from most encounters. But once you know how to respond to each encounter it's very much the same. There doesn't seem to be any depth or replay value. Not recommended even on sale.","August 22, 2015","false","0.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arabin/recommended/396610/","arabin","Arabin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arabin/","1665 products in account","I'm torn about whether to recommend this game or not. If we had a rating scale, I would give it a 3/5. Let me explain.\n\nQuantum Flux, at first glance, is a space adventure inspired by games like FTL, and perhaps even The Oregon Trail. It's fun, each time you jump, not knowing what you will find. This is fun, and I find myself excited when the ship launches into a new area.\n\nHowever, after playing a couple of times, you quickly notice that although each jump leads you to a semi-random encounter, the scenario and results of each encounter are always the same. It becomes a memory game rather than a risky adventure.\n\nAdditionally, in the few games I played, the game usually leans towards the positive, so if you choose the option that sounds like the nicest guy would choose, you will get the best results. I kept hoping that this would sometimes backfire, but it was always the same.\n\nThen on my third play, I encountered a bug(?) which is why I will now be uninstalling the game. The whole premise is that you are taking the last of humanity to Haven. Well, I managed to get the ship back into known space, and my crew told me we could now jump straight to Haven. After the conversation, the ship auto-jumped, and I expected an end game screen before credits rolled... but instead I got another random encounter, and at the end of that encounter, it was mentioned that I still had a long way to go. So apparently, it's not possible to actually complete the game.\n\nI should also mention that you cannot adjust the resolution, and it plays in either a tiny window, or a pixelated full screen mode.\n\nTherefore, although there is fun to be had here, and a puzzle to solve in figuring out the best approach to every encounter, the game is in need of some improvements before I could recomend it. If you get it cheap in a bundle, give it a try, otherwise I recommend giving FTL another play instead.","October 19, 2015","false","0.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
