"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/231740/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4978 products in account","Knights of Pen & Paper, originally for iOS, is a turn-based RPG with a novel concept: you take on the role of real-life players in a tabletop game.  The camera is set behind a table where up to five of your characters are seated, with the dungeon master on the other side leading you through the story.  Dialogue tends to be humorous and frequently goes out of character.\n\nThe game begins with character creation, where you must assign your players a real-life persona and one of a dozen traditional RPG classes, each with four skills.  The actual gameplay takes place around your table, as if you’re in the middle of all the action, and consists of traveling to locations on a world map and completing quests, which are really just more battles in disguise.  In fact, the entire game is simply one battle after another and becomes very repetitive, very fast.\n\nAs expected, level-ups provide stat bonuses and allow you to upgrade your skills and wear better equipment.  Armor and weapons may only be improved at the blacksmith, but each character has four additional slots for equipping various accessories.  In addition to in-game shops, there is a “real-life” shop where you may purchase snacks that provide temporary buffs for your players, as well as decorations and furniture that confer permanent bonuses.\n\nOverall, Knights of Pen & Paper is passable in the context of mobile gaming but completely forgettable when compared to quality games on the PC platform.  Considering the price is $9.99 on Steam vs a mere $2.99 on iOS and Android, it’s borderline offensive that the devs left in-app purchases in the game, allowing you to buy gold with your Steam wallet funds.  Such a shameless exhibit of its mobile origins is a fitting red flag for a game that also fails to break away from the shallow, repetitive gameplay those origins typically entail.","August 11, 2013","false","11.2"," 557 of 683 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","557","683","0","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/231740/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","I admit, I miss tabletop gaming. I miss the DM trying to kill off my characters. I miss creating ridiculously out-of-the-box characters. Heck, I miss the days of popcorn, Mountain Dew, and just hanging out and rolling some dice. Those days have been gone for me quite some time ago, and yet playing a little game called Knights of Pen and Paper reminded me of those good old days.\n\nKnights of Pen and Paper attempts to mimic tabletop gaming for an accessible audience. Players start by selecting three noobs to join the adventuring party, along with their class and starting skill. Like any tabletop RPG, as the adventuring party explores, kills baddies, and completes quests, they earn experience to level up and gain more skills. Each party member gets one skill point every time they level up and can only put points into one of four skills. While this creates simplicity for those unfamiliar with RPGs, it doesn't provide a lot of variety.\n\nIn fact, variety is what Knights of Pen and Paper struggles with throughout its twenty hour campaign. Although the backgrounds mimic an 8-bit style, there isn't much in terms of detail or design. The soundtrack loops, but it feels like there's only three tracks in the entire game. Although there's plenty of classes in the game, many of them are locked and the requirements for unlocking them appear random. The base classes — paladin, mage, cleric, etc. — while classic, are trapped with only four skills, which wouldn't be the case in tabletop gaming.\n\nWhile variety isn't the game's strong suit, accessibility is. It provides a simple turn-based battle system wherein players can select between attack, skill, defend, item, and flee. This makes for an easy learning experience, but it lacks any real depth that a tabletop game has. The game is also surprisingly grindy, and while it does a great job of teaching players what to expect in encounters (usually enemies three to five levels higher than the adventuring party), it's a bit crazy how much players will have to stop and grind because it's not entirely on par with the party's level. It feels like the developers set out to make a simple RPG to give players the feel of tabletop gaming, but the combat could have benefitted from actual dice rolls on screen to indicate whether or not the player's characters succeeded or fail in their actions. However, with the grindy combat, perhaps adding dice rolls would have just made everything take longer than provide more accessibility. Still, the combat lacks depth and it needs something else to make it a more engaging process.\n\nDice rolling does exist within Knights of Pen and Paper, it's just not as frequent as it should be. Dice rolls occur when players travel between areas, failures leading to battles, successes leading to safety. Dice rolls occur when players are mining for grindstones or moving through dungeons. These elements are done well and are fairly straightforward, but this game would really benefit if it was implemented into all actions, especially if its goal is to mimic tabletop games. What's further disappointing is the campaign itself. While the writing is charming and hilarious, the majority of the quests are either escort missions, collecting items, slaying some bad dudes, or traveling from place to place for plot purposes. The amount of backtracking in this game is brutal and inexcusable, and even the adventuring party complains about it. It goes back to that problem of accessibility versus variety — on one hand, the campaign should be easy to learn and follow along, on the other hand there should be more to do than then the standard affair. The charm in the writing, and even its awkward translation errors, can only go so far and will likely leave veteran RPGamers wanting something more substantial.\n\nHowever, Knights of Pen and Paper does succeed in its overall atmosphere. Players get the sense of gamers hanging out, bantering, and asking to pass the Mountain Dew. There is an overal sense that the Dungeon Master is out to kill the adventuring party, and the back and forth within the writing really does work well. The graphics and music, though overly simplistic, are vibrant and give the feeling that players are on an adventure and there is loot to be had. The game is also a fantastic time waster because in its lack of depth it success at being the type of mindless game where players find themselves going, "just one more quest." Considering all of the game's flaws, it admittedly succeeds in the one area that for some people matters most: it's actually fun.\n\nThere are some perks in Knights of Pen and Paper's PC release that differ from the original mobile version. For starters, it allows players to leave party members at the tavern, and bring a new adventurers into the party. They can roll for a new character and not feel like they have to start their entire campaign from scratch. There's also an extended campaign for those who want to explore more of what the game has to offer, and there's tons of new dungeons and loot to acquire. The main campaign can be completed in around twenty hours, with the extended campaign offering quite a bit of repaly value. There's also tons of items that can be purchased in shops that can give added bonuses to various stats, which is a nice cosmetic feature.\n\nKnights of Pen and Paper is a sweet little throwback to the days of pen and paper gaming, but its simple approach may not be enough to entice every RPGamer. Yes, the combat is simplistic, but it's fast and easy to roll with. Sure, the story is simple, but it's cute in its presentation. Knights of Pen and Paper's imperfections are many, and yet it's completely easy to sink time into. It's straightforward in its approach and yet, despite its flaws and frustration, I kept playing. Knights of Pen and Paper will never offer gamers a deep experience, but it offers mindless gameplay that admittedly can keep you coming back for more.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 17, 2014","true","35.8"," 99 of 115 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","99","115","3","2"

This game...\nThis game is awesome!\n\nI liked the overall parody feel about it while it has a strong and solid work about delivering action and plot in moderation, getting some loud laughs from me here and there. The battle is unforgiving, so you always have to be focused, despite it being turn-based. The difficulty is adjustable in a manner "How frisky you are today?", taking on anything between 1 and 7 rats or elite monsters. The open-ended way the characters are presented lets you use your imagination. I do feel like playing a table top sheets'n'pens while playing this. Yes, the feel of every character is an illusion, but it's a very-VERY well made illusion.\n\nAnother point is the building difficulty: Items give you stats that you barely see. Levels give you damage that you barely see. Hp and Mana regen is earned by tears and sweat dripping down your inner thigh. All this while enemy shamelessly uses lifesteal and applies crazy bleeding stacks. Some battles will be so tight that you will stain your undergarments a bit and still lose because of the enemy randomly preferring your rouge to your fully buffed granny paladin. You will put a sleep on a DoT'ed enemy and lose your healer because of that, and you will spend 4 times the money you earned in that battle to revive your team. You will even spend 2k on upgrading your sword and still get nothing in return because you are a looser and you will have no money to leave the god forsaken town.\nBut... You know... That's what's good about this game... That's what's your adventure is. And you should not just accept it, but have tons of fun while at it!\n\nI would like to say thank you to the developers. I've seen a lot of attempts to do what they achieved in this game and i think they did it better than anyone else I've seen so far, including UnEpic and Magicka, the first being too far away and the second being a bit too silly. But this game, oh, this game grabs the bull by his modesty and makes him enjoy it so much that he's ashamed afterwards, but he begs for more.\n\nHighly recommend.","May 31, 2015","true","10.9"," 55 of 64 people (86%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","86","55","64","17","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/desidiosusjk/recommended/231740/","desidiosusjk","Desidiosus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/desidiosusjk/","907 products in account","Knights of Pen and Paper is a fantasy RPG, which plays like tabletop RPGs. The twist is that you're playing as both the dungeon master and the players. Basically that means you can decide yourself what kind of quests you want (to some extent) and how difficult you want to make the fights by choosing how many enemies you want to fight against. And because the game is like tabletop RPGs, there are several situations where you'll throw a virtual D20 dice.\n\nWhen you first start the game you get to choose from about 10 characters to be the players and 5 classes for them. Each character has a different passive bonus that increases some attributes, which actually leads to choosing the characters based on the bonuses and the class you're going to pick. When starting a new game you get to choose 2 players for free and the remaining 3 seats in the table you can fill by buying the players with in-game gold. You can swap the players in places that have a tavern.\n\nIf I remember correctly, you first have 5 classes available, but you can unlock a few more by completing side-quests. You can only have one of each class, so for example you can't have 5 warriors as your party. You wouldn't want to either. The reason being that each class has its purpose. Some classes are healers, some are tanks and the rest are either melee fighters or spellcasters of some description. Each class has 4 skills, which are either passive or spells and skills that you can use during combat. The passive skills usually boost some attribute, but some of them also have special stat boosts like life steal. The active skills are pretty basic fantasy RPG skills. You can increase one of the skills every time you level up, which just made the skills more powerful or increased the attribute bonus. So it isn't very deep skill system.\n\nThe combat is turn based and the players and the enemies all have a box either on top of or below the sprite, which shows the number of their turn. On the player's turns you choose to either attack, use a skill/spell, use an item, defend or run away from the battle. You quite rarely want to use anything other than a skill or spell, because those are the most effective way for beating the enemies. As I mentioned earlier, you get to choose how many and what kind of enemies you want to fight against. Once you buy a certain item from a special shop you can fight 7 enemies at a time, but before that the maximum was 5, I think. I bought that item very early on and didn't check the maximum amount before that. The enemies you can choose from vary quite a lot and you can often choose to fight tougher elite monsters, which give better rewards.\n\nI thought the combat was quite fun, but it got kinda boring after 8 hours because in the end it was just the same thing over and over again. At least they kept things fresh with different enemies. The difficulty ramped up quite a lot after about halfway into the game, when the enemies suddenly became very high-leveled compared to the players. Surprisingly enough, I could survive against much higher level enemies than my players were provided I only fought against 3 at a time. It could take a long time to kill them all, but I still could do it. I suppose I played it quite safe since most of the time I fought battles I knew I could win and as a result my whole party died only 3 times during the time I played the game.\n\nWhen you're not in combat you can choose from several options depending on your location in the world. In almost every place you can choose to rest, start a quest specific to the location, use items, check the equipment of the players or travel to some other place. Cities usually also have shops for buying potions and equipment, a tavern and a blacksmith. The blacksmith can upgrade your equipment, but you shouldn't do that until you have increased the blacksmith's level enough for the odds to be on your side. The upgrading is chance based and it happens by throwing the dice. The range of "winning" numbers increases as the blacksmith levels up, which makes it easier to win. It's also a good idea to have level 16 players, because then you can equip items that decrease the equipment upgrading cost. I wasted several hundreds of in-game gold before I found about those items.\n\nMoving in the world happens by opening the world map and then choosing the location. Traveling costs some gold and every time you move on the map, you throw the D20 dice and depending the roll you might get a random battle. That would get annoying very quickly, if you had to fight some low level monsters when moving around the starting area with high level players, but luckily the chance for the random battle depends on the players' levels and the levels of the monsters in the area you're travelling to. You can also a buy an item that permanently increases your dice rolls by 1, which makes it impossible to get random battles in low level areas. I thought the time it took to travel between each place was a bit too long, but you could reduce that to half if you had a certain game master active.\n\nQuests were quite repetitive and not very fun. There is basically 3 types of quest: kill x amount of certain monsters, escort/deliver something and "fetch" some items by going to a certain place and killing the enemies there for the items and then return to the place where you started the quest. On the upside the quests gave a lot of experience. There were also some story quests as this game has a (boring) story about saving the pen and paper world. I think the dialog should have been funny, but I didn't find it funny. There were quite many references, but those weren't funny either. At one point I stopped caring about the story entirely and just skipped through the dialog. I just didn't find it interesting at all.\n\nThe game also has a special store that you can access anytime you're not in combat or in the middle of some conversation. The store has items like furniture, which boost something permanently, and snacks, which give a boost that only lasts for about 15 minutes. You can switch between the furniture you have bought without having to buy them again. I usually switched them based on the situation I was in. Everything bought in this store transferred to other saves too, so you only had to buy the stuff once.\n\nI believe the game was originally designed for phones and tablets as there is an in-game store, from which you can buy in-game gold for real money. However, using the in-game store is never required and it can be completely ignored. Once you reach a certain point in the game, you can easily get around 300 gold from a fight that lasts for a minute. The in-game gold is transferred between saves so you can have a save for farming gold for the other save. The real money store in the game seems to be a thing that makes some people skip the game entirely, even though you never have to use the store.\n\nThe graphics are 2D pixel art and the sounds effects are pretty old-school bleeps and bloops. There is no voice acting, so you have to read through all the dialog. I thought the music was repetitive so I ended up muting it.\n\nOverall I thought it was pretty enjoyable game and I was quite addicted to it for a while. I played it for 21 hours in total, which included me first going through half the game and then starting a new save to get couple of achievements. I finished the story in the second game I started and also beat the optional boss. I also got every achievement aside from the 3 broken ones. The boring story and the in-game real money store are definite cons, but the rest of the game is fun even without very deep character development or combat.","December 4, 2013","true","22.4"," 123 of 175 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","123","175","0","0"

Instead, players find themselves killing hordes upon hordes of monsters to make numbers go up so they can kill bigger hordes of scarier monsters. The story tries to be humorous about a D&D group finding the line between fantasy and reality blurred with numerous shoe-horned cameos, but the writing itself is unnatural to the point that it feels like a high-schooler's fan-fiction. In fact, if you're looking for a game the emulates the D&D experience, I recommend Cardhunter, a free-to-play tactical game with better writing and more involved gameplay.\n\nEven if you're in the market for a mindless grind-a-thon, don't buy this on the PC. Opt for the mobile version instead, since the game also constantly puts you through miniscule but unskippable animations that would be more bearable if you could look out the window while they play. Hell, I'd recommend other mobile games entirely, but some people like their skinner boxes and this is one of the skinneriest boxes I've ever seen.\n\nP.S.: This game *had* micro-transactions, but those have been removed. According to an anonymous source (see comment), the microtransaction was originally forced on by a publisher. A sad case of publisher overruling developer control.

That pretty much sums up this game in a nutshell, only you play it on the PC. It looks like an old school NES game, but incorporates the table top D&D feel, Very interesting concept. Much different than the early video game D&D adventures, this game tries to stay true to old school D&D. I thought it was a fun little game and would recommend it, because it can be picked up for next to nothing or even free and if you enjoy anything D&D related, you should at least give it a try.

However, it has both condensed and distilled the core elements of pen and paper gaming to a level which is far too simplistic for me to enjoy. The combat is shallow, the quests are repetitive, and the stats and perks are shallow and hardly feel like they matter. The UI is also highly simplistic and does not even provide important information efficiently or at all.\n\nI am sure that this is a fun bathroom game on a mobile device or something on the go, but the flaws of this game impeded my enjoyment of this game and cannot recommend this game to people who want an enthralling experience.","August 8, 2015","false","0.4"," 67 of 105 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","67","105","5","1"

Unfortunately, the novelty wears off fairly quickly, and the actual gameplay just doesn't hold up. Traditional jRPGs are carried by their characters and story, because the combat and mechanics thereof are so one-dimensional and stale.\n\nSo Knights of Pen and Paper has the same boring combat as any Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest/Final Fantasy/etc game, but all the writing, charm, and polish has been replaced by easy jokes about RPG tropes.\n\nIf RPGs are played for the story, where's the story? I guess the gag is that there is no story, that this is the RPG stripped down and laid bare. I can buy that. But since there's no gameplay worth noting, does that joke really carry a game for 5+ hours?\n\nI don't think it does. The premise is done a hundred times better by Half Minute Hero - which has all the same lazy RPG "observational humor", but uses it as a fluffy coat to the solid framework of fun, interesting gameplay. I recommend you pick that up, instead. Knights of Pen and Paper isn't worth the time it takes to finish it, much less the asking price.","June 22, 2015","false","3.9"," 46 of 74 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","46","74","2","2"

There is no exploration or movement. It is all menu and dialog based. The map is pretty segmented like a Mario map and there are not maps so much as there are quests. These quests revolve around typical and simplified RPG turn based combat. The catch is you also play your own dungeon master, so you can select your enemies to fight and how many you will fight. Its as if you're making your own busy work. The classes feel balanced, but the battles begin feel too long for the never ending grind that this game becomes. Unless you want to spend real money to buy in game gold.\n\nThe game has a lot of personalization. You start the game selecting characters and their classes. Each character has its own passive ability and then you assign a class. You can only have one of a class per party. Each class has 4 upgradeable abilities, some are passives like regenerate HP per turn and most are combat abilities. When you level up through experience defeating enemies, you can level up a skill. Leveling up skills increases the MP they use, so its a double edged sword where eventually you can only use a skill once or twice before you need to rest or use potions. There are items that will regenerate MP and HP along with increase maximums.\n\nThe combat abilities feel useful. Paladins have a leader strike that is a powerful attack. The strike will increase their threat to enemies driving the majority of attacks to that character. To balance the attention, the paladin has a temporary shield power, a flash heal for themselves and devotion that increases the base HP. A cleric can heal the entire party or focus healing on one character. They can also use a smite skill that damages an enemy and heals themselves. To round things out there is a weakening spell to debuff enemy attack power for three enemies. Mages have a single enemy damaging fireball that will burn them, damaging HP each turn. They also have a deep freeze that damages and stuns an enemy. Mages also have a meteor that damages an entire enemy party and finally a passive stream that increases the base MP. I can't cover all the classes, but they feel well rounded.\n\nThe classes have to feel well rounded, because the game is nothing but combat. A chess game between you and enemies that you chose to fight. The game has plenty of quests to give you and you can tackle them one at a time. Nothing that will stump you, since all the 'quests' seem to be collect X amount of Y or defeat X amount of Y enemies. Escort X from point A to B and then fight a battle. It wouldn't seem like such a grind if your travel had more exploration instead of moving along a line from location to location. There is some banter along the way, but its just your party sitting at a table facing a dungeon master with different beautiful backgrounds. The battles get long, even with better equipment. It gets frustrating when you complete a quest to kill 7 plants only to get another quest to kill 9 plants. Then that quest followed by another quest to get 19 carrots. How? By killing the same plants you've just slaughtered. You can always pick your quests, but its useless when you'll end up doing them all anyway.\n\nWhen you visit a town, you don't walk to a store, you just click on an icon that will open up the store. The items are nice. Upgrading weapons and armor involves a gambling system. Sure it costs 150 gold to have a blacksmith upgrade your gear, but there's only a 35% chance he'll succeed. Seems like a gamble and a waste of gold. The blacksmith will get better with every try . You can even increase the blacksmith's experience by using grindstones that you'll buy or find in caves.\n\nThat leads me to warn you of this. Microtransactions. Why grind for gold when you can just buy it with real life money? The microtransactions aren't in your face or annoying, but they are there and some people have problems with that. If you want gold, go kill some enemies, there's nothing else to do in the game.\n\nIf someone in your party dies, that costs gold. Since resurrection costs gold, when your party gets wiped out and you don't have enough gold to resurrect one of them, that's it. It was originally a gameover, because the game will save itself preventing you from going back to a previous point when your party was alive. So you'd have to buy gold with real life money. Luckily, there is now a free continue that will resurrect everyone, but reset their level experience. I'm thankful of that. If you don't want to grind to level up your characters, you can always buy experience with gold. There is always a need for gold. Whether its experience, resurrection, traveling, or gambling to upgrade your equipment. Oh and don't forget buying stuff.\n\nAt some point, this game is busy work and you know some people are ok with that. In all, I would say its a fun game, but other RPGs are better. Since this is trying to be a Dungeons & Dragons simulator without being a true RPG its just lacking in some areas.","October 18, 2013","false","36.2"," 93 of 161 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","93","161","0","0"

The game is not balanced around this shop, and I've never once understood why it was in the game. Perhaps it's for "stupid people" who make foolish decisions, or need a "boost", but I did not need it.\n\nHowever, I did decide to go with the digital deluxe edition for $1 more, which comes with a lot of goodies, including a new character, 800 starting gold, some minor boosts and a new area with a monster super effective to all dmg.

You set your own pace on everything, like choosing which enemies you want to fight and how many, so the game never really suprises or challenges you. The quests are boring and all feel like sidequests (kill this many things, go here, collect this many things, blahblahblah). They've taken microtransactions out of the game but you can tell a lot of the mechanics were set up with those in mind.\n\nThey do have some neat things like the ability to buy upgrades and powerups for the 'real life' players, and these upgrades carry over different saves, but there isn't enough of this and you'll have most the things you want rather early on. The graphics are pretty nice as well, if you like the 8bit style.\n\nThis game is probably better played on a phone or mobile device, this isn't a terrible port but it shows it was made for a touch screen in mind - for example you have to select the enemy to attack every time. I'd recommend buying this on a mobile touch screen device, it'll prob cost less - also it'd be easier to play it in short bursts like it is prob meant to be played.\n\nIn short, they botched it.","June 22, 2014","false","5.5"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

It was an old game when the patch came out, so the loss of save files was definitely unexpected.\n\nAlso, it's pretty dumb that if you already have some of the DLC from buying the +1 Edition, you can't just buy the extra DLC you're missing without rebuying it with the base game.  Come on now.\n\nAs for the game itself, I would rate as so-so.  The theme and art is top-notch, but everything else becomes kind of a drag as you keep playing.  There's way too many boring encounters.  Some of the areas seem really poorly balanced-- I went into a dungeon with a level rating lower than my party's, and was basically insta-killed (had zero problems up to that point).

One of the things I really disliked was that to upgrade your characters standard weapons and armour costs a fortune at the blacksmith and requires extensive upgrades to get above a less than %50 chance of the upgrade being successful (Your money, which is in short suppy, is spent regardless). You can upgrade the chance by getting grindstones, but GRIND is the opperative word. Grindstones are only available in caves and there is only a precentage of getting one for each ore pile you click on. You will need to go back to these places again and again and again to try to get enough grindstones to raise the chance of an upgrade succeeding more than %50 of the time. I do like it, but with caveats. If you can tolerate the random grinding required, go for it.\n\nPros:\nGood sense of humour\nGraphics have a lot of charm\nChirpy retro music\n\nCons:\nGrinding\nRepetition\nRinse/repeat\nTear enducing upgrade system\n","July 7, 2015","true","7.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game's premise of telling a story from the point of view of people playing a Tabletop RPG is played painfully straight without any humor involved other than the premise itself. The game also provides no attempts at being an authentic Tabletop RPG experience by being restrictively linear and having a fixed storyline. Speaking of which, the game's story has no sense of atmospheric or emotional depth and is paper thin, no pun intended, and is literally the most generic and bare bones story you can think of for a fantasy game. Again no attempts are made to actually make this interesting or relate it to the game's premise.\n\nThe gameplay is made up entirely of fetch quests that are normally reserved for sidequests, and there is no exploration included at all. The game will stop being fun after about an hour. Also the game features micro-transactions in the form of buying in game money with real world money, and the game's design seems to be based arpound making you use up as much in game money as possible. Traveling to new locations, reviving dead parteners both cost in game money despite making no logical sense why this should be the case. Up grading weapons is something that costs an absurd amount of money to attempt, but it starts out with only a 35% chance of working, and the only way to increase that percentage is to sucesfully upgrade weapons. Because of this, you will likely go through all your in game money really quickly, and seeing as how money takes a rediculously long time to farm in this game, it seems entirely likely that the idea was to get you to use the micro-transactions.\n\nThis game is not reccomended.","January 25, 2014","false","10.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The comments your party makes are usually cheesy one-liners or memes, or video game references. You roll a d20 for quests, upgrading gear, getting grindstones in caves, resting in non-towns, and travelling, and failing a dice roll only makes the game more tedious. The battle system is all turn-based, and order is loosely based on initiative, but it's mostly random.\n\nA more minor point though are the microtransactions for in-game gold which are COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY but for some reason every day some guy will complain about "ermergerd microtransactions" in the community hub.

This game...\nThis game is awesome!\n\nI liked the overall parody feel about it while it has a strong and solid work about delivering action and plot in moderation, getting some loud laughs from me here and there. The battle is unforgiving, so you always have to be focused, despite it being turn-based. The difficulty is adjustable in a manner "How frisky you are today?", taking on anything between 1 and 7 rats or elite monsters. The open-ended way the characters are presented lets you use your imagination. I do feel like playing a table top sheets'n'pens while playing this. Yes, the feel of every character is an illusion, but it's a very-VERY well made illusion.\n\nAnother point is the building difficulty: Items give you stats that you barely see. Levels give you damage that you barely see. Hp and Mana regen is earned by tears and sweat dripping down your inner thigh. All this while enemy shamelessly uses lifesteal and applies crazy bleeding stacks. Some battles will be so tight that you will stain your undergarments a bit and still lose because of the enemy randomly preferring your rouge to your fully buffed granny paladin. You will put a sleep on a DoT'ed enemy and lose your healer because of that, and you will spend 4 times the money you earned in that battle to revive your team. You will even spend 2k on upgrading your sword and still get nothing in return because you are a looser and you will have no money to leave the god forsaken town.\nBut... You know... That's what's good about this game... That's what's your adventure is. And you should not just accept it, but have tons of fun while at it!\n\nI would like to say thank you to the developers. I've seen a lot of attempts to do what they achieved in this game and i think they did it better than anyone else I've seen so far, including UnEpic and Magicka, the first being too far away and the second being a bit too silly. But this game, oh, this game grabs the bull by his modesty and makes him enjoy it so much that he's ashamed afterwards, but he begs for more.\n\nHighly recommend.","July 24, 2015","true","80.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","6","9","3","0"

Sadly though, that DM kinda sucks. If I had him for a DM in my pen-n-paper sessions, we'd have long discussions about NPC naming, story telling and such. But I think this is most likely yet an other prank from the developers :p\n\nI picked it up for €2,50 on the sale today, but if I knew this game was so much fun, I would have bought it earlier and have paid the €10 as well.

There isn't any decisions to be made (As one would expect from a dnd game) or strategy, and there isn't even any dice rolling aside from travel or sleeping.\n\nThe classes are un balanced like crazy. The mage and the cleric are easily the best classes in the game. The rogue is in 3rd at average and the warrior and paladin are just complete garbage. The characters dont do anything story wise and there is no banter or personality to them.\n\nThe character sheets are pretty boring. Each character gets 3 active skills and 1 passive that you can level up. However the skills are just about asa basic and uninteresting as you can get. The mage has a fireball, Frostbolt, meteor, and mana increase skill. The Cleric has smite, heal all, heal one, and a damage debuff skill. The rogue has a stealth, double strike, disable, and posion skill. The warrior has a healing, damage debuff, cleave, and one more skill I forgot. And the paladin has a shield, heal, aggro strike, and defense increase skill. B-O-R-I-N-G!!!\n\nYou do have a nice selection of buyable items to give buffs thought. Various items/props/food and even the dm can be changed. I do think that is nice and adds some charm to the game. The equipable items however, are again boring +to stat upgrades. Nothing cool or interesting.\n\nI hate not recommending this game as it is a solid concept that I hope to see expanded and improved in the future, but in its current state it just isn't worth your time or money.","November 8, 2014","false","2.5"," 35 of 66 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","35","66","0","0"

Like Dungeons and Dragons-style adventuring games?\nB.) Like playing actual D&D style games, on pen and paper?\nC.) Would like to try a simulator of the two?\n\nThis is that game.\n\nWill you like it? That's debatable.\n\nI bought this game when it was a daily deal because I like pen and paper D&D-style games. Note that I had received all of the boosts from the digital deluxe version.\n\nThe retro-style graphics are a nice aesthetic, and there is quite a bit of variety with the creatures you will encounter in the game.\n\nSo the game plays with you as the DM (dungeon master) overseeing a game of D20 Knights of Pen and Paper. You have seats that can sit how ever many characters you would like to use, but the last few seats require you to pay the in-game currency. You can keep grinding to afford the seats in the future.\n\nFor each seat, you can sit a type of character (ex: hipster, grandma) and assign them a specific class (ex: barbarian, bard). This offers a seemingly wide range of party configurations.\n\nThe difficulty is completely self-driven, as you are both the DM and the players. That being said, you may have an "objective" to kill 5 orcs - you can choose to fight them 1-at-a-time, or all at once, or whatever configuration you prefer. The entirety of the game involves A LOT of grinding, and this is even considering the boosts you may have gotten from the deluxe edition.\n\nI love D20 games, but this game can become repetitive extremely quickly. If there was a multiplayer cooperative functionality, it might have saved it a bit, however, there isn't one.\n\nThere is A LOT of variety for you to upgrade - you can change everything from the type of table you're playing on (each type provides different bonuses) to the type of door in the room to the DM. All of this can help shape your overall party into a specfic area, like tanky high HP characters, or high MP, magic-relying casters.\n\nI paid ~$5 US for the deluxe edition, and I think even then you may want to hold off and wait for it to be cheaper, if you are interested in trying the game.","July 6, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I thought it was actually worse than it is, and I'm glad I ended up buying this title and playing through it's 9 hour-ish campaign. The basic premise is, you are a group of friends that are playing the much known fantasy tabletop role-playing game, and your adventures are depicted both through pixelated landscapes/characters and from what the D&D players are actually saying, or actually the dungeon master. Much like in the main idea from the movie Inception, you are playing a game in which the characters are playing a game. So, gameception?\n\nKoP&P (Knights of Pen and Paper) is an RPG, and most features you expect from one are available in this title. Leveling up your characters, giving them new items, armor and weapons, upgrading your character's abilities, questing your way through until the very end, or until New Game +, in which your able to replay the whole game, with the same characters, but everything is harder. It didn't really attract me, since the main campaign features a bit of grinding and I didn't want to go through the same. It's useful for completing the achievements, though.\n\nSoundtrack fits the theme of KoP&P, but can actually become boring after a few hours of gameplay. Another interesting feature is the abundance of references to tv shows, movies, etc. You eventually find a character named Nabe Gewell, which lives in Steam Island, which I found amusing. The 4th wall is also broken lots of times.\n\nIn conclusion, do yourself a favor, and purchase KoP&P. It entertained me for a couple hours and I'm sure it will do the same for you. Alas, if you actually don't enjoy D&D's concept, steer in the way of another game.","November 22, 2015","true","26.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

You can choose which monster to beat and how many of them. So you're totally free to put your own difficulty.\nThe game reminds me of those old roleplays used to be "played" in forums:\n5 characters around a table with a master that is telling all the interactions you're doing with them.\nPlenty of environments, classes and monsters more or less tough are available during the quests.\n\nThe bad point is the repetitive actions in combat, from a place to another you can't change your character because it will take too long to level. A character has only 4 skills, you can easily choose which skill is the best though you will note that the effects of a single skill does the same for every monster: An ice monster should be weak against fire. The mage class uses "Fireball", no effect. "Deep Freeze", super effective, and that against most of the monsters.\n\nFinally, the game should be fine for beginners, who never played any old RPG game before because Knights Of Pen & Paper is really easy to beat, hard with patience.\nOtherwise, I think the game would fit better on phone and tablets.","May 5, 2014","false","21.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a turn based RPG, but it's not hard for noobies.\nYou can balance it yourself by starting with more or less characters. I would strongly recommend starting with 5 players because the endgame is very hard otherwise.\n\nOther then that you really need to play it for an hour or two to find out if it's for you. I like the dry humor and pop culture references. And how it doesn't take itself too seriously. But some people call this 'lacking in depth' and I guess they're right too. They do re-use certain backgrounds and let you grind from level 32-37 and 1 mission later 37-45 at the end of the game, so they definitely rushed through the end trying to add some 'gameplay' without putting in work sadly. That level 50 mission is optional btw. Throughout the rest of the game there is rarely a need to grind though. Do note that the game has some large bugs. Some achievements are broken, some missions are broken, DLC doesn't work for some and there's graphical glitches. This seems like a hasty port honestly. And then there's the fact that if you want the Deluxier Edition you have to buy it at once. You can't upgrade. If you already have Normal edition or Deluxe edition (extra's, but no DLC) you're screwed. Also they just wiped everybody's saves trying to emplement the (not fully working) cloud save. Then wiped all saves again when reverting to the old build.\n\nSo the game is very fun, but beware that this game is published by Paradox. As long as you're lucky enough to be in the 90% for whom most things don't break you're good. But if something goes wrong there's no support and dealing with Paradox is like talking to a 3 year old and when they realize you're right they just ignore you.\n\nI only recommend this game because it's unique. It's very money-grabby, too expensive and the publisher is unethical and clearly doesn't care about it's customers, but the game is so much  fun and most people don't care about what happens behind the scenes. And if I'd downvote it the fanboys would downvote this review and you wouldn't be reading about the downsides of this game right now.","October 6, 2015","true","49.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, then it just turned into a grind and the completionist in me forced me to play through and finish it.  Here are the main complaints:\n\n-The game progresses pretty smoothly and you don't need to grind much until the last dungeon.  I could get to the last dungeon easily, but then had to do almost 5 levels of grinding with all my guys just to be able to complete the final dungeon.\n-The blacksmith levels up far too slowly. The only way to level him is to get him grindstones, which you can find 1 to 4 of in certain locations.  However, at the final level you can give him 20-30 grindstones and barely move his xp bar.\n-Any game that encourages micro-transactions has already failed.","April 23, 2014","false","21.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","2"

Don't interpret the no vote to mean I think it's a bad game, it's just not that inspiring.  You set up a party, choose which fights you want so as to make sure you don't bite off more than you can chew, and then grind, grind, and grind some more.  Then you curb-stomp a quest boss when you can be bothered.\n\nYou have four skills per character, and basically pick one or two to min-max, and use basically exclusively for the entire length of the game.  Since your potential actions are so limited in combat, the differences between one fight and the next are negligible... if you're even fighting different enemies at all, since uneven challenge and reward schedules tend to reward players heavily for fighting the same pack of creatures in droves until you're ready to leapfrog half a dozen levels to the next cash cow.  A special "rug" for auto-battling basically means this game becomes something to press "start" on, then come back to later to reset another battle.  The only real thing to do outside of battles is to buy things, so there isn't much to break the monotony.\n\nKinghts of Pen and Paper is a decent concept, but it just doesn't engage the player enough for me to give this a good recommendation.","September 7, 2014","false","15.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

You can experience D&D-style gameplay without having to break out dice, charts, pencils, and painted figures, and it really makes it much easier to immerse yourself into the game. With the deluxe edition, you get SO many awesome new items and references to play with, including furniture such as THE TARDIS from Doctor Who, 800 gold coins and starting buff items, and even a new player character that makes a powerful magic user! I'd honestly buy the game just for that.\n\nSo many different players-class combinations to choose from that could either make the game difficult or easy, and it's so much fun to try different combos!\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG games, humor, and gaming/television references!","September 28, 2014","true","27.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I found an exploit though that makes it easier to double the amount of grindstones you get. When you start the game to the east of the starting town is a cave where you can mine grindstones. When you click on one and the dice rolls up you need 6 or higher to get the grindstone. The key here is after clicking on the ore deposit just start pressing spacebar because once the dice stops rolling and you do or don't get the grindstone the act of pressing spacebar triggers the dice to reroll giving you another chance to get a grindstone. I went from getting around 10 grindstones every minute to around 20-25 grindstones in the same amount of time.","January 23, 2014","true","15.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It doesn't just take a sledgehammer to it or anything, it demolishes that wall and lets you view a weird (but amusing) hybrid of a pen-and-paper RPG with the characters as well.\n\nVisually the game manages to hold it's unique touch, even on the PC platform. Music also does fairly well at making itself memorable in terms of it's melody but to some it could get extremely repetitive over time.\n\nWhile this game does have an in-game-store with which you can buy "gold" (the game's currency for getting buffs and permanent benefits, but the gold is just as easily earned by playing making the in-game-store a bit useless except to those who are extremely impatient.\n\nThe game can be a great time waster for people wanting to poke a little fun at the D&D genre and has taken a good number of hours from me. Without the timed waits that the mobile version has, this is a much better build that just lets you play without interference.","August 6, 2013","true","7.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

At first it was interesting in the simplicity and style, yet as the game progresses it feel immensely tedious.  There will be quests where you are required to go from one location to another and have to fight at each step along the way, sometimes up to five or six battles.  Then once you arrive the quest is to slay a number of monsters repeatedly.  The endgame seems almost unfair, requiring a lot of grinding unless you spend a lot of time exploring sidequests.  Based on the price, I think the game has a niche in the category of game where you advance through it periodically while taking a break from other games.  Could improvements be made? Absolutely, but for an indie title with some creative 4th wall shattering, it serves it's place decently.","December 25, 2013","true","19.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The second strike is that the massive amounts of heat are going to waste doing nothing at high speeds - the game is irritatingly slow at times, and I used CheatEngine to double KPP+1's speed to get it to a tolerable level. In-app purchases are the third strike leading me to conclude: KPP+1 is a bad game.

Not the style of RPG that I've really had much experience with so for me this was a bit of an experiment. I digress, a simple and smooth game that's easy to get into. I found it a little odd that my rogue has an attack almost double that of my warrior but that's pretty much the only issue I've had.

The parody of the traditional D&D scenario is wonderful and the humor is very self aware. The references are tasteful and abundant but not overly so that they obscure the story.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone lacking the means, friends or who's simply as antisocial as myself to actually play D&D (not a bad thing) to give this a go if you are interested in that sort of thing.","May 25, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It includes some gold and stuff, but mainly a village thats GREAT for grinding xp in the early parts of the game.\nAnyway, heres my thoughts:\nSound: The soundtrack isn't bad, pretty much what you'd expect in an rpg game, I do occasionally get sick of the looping song. However, the boss music is awesome and intense.\nGraphics: The graphics rock, It's all pixel art and it looks awesome!\nGameplay: The gameplay is pretty simple, but its also fun and at times, hilarious. The basic idea is your a bunch of people playing a game like dungeons and dragons in a basement. You choose your characters race (Pizza guy, jock, nerd etc) and class (cleric warrior paladin mage etc) and start playing. As you level up you will unlock and upgrade your different skills. There are plenty of fun items to find and equip, and I also joy at leveling up. Not only can you  buy ingame items, you can buy furniture, new tables, and snacks and drinks for the basement that your ACTUALLY playing the game in for buffs in the game. Pretty funny if you ask me. The game is very fun to play overall, even though at times, the missions feel a bit similar.\nOverall I would give this game a 8.7 out of 10.","October 18, 2013","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I eagerly awaited the final battle, hoping to get the "finish campaign within 365 days" achievement. So, there I was, facing the final boss battle and (at the second attempt) gloriously winning it -- only to find out, that, ooops, that was not the final battle yet because that cowardly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a final boss (name redacted to avoid spoilers) had the guts (or lack thereof) to rather run away than die. Oh well, guess it's just a few more quests until I find that fool again and finish him for good.\n\nThree hours later: Here I am, weapons sharpened and ready to let him meet his fate. Which he does. Except, the campaign is not over, because he was not the real final boss. Alright, a few more quests -- we are having day 500 by now -- and then the campaign must be over any time soon, because there's that achievement that says it is doable in 365 days and I haven't done any side quests.\n\nAnother five hours later: I fought my way through hordes of enemies who somehow start looking all the same to me. It's the same old drill, every single fight: Power up the paladin's shield, let the druid send a few to sleep, let the cleric and warrior weaken the rest, and let the mage finish them off with meteroids. ("Rocks fall, everyone dies!") I'm starting to consider writing a bot for clicking these same old buttons over and over again. I start detesting the painfully slow animation of travelling between locations which I am sure is only so slow because in an earlier version of the game there must have been an in-game-payment option to make it faster. But oh well, here we go: That's the ultimate final final battle, and then the campaign is finished.\n\nAlas, it isn't. Because there's just this one more final enemy, who is level 70 and I'm level 50, and I've done all side quests by now, so now all that's left to do is grinding by fighting even more of the same repetitive battles over and over again and again and again and again until I'm ready to face that final(?) boss.\n\nThat's the point at which I decided to give up and go to sleep, so I don't know if that at least would have been the final battle.\n\nThree weeks later I returned to the game to continue -- only to find my save game deleted by a malfunctioning patch (see forum). That's the final straw for me -- I'm uninstalling this and will not come back.","October 24, 2015","false","18.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not the style of RPG that I've really had much experience with so for me this was a bit of an experiment. I digress, a simple and smooth game that's easy to get into. I found it a little odd that my rogue has an attack almost double that of my warrior but that's pretty much the only issue I've had. Of course there's grinding... and then some more grinding\n\nOh I'm sorry did you think you were done? Guess what!?\n\nMORE GRINDING\n\nBut that's what you sign up for with these games, you have to be prepared for it and I have to say, it pays off. The parody of the traditional D&D scenario is wonderful and the humor is very self aware. The references are tasteful and abundant but not overly so that they obscure the story.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone lacking the means, friends or who's simply as antisocial as myself to actually play D&D (not a bad thing) to give this a go if you are interested in that sort of thing.","May 25, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It had a nice aesthetic, nice music, and it was from a small studio. Had I been aware that this was an iOS app before it was a PC game, I might've been more wary. The first couple hours went by relatively nicely, but after that, not so much.\n\nIf you buy the Deluxe Edition DLC, you get the Magika Wizard, a character with a better passive skill advantage than most other (see next point) characters. Around level 15, you unlock the Developer Player Characters, self-inserts that have even better passives, making whatever current party you're using seem feeble in comparison.\n\nAlso around this time, you'll notice your strength isn't getting you as far as it did in the beginning, so you go to buy gear. Only, the blacksmith, by default, has a 30-some percent chance at actually crafting the item you pay him for. So, either you toss bags of money at the him, praying that he succeeds (because of course he doesn't reimburse you), or you get grindstones, items that let you "level him up". It takes around 2000 grindstones at 25 gold apiece to have him reach 100%. That's 50,000 gold. At level 15, you might gain 200 per fight.\n\nOh, but what's this? You can buy gold in-game for real money! Of course you can. Sadly, this game really was designed as a cash-hungry iOS game first and foremost. 4/10, for the initial hour or two of fun before the grind.","January 23, 2014","false","5.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Uses dice roll to determine things such as crafting chance,battles,etc.\n\nIf you like games you can play 5min-1hr + at a time,do not mind grind , a pop culture heavy comedic story, and little varation in gameplay then pick it up on sale, or in a bundle. I would not pay full price,just does not feel like a $10 game , more like a $2.50-$5 one.\n\nRegular Review:\nThe game itself is a comedic sort of table top dice roll turned into a video game.The dialog trees,characters, and the story have comedy all throughout them. The game has tons of pop culture references from 1970s- onward in both enemies,outfits and dialog.\n\nGameplay mechanic wise you pretty much fight turn based fight your way through all the quests you do.There is hardly any variation in the quests escort,item fetch/deliever,rescue, and fight/slay. They incorporate you grind fighting your way through.There are no puzzles or anything so do not expect much outsite of witty dialog and fights.\n\nItems in the game are what you would expect, consumables with stat buffs that last for a certain time.Weapons/armor are not sold but are upgraded by blacksmiths.They are only found in towns as well as item purchases.There are different character classes each with 4 skills that you can level up individually.When you decide what character classes you want you have to pick a person whom hs their on special stat they add to be that class.You can swap in and out character classes that you level up when you are at towns with taverns.\n\nThe game can be played for 5min- 1hr+ depending on how much grinding and story you are willing to play through. There is a NG+ when you beat the game to continue on your adventures which resets all the quests making the mobs tougher at the beginning onward.\n\nMy final verdict on this game is if you do not mind the grind,it is a enjoyable title.Its simple yet to the point.I played it in spurts and had fun playing it.Its deffinately not for everyone but no game out there is.Get it on sale or in a bundle, not worth $10 to me more like $2.50-$5 game.Not for lack of content,more for lack of variations in quests and gameplay mechanics.","February 1, 2014","true","45.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

In fact, I got hooked into it to the point I play it instead of Clash of Clans (if I'm not already playing Geometry Dash).\n\nIt's so satisfying to be able to have a Dungeons-and-Dragons-like game in my pocket that I can bring anywhere and play at anytime.\nThe mechanics aren't groundbreaking, but it's included everything that I've forgotten to consider as a Dungeon Master.\n\nThe story's full of references to our gaming culture, but towards the end of the game, I felt that the story died after the "you have to save the world" bit... And the grind to the higher levels seemed impossible.\n(I mean come on... I've finished all the quests elsewhere and all my characters are only Level 37, despite having to beat Level 50-60 bosses which naturally one-shot them all, and getting gold becomes impossible without having to repeat near-death dungeons as farming lower down becomes more and more redundant as you level up since the bosses are the only thing that actually yields descent (more than 40) gold.)\n\nThe only other problem with this game is (only applies to the Android version)...

You are playing a game about a bunch of gamers playing D&D\nA few obvious jokes and references and things start out pretty well.\nThe sound, music, graphics, they all lend themselves pretty well.\nBut the grind, jeez! This is a single player game! Who thought that...\nConverted mobile app with a cash shop in the mobile version? Ooooooooooooooooh\n\nI don't need to say much more really. As far as converted mobile games go its actually really well ported. But the play time is so artifically padded that you probably will not complete the game.\nA sequel has been announced and I hope and pray it addresses the flaws this game has or even just does away with the excessive grinding for the inevitable PC port.\n\nI know some smartass will reply that this is an RPG and you are supposed to grind but this isn't 1997 anymore. Games like Bravely Default, like Magic Fantasy Battle 4, have come along and said 'listen, there is grinding but we streamlined it or we made it fun.'\n\nI stopped caring about the storyline the 8th time I was told to backtrack for excuse reasons. I especially stopped caring when my Lv32 Barbarian, with maxed equipment, wearing 4 +9attack items, still can't one shot a friggen spider!\nI especially was agitated that a newer version of this game was released that I can't simply upgrade too, or even buy apprently since steam says 'you already own that game' when clearly I don't.\n\nFlaws aside the game is enjoyable in short bursts which is fitting given its mobile phone roots. It was ported to the PC and no real effort was made to make it a more PC friendly game. Instead its dull, repetitive and boring.\nAlso the achievement, beat in 365 (game)days, is unachievable it seems.

Which is not a bad thing. Not a ton of skills, but combat is relatively satisfying. Graphics are weak but if you like classic console games you'll feel at home. As you play you unlock additional classes, though unfortunately those classes start at level 1, which makes playing with them frustrating. Grinding is a requirement unfortunately. Sometimes random quests unlock more meaningful quests, and everything has interesting dialog, so that's cool. The story is pretty good, the idea of playing a game about playing a game is well done.","August 18, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has been ported well to the PC, and the gameplay, again, although simplistic, has that "one-more-go" aura around it.\nIt does have in-game purchases, but you can play the game without paying any more than the initial money you bought the game for. You just need to do a bit of grinding. The good news is that you can earn quite a lot of money from completing the quests.\nThe design of the game is that of gamers sat around a table and gaming their little RPG hearts out. It's endearing, nostalgic and very retro at the same time.\nIf you have more than a passing aquaintance with rolling dice and role playing, get this game. It's quite frequently on sale and has been in Humble bundles before. Catch it then, and get sucked into it's time sink.","August 30, 2014","true","15.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Tne story involves a group of good ol' table-top rpg players trying to define the thin line that separates the game fro reality. It is a turn-based RPG where you choose what kind of adventurers you want in your group and level their character sheets as you would in a traditional table-top RPG, with dice rolls and everything. The story is the main selling point of the game and it does have its' own little charm to it, I did laugh at most of the jokes, though some of them fall a bit flat (it is mostly reference-based humour). There's a lot of text to go through, so it is not recommended for people who like to skip most of the dialogue in games. Good for playing if you have a bit of time on your hands, however I would not recommend it for "hardcore" players - they might be disappointed with the combat system (which is a bit simplistic and does not involve a lot of management) and find the game too repetitive. The progress does feel rewarding, however, there is quite a high level of grinding involved which should be taken into consideration. The art style and character design match the tone of the game well and the simple animation feels natural. The music could be better, after some time it can get a bit repetitive.\nOverall - I do like the game and I do recommend it if you are just looking for a little time waster.","December 15, 2013","true","36.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In the game, you play as a group of friends, getting together to play Dungeons & Dragons. You're not just picking classes, but picking which "real life" person is playing the characters in game. Want grandma to be the paladin on your team? No problem! Think your little brother would be best suited as a stealthy rogue? You can do that too. Although the character creation is as simple as matching an archetype to a class (like Hipster Mage or Pizza Guy Druid), it's pretty fun and gives the game replayability as you want to experiment with different combinations.\n\nThe storyline is light, but definitely will bring back memories to anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons in their lives. You travel through towns like "Journey Village" and battle monsters to save missing kings in a world full of pop culture references. It might be a bit silly if you're looking for a serious RPG, but if you love the classic turn-based battle style of the early Final Fantasy games, you'll at least appreciate the simple awesomeness of the gameplay. It's also hugely accessible and easy to learn for those who've never played that kinda game before.\n\nYou'll get the most out of this if you're just a huge RPG fan, because Knights of Pen and Paper relies a lot on nostalgia. Still, it's a really fun RPG that can eat up many hours of your life in a very satisfying way. It's a really good example of what indie game companies are capable of. Oh, and if you complain about the graphics, I have a fist to shake at you.","July 8, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You play as a group of roleplayers sitting around a table, going on an adventure led by a dungeon master. No, really. The DM is actually there, narrating the quest. It’s a really unique RPG in its presentation, though not so much in its gameplay, which is a rather simple turn-based battle system.\n\nThe simplicity owes to the game's origins on mobile platforms, and this is why recommending KoPP is complicated for me: It still plays exactly like a mobile game, much better suited for playing in small intervals. Understandably, a lot of people don't expect that from a $10 PC game. If it was the same price as the mobile version ($3), maybe it could get away with its lack of depth. Not for this price.\n\nIt's also worth noting that there are microtransactions in the game. [Update: Not anymore. As of patch 2.09 (2014/02/14), they have been removed from the game.]. Also, some achievements are broken, and won't be fixed for a while. [Update: Also fixed in patch 2.09, I was able to obtain all of them.]\n\nYou may be wondering why I recommend the game after all. Very simple. I still enjoyed it. I'd play it while watching a stream or something, when I wanted to unwind and avoid ultra-complex games. In a way, I went through it with the mobile mindset, and this is the case in which I'd recommend KoPP, if you want a simple game.\n\nJust don't get it for full price, even if you really want it. It's not worth it. Wait for a sale of at least 50% off.","January 22, 2014","true","38.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The mechanics are pretty decent, and I like that it's got a DND type feel to it (not to mention the excellent dialog!) but it really just feels like a cellphone game that was ported over to PC and shoved out the door.  I just feel like they could have done a better job with it.\n\nIt's slightly too simplistic for my taste, but when I play it, it does scratch a turn based itch that I get from time to time.  Probably not worth full price, but if you see it on sale it might be worth picking up.

You play as a group of roleplayers sitting around a table, going on an adventure led by a dungeon master. No, really. The DM is actually there, narrating the quest. It’s a really unique RPG in its presentation, though not so much in its gameplay, which is a rather simple turn-based battle system.\n\nThe simplicity owes to the game's origins on mobile platforms, and this is why recommending KoPP is complicated for me: It still plays exactly like a mobile game, much better suited for playing in small intervals. Understandably, a lot of people don't expect that from a $10 PC game. If it was the same price as the mobile version ($3), maybe it could get away with its lack of depth. Not for this price.\n\nIt's also worth noting that there are microtransactions in the game. [Update: Not anymore. As of patch 2.09 (2014/02/14), they have been removed from the game.]. Also, some achievements are broken, and won't be fixed for a while. [Update: Also fixed in patch 2.09, I was able to obtain all of them.]\n\nYou may be wondering why I recommend the game after all. Very simple. I still enjoyed it. I'd play it while watching a stream or something, when I wanted to unwind and avoid ultra-complex games. In a way, I went through it with the mobile mindset, and this is the case in which I'd recommend KoPP, if you want a simple game.\n\nJust don't get it for full price, even if you really want it. It's not worth it. Wait for a sale of at least 50% off.","January 22, 2014","true","38.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There should be a little bit more side quests to keep up with needs of new monsters. That's why I didn't finish the game.

The music is also one of the best parts of the game, with a pixelated style that reminds me of old-school western RPG with a battle theme as addictive as that of any Final Fantasy game.\nOverall this is probably the most genuine fun I've had with an RPG in a long time, and easily one of my best finds/purchases.","December 4, 2013","true","6.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game is chock full of little gags, from visual ones in the background to quotes and characters. The gameplay itself is solid and is a lot of fun. There are times where you do have to grind but that's standard issue for an rpg and if you dislike that then there are very few rpg's I would or could recommend.\n\nI have no issues with this game... With one exception, the in game microtransactions. You can avoid them quite easily, but it irks me that it is still included in a game I had to pay for in the first place. Either be free and have microtransactions or paid and not have them not paid and have them, that's just underhanded. That being said it's actually really easy to get around. If your main team dies just create a new one and any coins they earn will be shared between the different playthroughs.\n\nThere's also a new game + mode but it doesn't really add anything except the monsters being more difficult.\n\nI would highly recommend this game but I would also wait for it to appear in a steam sale.","April 15, 2014","true","36.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However it boils down to very shallow RPG that's comparable to some of the original GameBoy's launch titles.\n\nYou select a premade character, there's no way to customize their look but you do get to distribute points to their character sheets. Each of the 10 classes only has 4 abilities, and that is counting their passives. Damage is either magical or physical, no breakdowns within such as fire, slashing, holy, etc.  You'll quickly find others to join your party and unlock new classes to choose from.\n\nAn interesting feature is that when a battle starts you choose what type of enemies appear and how many there are, you're the dungeon master as well as the player. You'll probably want to have a tank in your party to taunt, and at least one area of effect damage dealer, along with a healer, and maybe a single target damager to mop up the rough edges and elites. Extremely basic tactics here.\n\nThe unlockables were nice (they were previously microtransactions but changed in this mobile to Steam port to be bought only with in game gold), but they make the game far too easy. Even with the cheats off don't expect a challege here. But you'll probably get some laughs and have fun, especially if you've ever put hours into any RPG.

For the SAME GAME.\nJust for this, I wouldn't reccommend buying it from Steam on principle, as even though it is a brillian game, it is still only a mobile android app. On PC.\nNow I got this game with a Humble Bundle, so assuming I paid the £1.99 for it, I can certainly say it was worth it.\n\nI think my first runthrough took approx 12 hours, that wasn't rushed but it wasn't lazed either, so even if you where to pay £7.99, it still has more play time then most £40 hit title campaigns.\n\nIn the game you take control of 5 people role playing in a board RPG pretty much, and without going into to much detail, it's like playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons with amusing characters and dungeonmaster.\nThe missions are reasonably simple, and if you complete the entire campaign in a day, like me, then it does get somewhat repetitive by the end, though if you actually have a life and pace it out a bit more, you may not find this the same.\n\nThe game is FULL of references, there are pointers to Star Wars, Pokemon, Sponge Bob Square Pants, TMNT, Final Fantasy, Mario and much much more, almost every five minutes I would see something and be amazed at how many references they have fit in there.\n\nThat is everything, and if you are reading this and the Humble Bundle PC & Android Bundle 9 is still on (It is until 14/04/14) then go and get it, as it is worth it.","April 6, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game is chock full of little gags, from visual ones in the background to quotes and characters. The gameplay itself is solid and is a lot of fun. There are times where you do have to grind but that's standard issue for an rpg and if you dislike that then there are very few rpg's I would or could recommend.\n\nI have no issues with this game... With one exception, the in game microtransactions. You can avoid them quite easily, but it irks me that it is still included in a game I had to pay for in the first place. Either be free and have microtransactions or paid and not have them not paid and have them, that's just underhanded. That being said it's actually really easy to get around. If your main team dies just create a new one and any coins they earn will be shared between the different playthroughs.\n\nThere's also a new game + mode but it doesn't really add anything except the monsters being more difficult.\n\nI would highly recommend this game but I would also wait for it to appear in a steam sale.","April 15, 2014","true","36.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Why? It's just full of charm, funny little cultural references and has a pretty good amount of content. However combat gets very boring as each class has 4 abilities, one of which is just a passive for 80-90% of the classes. So you largely spam the same 1-2 abilities, with the rare use (sometimes once a fight later on) of a 3rd ability, and sometimes a basic attack.\n\nOther gripe is upgrading items at the blacksmith. Farming grindstones takes forever after the 1st or 2nd upgrade for him. However if you want upgrades without spending ALL of your gold, you need to gather dozens of these at a time for a 5-10% increase in chance of succesfully forging an item. Don't even bother trying unless you're at about 60% success, because you can waste almost all your gold upgrading one or two items. It's a shame because this could have been a really fun and important mechanic, but feels really forced. The only way to get grindstones is travel to caves, and hopefully roll a high enough number for each ore vein present, or spend 25 G a piece. As I said though this can take ALOT of grindstones and buying that amount can really add up in early-midgame as gold generally isnt earned fast. Battles (depending on bonuses of items you have and what you are fighting) generally drop 1-20 gold.\n\nThe blacksmith, repetive fighting and slow accumlation of gold are painfully dull or even annoying. However, the concept, dialogue, references, simplicity and music keep it entertaining enough to play for 20 or so minutes at a time.","April 20, 2014","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's plenty to love in designing your own D&D room, then using all the bonuses in the game world when you start playing. I can see this used to be a "pay-to-win" sort of game, but thankfully that's been taken out so it's all good now.\n\nAs far as style and identity, this game has NONE of it's own. Every creature, every location, virtually every screen and character and bit of dialogue is pulled from somewhere else. The temples are marked with nintendo controllers. Gonzo and Rizzo (muppets) are aliens. There are Chozo (metriod) statues and dancing skeletons and everything in between. This game is a giant cluster-(blank) of references, both of the pop-culture and video game history variety. While this IS charming, it does get old after a while. There's a difference between a cute little nod towards another game, and just building your ENTIRE GAME around references.\n\nTDLR:\n+It's very, very fun and cute for a quick laugh. (excellent price)\n+It's a solid turn-based RPG that'll tickle your nostalgia bone.\n+20-25hr campaign with tons of unlockables.\n+/-The ENTIRE GAME is nothing but references to other games and geek culture.\n+/- Low difficulty, okay replay value.\n-Some achievements are needlessly grindy. (Complete 50 dungeons, wee!)\n-Some achievements are badly bugged. 1-3 of them simply don't work or don't work as intended.\n\n\nIs it worth getting? If you're ingrained in nerd culture and can grasp all the nintendo, Doctor Who and other references-- its more than worth it's price tag.

I wanted to love this game, I really did. I've been fascinated with it ever since I first heard about the idea of playing an RPG about an RPG and I did manage to avoid paying full price (Steam sale or Humble Bundle, can't remember which anymore), but after about 6 hours with this game, I just gave up. The story was bad, the writing was bad, the gameplay was cool at first but devolved into being bad by way of mindlessly repetitive (as soon as I had 4 worthwhile party members [balance is another issue with the game, honestly] I found myself unconsciously falling into a pattern of using the same attacks every time because it was pretty much a guaranteed win), the humour (read: pop-culture references) is outdated and forced... The graphics are very nice, though. There's something to be said for well-done 8-bit pixel art. I'd say something about the soundtrack here, but after a while I just turned it off and played my own music. I felt that it added more to the "game about a game" experience than generic chiptunes, honestly. I mean, if I were running a game of D&D, I'd probably be playing power metal, not NES soundtracks.\n\nBottom Line: If you're midly curious, skip it. If you absolutely HAVE to play this game, at least wait until a sale or something. The game deserves some attention for its unique premise, but it's just not worth the full price.

There's a lot of customization for the characters as well.  I got this on sale for $2, but I'd say it's worth the full price.  I can see myself playing this game for a long time.","June 26, 2014","true","35.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story could not be more classic: two to five heroes find themselves in a dungeon, have to escape and then save the kingdom from something dark and evil. It's not the story, though, that really drives KoPaP: as the description says, it's a meta-roleplaying experience with a fair bit of comedy in it. The Dungeon Master and the players are themselves on-screen, and will sometimes make little quips about the D&D system, the campaign story, the enemies and so on.\nOther than the humor, the game offers some nice challenges, nineteen possible players (five of which are unlocked after a quest in the main campaign) to choose from, and different classes to assign them at the start of the campaign (again, some classes are initially unavaillable). All in good ol' D&D-style, complete with dice rolls to verify success or failure in certain task or during travel to decide whether a random encounter occurs.","June 22, 2014","true","41.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wanted to love this game, I really did. I've been fascinated with it ever since I first heard about the idea of playing an RPG about an RPG and I did manage to avoid paying full price (Steam sale or Humble Bundle, can't remember which anymore), but after about 6 hours with this game, I just gave up. The story was bad, the writing was bad, the gameplay was cool at first but devolved into being bad by way of mindlessly repetitive (as soon as I had 4 worthwhile party members [balance is another issue with the game, honestly] I found myself unconsciously falling into a pattern of using the same attacks every time because it was pretty much a guaranteed win), the humour (read: pop-culture references) is outdated and forced... The graphics are very nice, though. There's something to be said for well-done 8-bit pixel art. I'd say something about the soundtrack here, but after a while I just turned it off and played my own music. I felt that it added more to the "game about a game" experience than generic chiptunes, honestly. I mean, if I were running a game of D&D, I'd probably be playing power metal, not NES soundtracks.\n\nBottom Line: If you're midly curious, skip it. If you absolutely HAVE to play this game, at least wait until a sale or something. The game deserves some attention for its unique premise, but it's just not worth the full price.

Everything about it has an old-school feel that blends tabletop RPGs with NES graphics.  There is a lot of grinding in this game, but that's what RPGs are about.  You choose your initial characters from an assortment of people who each have their own unique bonuses, then pick a class for them based on those bonuses and what you want in your party.\n\nIf you make challenging enough fights, they require a bit of strategy.  My paladin typically casts a shield to reduce damage by 50%, then increases his threat to draw attention, while my rogue stuns people for 3 turns (thanks to items I have that extend the time by 2 turns).  My mage will either AoE the entire group or fireball for a burning DoT.  My cleric has a powerful single heal, decent group heal, an offensive move called smite, and a debuff on 3 enemy's attack strength.  My newest addition, the berserker, goes berserk (I can't choose his targets but he gains extra damage and regen) and has passives/equipment that boost his crit rate above 30% while also allowing him to heal for 63% of his total damage.  And those are just my 5 classes, there's quite a few more to unlock as you play.\n\nThe grinding part comes in two forms.  You'll find yourself moving back and forth to caves often to get grindstones to upgrade your blacksmith.  You'll also want to fight a lot, and grind quests to earn gold.  Gold can be spent buying yourself some equipment at the blacksmith, or on a whole bunch of upgrades to the room you play in, the table you play on, etc.  Purchases made will give your party bonuses, such as higher RNG die rolls, more gold/exp, boosted stats, regen, etc.\n\nThere's always something to do in this game.  It can be tedious at times, but the humor of the game, including comments from the game master and party members help to ease this.  Overall, I think it would be a worthy addition to anyone's library who is a fan of old school RPGs.","December 11, 2014","true","13.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But I wouldn't have bought it otherwise. The game was supposed to be retro and amusing but turned into a horrible grind. A really *grindy* grind. It was cute for a while but then quickly got annoying... and the pop-culture references have been done to death.\n\nThe quests often were "Kill 7 of X then come back" or "Collect 7-12 drops from Y then come back" and there were a few examples where you had do it that 4 times in a row. You have to pay gold to walk between locations, so it feels like you're questing on a Monopoly board; "Go south 2, kill 7, come back" or "Escort 5 spaces East, get attacked every step, come back" while you are paying each way. Dumb.\n\nThe little dungeon system... is annoying. You can't rest or run away from a fight or it boots you out and you have to do the whole dungeon again. You have to wander around to find the key for the boss fight, taking damage from fights or traps 75% of the time. Who does that? Who is going to spend time to do 10-50 of those for the achievement?

I haven't played enough of it, only 3.5 hours of the game, from what I know, I got the original version and not the "digital deluxe" I reccomend you get this otherwise, you'll have to do about 1 hour of grinding in order to reach it. In 3.5 hours I've created two saves which include characters level 11/12. Its fairly challenging to level up and its meant to give a nostalgic feel to the game which is why the graphics are pixel art. Problem I find, people pay £8 or $15 to only spend more money to get your coins, you dont necessarily have to buy it, I would do it because grinding is repetitive and mind-blowingly boring. People should pay money for games to not have to spend more money. Thats what F2P games are for. Thats how they get their money not games you spend a fair bit on only to spend more. Thats my complaint, Peace. a weak six or a strong five is my score, I feel I wont exceed 25 hours of gameplay on this game.

Unfortunately, they left out the game part of D&D.\n\nEssentially, this game is trying to be a humorous game. It's not one you play for a challenge or for fun, but to laugh at. Unfortunately, there are only so many jokes, and there's lots of battling that must be done to go forward. Typically, you'll spend at least ten minutes battling before the next joke or reference, and there's still no guarantee you'll even find it funny.\n\nThat might be acceptable if battling was any fun, but unfortunately, it isn't. Every enemy in the game (at least those that I saw) does the exact same thing: Attack on their turn. There is literally nothing to react to except damage. To make matters worse, once you reach level 5 and unlock each of your skills, you can kiss any sense of progression goodbye, since every subsequent level only grants more stat-ups and numerical upgrades to said skills. As for loot and gear, the fun is sucked out of that too; while loot often drops, you have access to a store that sells pretty much any gear you could ever need, so if you're halfway intelligent about visiting it, any loot that drops will always be inferior vendor trash.\n\nLastly, the game is OBSCENELY grindy. This is the level of grind I would expect from an poorly-made free MMO. Doing almost anything in the game costs coins; often a lot of them. And there are two ways to get coins: A) Win battles, or B) Buy them with real money.","January 22, 2014","false","5.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The actual concept of a fun D&D like experience of Knights of Pen and Paper sounds fun and gives it a nice charm to it, but it's simply put down by extremely simple and boring battle mechanics, proceding to follow by annoying dice rolls that become much more of an annoyance then an actual Tabletop game, extreme grinding to the point of just annoyance, and the fact that this game isn't simply something to play a long session on just doesn't give it a justifiable pricetag that's way too expensive for it's own good. It works as a fun mobile game, and I really love the charm and such, but it's still isn't enough to warrant such a purchase of 10 dollars.\n\nI don't know, maybe I am judging it a bit too much, after all, it's roots were from a mobile game. I wouldn't recommend playing this game to many people (Particularly those who don't like mobile games and their microtransaction-like models), but if you like something that can be played in short bursts, is quirky, and simple, this game is for you.","March 10, 2015","false","12.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

If you have played some dungeon&dragons-like games in the past, it will bring fond memories. Some of the phrases and quips of the characters are spot on, and it all brings you back to that D&D atmosphere very well.\n\nThe game principles are quite simple, there is a number of characters, each character has 4 skills, you can loot or buy wearable items and consumables, you can upgrade your weapons. Battles are turn-based, one action per turn. Simple, but also enjoyable and sufficient to help you enjoy yet another D&D adventure.\n\nThe questing is well done, there is a main story line, but in any place you have a set of pre-created generic side quests that you can activate at any moment in order to gain more experience or items. You can also set up a custom fight any time. When setting up a fight, you choose how many and which creatures you're going to fight with, and the reward reflects that. I very much like this approach.\n\nThere are a few dungeons in the game, which force you to stock up some healing items in the inventory if you want to explore it all, survive, and kill the boss. Again, similar to the D&D theme.\n\nThere is good humor in the game, I liked it. After some hours it gets a bit repetitive, but it doesn't hold you up. The music is a bit more of a problem, there are just a few songs in the game, so it gets old quickly. A few more songs would be nice.\n\nPlease note I've played this game on an Android tablet, not a PC, so I'm seeing this in a bit different perspective. The greatest benefit of this game for me was that it is an enjoyable game that can easily be played in a public transport during commuting, therefore offline and turn-based. This is an ideal game for your phone or tablet. If you intend to play this on PC, you might expect a bit more complex game mechanics, because you're fully concentrated on the game and you have a big screen. In that case, my opinion might not apply that well.\n\nHighly recommended, especially if you plan to play this on a mobile device (not the Steam version, though, of course).","January 13, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The second is the pixel art, which is sumptious and extremely well done.\n\nThis is a light and amusing game, paying homage to tabletop RPGs and early 90s cRPGs. If you have reservations in respect of the gold buying facility which is apparently a feature of the tablet versions, it is disabled in the PC version. At first I found the concept a little too meta and self-referential, but the humour grew on me to the point where I found myself laughing and recalling real pen and paper sessions where the GM and players said almost exactly the same things the characters in game were saying.\n\nIf you are trying for full completion of achievements, keep in mind that your gold is common between all your saved games, so you can accumulate a good amount of reserves to equip the uber party you create for the 365/465 day completion achieve. This is probably the most elusive while the similarly rare 50 dungeon complete achieve requires no particular strategy except an appetite for doing the same thing over and over again. I've found resetting or upgrading a party which has completed the game and replaying the content at a higher level to be the best way of accumulating gold for such an attempt.\n\nWait for a decent sale price and you will get at least 25hrs of entertainment for a reasonable sum.","January 14, 2015","true","47.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This retro style RPG does an amazing job at bringing both the experience of a DnD session and a 90's style JRPG to you with plenty of toungue-in-cheek, modern humor to liven things up.  The classes are all very interesting and provide you with many unique ways to play their skills off of each other.  Battles are quickly paced and fairly designed; if you lose it's your fault.  If I had any critisism at it would be that the game is easier than it should be.  Granted, I grew up in the 90's so I'm a grizzled, RPG veteren at this point but I would still say a small difficulty spike would have raised this game to even greater heights.\n\nIf you have even a smidge of love for Pen and Paper style role play this game is a must purchase.","January 6, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KlerikalFortress/recommended/231740/","KlerikalFortress","WG4575","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KlerikalFortress/","109 products in account","I think I've played this game enough to give a basic review on the aspects of the game. Now, I'm going to go ahead and say that I like the style of this game, so I may be a bit biased. However, that does not matter as I will still be honest with this game.\n\nMy reviews are typically divided into parts. Story, Gameplay, Music/Sounds, and Graphics. So let's get started!\n\nGraphics:\nI decided to start with graphics as they are the LEAST important when it comes to this review. This game is featured in 16 bit (I think) and looks quite good. In fact, you basically don't notice how old the graphics look after a while.\n\nStory:\nThe story of this game is very simple. You are a adventurer. More specifically, you are a D&D player playing a character. You get to create your characters in this game, so you can mix and match until you find the ultimate party! You start with only two members at your table. However, you can pay gold to add three more party members. Each class has a different role. Paladin is the tank. Cleric is the healer. Mage is the support/dps and rogue is the 100% pure blood DPS. After you select your party members and their roles, you start by having your DM tell you that you are in a dark dungeon with no recollection of what happened to you previously. Now, I really don't want to spoil anymore, as fans of D&D (myself included) will have a very fun time with this game.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game features a turn-based system using "initiative", a real D&D mechanic. Initiative is rolled to see who gets to attack first. Say your character and an ogre were about to have a fight. Your character rolls a 15. The ogre rolls a 9. Therefore, you would get to go first, as you have the higher number. Not only is this game ROLLING in D&D references, it has it's own unique style. Locations are intresting, characters are hilarious and dialogue kept me laughing the entire time. For example, early in the game you have to kill some rats. The DM says a girl walks up to the party. One of your party members will ask, "Is she hot?" and your DM replies, "Fine. Her charisma is 19." See what I'm saying? So many tabletop references! I guess that's expected. You can upgrade your characters stats using "table items" like food or drinks. There are permanent table items, including a BK crown (which allows you to fight 7 monsters at once) and the Holy Grail (which allows you to have 5 members at your table). There are also "room upgrades". For example, on the left side of your room, you can have a suit of armor, which gives you +20 health on every character until you change it. On the right side, you can have a fridge, which makes your table items last longer. You can change your tables too. The gold table gives you more gold. The rock table gives you a larger crit chance. This game is full of customization!\n\nMusic/Sounds:\nMusic and sounds are, like the graphics, designed in a 16 bit fashion, delivering some tunes I've been humming since the day I got the game. The title screen is my personal favorite though!\n\nOVERALL RATING:\nThis game is a fantastic game with a lot of comedy. Over all I'd give Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition a 10/10 for it's effort to contribute to the D&D society and give you some good laughs along the way!\n\nConclusion:\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review of Knights of Pen and Paper +1 Edition! The DLC for the game, Haunted Fall, is out now! I will be reviewing it once I get the chance to play the DLC! Cya next time folks!","January 6, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game takes itself lightly by breaking the fourth wall to the players of the game as well as the fourth wall to the person playing the game. The short time I've played this game makes me want to keep playing to see how the story fully pans out. The quality of the story so far (up to level 25) is quite good and is filled with humor and stereotypical quest missions. The missions can get repetitive if you don't customize the wave difficulty, I found that mechanic to be especially usefull in making the game more challenging. The upgrade mechanics are well rounded and I have found no problem with them. If you aren't a fan of the Turn Based games then this game is DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOU. But the fans of TBS and people who can appreciate the gamestyle, my favorite gamestyle is Wavedefense/Towerdefense, then this game offers alot to you. I have not been disapointed by this game at all.\n\nCost to Gameplay Ratio (.8 is an Okay ratio) : $10 - 6(+6 hours of completing the game fully)\nReplay Value: 9/10\nStory Quality: 6/10 (the story itself isn't so great but the small sidemissions and other things are great)\nHumor Value: 8/10\nTechnical Quality: 10/10\nGraphics Quality: 8/10 (it is in the pixel artstyle (did not subtract b/c of the pixel artsyle))\n\nOVERALL RATING: 8/10\n\nI purchased this game in a bundlestars bundle and I'm glad this game was in it, I didn't buy the bundle for this game at the time, but after playing it I would have been mad if I didn't purchase the bundle.","March 1, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am able to control a few characters on one table with clear cut differences between them.  It is simple enough for almost anyone to understand, and it is a pretty good game to play if you like indie, small time games.  It has a lot of exploration that I haven't done.  Even though you repeat quests a lot, the quests are different every time with different people.\n\nThe basis of the game is that you are playing against whatever the DM throws at you.  You are at your table, with your players and your classes they each encapsulate.  The classes are basic (Mage, Druid, Rogue, Warrior, Cleric, etc.) and the players themselves each have a special characteristic about them (the Jock has +? HP, the Alien regenrates +1 MP every turn, etc.).  It  Buying objects for the DM room, table, general location allows the players to get better points, experience, health, etc.  So instead of buffing singular characters, you are buffing all characters.  It's a fun game ultimately, and one that I will play frequently.\n\nIf you don't like pixelated gfxs, or table top scenarios at all, this might not be your cup of tea.","November 5, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I totally recommend this game to ANYBODY who had played D&D ever! It’s just a fun romp of the whole table top genre. It’s got so many background references that i started looking harder in areas that revised for anything that I missed. This game is totally worth getting.\n\nAs for gameplay, it’s really easy to figure out what is what. I figured everything out in the first 5 minutes. Unfortunately for those who haven't played D&D, it may be a little hard to understand what is what. (Considering this is steam, and its PC gamers we are talking about here: I’m pretty sure that it would be a safe bet to say that many, if not all, have done some version of D&D if not something similar.

I am able to control a few characters on one table with clear cut differences between them.  It is simple enough for almost anyone to understand, and it is a pretty good game to play if you like indie, small time games.  It has a lot of exploration that I haven't done.  Even though you repeat quests a lot, the quests are different every time with different people.\n\nThe basis of the game is that you are playing against whatever the DM throws at you.  You are at your table, with your players and your classes they each encapsulate.  The classes are basic (Mage, Druid, Rogue, Warrior, Cleric, etc.) and the players themselves each have a special characteristic about them (the Jock has +? HP, the Alien regenrates +1 MP every turn, etc.).  It  Buying objects for the DM room, table, general location allows the players to get better points, experience, health, etc.  So instead of buffing singular characters, you are buffing all characters.  It's a fun game ultimately, and one that I will play frequently.\n\nIf you don't like pixelated gfxs, or table top scenarios at all, this might not be your cup of tea.","November 5, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have played some dungeon&dragons-like games in the past, it will bring fond memories. Some of the phrases and quips of the characters are spot on, and it all brings you back to that D&D atmosphere very well.\n\nThe game principles are quite simple, there is a number of characters, each character has 4 skills, you can loot or buy wearable items and consumables, you can upgrade your weapons. Battles are turn-based, one action per turn. Simple, but also enjoyable and sufficient to help you enjoy yet another D&D adventure.\n\nThe questing is well done, there is a main story line, but in any place you have a set of pre-created generic side quests that you can activate at any moment in order to gain more experience or items. You can also set up a custom fight any time. When setting up a fight, you choose how many and which creatures you're going to fight with, and the reward reflects that. I very much like this approach.\n\nThere are a few dungeons in the game, which force you to stock up some healing items in the inventory if you want to explore it all, survive, and kill the boss. Again, similar to the D&D theme.\n\nThere is good humor in the game, I liked it. After some hours it gets a bit repetitive, but it doesn't hold you up. The music is a bit more of a problem, there are just a few songs in the game, so it gets old quickly. A few more songs would be nice.\n\nPlease note I've played this game on an Android tablet, not a PC, so I'm seeing this in a bit different perspective. The greatest benefit of this game for me was that it is an enjoyable game that can easily be played in a public transport during commuting, therefore offline and turn-based. This is an ideal game for your phone or tablet. If you intend to play this on PC, you might expect a bit more complex game mechanics, because you're fully concentrated on the game and you have a big screen. In that case, my opinion might not apply that well.\n\nHighly recommended, especially if you plan to play this on a mobile device (not the Steam version, though, of course).","January 13, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The second is the pixel art, which is sumptious and extremely well done.\n\nThis is a light and amusing game, paying homage to tabletop RPGs and early 90s cRPGs. If you have reservations in respect of the gold buying facility which is apparently a feature of the tablet versions, it is disabled in the PC version. At first I found the concept a little too meta and self-referential, but the humour grew on me to the point where I found myself laughing and recalling real pen and paper sessions where the GM and players said almost exactly the same things the characters in game were saying.\n\nIf you are trying for full completion of achievements, keep in mind that your gold is common between all your saved games, so you can accumulate a good amount of reserves to equip the uber party you create for the 365/465 day completion achieve. This is probably the most elusive while the similarly rare 50 dungeon complete achieve requires no particular strategy except an appetite for doing the same thing over and over again. I've found resetting or upgrading a party which has completed the game and replaying the content at a higher level to be the best way of accumulating gold for such an attempt.\n\nWait for a decent sale price and you will get at least 25hrs of entertainment for a reasonable sum.","January 14, 2015","true","47.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The conceit behind the game is that you are sitting at a table with your game master with a group of friends, and that you are going through a campaign. The players are indeed all seated around a table, with the game master on the far side of the table dictating what is going on. It is a very clever idea, but unfortunately the game fails to execute on it at all; instead, the game is a pure hack-and-slash fest which tries to spice things up with humor and gaming references but falls flat because, quite frankly, everyone sitting around a table has already not only made all of these references, but done it better. The plot is every bad game of D&D you've ever played, every unoriginal campaign rolled into one, and it is played straight - sure, one could argue that it is almost comically bad, but it is painfully bad, like Batman and Robin, rather than camp.\n\nAs the gameplay itself is thoroughly hack and slash, purely about cutting your way through an extremely large number of monsters using extremely simplistic turn-based combat reminiscent of many JRPGs, with no real coherent or interesting story to speak of, there is little to recommend this game as anything but a time waster, and even there, you can do far better. There's nothing that this game doesn't show you in the first hour, and there's nothing in that first hour worth taking. While the basic underlying idea of having a bunch of players playing a roleplaying game is an interesting one, this game is a total failure at it. Maybe someday, someone will take this idea and do something good with it, but this is not that game.","August 3, 2014","false","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But thats only my opinion and because it was what I was looking for at this time in a game. Its funny. Its simpull. You can put it down and come back to it and not worry about forgetting anything or what to do. Its not graphics hungry so it can play on any michine. Its retro and brings back alot of memories for me of actually playing the game of pen and paper D&D. The humor is funny. And its cheap. Worth every cent.\nLike my positive review all the negitive ones are only opinions of people who didn't look into what this game really was. Read them. there is nothing wrong with this game. Its got a great developer. And is already making a second game.\nThe only thing I would ask of the developer would be more dlc. That and a way to create your own caractor and even give the origianl caractors new names.\n\nEDIT!\n\nAs of this time I can not recommed this game. After playing 30 hrs and rasing my characters to lvl 35+ an automatic update was applied and my saved game was wiped out! So far there has been no response from the company. I'm not sure I want to sink that kind of time back into this game. I guess it will all depend on how the company handles it and all of the upset players.  If they do well I will once again change my review back to positive.\n\nEDIT 2 !\n\nCompany tried to fix problem with a Master Save. It was a very poor fix. As of right now I will not be playing this game any more or buying the new game. I will keep an eye on the forms to see if they lisen and try again.","October 14, 2015","false","51.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In all honesty, this is a fun little game! There's several different kinds of combinations you can make with your characters, and there's also new classes to unlock along the way, which just adds to the replayability to see all the different kinds of combinations. The gameplay is incredibly simple, but it's fun to kind of 'multitask' as you're doing something in the background while also playing this game in windowed mode.\n\nThe game also kind of lets you 'choose' how the game progresses, as you're essentially the Dungeon Master. You can choose what kind of enemy to fight, and also how many of them. This allows for you to play at your own pace!\n\nYou can also add on more characters as you go along (up to five in total), but you'd have to level them up all the way from level one, which can be kind of a pain, but, ya know, comes with the territory. The same applies for whenever you unlock a class and want to use them. You'd have to level them up from level one. Kind of sucks, but once again, this is supposed to be reminiscent of old-school RPG's. You want to play that new class you just unlocked? Gotta start 'em from the beginning.\n\nOverall, even though I'm only a few hours into the game, I still want to play it and progress even further. This game could definitely keep you occupied for a while, especially if you're looking for a more traditional, old-school RPG.

You do NOT need to buy any microtransactions in this game as long as you manage you money ok (read the guides and use +gold bonus modifiers). I like the fact that you have the option to play in different screen resolutions as well as in a windowed mode where you can multitask.\n\nThis game takes turn-based RPG to its roots. Newer gamers may not appreciate it, but it is right for older gamers with busy lives. It is sprinkled with pop culture and various references throughout the game. It may get repetitive at times, but there are various classes to keep things fresh.\n\nThe game doesn't do a very good job in explaining that you can mine rocks in caves for grindstone, and then take the stones to a town to raise the XP of the blacksmith. I would not suggest attempting to level up weapons and armors until later in the game since the success rate is so low.

This game should not be initiated late in the evening as you will almost always find yourself still playing by one in the morning.  New players begin with five seats, but can only afford to fill two of them at first.  Choose carefully which skills your heroes will specialize in, don't make jack-of-all-trades; because even though you can 'usually' controll the strength of the mob parties you will fight, you can't afford to be unspecialized.   I'm loving this game so much I can barely elequate.\n\nHumor:  Casual, but usually satisfactory, 8-bit cliches and DM wit, 7/10\nMusic: Fits the game, it's 8-bit rpg themes, what is there to say?  6/10\n\nControls: Smoothe as giant moth fur.  In combat, whoevers turn it is, no need to click 'attack' and then select which enemy to attack, just click the enemy and, wham, a virtual 'rush' mechanic for mopping up weaker mobs.  The world map could've been given a bit more compensation room at the fringes because you click and drag the map to move it around and some locations ARE right at the edges, just a minor irritation there, could've been fixed with the ability to zoom out, but they didn't include that.  There were other things, but overall, deserves a 9/10\n\nVisuals: In an 8-bit tabletop rpg sim, all you can ask for is a great color pallete, and it's in there.  8/10\n\nThis game is virtually always in Ironman mode, constantly autosaving, so even if you hit esc enough times to terminate the game, no need to freak for your progress' sake :)\n\nThat's enough from me, enjoy, my comerade gamers, *drops the mic*","July 17, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sense of humor is mildly more down-to-earth, the battles are turn-based RPG style (with no tile-based / movement aspect), but the character progression is similar and the visual style reminds me of it in a good way.  The actual game mechanics are heavily simplified, and seem to be based as much off of japanese computer RPGs as they are off of any particular tabletop game.  The players for your party bicker and banter at eachother with one-liners now and again, I've found at least one quest that seems specifically designed to encourage lateral thinking ("why go to the area ten levels higher than you, when you can /buy/ the quest drop at a store?"), and there seems to be some kind of over-arching storyline that I haven't really gotten far with.\n\nDoD is on my computer as sort of an equivalent / replacement for solitaire -- Knights of Pen and Paper is happily getting added into the same category.\n\n[Edit]  On later reflection, it also reminds me of MMO's with the get quest / kill X things / get next quest / move to new area dynamic.  Unfortunately, they roam all over the world map and you can only hold one of them at a time -- meaning it's impossible to prioritize what order you want to do them in, particularly when many of them are multi-stage with each step in a different place.  There is very little strategy.  That said, it's still a good mindless game if you like the combat style.","January 25, 2014","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For about 90% of the battles, you decide just how many monsters you face, whether you make it easy on yourself and just take on one small bat for minimal but easy exp, or whether you take on a horde of Invaders for major risk/reward exp/gold - a concept which I thought is pretty damn neat. Along with being able to change your party at any point in the game (with more classes to unlock as you playthrough), you can really make the experience your own every time and try all sorts of weird and wonderful combinations.\n\nFun addicting title with neat graphics and a good soundtrack that I'm sure I'll be playing for many many moons to come.","January 29, 2014","true","46.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
