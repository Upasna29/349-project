"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/277870/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Diehard Dungeon is a homage to the dungeon crawlers of old, mixed with some new, combined into a retro styled game that is not only aptly named but also a lot of fun to play.\n\nDiehard Dungeon has you making your way though a series of dungeons, collecting gold keys and fighting various monsters and other enemies in an ultimate search for loot and glory.  It has a surprisingly large amount of depth for a game with no story, and oddly enough, has a mini-game included that is almost worth the purchase price alone.\n\nThe game starts you off alone, in a dungeon with nothing.  You quickly find your sword and a few stages later the Companion Chest. The Companion Chest stores your treasure (you never actually access it though) and will even help you fight your way through the dungeon.  Upon your first boss battle you will also pick up a hand-cannon, which is literally, a handgun that shoots cannon balls.  These make up your primary combat abilities in the game, with your sword being the focus ultimately. At the core, Diehard Dungeon is a hack and slash, but positioning yourself properly against certain foes is still important, as is proper use of the hand-cannon.  As one might expect, with such a simple combat system the controls are also pretty simple.\n\nSpeaking of abilities, rather than leveling up and using experience points or any system like that; Diehard Dungeon simply has you find or win extra abilities. You can find them in chests that operate like slot machines, a mini “trap-door” game or just laying on the ground. These range from becoming fireproof, adding shrapnel to your hand-cannon or as suggested before, an ability that allows you to kill everything on screen in exchange for one heart of life by pressing B.  These abilities are random and make all the difference in your ability to make it through the dungeon in one piece.  This makes finding and collecting the abilities incredibly important, but also leads to one of the main downsides to the game.\n\nWhile Diehard Dungeon is a blast to play, the name is very appropriate. The game uses a simple “heart” system of health, where each hit takes one away and you can add more (if you find some) along the way.  That said, when you die, there is no check point; you don’t go back to the beginning of that dungeon room with all that you had when you got there; no, you go back, all the way back. To the beginning. With nothing. While this certainly makes death a big deal, it is frustrating when you seem to have a fairly decent start but then a really tough middle-range area in the game.  Basically, if you get overwhelmed in a single room (which happened to me on a couple of occasions) you drop all of your progress from the last half hour and start over again; something made even more possible by the fact health can sometimes be quite rare.  Does it add more weight to your death? Absolutely. Does it make you fight that much harder to not die? Of course. Does it make you absolutely want to stop playing the game for a few minutes after? You bet your ♥♥♥ it does.\n\nLuckily the game does offer another mode of play to distract you for a bit while you let the anger inside you dissipate.  The mini-game “Mayhem” is not only fun, it comes close to overshadowing the main game. Who would have guess that built within a dungeon crawler would be one of the better twin-stick shooters on the XBLIG service?  Mayhem has you playing as the Companion Chest in a room that quickly fills with enemies.  The goal is ultimately to get as high of a score as possible in only three minutes, but the “gimmick” is that your score multiplier only goes up if you don’t get hit.  It is, simply put; a blast and you will strive to reach higher and higher on the leaderboard (I managed to take first place for an evening).  The one downside to this mode is that quite often it seemed I was “being hit’ when there was no conceivable way that I actually was (unless the game punishes you for standing still).  I was clearly not near any enemies (or crates) yet felt my controller vibrate like I was hit and saw that my multiplier had gone down as well.  I’m assuming there was a reason for it that I just didn’t realize, but for the life of me I don’t know what it was.\n\nBack to the main game, there is one other… issue that soured Diehard Dungeon’s experience.  Despite playing through the game well (well? I kicked ♥♥♥) and killing everything in sight and breaking every crate open, I still made it to what I presume is the end of the game without enough golden keys to open the giant chest at the end; so I died and lost anyway.  Looking at the developer’s website, “gold key rarity” is something that is planned to be patched in an updating coming any day now, so this is hopefully a non-issue going forward but it was incredibly frustrating to have gotten to the end and still lost because the game simply didn’t generate enough of a crucial item.\n\nDeath resetting everything is rough, but it is part of the game and what makes it work (even if you kind of hate it in the moment).  A lack of a crucial item that makes an otherwise successful run a waste of time though is very, very close to being a deal breaker. Luckily for Diehard Dungeon, it was fun getting to that point and the mini-game Mayhem compensates for this oversight.  Hopefully the patch will fix it, along with a lot of other changes coming soon as the patch is approved, but it is enough to take a great game and knock it down from where it should be; for now anyway.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 25, 2014","true","39.5"," 55 of 66 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","55","66","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradesniper/recommended/277870/","comradesniper","gr8stalin's mustache!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradesniper/","528 products in account","There are way too many reviews for this game spouting cheap, repetitive, barely-descriptive one-liners like “Link to the Past meets Roguelikes!!! A+ very good game!!!” or “Homage to old dungeon crawlers” when the fact of the matter is that it’s just not a very good game. The best thing it does is work without crashing.\n\nThe weapons given to the player character are a cannon launcher and a sword. These deal unimpressive amounts of damage even with upgrades. There are also perks that the player can pick up a-la Binding of Isaac for abilities. Unlike BoI, however, these perks don’t really change the way that the game is played too much since they either allow the player to avoid hazards or tack on slight effects to the two weapons (e.g., cannonball explosions spawning tiny pools of fire). The player can upgrade their treasure chest companion by collecting gems to the point where it will fire spikes at enemies or dash around into enemies but those are the only other attack that can be performed.\n\nThere are a lot of different sprites for enemy types but they all follow the same pattern: +forward. Everything either runs towards or away from the player, including bosses. This, in combination with the weapons, makes combat really boring and shallow. The gameplay doesn’t particularly change much outside of the included minigame, which is essentially Pac-Man. Click to slash, click to shoot. There’s nothing like BoI’s bullet-hell, active abilities, or item synergy. There’s nothing like Ziggurat’s arena shooter approach to survival (good movement, good positioning, good aim). There’s nothing like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup/Tales of Maj’Eyal/Nethack/others where items and random events legitimately change the player’s experience (e.g., Bearosphere in ToME). In essence, it’s LoZ: A Link to the Past without anything that made LTTP good fused with the permadeath behind Roguelikes.\n\nThe art design is explicitly stated as a “nostalgic 16-bit look and feel” but there’s so much dark and grey and brown, any attempt to have anything that looks at the very least different is crushed. Hammerwatch tackles “retro” in a far superior graphical manner, and Darkest Dungeon utilize black, brown, and grey to create a foreboding atmosphere. Diehard Dungeon just looks like a flash game. There is also a lot of screen clutter in Diehard Dungeon; broken barrels and boxes covering up progression items (keys), tiny shelled critters running around everywhere that don’t deal damage, bouncing spinning spikewheels, etc, all in a small room. Others might say that "this just helps cover up traps!!!" but the fact that it's really easy to see where the physical traps themselves are (spike walls, arrow holes, etc.) defeats the purpose of hiding the trigger.\n\nThe XP system and ability system are completely useless. The only thing gaining XP does is increase the difficulty of the mobs and doesn’t change anything about the player. No power bonus, no extra abilities, nothing. All abilities are acquired via RNG chests where players play slot machines for random abilities, which determine the player’s pace; if the abilities picked up are useful, the player can actually play the game at a reasonable pace. If the abilities are garbage, players are forced to plink away at enemies until the odds roll in their favor. Another reviewer described the game as “tedious” and I can’t help but agree; it’s not a fun timesink, it’s not a game one can leave running in the background like a clicker game, but it requires the player’s undivided attention to open the exit to the current room. It feels familiar but unlike the claims, it does nothing unique or out of the ordinary.\n\nIt’s fitting that Diehard Dungeon was released on Steam on September 11th because this game is a disaster. Spend your $5 (or $0.99 if on sale) somewhere else.","June 21, 2015","false","1.4"," 138 of 215 people (64%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","64","138","215","15","6"

Now i've gotta come up with other things to talk about in the Review :D\n\nI'm a really big fan of action roguelikes, so I'm quite happy to see more coming out and I instantly wanted to give this a shot.\n\nMy first reaction to seeing the trailer was to think that the game may be too derivative of The Binding of Isaac, but luckily I tried out the game and saw how wrong I was.\n\nThis game has a striking resembalance to The Binding of Isaac, as they're both of the same genre and are both seemingly inspired by older entires in the Zelda franchise. The similarites don't go too far though, as it appears that Isaac was based off of the original Zelda, with every room having exactly the same dimensions, whereas Diehard has more similarities to Zelda: A Link to the Past.  The result is a much more organic experience, and your adventure focuses more on each unique room, rather than dungeon floors made up of  maze of bland square areas.\n\nThe combat mechanics are also more developed, with the delver having a Zeldaesque sword for his primary attack, and a very interesting gun for his secondary attack.  This gun shoots bombs, which can cause damage to enemies on both impact and explosion, but cannot hurt the player directly.  The explosions of bombs push back both enemies and the player, and with the bombs propensity to ricochet around a room, it can make using it effectively quite tricky.  This results in deeper, trickier combat mechanics than one would expect, and adds a certain richness.\n\nA final added bonus Diehard Dungeon has over BoI is that it doesn't rely on blood, poop, tears and gore to have an atmospheric experience.\n\nOverall it was a good experience, and with the low price tag the devs seem to be selling themselves short, though it does certainly help spread the love faster :)\n\n[Original Complaint]\nWhile the gameplay was fairly enjoyable, the game overuses a visual effect which makes the entire screen flash white very quickly without warning. I play far too many videogames, and I'm virtually never affected by any kind of flashing lights(besides the seizure inducing flashes in Guacamelee!) but these flashes are definitely responsible for giving me a headache, and turning an entertaining experience into a negative one.\n\nIf this is patched out, I'd gladly give this game a thumbs up and would definitely give it another go, but at this point it's getting shelved after only a few runs.\n[/original complaint]","March 6, 2014","true","3.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","2"

I would recommend it as it has most of the elements that fans of the genre like including permadeath, random upgrades, random dungeons, and a retro feel. The only problem that keeps me from loving this game is that it feels very slow, but only on the players end. The dungeons side on the other hand will seem very fast and can kill you in just seconds with the crazy amount of enemies on the screen (which is no problem at all of course.) The issue is that killing the enemies seems so slow sometimes with your cannon gun and tiny little dagger. Yes, you can upgrade both of those, but sometimes you wont get upgrades through out the dungeon if you are unlucky and it will just make things slower. One may argue "that's what rogue-likes are all about. They are going to be tough." This isn't really that kind of game. In this sort of game you want quick difficult gameplay where the upgrades make you feel like you are progressing even if the game is getting more tough. A few floors in and i'm doing the same damage. The only buffs I have make me immune to fire or that the chests wont be empty (yet you can still get unlucky and recieve nothing.) The game is fun. Just seems slow. I think it's safe to say that if you know what you are playing 5 dollars is a good price.\n\n\nLET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE UPDATE THAT MAKES YOUR SWORD SLASH WAS A GREAT IMPROVMENT. IT IS A LOT MORE PLAYABLE FOR NOW. THE GAMEPLAY FEELNIG A BIT SLOW AS SAID IN THIS REVIEW STILL APPLIES A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT IS NOW ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

The controls in Diehard Dungeon are not particularly responsive and the combat mechanics make things awkward. Using a controller does help with some of the problems but even so, moving and turning in combat is generally bad.\n\nAs to the 'tedious' part; well, many of the game's mechanics seem to be based around wasting as much of the player's time as possible. Here are some examples of what I am trying to convey:\n\nThe majority of rooms can only be exited once a key has been placed in a lock. The key will be hidden somewhere in the room; perhaps in one of the many random objects in the room (every one of which takes multiple strikes to break open), perhaps on one of the hit-sponge enemies. There's no indication as to where the key will be and you will often spend fruitless minutes hacking away at boxes to find the key.\n\nLittle pixie type creatures will often appear (most of the time from one of the previously mentioned boxes you are hacking open in search of the key) and steal your companion chest. Well, not properly steal the chest, like take it away to be found later on; they just grab it and run to the other side of the room. You can't collect any treasure without the chest so you can't just leave it behind. What you must do instead is chase the pixies around the room, slashing at them with your sword until you've killed them all and can get your chest back. The problem here is that the pixies are fast and will continually move away from the player character, whilst the character cannot move while swinging his sword. And so a merry game of trying to manouvre the pixies into a corner ensues. And this will happen every few rooms. It's not that difficult to get the chest back, it's just tedious and annoying.\n\nThere are other exmples that I won't go into an extended explanation of as they all tend to end with the same reaction of 'Why am I doing this? What's the point?' and a feeling that your time has been wasted.\n\nOther, although much less prominent, annoyances exist in the game, such as: parts of broken objects covering the trigger plates for traps so you can't even see them, enemy attacks that cause you to drop your only melee weapon so you have to go running around to find it again, status effects that make you run in random directions (usually straight at the nearest wall) for an intolerably long time and the fact that the bomb launcher (secondary weapon) is about as effective as launching an attack on a Tiger tank with firecrackers.\n\nThe final negatives about Diehard Dungeon are the bland graphics, uninspired dungeon design and the completely 'meh' soundtrack. Overall this is not a game I would recommend unless you have a whole load of time to waste on pointless tedium and absolutely nothing else to play.","October 15, 2014","false","0.8"," 36 of 54 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","36","54","0","0"

In this top-down 2D dungeon crawler, the main goal is to explore and survive a succession of randomly generated rooms populated by various enemies. Amassing gold, avoiding traps, and collecting golden keys are the things you will have to do to reach the end of each level, all the while fighting your way through the different rooms and trying to collect power-ups that are spread around.\n\nIn order to help you in this task, you are equipped with a sword which acts as a melee weapon, and a Hand Cannon which throws explosive projectiles. You will also be followed during your exploration by a magical chest, which acts as a companion and collects gold for you. After some time, it evolves and can become an active item, defending you throughout the levels.\n\nThe controls in DieHard Dungeon are fairly easy, and a simple tutorial will help you get the hang of things. The game is best played with a controller, as it was firstly meant to be played on the Xbox Live Indiegame Marketplace.\n\nWhile it borrows most of its aesthetics from The Legend of Zelda, DieHard Dungeon is also inspired by another game that’s hugely popular in the rogue-like genre: The Binding of Isaac. Just like in Isaac, the player will be able to find special items that are spread around the levels. In DieHard Dungeon though, power-ups are available thanks to randomly placed chests that act as slot machines. If successful, the player is rewarded with a bonus, which he can accept, or refuse and reroll for a new chance at getting a better power-up. Some enemies will also drop tokens, which can be spent in a Token Well, giving the player another chance at getting better items.\n\nTaking everything into account, DieHard Dungeon feels alive and responsive. The sense of progression is present throughout the different levels. The fact that the dificulty adjusts itself depending on the player’s performance gives him the feeling to be “fed” in a good way: the game grows with the player, and the challenge curve always feels right. The randomly generated levels make the game a new challenge to play each and every time. Unfortunately, unlike in The Binding of Isaac, you are not able at this time to input your own seed. “At this time”, because while the game has been released for over two years now, it is still in active development. TrickTale is constantly improving its creation by adding powerups, challenges, enemies, and by working on the game’s balance. One clever decision that has been made for example is switching the player’s speed from low to high when carrying a key. This change, which will certainly be available in the next patch will definitely help in the game’s dynamics by making the player’s escape a positive action instead of a struggle.\n\nThe main drawback with DieHard Dungeon though, is its lack of diversity in graphics. While trying a bit too hard to pay its respect to its elders, the game lacks creativity in getting a strong visual identity of its own, and therefore may look a bit bland for some people. This problem is felt up to some of the enemies’ patterns which act just like their grand-parents counterparts, or even the charge ability of the player’s sword. While it’s always a good thing to throw a wink at the games that made your childhood and help the player overcome enemies by putting him in a familiar place, it would have been appreciated to see a bit more diversity in this regard.\n\nThere are also a few points in which the game could benefit some tweaks, such as an in-game user interface showing your current collected gold, a timer that could certainly attract the speedrunning scene, or even simply an indicator showing the current level you’re exploring.\n\nDespite these points, DieHard Dungeon feels really nice. The dungeon theme combined with the randomly generated levels, the variety in powerups, and the fact that the dificulty adjusts itself in real time makes it a game that is a real joy to play. The replay value is definitely great, and when you take into account the fact that the game is in active development, that it features a champion level (which is some kind of new game + once you’ve beaten the last boss), and even minigames, all that for a mearly $5, you get a game that not only is an excellent introduction to randomly generated dungeon crawlers, but can stand on its own with no problem whatsoever and definitely deserves your attention.","November 8, 2014","true","1.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I'm compelled to compare the combat and weapons of this game to the first Legend of Zelda. While the combat in Zelda is simple, it is polished and immersive on a level this game does not come close to matching. This is primarily due to Diehard Dungeon's combination of an ultimately unremarkable arsenal, boring enemies, and the mechanics that drive it all. Your primary weapon (as in Zelda) is a sword that is somewhat satisfying to use but is otherwise unremarkable. Your secondary weapon is a very strangely ineffective canon that fires weak, timed mortars that never go where you want them to. While you can get 'upgrades' that improve these weapons and that slightly alter their behavior, you're stuck with just these two. Meanwhile, in Zelda (and several other games you can draw comparisons to), you have a fairly broad array of secondary items to choose from.\n\nIt's no wonder I couldn't be bothered to delve deeper. The foundation of Diehard Dungeon is simply not fun from the get-go. The dull art style does not help either. Overall, the game is just a chaotic mish-mash of genres and is unrewarding and uninspired. I say this because, while it can provide a good challenge, the game feels so average across-the-board that it is a very niche experience.","October 10, 2014","false","0.5"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

This game is innovative in how it feels like you are playing something like a RNG based Legend of Zelda, or something like it.\n\nLet's go over the Pros, Cons, and Neutrals I have found:\nPros- This game is very responsive. The controls are tight, and there are no mystery hits from you or monsters. You know when you get hit or you hit enemies.\nI love the art direction they took with the game, making it 16-bit. It truly feels like I am playing a game straight from the Super Nintendo!\nThis game has a challenge to it, just like a Roguelike should. If Roguelikes are too hard for you, you shouldn't be playing them (Being honest here, so don't whine.)\n\nNeutrals- This game was made for the PC, so the movement is WASD, whereas the attacking buttons are located on the mouse. For someone like myself who is attuned to playing PC games, this wasn't an issue. For all you Console gamers out there, this will be for the fact that you cannot remap your controls.\n\nCons- Every time you start up the game (Be it for the first time, or if you close it and come back to it later) You go through the tutorial. I'm sorry, but I should only have to go through a tutorial for a game ONCE. Having to do it over and over again is just tedious.\nI have not run across any kind of weapon pickups in the game, and this is a shame. Using the same stuff over and over again really hinders the replay value. Would I like to keep playing? Of course! But, give me some new stuff to lay waste to dungeon minions please!\n\nOverall, I give this game am 8/10. Great game, just needs some added work to make it amazing.","March 16, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Using a controller is significantly better, and perhaps the way to go. if you dont have a controller, dont be encouraged to pick this up. if you dont a have an official controller (meanign the game doesnt detect it) google and download "joy to key" program, you can rebind your controller to make each button count as a specific key stroke.\n\nEDIT: I left the statement above to serve the purpose of showing that the developers do care for the game. the keys are now rebindable allowing for a custom configuration, which permits for a much confortable expeirnce\n\nThe game is hardcore roguelike, meaning it follows tipical standards of the genre. you only get 1 life, once its gone, you gotto start all over again. the game is going to be repetitive, however each time you learn something more, you improve, and the feeling of stepping into new heights is unique, and personally, very gratifying. I dont feel this game hits that feeling just yet, so far I have only dropped about 1 hour, so this learning feeling hasnt kicked in yet, maybe it wont.\n\nEDIT: after revisiting the game and passing it about twice, I can openly say that the experience has been enhanced while maintaining a good sense of difficulty, as some mechanics which made it a unfair for the player were polished and/or eliminated, EX: the sword swing delay\n\nThe combat is simple. your given a sword and a handcannon (think of it as a bomb launcher, meaning this "bomb" has a fuse on it. it wont explode on impact, it actually damages and bounces away from whatever is struck). the handcannon is unique in feel and learning how to work it out is solid.\n\nEdit: The sword on the other hand is the true meaning of "mastering simplicity." it is a basic horizontal swing forward, not much more/less, and perhaps is its simplicity that gives it its charm.\n\nThis new style allows for a fresh feeling. some enemies make you weight the importance of your sword and its contrast with the cannon. while you can swing your sword much faster for much higher damage, your cannon allows for a safer aproach, and mixing but properly is what gives you a gratifying feeling of success.\n\nThere is also a score attack called "mayhem", its strainght to the point a and you will play it once or twice for the sake of taking away the taste of a failed run, it helps to steam down very well.\n\nThe asthetics of the game are ok. the music isnt spectacular, but gets the right feeling going, meaing its just fine.\nThe game uses a pixel style meaning it feels like "Legend of Zelda a Link to the Past" nothing that will win an award, but a nice style considering the gameplay. fits nicely.\n\nMost discussed above can be disregarded almost entirely by personal taste though. The game can be picked and played quickly, specially for the low cost of the game itself and the simplistic gameplay, while still providing that roguelike feeling of "learning through repeated failure."\n\nIf your looking for a hardcore Roguelike gamplay, "the binding of isaac" or "our darker purpose" will quench that thirst. but if your on the much more into quick and simple, this is a  better choice. the game is also getting updated, sentence that I hold strong.\n\nNonetheless, if you have found great experience in games like rogue legacy, binding of isaac or risk of rain, this might come as a shorter burst of that flavor\n\nEdit: I would also like to make a strong sense of respect as my original review used to say that i didnt recommend this game, mostly on a bases that if 100 ppl played it, less that half would like it, (some original machanics, which are no longer there, made it difficult to enjoy properly).\nI stand chaged, most wont love it, but will play it, and few will learn to cherish it, enogh to comeback untill that 100% is there.","March 5, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","8"

I imagine if I kept working on it, I would eventually succeed, but while the game isn't bad, I don't find myself drawn enough to it to favor that objective over other gaming options.","March 23","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've played less than thirty minutes of this game and already love it.  As you know me (if you have read past reviews of mine) I am a frugal gamer.  Perhaps that should be my thing?  Anyway, this game went on sale recently for $2.24 and couldn't resist.  "Zelda" was in the description, so I threw my money at Steam.\n\nSo, like I said I love it.  It'll probably get stale with time, but this is a great pickup-and-play-rogue-like adventure.  The way it plays reminds me a lot of "Binding of Isaac".  You go through various rooms picking up keys, hearts and power-ups.  Every so often you enter a room with a big-ol' boss baddy you have to defeat.  And just like "Binding of Isaac", the level layout is always changing so each time you die, the whole structure gets rearranged (thus my "rogue-like" description) and you lose your power-ups and have to start over again.  This makes each time you play a bit unique and different.  Any subtle hint of change always gives a game a bit more life to it so it doesn't become stale so easily.\n\nNow, I'm going to say this and I'm sure many people will disagree, but I like this much better than "Binding of Isaac" (Sorry to keep comparing it to that, but it's the only relation I know as far as style and I know MANY people have played "BoI").  The main, and probably sole reason, I like this more than "BoI" is that it is much more forgiving.  I'm not a great gamer, but I'm also no newbie. With that said, "BoI" is TOUGH for me.  Bosses are tough to get through, and when I make it I'm shocked and awed.  This does make it all the more rewarding, but like I mentioned before, when you die in "BoI", you lose everything and have to restart.  Needless to say, I die a lot in that game, become discouraged after ten minutes of play, and don't touch it for four months. With "Diehard Dungeon" I feel like I can make it pretty far without dying.  There's still a challenge, but I'm not getting slaughtered after only a handful of rooms.  I also feel like they're a little more generous with the power-ups, which makes this a little more rewarding and fun.\n\nNow, enough comparison.  Overall this game is addictive and makes me want to go deeper and deeper into this dungeon.  The style is very much in the vain of "Link to the Past" which is a lazy description I know, but it's the first thing that comes to mind.  It's got that heavy pixelated look which has become ever so popular.  As far as game play goes, yes it is like "BoI" (I swear that's the last time) BUT there are mini-games, too, with a global scoreboard, which definitely adds some replay value.  If you have just a bit of hardcore gamer in you, but also just want a casual game to play, this will be a perfect game to fulfill that need. A great edition to any gamers' Steam library.\n","October 4, 2014","true","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Diehard Dungeon is one of the few that I really love.\n\nI'm not a fan of 8-bit style anymore, but it works well for this game. Sometimes the screen does get cluttered and you accidently step on a pressure plate, triggering a trap, but you learn how to watch out for things like that.\n\nYou have a loot chest (like a mimic) who follows you around and collects the treasure, leveling up when it gains enough. At higher levels, the chest will gain ranged attacks and join you in fights. But there are also little imps who only attack the chest, and prevents the chest from collecting any loot while it's being chased around the room.\n\nThe games difficulty adjusts with your success or failure, so you always get a suitable challenge. It took me 6 attempts before I first escaped the dungeon, and it unlocked optional champions who wander the edge of the dungeon on top of the walls and jump down to attack you... all while you are dealing with the regular room stuff like traps, monsters, etc.\n\nThe game has a large variety of perks you can gain through a single dungeon delve and the ones you find are randomized. In one game, I gained the ability to hide in my loot chest, so monsters wouldn't be able to find me. Great if you need a breather and accidently bite off too many monsters at once. Other times I'm gained throwing knives, or flame resistance. All of them offer different ways to play the game, so it always keeps it fresh and interesting.\n\nOverall, I think this is the first rogue-like game in a long while with enough variety to keep me coming back time after time. Highly recommended.","January 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a fun game but it can be pretty hard and the bosses are tough in my opinion.\n\nMain ReviewIn Diehard Dungeon you control a character that has a sword and a gun that shoots out bombs. The gameplay and controls feel very similar to an older Legend of Zelda game. There is even the spin attack. Each time you enter the dungeon you fight against random rooms of enemies. Eventually after clearing so many rooms you fight a boss. You do this about three times and then you fight the final boss. I think the gameplay is fun but it can get repetitive. Maybe I just suck but I rarely can beat this game. That being said I am trying to get to Diehard rank. This is like playing the game on very hard. The game has multiple challenge modes if the main game mode gets boring.\n\nThe Good The game has lots of replayability.\nIf you like being on lists then this game can scratch that itch for you.\nThe bad The game does feel repetitive after so many plays.\nIf you let the difficulty get too high without ever lowering it the game becomes very difficult.\nFinal ThoughtsIf you like the look and feel of an older Legend of Zelda game, for example A Link to the Past and you like Rogue-Lite games then this game will be fun and I recommend it. That being said if somewhat repetitive dungeons and irritating enemies and bosses is a turn off then maybe you will not like this game. Like most indie games I would recommend watching some gameplay on Twitch/YouTube.","February 14","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A game that will be moderately enjoyable to those who specifically seek rogue-style games, but nothing exceptional.  The game functions appropriately and has the requisite mechanics and RNG.  However when I can't activate the random ability I picked up because the default controls also use the 'A' button meaning that a rare random drop is useless to me...

Not the first game I'd point to when recommending a game from the genre, but it should prove reasonably enjoyable for fans of the genre.  The one point I'd have to complain about is the weapon system.\n\nIn the game you're given 2 weapons, the sword and the hand-cannon.  The problem with sword is that, even with all the upgrades, its reach is far too shallow, causing the player to get hit himself 50% of the time.  The problem with the Hand-Cannon is that it launches something akin to grenades, the projectile having a delay before it detonates.  This often leaves the player with the only option of launching the projectiles at enemy and having them bounce off, causing sub-optimal damage.\n\nNeither of weapons gives a lasting satisfaction when defeating an enemy like almost any weapon in a comparable top-down dungeon crawlers does (eg; Zelda).  If you can get past this fact, then it's pretty enjoyable, and definately recommendable at such a paltry price as $5.","March 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you grew up with 8-bit graphics and you like a challenge that would be another reason to pick this up.

Nothing spectacular but again...the game is $4.\n\nGameplay wise it doesn't get old until a few hours in.  This is a rogue-like so it's one of those where after 1 death, you start over from the very beginning.  You will lose health is some really cheap ways too.

If you really love classic topdown Zelda combat, you could get something out of it. Still, you're probably better off with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, since this game is just a less fun version of that.\n\nOther things that suck about this game:\n\n-The powerups you get are all really minor and inexplicably rare.\n-Really awful graphics. Blocky 16-bit sprites can look great, but this is muddy and ugly.\n-The ranged weapon they give you highly discourages actually fighting enemies, since you can plink at them forever and not risk taking damage. This is boring.\n\nTo its credit, the game does the following well:\n\n-Good difficulty curve. Tough but almost always fair, you can generally learn from your mistakes.\n-"Champion" mechanic where your character can screw with other people's games after you beat it once. AI controlled, so this is more just a "oh, that's cute" thing than really interesting or annoying - it basically just puts your name over an ingame monster.\n-The combat itself is fairly solid, if you don't just hang back and shoot at enemies 1 damage at a time.\n\nThis one is up to you.

Its fun and unique. Its a roque like game to be sure but there are some things that make it stand out. Slot machine chests are one example of thinking outside the box.  You touch a chest and you have might zero spins or 3 spins and then it gives you a powerup of some kind. The action is kind of a slow paced robotron with traps you have to watch out for.\n\nThe game has a difficutly lever that can work automatically or you can adjust it for higher or lower. That to me is smart. The game does have boss fights and they are fun. The graphics while not super sharp looking look incredibly sharp in action.So the game is perfect? Um No. I kind of wish the color pallet of the game was a little more vivid its very hard to see the plates in the floor sometimes. The randomly generated rooms can sometimes be a big pain. While it makes every game unique sometimes you will get a bad spawn and a spear dude or a medium boss  will be right in your face with no where to run or to hide.\n\nAlso when you break stuff in the game it scatters debris every where and that sometimes obscure the key you need to unlock the door. Also no multiplayer of any kind is in this game.  However these are mostly minor nitpicks and I enjoyed the game for the low price of under $2dollars its a bargain. Even at the normal price of $5 its still a solid value. If you enjoy Legend of Dungeon or the stars and the pit then this is a game you should consider picking up.\n\nI actually consider it a better game then Legend of Dungeon. Legend is a nice game but it mostly depends on 2 item that if you can get you can beat the game and if you dont then you better start over again. Also when I died in this game it didnt feel cheap. The game treats the player more fairly inside the game world. My rating would be an easy 8/10 right now. Its super good with few flaws.\n\nJust an update I have finished the game on the regular mode and unlocked champion mode. I also finished the game and did not get the set number of keys. Fun game and the developer is still issuing updates to this game.","June 28, 2014","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You collect coins and rings which serve absolutely no purpose, no long term investments that make you want to play again after you die or beat the game.  If you like playing a game that will get harder over time but everything else essentially stays the same, then this game is for you.  Hearts are pretty rare which isnt the worst thing in the world, but honestly the gameplay is just very repetitive and boring.  The fact that the coins and rings are in the game is just stupid, i was expecting there to be shops or equipable items (i know there are some, but they are rare and the benefit is hardly noticable or worth it).  Even the most simple thing like different weapons or gear to equip would have made this game more enjoyable, but there was little suspence in terms of finding new items for me.\nAgain, i bought this for like a dollar so i guess it is worth the money, but compared to other roguelike games, there is little to no character progression that would make me want to play for hours and hours much like other games have (binding of issac, risk or rain, FTL etc) from somone who has hundreds of games on steam and is always looking for a great time killer i have to say there are way better options and this game will simply go in the folder of "not bad but dont really want to play again"","April 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

This game is ugly. If you're going to copy Link to the Past's set up, at least use a good color pallet. Everything is brown and grey in the dungeons.\n\n2. The monsters are stock.

The only advantage they have over you, the only way they ever damaged me, was with teleporting or simply because they were running faster than me. Lame.\n\n3. The items and power-ups suck. Your sword reaches a quarter of an inch and your gun shoots blueberries instead of, y'know, bullets. So your projectiles bounce off everything and rarely connect for full damage. The power-ups include lame things like status immunities, larger health pools, and the ability to run faster. Where's all my exotic weapons? Damage shields? Dashing? ANYTHING fun?\n\n4. Many enemies either run from you, slow you down, or are faster than you-- making every single one tedious.\n\n5. Crates can contain explosives and/or enemies that hit you as soon as they pop out.

I bought Diehard Dungeon while it was on offer, the reviews warned that it was like a very hard Zelda style dungeon slasher. When it said hard, I didn't expect it to be AS hard as it is. Part of me is glad I didn't pay a lot for this game. For the simple fact, it's not suited for the casual gamer. If like me, you play games to relax and have an hour of enjoyment, Diehard Dungeon will leave you ever so slightly frustrated.\n\nMy hat is off to the developers, it's a lovely thought out game and really looks like something you'd see on the SNES, but thats about all it does do. DD feels like it only caters toward a certain type of gamer. Those who dont mind repeating the same motions over and over again. Frankly I got bored very quickly of dying and loosing everything I had achieved. What is the point of a retry, if you dont continue from were you left off?\nI was really looking forward to some old skool style gaming and for the first 2-3 minutes DD felt like it actually would come up with the goods.

A treasure chest 'companion' levels up (and it caps out fairly quickly) although not to much effect.  Itemization is similarly lacking: you have a sword and a gun and... that's it.  They don't upgrade.  There are 'perk' cards you can find although I only manged to stumble on one in about an hour of gameplay and you are limited to two total.

The main glitch I am talking about is how sometimes I can be walking away from an enemy and swinging at him but my attack direction gets, for no reason, temporarily locked in the opposite direction. So I am desperately trying to swing in the right direction but instead am taking massive dmg from that side because I am defenseless. That and I can be having a perfect run, never even taking one hit, then all of a sudden I get thrown into a situation that is unavoidable and all of my life is drained right away, game over permadeath. That is one thing I also hate, permadeath games. That is just what I want, for all of my hard work to be thrown down the toilet because the developers programmed the game to screw me over as hard as it can in certain spots. In my mind, permadeath is just an excuse to pull a blanket over a game's other flaws such as how short it is, in which I have no doubt this one is probably pretty short. But i may never beat it because of the sheer amount of different ways to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttingly die, especially boss fights. You have to get too close to attack and it is way too easy to get hit by a boss and they just obliterate me and I feel totally powerless. I started just hitting them with my cannon and it worked and I could beat them, but after beating 3 bosses and playing for over an hour, the real problem dropped: I was doing great then a guy with a spiked wooden shield backed me into a corner and drained me from 6 hearts to zero, game over, all that work lost. There are some enemies who run from you and you have to chase them to the other side of the room to kill them, and little green things that hop around the map and hit traps that send an arrow from off-screen to hit you unknowingly. That is probably the game's biggest flaw, other than the BS deaths, is that it is zoomed in way too far. It seems like I only ever take dmg because I have no idea what is going on around me because I can only see a few feet around my guy. It really is terrible how far in it is zoomed. I mean I have two and a half hours in this already and do not feel like I have gotten even a slight bit of progress towards ever beating it, and probably never will, and do not care in the slightest bit because it only cost a dollar to find out if this game has any redeeming qualities, in which it has zero. I just uninstalled this and couldn't be happier.","November 5, 2014","false","3.7"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","5","22","0","0"

Just not worth more than $5. Within 10 to 20 minutes you'll "get it" and within 2 hours you'll beat it. At that point you'll either want more or be done. $5 for 2-3 hours of entertainment with the possibility of much more isn't so bad.\n\nFor the most part, what's new in this game isn't fun and what's fun in this game isn't new. It's still very enjoyable, but it will be very familiar. Unlike many dungeon crawler games with this camera angle, you have a gun! It shoots cannonballs that explode, dealing more damage. It's supposedly a skill-based projectile, but in reality you just fire it directly at the enemy because all the enemies AI is "walk towards you" or "walk towards you, run away when you get near" or "run around like a chicken with its head cut off". I feel that it would have been more fun to use the projectile if the AI took a bit more thought to outsmart; most rooms can be flawlessly cleared by standing in a corner and shooting your cannon over and over until you kill things off screen, doubly so with upgrades.\n\nThe upgrades are sensible and fun and your playthroughs are basically determined by them. If you get good ones (see: relating to ranged attacks) you'll win easily, if you get bad ones you'll have to make smart choices to win. It is fun to get ugprades and change your play based on how you get them, but its mostly just more effective versions of the same thing.\n\nThat said, it's a fun game that actually gets harder the more you play it. If you REALLY enjoy this type of game, you can keep playing and it will get harder and harder. Get frustrated from losing? The game gets easier. It's a good system, although it's kinda "meh" in its implementation; I beat the game at the "warrior" level, which is the 3rd level in the chain. There's many more levels and I'd imagine the game is way more fun at those levels, but it doesn't allow for it without extensive playtime, so I guess I'll never see it.\n\nThis is a pick up and play when you've got 30 minutes to play a game or don't want to get invested in a long term committment. A good buy if you're into that kind of thing.","July 7, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also get a ranged bomb attack that you shoot out of a cannon. You progress from room to room, always forward through the dungeon, with each room needing some basic goal to be completed: kill certain enemies, unlock a lock, or press some buttons. Sometimes there are secret rooms you can go to instead! What each room contains is random, I'm not sure if it is many stock rooms, or procedually generated, or a mixture, but the variety seems good enough. After a certain amount of rooms, you come to a boss, and there seems to be quite a few you can possibly encounter. The title should say it well enough, but it is also a challenging game!\n\nThere are powerups to collect, all I've seen so far are passive benefits like immunity to status effects, or better attacks. My favorite so far lets you shoot 3 bombs at once. There is also gold/jewels to collect, which apparently levels up the treasure chest that follows you around? I'm not fully sure what the deal is with that, but it seems like a friendly sentient treasure chest, so it's fun. :D\n\nThere are also some little minigames you come across during the adventure, and also some you can play from the main menu. These little extras are great and nice little breaks from the standard. One on the main menu is locked needing tokens to unlock, which can be collected through multiple playthroughs, but the tokens are also useful in the dungeon for various things.\n\nI should also mention that the game simply 'feels' right. I'm not sure how better to put it, but I think anyone reading this review have played enough games to maybe understand me... there are many an indie game that looks cool but when you play there is just something(s) missing that you can't put your finger on that the game lacks in it's polish to really make it sing. Well, here, everything just seems to be right. The art and the sound/music are consistent and done decently well.\n\nRecommended, especially to anyone who was a fan of Binding of Issac or Zelda, and likes a challenge.","July 3, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not sure if that reflects that it is easy, or that I got lucky.. However, there is a 'champion mode' difficulty, optional harder routes and I believe difficulty scales with your experience level.\n\nI found the game really fun, and because of the things I mentioned above, there is a lot of replayability. More items to unlock, different bosses to fight, and champion mode to complete (the 'true' ending of the game) There are also minigames (alternate modes) to play whenever you want a break from the main run.\n\nFans of The binding of isaac and other similar roguelikes should find a good few hours of gameplay in this, certainly worth it for the price. I do think it is one of the easier ones though, which is not necessarily a bad thing. 7.5/10, Recommended!","June 26, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #46 - Diehard Dungeon\n\nPlaying Diehard Dungeon feels like reading a love letter to the original Zelda game.  And I don't mean this to accuse this game of being Zelda ripoff, but you can clearly see the inspiration.  The gameplay is very Zelda-like in how you move through dungeons and unlock new rooms while fighting various enemies.  There are also various destructible crates and other items that you can break open for loot.  Rooms often have traps, triggered by floor plates, that you have to keep an eye open for.\n\nThe art is also retro styled.  It's a bit on the dreary side, but I get that it's supposed to represent a dungeon.  Sometimes it's nice to see some color though, and not just on the loot that drops. Mostly my only complaint about the art is sometimes the background and items have a way of blending together to make it hard to tell which items are 'destructible' from already broken containers littering the floor.  This can also cover up items that you haven't picked up yet, which can be a pain because often the rooms require a key to get out, and you don't realize a key has been dropped.\n\nI liked the music okay, and felt like it blended well with the environment and gameplay, but I can also see where it's going to start feeling repetitive.  Hopefully it changes up some after more gameplay.\n\nCombat is pretty straightforward.  You have a melee attack with a sword, and a hand cannon.  Melee attacks work just like you'd expect.  The hand cannon takes a little more getting used to.  It shoots a cannonball and hits anything in it's path, much like firing an arrow would.  But the cannonball will bounce off of walls if there are any in it's path, meaning you might find your shot coming right back to you.   After a few seconds the cannonball explodes.\n\nAs a roguelike, the permadeath may be a bit of a turnoff.  Some roguelike games have something of a progression so that as you play you unlock things that make subsequent playthroughs easier (and thus enable even harder areas).  But this seems more like the classic roguelike where the game starts the same way each time.\n\nMy hour of play wasn't enough to get a good sense of how progression works in the game.  It was enough time to get several playthroughs, but most of them ended in the same way.  That would be making it to a boss fight with 1 or 2 hearts of health left, and then failing to kill the boss.\n\nIt seems like you are really at the mercy of the random number generator when it comes to getting life back.  I've seen some rooms that will drop 3 hearts (which at the time I didn't need), and other rooms not drop a single one (when I'm down to a single heart).  I won't go so far as to say this is Dark Souls difficult, but I definitely had a hard time making it to the boss unscathed.\n\nI really hestiate to call this an RPG, even though it's tagged as one.  For one, there really isn't any story to speak of here.  There's no experience points or levels or classes or skills.  Also there isn't really any character customization to speak of, other than customizing your look from the main menu.  So it seems a stretch to call this an RPG.\n\nThe most unexpected part of this game was the minigames.  There are 3 minigames total, but to start with you only have access to 1, and it's called Mayhem, which is a good description.  In Mayhem you have 3 minutes to get the highest score possible, but instead of exploring a dungeon, it turns the game into a dual stick shooter.  I have to admit, I ended up having more fun with this minigame than I did the main game itself.\n\nI still have some reservations about the long term enjoyment of this game, but I'm going to give it a lukewarm recommendation nonetheless.  For $4.99, I do think there is enough fun to be had in this game to justify the price, even if it doesn't end up keeping your attention for the long term.","December 11, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I myself consider me to be a man of rogue likes and I have played many and beat many and I have to say that all of the people who seem to talk negatively about this game aren't really justified in doing so. Weapon choices are limited, because it's not like the prestigious Binding of Isaac with all of its weapons in which change how the game goes dramatically. Instead, it nods to previous games such a Zelda. A rogue-like doesn't need all of that to be good. All it needs is this sense of difficulty in which attracts an individual and makes them want to play over and over again. Graphics.... They have little to do with this review, but I would say they meet the standard for what is needed to be a decent rogue-like. Just like Binding of Isaac, Pixel Piracy, or Paranautical activity it has its own unique feeling which is unique to this game.  In conclusion I find this game to be wonderful. 8/10. The only thing that it was really lacking in was size. However, it does makeup for it due to replayability and the difficulty scaling system that it has.","November 30, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm sure I don't have to explain what you do but basically you get a chest companion who picks up your loot for you while you run around mashing x and somethings hitting right trigger then x to shoot a blueberry-canon type projectile.\n\nIt has random powere ups you get from chests randomly placed throughout the maps, except for the chest you get from the very beginning. My only problem with this system is that the chests act like a slot machine and don't guarantee you anything, which is annoying. I'd rather just open a chest and get a piece of gold rather than wait there and watch the reels whirl to reveal I get nothing from tche chest.\n\nThere's no guard or parry button, which is a little disappointing but not really that big of a deal. Anyone who can beat this game without that definitely has my respect, because this game is pretty challenging.\n\nI don't understand the canon to well but I'm starting to get use to it. It doesn't explode on impact and it doesn't hurt you however it sends out a blast radius that supposedly hurts enemies and pushes you around, which is kind of annoying to be honest. I hate it but when my health gets low I tend to spam it to keep myself from dieing.\n\nOne last thing that bothers me is some of the achievements are for getting abilities, which are randomly rewarded to you. I don't like that because you could theoretically play for longer than this game is fun and not get the achievement for getting some random ability. Not really a big deal, but I figured some people would be deterred by that if they were achievement hunters.\n\nI hope this doesn't look to negative, because this game is actually quite fun to play. Plus it has mini games, which I haven't unlocked all of but that little extra is pretty amazing. Everything not listed here is pretty much well above average and well above the expectations I had going in to this game.","November 27, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/277870/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Diehard Dungeon is a homage to the dungeon crawlers of old, mixed with some new, combined into a retro styled game that is not only aptly named but also a lot of fun to play.\n\nDiehard Dungeon has you making your way though a series of dungeons, collecting gold keys and fighting various monsters and other enemies in an ultimate search for loot and glory.  It has a surprisingly large amount of depth for a game with no story, and oddly enough, has a mini-game included that is almost worth the purchase price alone.\n\nThe game starts you off alone, in a dungeon with nothing.  You quickly find your sword and a few stages later the Companion Chest. The Companion Chest stores your treasure (you never actually access it though) and will even help you fight your way through the dungeon.  Upon your first boss battle you will also pick up a hand-cannon, which is literally, a handgun that shoots cannon balls.  These make up your primary combat abilities in the game, with your sword being the focus ultimately. At the core, Diehard Dungeon is a hack and slash, but positioning yourself properly against certain foes is still important, as is proper use of the hand-cannon.  As one might expect, with such a simple combat system the controls are also pretty simple.\n\nSpeaking of abilities, rather than leveling up and using experience points or any system like that; Diehard Dungeon simply has you find or win extra abilities. You can find them in chests that operate like slot machines, a mini “trap-door” game or just laying on the ground. These range from becoming fireproof, adding shrapnel to your hand-cannon or as suggested before, an ability that allows you to kill everything on screen in exchange for one heart of life by pressing B.  These abilities are random and make all the difference in your ability to make it through the dungeon in one piece.  This makes finding and collecting the abilities incredibly important, but also leads to one of the main downsides to the game.\n\nWhile Diehard Dungeon is a blast to play, the name is very appropriate. The game uses a simple “heart” system of health, where each hit takes one away and you can add more (if you find some) along the way.  That said, when you die, there is no check point; you don’t go back to the beginning of that dungeon room with all that you had when you got there; no, you go back, all the way back. To the beginning. With nothing. While this certainly makes death a big deal, it is frustrating when you seem to have a fairly decent start but then a really tough middle-range area in the game.  Basically, if you get overwhelmed in a single room (which happened to me on a couple of occasions) you drop all of your progress from the last half hour and start over again; something made even more possible by the fact health can sometimes be quite rare.  Does it add more weight to your death? Absolutely. Does it make you fight that much harder to not die? Of course. Does it make you absolutely want to stop playing the game for a few minutes after? You bet your ♥♥♥ it does.\n\nLuckily the game does offer another mode of play to distract you for a bit while you let the anger inside you dissipate.  The mini-game “Mayhem” is not only fun, it comes close to overshadowing the main game. Who would have guess that built within a dungeon crawler would be one of the better twin-stick shooters on the XBLIG service?  Mayhem has you playing as the Companion Chest in a room that quickly fills with enemies.  The goal is ultimately to get as high of a score as possible in only three minutes, but the “gimmick” is that your score multiplier only goes up if you don’t get hit.  It is, simply put; a blast and you will strive to reach higher and higher on the leaderboard (I managed to take first place for an evening).  The one downside to this mode is that quite often it seemed I was “being hit’ when there was no conceivable way that I actually was (unless the game punishes you for standing still).  I was clearly not near any enemies (or crates) yet felt my controller vibrate like I was hit and saw that my multiplier had gone down as well.  I’m assuming there was a reason for it that I just didn’t realize, but for the life of me I don’t know what it was.\n\nBack to the main game, there is one other… issue that soured Diehard Dungeon’s experience.  Despite playing through the game well (well? I kicked ♥♥♥) and killing everything in sight and breaking every crate open, I still made it to what I presume is the end of the game without enough golden keys to open the giant chest at the end; so I died and lost anyway.  Looking at the developer’s website, “gold key rarity” is something that is planned to be patched in an updating coming any day now, so this is hopefully a non-issue going forward but it was incredibly frustrating to have gotten to the end and still lost because the game simply didn’t generate enough of a crucial item.\n\nDeath resetting everything is rough, but it is part of the game and what makes it work (even if you kind of hate it in the moment).  A lack of a crucial item that makes an otherwise successful run a waste of time though is very, very close to being a deal breaker. Luckily for Diehard Dungeon, it was fun getting to that point and the mini-game Mayhem compensates for this oversight.  Hopefully the patch will fix it, along with a lot of other changes coming soon as the patch is approved, but it is enough to take a great game and knock it down from where it should be; for now anyway.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 25, 2014","true","39.5"," 55 of 66 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","55","66","0","0"

A+ very good game!!!” or “Homage to old dungeon crawlers” when the fact of the matter is that it’s just not a very good game. The best thing it does is work without crashing.\n\nThe weapons given to the player character are a cannon launcher and a sword. These deal unimpressive amounts of damage even with upgrades. There are also perks that the player can pick up a-la Binding of Isaac for abilities. Unlike BoI, however, these perks don’t really change the way that the game is played too much since they either allow the player to avoid hazards or tack on slight effects to the two weapons (e.g., cannonball explosions spawning tiny pools of fire). The player can upgrade their treasure chest companion by collecting gems to the point where it will fire spikes at enemies or dash around into enemies but those are the only other attack that can be performed.\n\nThere are a lot of different sprites for enemy types but they all follow the same pattern: +forward. Everything either runs towards or away from the player, including bosses. This, in combination with the weapons, makes combat really boring and shallow. The gameplay doesn’t particularly change much outside of the included minigame, which is essentially Pac-Man. Click to slash, click to shoot. There’s nothing like BoI’s bullet-hell, active abilities, or item synergy. There’s nothing like Ziggurat’s arena shooter approach to survival (good movement, good positioning, good aim). There’s nothing like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup/Tales of Maj’Eyal/Nethack/others where items and random events legitimately change the player’s experience (e.g., Bearosphere in ToME). In essence, it’s LoZ: A Link to the Past without anything that made LTTP good fused with the permadeath behind Roguelikes.\n\nThe art design is explicitly stated as a “nostalgic 16-bit look and feel” but there’s so much dark and grey and brown, any attempt to have anything that looks at the very least different is crushed. Hammerwatch tackles “retro” in a far superior graphical manner, and Darkest Dungeon utilize black, brown, and grey to create a foreboding atmosphere. Diehard Dungeon just looks like a flash game. There is also a lot of screen clutter in Diehard Dungeon; broken barrels and boxes covering up progression items (keys), tiny shelled critters running around everywhere that don’t deal damage, bouncing spinning spikewheels, etc, all in a small room. Others might say that "this just helps cover up traps!!!" but the fact that it's really easy to see where the physical traps themselves are (spike walls, arrow holes, etc.) defeats the purpose of hiding the trigger.\n\nThe XP system and ability system are completely useless. The only thing gaining XP does is increase the difficulty of the mobs and doesn’t change anything about the player. No power bonus, no extra abilities, nothing. All abilities are acquired via RNG chests where players play slot machines for random abilities, which determine the player’s pace; if the abilities picked up are useful, the player can actually play the game at a reasonable pace. If the abilities are garbage, players are forced to plink away at enemies until the odds roll in their favor. Another reviewer described the game as “tedious” and I can’t help but agree; it’s not a fun timesink, it’s not a game one can leave running in the background like a clicker game, but it requires the player’s undivided attention to open the exit to the current room. It feels familiar but unlike the claims, it does nothing unique or out of the ordinary.\n\nIt’s fitting that Diehard Dungeon was released on Steam on September 11th because this game is a disaster. Spend your $5 (or $0.99 if on sale) somewhere else.","June 21, 2015","false","1.4"," 138 of 215 people (64%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","64","138","215","15","6"

Now i've gotta come up with other things to talk about in the Review :D\n\nI'm a really big fan of action roguelikes, so I'm quite happy to see more coming out and I instantly wanted to give this a shot.\n\nMy first reaction to seeing the trailer was to think that the game may be too derivative of The Binding of Isaac, but luckily I tried out the game and saw how wrong I was.\n\nThis game has a striking resembalance to The Binding of Isaac, as they're both of the same genre and are both seemingly inspired by older entires in the Zelda franchise. The similarites don't go too far though, as it appears that Isaac was based off of the original Zelda, with every room having exactly the same dimensions, whereas Diehard has more similarities to Zelda: A Link to the Past.  The result is a much more organic experience, and your adventure focuses more on each unique room, rather than dungeon floors made up of  maze of bland square areas.\n\nThe combat mechanics are also more developed, with the delver having a Zeldaesque sword for his primary attack, and a very interesting gun for his secondary attack.  This gun shoots bombs, which can cause damage to enemies on both impact and explosion, but cannot hurt the player directly.  The explosions of bombs push back both enemies and the player, and with the bombs propensity to ricochet around a room, it can make using it effectively quite tricky.  This results in deeper, trickier combat mechanics than one would expect, and adds a certain richness.\n\nA final added bonus Diehard Dungeon has over BoI is that it doesn't rely on blood, poop, tears and gore to have an atmospheric experience.\n\nOverall it was a good experience, and with the low price tag the devs seem to be selling themselves short, though it does certainly help spread the love faster :)\n\n[Original Complaint]\nWhile the gameplay was fairly enjoyable, the game overuses a visual effect which makes the entire screen flash white very quickly without warning. I play far too many videogames, and I'm virtually never affected by any kind of flashing lights(besides the seizure inducing flashes in Guacamelee!) but these flashes are definitely responsible for giving me a headache, and turning an entertaining experience into a negative one.\n\nIf this is patched out, I'd gladly give this game a thumbs up and would definitely give it another go, but at this point it's getting shelved after only a few runs.\n[/original complaint]","March 6, 2014","true","3.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","2"

I would recommend it as it has most of the elements that fans of the genre like including permadeath, random upgrades, random dungeons, and a retro feel. The only problem that keeps me from loving this game is that it feels very slow, but only on the players end. The dungeons side on the other hand will seem very fast and can kill you in just seconds with the crazy amount of enemies on the screen (which is no problem at all of course.) The issue is that killing the enemies seems so slow sometimes with your cannon gun and tiny little dagger. Yes, you can upgrade both of those, but sometimes you wont get upgrades through out the dungeon if you are unlucky and it will just make things slower. One may argue "that's what rogue-likes are all about. They are going to be tough." This isn't really that kind of game. In this sort of game you want quick difficult gameplay where the upgrades make you feel like you are progressing even if the game is getting more tough. A few floors in and i'm doing the same damage. The only buffs I have make me immune to fire or that the chests wont be empty (yet you can still get unlucky and recieve nothing.) The game is fun. Just seems slow. I think it's safe to say that if you know what you are playing 5 dollars is a good price.\n\n\nLET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE UPDATE THAT MAKES YOUR SWORD SLASH WAS A GREAT IMPROVMENT. IT IS A LOT MORE PLAYABLE FOR NOW. THE GAMEPLAY FEELNIG A BIT SLOW AS SAID IN THIS REVIEW STILL APPLIES A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT IS NOW ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

The controls in Diehard Dungeon are not particularly responsive and the combat mechanics make things awkward. Using a controller does help with some of the problems but even so, moving and turning in combat is generally bad.\n\nAs to the 'tedious' part; well, many of the game's mechanics seem to be based around wasting as much of the player's time as possible. Here are some examples of what I am trying to convey:\n\nThe majority of rooms can only be exited once a key has been placed in a lock. The key will be hidden somewhere in the room; perhaps in one of the many random objects in the room (every one of which takes multiple strikes to break open), perhaps on one of the hit-sponge enemies. There's no indication as to where the key will be and you will often spend fruitless minutes hacking away at boxes to find the key.\n\nLittle pixie type creatures will often appear (most of the time from one of the previously mentioned boxes you are hacking open in search of the key) and steal your companion chest. Well, not properly steal the chest, like take it away to be found later on; they just grab it and run to the other side of the room. You can't collect any treasure without the chest so you can't just leave it behind. What you must do instead is chase the pixies around the room, slashing at them with your sword until you've killed them all and can get your chest back. The problem here is that the pixies are fast and will continually move away from the player character, whilst the character cannot move while swinging his sword. And so a merry game of trying to manouvre the pixies into a corner ensues. And this will happen every few rooms. It's not that difficult to get the chest back, it's just tedious and annoying.\n\nThere are other exmples that I won't go into an extended explanation of as they all tend to end with the same reaction of 'Why am I doing this? What's the point?' and a feeling that your time has been wasted.\n\nOther, although much less prominent, annoyances exist in the game, such as: parts of broken objects covering the trigger plates for traps so you can't even see them, enemy attacks that cause you to drop your only melee weapon so you have to go running around to find it again, status effects that make you run in random directions (usually straight at the nearest wall) for an intolerably long time and the fact that the bomb launcher (secondary weapon) is about as effective as launching an attack on a Tiger tank with firecrackers.\n\nThe final negatives about Diehard Dungeon are the bland graphics, uninspired dungeon design and the completely 'meh' soundtrack. Overall this is not a game I would recommend unless you have a whole load of time to waste on pointless tedium and absolutely nothing else to play.","October 15, 2014","false","0.8"," 36 of 54 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","36","54","0","0"

In this top-down 2D dungeon crawler, the main goal is to explore and survive a succession of randomly generated rooms populated by various enemies. Amassing gold, avoiding traps, and collecting golden keys are the things you will have to do to reach the end of each level, all the while fighting your way through the different rooms and trying to collect power-ups that are spread around.\n\nIn order to help you in this task, you are equipped with a sword which acts as a melee weapon, and a Hand Cannon which throws explosive projectiles. You will also be followed during your exploration by a magical chest, which acts as a companion and collects gold for you. After some time, it evolves and can become an active item, defending you throughout the levels.\n\nThe controls in DieHard Dungeon are fairly easy, and a simple tutorial will help you get the hang of things. The game is best played with a controller, as it was firstly meant to be played on the Xbox Live Indiegame Marketplace.\n\nWhile it borrows most of its aesthetics from The Legend of Zelda, DieHard Dungeon is also inspired by another game that’s hugely popular in the rogue-like genre: The Binding of Isaac. Just like in Isaac, the player will be able to find special items that are spread around the levels. In DieHard Dungeon though, power-ups are available thanks to randomly placed chests that act as slot machines. If successful, the player is rewarded with a bonus, which he can accept, or refuse and reroll for a new chance at getting a better power-up. Some enemies will also drop tokens, which can be spent in a Token Well, giving the player another chance at getting better items.\n\nTaking everything into account, DieHard Dungeon feels alive and responsive. The sense of progression is present throughout the different levels. The fact that the dificulty adjusts itself depending on the player’s performance gives him the feeling to be “fed” in a good way: the game grows with the player, and the challenge curve always feels right. The randomly generated levels make the game a new challenge to play each and every time. Unfortunately, unlike in The Binding of Isaac, you are not able at this time to input your own seed. “At this time”, because while the game has been released for over two years now, it is still in active development. TrickTale is constantly improving its creation by adding powerups, challenges, enemies, and by working on the game’s balance. One clever decision that has been made for example is switching the player’s speed from low to high when carrying a key. This change, which will certainly be available in the next patch will definitely help in the game’s dynamics by making the player’s escape a positive action instead of a struggle.\n\nThe main drawback with DieHard Dungeon though, is its lack of diversity in graphics. While trying a bit too hard to pay its respect to its elders, the game lacks creativity in getting a strong visual identity of its own, and therefore may look a bit bland for some people. This problem is felt up to some of the enemies’ patterns which act just like their grand-parents counterparts, or even the charge ability of the player’s sword. While it’s always a good thing to throw a wink at the games that made your childhood and help the player overcome enemies by putting him in a familiar place, it would have been appreciated to see a bit more diversity in this regard.\n\nThere are also a few points in which the game could benefit some tweaks, such as an in-game user interface showing your current collected gold, a timer that could certainly attract the speedrunning scene, or even simply an indicator showing the current level you’re exploring.\n\nDespite these points, DieHard Dungeon feels really nice. The dungeon theme combined with the randomly generated levels, the variety in powerups, and the fact that the dificulty adjusts itself in real time makes it a game that is a real joy to play. The replay value is definitely great, and when you take into account the fact that the game is in active development, that it features a champion level (which is some kind of new game + once you’ve beaten the last boss), and even minigames, all that for a mearly $5, you get a game that not only is an excellent introduction to randomly generated dungeon crawlers, but can stand on its own with no problem whatsoever and definitely deserves your attention.","November 8, 2014","true","1.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I'm compelled to compare the combat and weapons of this game to the first Legend of Zelda. While the combat in Zelda is simple, it is polished and immersive on a level this game does not come close to matching. This is primarily due to Diehard Dungeon's combination of an ultimately unremarkable arsenal, boring enemies, and the mechanics that drive it all. Your primary weapon (as in Zelda) is a sword that is somewhat satisfying to use but is otherwise unremarkable. Your secondary weapon is a very strangely ineffective canon that fires weak, timed mortars that never go where you want them to. While you can get 'upgrades' that improve these weapons and that slightly alter their behavior, you're stuck with just these two. Meanwhile, in Zelda (and several other games you can draw comparisons to), you have a fairly broad array of secondary items to choose from.\n\nIt's no wonder I couldn't be bothered to delve deeper. The foundation of Diehard Dungeon is simply not fun from the get-go. The dull art style does not help either. Overall, the game is just a chaotic mish-mash of genres and is unrewarding and uninspired. I say this because, while it can provide a good challenge, the game feels so average across-the-board that it is a very niche experience.","October 10, 2014","false","0.5"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

This game is innovative in how it feels like you are playing something like a RNG based Legend of Zelda, or something like it.\n\nLet's go over the Pros, Cons, and Neutrals I have found:\nPros- This game is very responsive. The controls are tight, and there are no mystery hits from you or monsters. You know when you get hit or you hit enemies.\nI love the art direction they took with the game, making it 16-bit. It truly feels like I am playing a game straight from the Super Nintendo!\nThis game has a challenge to it, just like a Roguelike should. If Roguelikes are too hard for you, you shouldn't be playing them (Being honest here, so don't whine.)\n\nNeutrals- This game was made for the PC, so the movement is WASD, whereas the attacking buttons are located on the mouse. For someone like myself who is attuned to playing PC games, this wasn't an issue. For all you Console gamers out there, this will be for the fact that you cannot remap your controls.\n\nCons- Every time you start up the game (Be it for the first time, or if you close it and come back to it later) You go through the tutorial. I'm sorry, but I should only have to go through a tutorial for a game ONCE. Having to do it over and over again is just tedious.\nI have not run across any kind of weapon pickups in the game, and this is a shame. Using the same stuff over and over again really hinders the replay value. Would I like to keep playing? Of course! But, give me some new stuff to lay waste to dungeon minions please!\n\nOverall, I give this game am 8/10. Great game, just needs some added work to make it amazing.","March 16, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Using a controller is significantly better, and perhaps the way to go. if you dont have a controller, dont be encouraged to pick this up. if you dont a have an official controller (meanign the game doesnt detect it) google and download "joy to key" program, you can rebind your controller to make each button count as a specific key stroke.\n\nEDIT: I left the statement above to serve the purpose of showing that the developers do care for the game. the keys are now rebindable allowing for a custom configuration, which permits for a much confortable expeirnce\n\nThe game is hardcore roguelike, meaning it follows tipical standards of the genre. you only get 1 life, once its gone, you gotto start all over again. the game is going to be repetitive, however each time you learn something more, you improve, and the feeling of stepping into new heights is unique, and personally, very gratifying. I dont feel this game hits that feeling just yet, so far I have only dropped about 1 hour, so this learning feeling hasnt kicked in yet, maybe it wont.\n\nEDIT: after revisiting the game and passing it about twice, I can openly say that the experience has been enhanced while maintaining a good sense of difficulty, as some mechanics which made it a unfair for the player were polished and/or eliminated, EX: the sword swing delay\n\nThe combat is simple. your given a sword and a handcannon (think of it as a bomb launcher, meaning this "bomb" has a fuse on it. it wont explode on impact, it actually damages and bounces away from whatever is struck). the handcannon is unique in feel and learning how to work it out is solid.\n\nEdit: The sword on the other hand is the true meaning of "mastering simplicity." it is a basic horizontal swing forward, not much more/less, and perhaps is its simplicity that gives it its charm.\n\nThis new style allows for a fresh feeling. some enemies make you weight the importance of your sword and its contrast with the cannon. while you can swing your sword much faster for much higher damage, your cannon allows for a safer aproach, and mixing but properly is what gives you a gratifying feeling of success.\n\nThere is also a score attack called "mayhem", its strainght to the point a and you will play it once or twice for the sake of taking away the taste of a failed run, it helps to steam down very well.\n\nThe asthetics of the game are ok. the music isnt spectacular, but gets the right feeling going, meaing its just fine.\nThe game uses a pixel style meaning it feels like "Legend of Zelda a Link to the Past" nothing that will win an award, but a nice style considering the gameplay. fits nicely.\n\nMost discussed above can be disregarded almost entirely by personal taste though. The game can be picked and played quickly, specially for the low cost of the game itself and the simplistic gameplay, while still providing that roguelike feeling of "learning through repeated failure."\n\nIf your looking for a hardcore Roguelike gamplay, "the binding of isaac" or "our darker purpose" will quench that thirst. but if your on the much more into quick and simple, this is a  better choice. the game is also getting updated, sentence that I hold strong.\n\nNonetheless, if you have found great experience in games like rogue legacy, binding of isaac or risk of rain, this might come as a shorter burst of that flavor\n\nEdit: I would also like to make a strong sense of respect as my original review used to say that i didnt recommend this game, mostly on a bases that if 100 ppl played it, less that half would like it, (some original machanics, which are no longer there, made it difficult to enjoy properly).\nI stand chaged, most wont love it, but will play it, and few will learn to cherish it, enogh to comeback untill that 100% is there.","March 5, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","8"

I've played less than thirty minutes of this game and already love it.  As you know me (if you have read past reviews of mine) I am a frugal gamer.  Perhaps that should be my thing?  Anyway, this game went on sale recently for $2.24 and couldn't resist.  "Zelda" was in the description, so I threw my money at Steam.\n\nSo, like I said I love it.  It'll probably get stale with time, but this is a great pickup-and-play-rogue-like adventure.  The way it plays reminds me a lot of "Binding of Isaac".  You go through various rooms picking up keys, hearts and power-ups.  Every so often you enter a room with a big-ol' boss baddy you have to defeat.  And just like "Binding of Isaac", the level layout is always changing so each time you die, the whole structure gets rearranged (thus my "rogue-like" description) and you lose your power-ups and have to start over again.  This makes each time you play a bit unique and different.  Any subtle hint of change always gives a game a bit more life to it so it doesn't become stale so easily.\n\nNow, I'm going to say this and I'm sure many people will disagree, but I like this much better than "Binding of Isaac" (Sorry to keep comparing it to that, but it's the only relation I know as far as style and I know MANY people have played "BoI").  The main, and probably sole reason, I like this more than "BoI" is that it is much more forgiving.  I'm not a great gamer, but I'm also no newbie. With that said, "BoI" is TOUGH for me.  Bosses are tough to get through, and when I make it I'm shocked and awed.  This does make it all the more rewarding, but like I mentioned before, when you die in "BoI", you lose everything and have to restart.  Needless to say, I die a lot in that game, become discouraged after ten minutes of play, and don't touch it for four months. With "Diehard Dungeon" I feel like I can make it pretty far without dying.  There's still a challenge, but I'm not getting slaughtered after only a handful of rooms.  I also feel like they're a little more generous with the power-ups, which makes this a little more rewarding and fun.\n\nNow, enough comparison.  Overall this game is addictive and makes me want to go deeper and deeper into this dungeon.  The style is very much in the vain of "Link to the Past" which is a lazy description I know, but it's the first thing that comes to mind.  It's got that heavy pixelated look which has become ever so popular.  As far as game play goes, yes it is like "BoI" (I swear that's the last time) BUT there are mini-games, too, with a global scoreboard, which definitely adds some replay value.  If you have just a bit of hardcore gamer in you, but also just want a casual game to play, this will be a perfect game to fulfill that need. A great edition to any gamers' Steam library.\n","October 4, 2014","true","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Diehard Dungeon is one of the few that I really love.\n\nI'm not a fan of 8-bit style anymore, but it works well for this game. Sometimes the screen does get cluttered and you accidently step on a pressure plate, triggering a trap, but you learn how to watch out for things like that.\n\nYou have a loot chest (like a mimic) who follows you around and collects the treasure, leveling up when it gains enough. At higher levels, the chest will gain ranged attacks and join you in fights. But there are also little imps who only attack the chest, and prevents the chest from collecting any loot while it's being chased around the room.\n\nThe games difficulty adjusts with your success or failure, so you always get a suitable challenge. It took me 6 attempts before I first escaped the dungeon, and it unlocked optional champions who wander the edge of the dungeon on top of the walls and jump down to attack you... all while you are dealing with the regular room stuff like traps, monsters, etc.\n\nThe game has a large variety of perks you can gain through a single dungeon delve and the ones you find are randomized. In one game, I gained the ability to hide in my loot chest, so monsters wouldn't be able to find me. Great if you need a breather and accidently bite off too many monsters at once. Other times I'm gained throwing knives, or flame resistance. All of them offer different ways to play the game, so it always keeps it fresh and interesting.\n\nOverall, I think this is the first rogue-like game in a long while with enough variety to keep me coming back time after time. Highly recommended.","January 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a fun game but it can be pretty hard and the bosses are tough in my opinion.\n\nMain ReviewIn Diehard Dungeon you control a character that has a sword and a gun that shoots out bombs. The gameplay and controls feel very similar to an older Legend of Zelda game. There is even the spin attack. Each time you enter the dungeon you fight against random rooms of enemies. Eventually after clearing so many rooms you fight a boss. You do this about three times and then you fight the final boss. I think the gameplay is fun but it can get repetitive. Maybe I just suck but I rarely can beat this game. That being said I am trying to get to Diehard rank. This is like playing the game on very hard. The game has multiple challenge modes if the main game mode gets boring.\n\nThe Good The game has lots of replayability.\nIf you like being on lists then this game can scratch that itch for you.\nThe bad The game does feel repetitive after so many plays.\nIf you let the difficulty get too high without ever lowering it the game becomes very difficult.\nFinal ThoughtsIf you like the look and feel of an older Legend of Zelda game, for example A Link to the Past and you like Rogue-Lite games then this game will be fun and I recommend it. That being said if somewhat repetitive dungeons and irritating enemies and bosses is a turn off then maybe you will not like this game.

Not the first game I'd point to when recommending a game from the genre, but it should prove reasonably enjoyable for fans of the genre.  The one point I'd have to complain about is the weapon system.\n\nIn the game you're given 2 weapons, the sword and the hand-cannon.  The problem with sword is that, even with all the upgrades, its reach is far too shallow, causing the player to get hit himself 50% of the time.  The problem with the Hand-Cannon is that it launches something akin to grenades, the projectile having a delay before it detonates.  This often leaves the player with the only option of launching the projectiles at enemy and having them bounce off, causing sub-optimal damage.\n\nNeither of weapons gives a lasting satisfaction when defeating an enemy like almost any weapon in a comparable top-down dungeon crawlers does (eg; Zelda).  If you can get past this fact, then it's pretty enjoyable, and definately recommendable at such a paltry price as $5.","March 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you grew up with 8-bit graphics and you like a challenge that would be another reason to pick this up. It has steam cards and if you sell those on the market this game is less than 4 bucks for hours of entertainment.\n\nThere is a mayhem mode which is basically a twin stick shooter where you compare scores on a leaderboard with your friends and other gamers world wide.  Nothing spectacular but again...the game is $4.\n\nGameplay wise it doesn't get old until a few hours in.  This is a rogue-like so it's one of those where after 1 death, you start over from the very beginning.  You will lose health is some really cheap ways too.  I found myself getting frustrated from the cheap deaths on more than one occasion but thats when you just boot up a differant game and come back later.","March 11, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You get a sword, a gun that shoots time-bombs, and a chest that follows you around. If you die you lose some of your stuff and have to start over, but since the dungeon seems to be more or less the same everywhere, this is not really a huge setback.\n\nThis is not a ♥♥♥♥ing rogue-like. You idiots need to stop slapping that tag on every ♥♥♥♥ing game on Steam. Go play Rogue so you can tell the difference, ffs.\n\nAnyway, this is not a bad game. It's fun to play and it looks like there's still updates happening. My only real complaint is that it leaves too much debris everywhere, which detracts from the gratifyingly clean feeling that you get from clearing a room in Zelda.

There's no shop.\n\nYou collect rings or something. But what do they do? They don't seem to do anything.\n\nYou've got a treasure chest that follows you around - and it can level up - but what's it do? What's the level up do? What's the point of the chest, except being able to hide in if you get a rare lucky roll? The chest seems like it's central to game's uniqueness, but it doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nI beat the boss - but he was the same as an enemy I had already fought several times before, all he does is run at you, and then I went to the next set of levels - which was more or less just like the last set, except a bit harder.\n\nEvery time you die, you lose all the stuff you've been collecting, and it never seems to help you or do anything in any way.\n\nAll in all, I didn't want to get better at this game, I didn't want to explore to see what else the game had to offer, I didn't want to beat it - because everything about it was boring as spit.\n\nI'm not sure what I paid for this, but whatever it was it was too much, because I've gotten vastly more enjoyment out of free flash games.\n\nSorry.","February 7, 2015","false","1.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

If you really love classic topdown Zelda combat, you could get something out of it. Still, you're probably better off with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, since this game is just a less fun version of that.\n\nOther things that suck about this game:\n\n-The powerups you get are all really minor and inexplicably rare.\n-Really awful graphics. Blocky 16-bit sprites can look great, but this is muddy and ugly.\n-The ranged weapon they give you highly discourages actually fighting enemies, since you can plink at them forever and not risk taking damage. This is boring.\n\nTo its credit, the game does the following well:\n\n-Good difficulty curve. Tough but almost always fair, you can generally learn from your mistakes.\n-"Champion" mechanic where your character can screw with other people's games after you beat it once. AI controlled, so this is more just a "oh, that's cute" thing than really interesting or annoying - it basically just puts your name over an ingame monster.\n-The combat itself is fairly solid, if you don't just hang back and shoot at enemies 1 damage at a time.\n\nThis one is up to you.

You collect coins and rings which serve absolutely no purpose, no long term investments that make you want to play again after you die or beat the game.  If you like playing a game that will get harder over time but everything else essentially stays the same, then this game is for you.  Hearts are pretty rare which isnt the worst thing in the world, but honestly the gameplay is just very repetitive and boring.  The fact that the coins and rings are in the game is just stupid, i was expecting there to be shops or equipable items (i know there are some, but they are rare and the benefit is hardly noticable or worth it).  Even the most simple thing like different weapons or gear to equip would have made this game more enjoyable, but there was little suspence in terms of finding new items for me.\nAgain, i bought this for like a dollar so i guess it is worth the money, but compared to other roguelike games, there is little to no character progression that would make me want to play for hours and hours much like other games have (binding of issac, risk or rain, FTL etc) from somone who has hundreds of games on steam and is always looking for a great time killer i have to say there are way better options and this game will simply go in the folder of "not bad but dont really want to play again"","April 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I bought Diehard Dungeon while it was on offer, the reviews warned that it was like a very hard Zelda style dungeon slasher. When it said hard, I didn't expect it to be AS hard as it is. Part of me is glad I didn't pay a lot for this game. For the simple fact, it's not suited for the casual gamer. If like me, you play games to relax and have an hour of enjoyment, Diehard Dungeon will leave you ever so slightly frustrated.\n\nMy hat is off to the developers, it's a lovely thought out game and really looks like something you'd see on the SNES, but thats about all it does do. DD feels like it only caters toward a certain type of gamer. Those who dont mind repeating the same motions over and over again. Frankly I got bored very quickly of dying and loosing everything I had achieved. What is the point of a retry, if you dont continue from were you left off?\nI was really looking forward to some old skool style gaming and for the first 2-3 minutes DD felt like it actually would come up with the goods. Then as I played more, disappointment set in as I realised thats not what this game offers.  Games should leave the player feeling they have a fair chance at winning and I dont get that feeling from DD. I dont regret buying it, I just regret it fell short of the mark.\n\n\n\nWho knows, dying a few more dozen times in the dungeon might change my mind, tho I think not","August 12, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

You might fall into thinking you'd be better of with a controller, a keyboard works better. =) Great Game, pretty straight forward positive review, don't listen to the negative reviews. They just blame the light side of reviews and insult our reviews for lacking descriptive text when all they say is it's "clunky." Which it is the complete opposite. If you're good at keeping track of things even when there is enemies charging at you, you will suceed, I just run into a trap mostly since the triggers are hard to recognize when you're running.

This game is a waste of the seventy-five cents I paid for it.  The 'roguelike' elements are extremely shallow.  There's little form of character progression other than unlocking harder modes.  A treasure chest 'companion' levels up (and it caps out fairly quickly) although not to much effect.  Itemization is similarly lacking: you have a sword and a gun and... that's it.  They don't upgrade.  There are 'perk' cards you can find although I only manged to stumble on one in about an hour of gameplay and you are limited to two total.

The main glitch I am talking about is how sometimes I can be walking away from an enemy and swinging at him but my attack direction gets, for no reason, temporarily locked in the opposite direction. So I am desperately trying to swing in the right direction but instead am taking massive dmg from that side because I am defenseless. That and I can be having a perfect run, never even taking one hit, then all of a sudden I get thrown into a situation that is unavoidable and all of my life is drained right away, game over permadeath. That is one thing I also hate, permadeath games. That is just what I want, for all of my hard work to be thrown down the toilet because the developers programmed the game to screw me over as hard as it can in certain spots. In my mind, permadeath is just an excuse to pull a blanket over a game's other flaws such as how short it is, in which I have no doubt this one is probably pretty short. But i may never beat it because of the sheer amount of different ways to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttingly die, especially boss fights. You have to get too close to attack and it is way too easy to get hit by a boss and they just obliterate me and I feel totally powerless. I started just hitting them with my cannon and it worked and I could beat them, but after beating 3 bosses and playing for over an hour, the real problem dropped: I was doing great then a guy with a spiked wooden shield backed me into a corner and drained me from 6 hearts to zero, game over, all that work lost. There are some enemies who run from you and you have to chase them to the other side of the room to kill them, and little green things that hop around the map and hit traps that send an arrow from off-screen to hit you unknowingly. That is probably the game's biggest flaw, other than the BS deaths, is that it is zoomed in way too far. It seems like I only ever take dmg because I have no idea what is going on around me because I can only see a few feet around my guy. It really is terrible how far in it is zoomed. I mean I have two and a half hours in this already and do not feel like I have gotten even a slight bit of progress towards ever beating it, and probably never will, and do not care in the slightest bit because it only cost a dollar to find out if this game has any redeeming qualities, in which it has zero. I just uninstalled this and couldn't be happier.","November 5, 2014","false","3.7"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","5","22","0","0"

The keyboard/mouse controls are absolutely horrible though, so I highly suggest you play using a gamepad and joy2key or something similar.\n\nThe game uses a perk system to power up your character as you progress in a very similar nature to hero siege. The perk system makes every run a unique play, as different combinations of perks lead to different playing styles. You also have a companion chest that upgrades to fight enemies as you collect loot. Combat in the game is acceptable and reminds me of a top down Zelda but there is less than ideal enemy variety. The boss fights are uninspired and lack any challenge the second time around.

Your sword swing does three per swing. And you can do it a few times a second. So... yeah. You also have a box that follows you around and changes colors as it picks up gold. Why? Not sure.

Just not worth more than $5. Within 10 to 20 minutes you'll "get it" and within 2 hours you'll beat it. At that point you'll either want more or be done. $5 for 2-3 hours of entertainment with the possibility of much more isn't so bad.\n\nFor the most part, what's new in this game isn't fun and what's fun in this game isn't new. It's still very enjoyable, but it will be very familiar. Unlike many dungeon crawler games with this camera angle, you have a gun! It shoots cannonballs that explode, dealing more damage. It's supposedly a skill-based projectile, but in reality you just fire it directly at the enemy because all the enemies AI is "walk towards you" or "walk towards you, run away when you get near" or "run around like a chicken with its head cut off". I feel that it would have been more fun to use the projectile if the AI took a bit more thought to outsmart; most rooms can be flawlessly cleared by standing in a corner and shooting your cannon over and over until you kill things off screen, doubly so with upgrades.\n\nThe upgrades are sensible and fun and your playthroughs are basically determined by them. If you get good ones (see: relating to ranged attacks) you'll win easily, if you get bad ones you'll have to make smart choices to win. It is fun to get ugprades and change your play based on how you get them, but its mostly just more effective versions of the same thing.\n\nThat said, it's a fun game that actually gets harder the more you play it. If you REALLY enjoy this type of game, you can keep playing and it will get harder and harder. Get frustrated from losing? The game gets easier. It's a good system, although it's kinda "meh" in its implementation; I beat the game at the "warrior" level, which is the 3rd level in the chain. There's many more levels and I'd imagine the game is way more fun at those levels, but it doesn't allow for it without extensive playtime, so I guess I'll never see it.\n\nThis is a pick up and play when you've got 30 minutes to play a game or don't want to get invested in a long term committment.

It keeps giving me titles as I play, going back and forth between rogue and fighter or something. I don't seem to get any stronger when I level. And when I die I don't get any weaker. So what's the point? You have a bit more control over the drops here than you do in the binding of isaac, but all of these upgrades are crap. There's one that requires you to fire your bomb gun, bounce a bomb off a wall, strike the bomb, and send it at the enemies as a wave of hellfire!... for one damage. Your sword swing does three per swing. And you can do it a few times a second. So... yeah. You also have a box that follows you around and changes colors as it picks up gold. Why? Not sure. Game doesn't really tell you. It just "levels up" and loses those levels still when you die. Whatever. Big tease.

I'm only about an hour and 10 minutes into the game at the time of writing this, but I can honestly say I'm enjoying this far more than Binding of Isaac.\n\nPositives\n+Graphics are pixelated, many people get upset by this but honestly it fits the game and doesn't bother me.\n\n+Minigames on certain chests, that are actually kind of fun so far. The one I have seen (I know there are more) is a pacman like one. (There is a seperate minigame menu that leads to different minigames, one of which is akin to Geometry Wars/Asteroids but with a theme that matches the game)\n\n+Controls are easy to learn, and offers controller support for at the least XBox 360 controllers (have not tested ps3, ps4, XBox One, etc)\n\n+Two weapon types that I have seen thus far, a sword that controls similarly to Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES, and a sort of grenade launcher with bombs that bounce off walls and enemies (takes some getting used to, but once one gets the hang of it, it becomes very useful).\n\n+The game actually has a tutorial as opposed to a one room picture of "lol space is bombs and left stick moves while right stick shoots, good luck out there!"\n\n+You can change the color of your character's clothing (Yeah, I consider this a positive. What of it?)\n\n+You start with a companion chest which stores treasure for you. When you collect enough, the chest will upgrade and eventually start defending you and fighting back. Chest gets stronger with each level, naturally.\n\n+If you have collected 10 golden keys throughout your run, you can open a special chest and receive a "perk" which will carry through to the next game (I think this is how it works, anyways.) This was one thing I didn't like about Binding of Isaac, not one thing carried over no matter how good the run was or how much effort you put into it; all you could do was unlock new things.\n\n+Very reasonable price, I got it on sale for $1 and some loose change, and after playing it can honestly say I'd have paid for the full price and still felt good about my purchase.\n\n+Tokens go into token wells, which will give you money/health/items. Any un-spent tokens will carry over into the next game.\n\nNegatives\n\n-Hitboxes can sometimes be janky\n\n-In the tutorial area, there were chests on top of the walls. Maybe there is a secret way to get to them, or it was a one time bug on my end; but either way I felt this should be noted. However, there have been no other issues with wall-chests after tutorial.\n\n-The sword isn't particularly useful past smashing crates or hitting switches, unless you get some upgrades for it. Most of the time, you will end up spamming your cannon.\n\n\n\nAll in all, I feel this is a very good game for a very good price. Now I'm off to get another hour or two into it!","July 10, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I myself consider me to be a man of rogue likes and I have played many and beat many and I have to say that all of the people who seem to talk negatively about this game aren't really justified in doing so. Weapon choices are limited, because it's not like the prestigious Binding of Isaac with all of its weapons in which change how the game goes dramatically. Instead, it nods to previous games such a Zelda. A rogue-like doesn't need all of that to be good. All it needs is this sense of difficulty in which attracts an individual and makes them want to play over and over again. Graphics.... They have little to do with this review, but I would say they meet the standard for what is needed to be a decent rogue-like. Just like Binding of Isaac, Pixel Piracy, or Paranautical activity it has its own unique feeling which is unique to this game.  In conclusion I find this game to be wonderful. 8/10. The only thing that it was really lacking in was size. However, it does makeup for it due to replayability and the difficulty scaling system that it has.","November 30, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm sure I don't have to explain what you do but basically you get a chest companion who picks up your loot for you while you run around mashing x and somethings hitting right trigger then x to shoot a blueberry-canon type projectile.\n\nIt has random powere ups you get from chests randomly placed throughout the maps, except for the chest you get from the very beginning. My only problem with this system is that the chests act like a slot machine and don't guarantee you anything, which is annoying. I'd rather just open a chest and get a piece of gold rather than wait there and watch the reels whirl to reveal I get nothing from tche chest.\n\nThere's no guard or parry button, which is a little disappointing but not really that big of a deal. Anyone who can beat this game without that definitely has my respect, because this game is pretty challenging.\n\nI don't understand the canon to well but I'm starting to get use to it. It doesn't explode on impact and it doesn't hurt you however it sends out a blast radius that supposedly hurts enemies and pushes you around, which is kind of annoying to be honest. I hate it but when my health gets low I tend to spam it to keep myself from dieing.\n\nOne last thing that bothers me is some of the achievements are for getting abilities, which are randomly rewarded to you. I don't like that because you could theoretically play for longer than this game is fun and not get the achievement for getting some random ability. Not really a big deal, but I figured some people would be deterred by that if they were achievement hunters.\n\nI hope this doesn't look to negative, because this game is actually quite fun to play. Plus it has mini games, which I haven't unlocked all of but that little extra is pretty amazing. Everything not listed here is pretty much well above average and well above the expectations I had going in to this game.","November 27, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #46 - Diehard Dungeon\n\nPlaying Diehard Dungeon feels like reading a love letter to the original Zelda game.  And I don't mean this to accuse this game of being Zelda ripoff, but you can clearly see the inspiration.  The gameplay is very Zelda-like in how you move through dungeons and unlock new rooms while fighting various enemies.  There are also various destructible crates and other items that you can break open for loot.  Rooms often have traps, triggered by floor plates, that you have to keep an eye open for.\n\nThe art is also retro styled.  It's a bit on the dreary side, but I get that it's supposed to represent a dungeon.  Sometimes it's nice to see some color though, and not just on the loot that drops. Mostly my only complaint about the art is sometimes the background and items have a way of blending together to make it hard to tell which items are 'destructible' from already broken containers littering the floor.  This can also cover up items that you haven't picked up yet, which can be a pain because often the rooms require a key to get out, and you don't realize a key has been dropped.\n\nI liked the music okay, and felt like it blended well with the environment and gameplay, but I can also see where it's going to start feeling repetitive.  Hopefully it changes up some after more gameplay.\n\nCombat is pretty straightforward.  You have a melee attack with a sword, and a hand cannon.  Melee attacks work just like you'd expect.  The hand cannon takes a little more getting used to.  It shoots a cannonball and hits anything in it's path, much like firing an arrow would.  But the cannonball will bounce off of walls if there are any in it's path, meaning you might find your shot coming right back to you.   After a few seconds the cannonball explodes.\n\nAs a roguelike, the permadeath may be a bit of a turnoff.  Some roguelike games have something of a progression so that as you play you unlock things that make subsequent playthroughs easier (and thus enable even harder areas).  But this seems more like the classic roguelike where the game starts the same way each time.\n\nMy hour of play wasn't enough to get a good sense of how progression works in the game.  It was enough time to get several playthroughs, but most of them ended in the same way.  That would be making it to a boss fight with 1 or 2 hearts of health left, and then failing to kill the boss.\n\nIt seems like you are really at the mercy of the random number generator when it comes to getting life back.  I've seen some rooms that will drop 3 hearts (which at the time I didn't need), and other rooms not drop a single one (when I'm down to a single heart).  I won't go so far as to say this is Dark Souls difficult, but I definitely had a hard time making it to the boss unscathed.\n\nI really hestiate to call this an RPG, even though it's tagged as one.  For one, there really isn't any story to speak of here.  There's no experience points or levels or classes or skills.  Also there isn't really any character customization to speak of, other than customizing your look from the main menu.  So it seems a stretch to call this an RPG.\n\nThe most unexpected part of this game was the minigames.  There are 3 minigames total, but to start with you only have access to 1, and it's called Mayhem, which is a good description.  In Mayhem you have 3 minutes to get the highest score possible, but instead of exploring a dungeon, it turns the game into a dual stick shooter.  I have to admit, I ended up having more fun with this minigame than I did the main game itself.\n\nI still have some reservations about the long term enjoyment of this game, but I'm going to give it a lukewarm recommendation nonetheless.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #46 - Diehard Dungeon\n\nPlaying Diehard Dungeon feels like reading a love letter to the original Zelda game.  And I don't mean this to accuse this game of being Zelda ripoff, but you can clearly see the inspiration.  The gameplay is very Zelda-like in how you move through dungeons and unlock new rooms while fighting various enemies.  There are also various destructible crates and other items that you can break open for loot.  Rooms often have traps, triggered by floor plates, that you have to keep an eye open for.\n\nThe art is also retro styled.  It's a bit on the dreary side, but I get that it's supposed to represent a dungeon.  Sometimes it's nice to see some color though, and not just on the loot that drops. Mostly my only complaint about the art is sometimes the background and items have a way of blending together to make it hard to tell which items are 'destructible' from already broken containers littering the floor.  This can also cover up items that you haven't picked up yet, which can be a pain because often the rooms require a key to get out, and you don't realize a key has been dropped.\n\nI liked the music okay, and felt like it blended well with the environment and gameplay, but I can also see where it's going to start feeling repetitive.  Hopefully it changes up some after more gameplay.\n\nCombat is pretty straightforward.  You have a melee attack with a sword, and a hand cannon.  Melee attacks work just like you'd expect.  The hand cannon takes a little more getting used to.  It shoots a cannonball and hits anything in it's path, much like firing an arrow would.  But the cannonball will bounce off of walls if there are any in it's path, meaning you might find your shot coming right back to you.   After a few seconds the cannonball explodes.\n\nAs a roguelike, the permadeath may be a bit of a turnoff.  Some roguelike games have something of a progression so that as you play you unlock things that make subsequent playthroughs easier (and thus enable even harder areas).  But this seems more like the classic roguelike where the game starts the same way each time.\n\nMy hour of play wasn't enough to get a good sense of how progression works in the game.  It was enough time to get several playthroughs, but most of them ended in the same way.  That would be making it to a boss fight with 1 or 2 hearts of health left, and then failing to kill the boss.\n\nIt seems like you are really at the mercy of the random number generator when it comes to getting life back.  I've seen some rooms that will drop 3 hearts (which at the time I didn't need), and other rooms not drop a single one (when I'm down to a single heart).  I won't go so far as to say this is Dark Souls difficult, but I definitely had a hard time making it to the boss unscathed.\n\nI really hestiate to call this an RPG, even though it's tagged as one.  For one, there really isn't any story to speak of here.  There's no experience points or levels or classes or skills.  Also there isn't really any character customization to speak of, other than customizing your look from the main menu.  So it seems a stretch to call this an RPG.\n\nThe most unexpected part of this game was the minigames.  There are 3 minigames total, but to start with you only have access to 1, and it's called Mayhem, which is a good description.  In Mayhem you have 3 minutes to get the highest score possible, but instead of exploring a dungeon, it turns the game into a dual stick shooter.  I have to admit, I ended up having more fun with this minigame than I did the main game itself.\n\nI still have some reservations about the long term enjoyment of this game, but I'm going to give it a lukewarm recommendation nonetheless.  For $4.99, I do think there is enough fun to be had in this game to justify the price, even if it doesn't end up keeping your attention for the long term.","December 11, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I myself consider me to be a man of rogue likes and I have played many and beat many and I have to say that all of the people who seem to talk negatively about this game aren't really justified in doing so. Weapon choices are limited, because it's not like the prestigious Binding of Isaac with all of its weapons in which change how the game goes dramatically. Instead, it nods to previous games such a Zelda. A rogue-like doesn't need all of that to be good. All it needs is this sense of difficulty in which attracts an individual and makes them want to play over and over again. Graphics.... They have little to do with this review, but I would say they meet the standard for what is needed to be a decent rogue-like. Just like Binding of Isaac, Pixel Piracy, or Paranautical activity it has its own unique feeling which is unique to this game.  In conclusion I find this game to be wonderful. 8/10. The only thing that it was really lacking in was size. However, it does makeup for it due to replayability and the difficulty scaling system that it has.","November 30, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm sure I don't have to explain what you do but basically you get a chest companion who picks up your loot for you while you run around mashing x and somethings hitting right trigger then x to shoot a blueberry-canon type projectile.\n\nIt has random powere ups you get from chests randomly placed throughout the maps, except for the chest you get from the very beginning. My only problem with this system is that the chests act like a slot machine and don't guarantee you anything, which is annoying. I'd rather just open a chest and get a piece of gold rather than wait there and watch the reels whirl to reveal I get nothing from tche chest.\n\nThere's no guard or parry button, which is a little disappointing but not really that big of a deal. Anyone who can beat this game without that definitely has my respect, because this game is pretty challenging.\n\nI don't understand the canon to well but I'm starting to get use to it. It doesn't explode on impact and it doesn't hurt you however it sends out a blast radius that supposedly hurts enemies and pushes you around, which is kind of annoying to be honest. I hate it but when my health gets low I tend to spam it to keep myself from dieing.\n\nOne last thing that bothers me is some of the achievements are for getting abilities, which are randomly rewarded to you. I don't like that because you could theoretically play for longer than this game is fun and not get the achievement for getting some random ability. Not really a big deal, but I figured some people would be deterred by that if they were achievement hunters.\n\nI hope this doesn't look to negative, because this game is actually quite fun to play. Plus it has mini games, which I haven't unlocked all of but that little extra is pretty amazing. Everything not listed here is pretty much well above average and well above the expectations I had going in to this game.","November 27, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/277870/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Diehard Dungeon is a homage to the dungeon crawlers of old, mixed with some new, combined into a retro styled game that is not only aptly named but also a lot of fun to play.\n\nDiehard Dungeon has you making your way though a series of dungeons, collecting gold keys and fighting various monsters and other enemies in an ultimate search for loot and glory.  It has a surprisingly large amount of depth for a game with no story, and oddly enough, has a mini-game included that is almost worth the purchase price alone.\n\nThe game starts you off alone, in a dungeon with nothing.  You quickly find your sword and a few stages later the Companion Chest. The Companion Chest stores your treasure (you never actually access it though) and will even help you fight your way through the dungeon.  Upon your first boss battle you will also pick up a hand-cannon, which is literally, a handgun that shoots cannon balls.  These make up your primary combat abilities in the game, with your sword being the focus ultimately. At the core, Diehard Dungeon is a hack and slash, but positioning yourself properly against certain foes is still important, as is proper use of the hand-cannon.  As one might expect, with such a simple combat system the controls are also pretty simple.\n\nSpeaking of abilities, rather than leveling up and using experience points or any system like that; Diehard Dungeon simply has you find or win extra abilities. You can find them in chests that operate like slot machines, a mini “trap-door” game or just laying on the ground. These range from becoming fireproof, adding shrapnel to your hand-cannon or as suggested before, an ability that allows you to kill everything on screen in exchange for one heart of life by pressing B.  These abilities are random and make all the difference in your ability to make it through the dungeon in one piece.  This makes finding and collecting the abilities incredibly important, but also leads to one of the main downsides to the game.\n\nWhile Diehard Dungeon is a blast to play, the name is very appropriate. The game uses a simple “heart” system of health, where each hit takes one away and you can add more (if you find some) along the way.  That said, when you die, there is no check point; you don’t go back to the beginning of that dungeon room with all that you had when you got there; no, you go back, all the way back. To the beginning. With nothing. While this certainly makes death a big deal, it is frustrating when you seem to have a fairly decent start but then a really tough middle-range area in the game.  Basically, if you get overwhelmed in a single room (which happened to me on a couple of occasions) you drop all of your progress from the last half hour and start over again; something made even more possible by the fact health can sometimes be quite rare.  Does it add more weight to your death? Absolutely. Does it make you fight that much harder to not die? Of course. Does it make you absolutely want to stop playing the game for a few minutes after? You bet your ♥♥♥ it does.\n\nLuckily the game does offer another mode of play to distract you for a bit while you let the anger inside you dissipate.  The mini-game “Mayhem” is not only fun, it comes close to overshadowing the main game. Who would have guess that built within a dungeon crawler would be one of the better twin-stick shooters on the XBLIG service?  Mayhem has you playing as the Companion Chest in a room that quickly fills with enemies.  The goal is ultimately to get as high of a score as possible in only three minutes, but the “gimmick” is that your score multiplier only goes up if you don’t get hit.  It is, simply put; a blast and you will strive to reach higher and higher on the leaderboard (I managed to take first place for an evening).  The one downside to this mode is that quite often it seemed I was “being hit’ when there was no conceivable way that I actually was (unless the game punishes you for standing still).  I was clearly not near any enemies (or crates) yet felt my controller vibrate like I was hit and saw that my multiplier had gone down as well.  I’m assuming there was a reason for it that I just didn’t realize, but for the life of me I don’t know what it was.\n\nBack to the main game, there is one other… issue that soured Diehard Dungeon’s experience.  Despite playing through the game well (well? I kicked ♥♥♥) and killing everything in sight and breaking every crate open, I still made it to what I presume is the end of the game without enough golden keys to open the giant chest at the end; so I died and lost anyway.  Looking at the developer’s website, “gold key rarity” is something that is planned to be patched in an updating coming any day now, so this is hopefully a non-issue going forward but it was incredibly frustrating to have gotten to the end and still lost because the game simply didn’t generate enough of a crucial item.\n\nDeath resetting everything is rough, but it is part of the game and what makes it work (even if you kind of hate it in the moment).  A lack of a crucial item that makes an otherwise successful run a waste of time though is very, very close to being a deal breaker. Luckily for Diehard Dungeon, it was fun getting to that point and the mini-game Mayhem compensates for this oversight.  Hopefully the patch will fix it, along with a lot of other changes coming soon as the patch is approved, but it is enough to take a great game and knock it down from where it should be; for now anyway.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 25, 2014","true","39.5"," 55 of 66 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","55","66","0","0"

A+ very good game!!!” or “Homage to old dungeon crawlers” when the fact of the matter is that it’s just not a very good game. The best thing it does is work without crashing.\n\nThe weapons given to the player character are a cannon launcher and a sword. These deal unimpressive amounts of damage even with upgrades. There are also perks that the player can pick up a-la Binding of Isaac for abilities. Unlike BoI, however, these perks don’t really change the way that the game is played too much since they either allow the player to avoid hazards or tack on slight effects to the two weapons (e.g., cannonball explosions spawning tiny pools of fire). The player can upgrade their treasure chest companion by collecting gems to the point where it will fire spikes at enemies or dash around into enemies but those are the only other attack that can be performed.\n\nThere are a lot of different sprites for enemy types but they all follow the same pattern: +forward. Everything either runs towards or away from the player, including bosses. This, in combination with the weapons, makes combat really boring and shallow. The gameplay doesn’t particularly change much outside of the included minigame, which is essentially Pac-Man. Click to slash, click to shoot. There’s nothing like BoI’s bullet-hell, active abilities, or item synergy. There’s nothing like Ziggurat’s arena shooter approach to survival (good movement, good positioning, good aim). There’s nothing like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup/Tales of Maj’Eyal/Nethack/others where items and random events legitimately change the player’s experience (e.g., Bearosphere in ToME). In essence, it’s LoZ: A Link to the Past without anything that made LTTP good fused with the permadeath behind Roguelikes.\n\nThe art design is explicitly stated as a “nostalgic 16-bit look and feel” but there’s so much dark and grey and brown, any attempt to have anything that looks at the very least different is crushed. Hammerwatch tackles “retro” in a far superior graphical manner, and Darkest Dungeon utilize black, brown, and grey to create a foreboding atmosphere. Diehard Dungeon just looks like a flash game. There is also a lot of screen clutter in Diehard Dungeon; broken barrels and boxes covering up progression items (keys), tiny shelled critters running around everywhere that don’t deal damage, bouncing spinning spikewheels, etc, all in a small room. Others might say that "this just helps cover up traps!!!" but the fact that it's really easy to see where the physical traps themselves are (spike walls, arrow holes, etc.) defeats the purpose of hiding the trigger.\n\nThe XP system and ability system are completely useless. The only thing gaining XP does is increase the difficulty of the mobs and doesn’t change anything about the player. No power bonus, no extra abilities, nothing. All abilities are acquired via RNG chests where players play slot machines for random abilities, which determine the player’s pace; if the abilities picked up are useful, the player can actually play the game at a reasonable pace. If the abilities are garbage, players are forced to plink away at enemies until the odds roll in their favor. Another reviewer described the game as “tedious” and I can’t help but agree; it’s not a fun timesink, it’s not a game one can leave running in the background like a clicker game, but it requires the player’s undivided attention to open the exit to the current room. It feels familiar but unlike the claims, it does nothing unique or out of the ordinary.\n\nIt’s fitting that Diehard Dungeon was released on Steam on September 11th because this game is a disaster. Spend your $5 (or $0.99 if on sale) somewhere else.","June 21, 2015","false","1.4"," 138 of 215 people (64%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","64","138","215","15","6"

Now i've gotta come up with other things to talk about in the Review :D\n\nI'm a really big fan of action roguelikes, so I'm quite happy to see more coming out and I instantly wanted to give this a shot.\n\nMy first reaction to seeing the trailer was to think that the game may be too derivative of The Binding of Isaac, but luckily I tried out the game and saw how wrong I was.\n\nThis game has a striking resembalance to The Binding of Isaac, as they're both of the same genre and are both seemingly inspired by older entires in the Zelda franchise. The similarites don't go too far though, as it appears that Isaac was based off of the original Zelda, with every room having exactly the same dimensions, whereas Diehard has more similarities to Zelda: A Link to the Past.  The result is a much more organic experience, and your adventure focuses more on each unique room, rather than dungeon floors made up of  maze of bland square areas.\n\nThe combat mechanics are also more developed, with the delver having a Zeldaesque sword for his primary attack, and a very interesting gun for his secondary attack.  This gun shoots bombs, which can cause damage to enemies on both impact and explosion, but cannot hurt the player directly.  The explosions of bombs push back both enemies and the player, and with the bombs propensity to ricochet around a room, it can make using it effectively quite tricky.  This results in deeper, trickier combat mechanics than one would expect, and adds a certain richness.\n\nA final added bonus Diehard Dungeon has over BoI is that it doesn't rely on blood, poop, tears and gore to have an atmospheric experience.\n\nOverall it was a good experience, and with the low price tag the devs seem to be selling themselves short, though it does certainly help spread the love faster :)\n\n[Original Complaint]\nWhile the gameplay was fairly enjoyable, the game overuses a visual effect which makes the entire screen flash white very quickly without warning. I play far too many videogames, and I'm virtually never affected by any kind of flashing lights(besides the seizure inducing flashes in Guacamelee!) but these flashes are definitely responsible for giving me a headache, and turning an entertaining experience into a negative one.\n\nIf this is patched out, I'd gladly give this game a thumbs up and would definitely give it another go, but at this point it's getting shelved after only a few runs.\n[/original complaint]","March 6, 2014","true","3.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","2"

I would recommend it as it has most of the elements that fans of the genre like including permadeath, random upgrades, random dungeons, and a retro feel. The only problem that keeps me from loving this game is that it feels very slow, but only on the players end. The dungeons side on the other hand will seem very fast and can kill you in just seconds with the crazy amount of enemies on the screen (which is no problem at all of course.) The issue is that killing the enemies seems so slow sometimes with your cannon gun and tiny little dagger. Yes, you can upgrade both of those, but sometimes you wont get upgrades through out the dungeon if you are unlucky and it will just make things slower. One may argue "that's what rogue-likes are all about. They are going to be tough." This isn't really that kind of game. In this sort of game you want quick difficult gameplay where the upgrades make you feel like you are progressing even if the game is getting more tough. A few floors in and i'm doing the same damage. The only buffs I have make me immune to fire or that the chests wont be empty (yet you can still get unlucky and recieve nothing.) The game is fun. Just seems slow. I think it's safe to say that if you know what you are playing 5 dollars is a good price.\n\n\nLET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE UPDATE THAT MAKES YOUR SWORD SLASH WAS A GREAT IMPROVMENT. IT IS A LOT MORE PLAYABLE FOR NOW. THE GAMEPLAY FEELNIG A BIT SLOW AS SAID IN THIS REVIEW STILL APPLIES A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT IS NOW ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

The controls in Diehard Dungeon are not particularly responsive and the combat mechanics make things awkward. Using a controller does help with some of the problems but even so, moving and turning in combat is generally bad.\n\nAs to the 'tedious' part; well, many of the game's mechanics seem to be based around wasting as much of the player's time as possible. Here are some examples of what I am trying to convey:\n\nThe majority of rooms can only be exited once a key has been placed in a lock. The key will be hidden somewhere in the room; perhaps in one of the many random objects in the room (every one of which takes multiple strikes to break open), perhaps on one of the hit-sponge enemies. There's no indication as to where the key will be and you will often spend fruitless minutes hacking away at boxes to find the key.\n\nLittle pixie type creatures will often appear (most of the time from one of the previously mentioned boxes you are hacking open in search of the key) and steal your companion chest. Well, not properly steal the chest, like take it away to be found later on; they just grab it and run to the other side of the room. You can't collect any treasure without the chest so you can't just leave it behind. What you must do instead is chase the pixies around the room, slashing at them with your sword until you've killed them all and can get your chest back. The problem here is that the pixies are fast and will continually move away from the player character, whilst the character cannot move while swinging his sword. And so a merry game of trying to manouvre the pixies into a corner ensues. And this will happen every few rooms. It's not that difficult to get the chest back, it's just tedious and annoying.\n\nThere are other exmples that I won't go into an extended explanation of as they all tend to end with the same reaction of 'Why am I doing this? What's the point?' and a feeling that your time has been wasted.\n\nOther, although much less prominent, annoyances exist in the game, such as: parts of broken objects covering the trigger plates for traps so you can't even see them, enemy attacks that cause you to drop your only melee weapon so you have to go running around to find it again, status effects that make you run in random directions (usually straight at the nearest wall) for an intolerably long time and the fact that the bomb launcher (secondary weapon) is about as effective as launching an attack on a Tiger tank with firecrackers.\n\nThe final negatives about Diehard Dungeon are the bland graphics, uninspired dungeon design and the completely 'meh' soundtrack. Overall this is not a game I would recommend unless you have a whole load of time to waste on pointless tedium and absolutely nothing else to play.","October 15, 2014","false","0.8"," 36 of 54 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","36","54","0","0"

The atmosphere is lit well enough and creepy, giving a sense that you really don't know how to get out. Each floor has a choice to go towards harder or easier rooms.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fastela/recommended/277870/","Fastela","Fastela","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fastela/","196 products in account","Transcript of my video review which is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iopAUD_dhTw\n\n--\n\n“What would happen if The Legend of Zelda were to have randomly generated dungeons?”\n\nThis is certainly the question the man behind indie studio TrickTale must have asked himself many times before working on DieHard Dungeon. In this top-down 2D dungeon crawler, the main goal is to explore and survive a succession of randomly generated rooms populated by various enemies. Amassing gold, avoiding traps, and collecting golden keys are the things you will have to do to reach the end of each level, all the while fighting your way through the different rooms and trying to collect power-ups that are spread around.\n\nIn order to help you in this task, you are equipped with a sword which acts as a melee weapon, and a Hand Cannon which throws explosive projectiles. You will also be followed during your exploration by a magical chest, which acts as a companion and collects gold for you. After some time, it evolves and can become an active item, defending you throughout the levels.\n\nThe controls in DieHard Dungeon are fairly easy, and a simple tutorial will help you get the hang of things. The game is best played with a controller, as it was firstly meant to be played on the Xbox Live Indiegame Marketplace.\n\nWhile it borrows most of its aesthetics from The Legend of Zelda, DieHard Dungeon is also inspired by another game that’s hugely popular in the rogue-like genre: The Binding of Isaac. Just like in Isaac, the player will be able to find special items that are spread around the levels. In DieHard Dungeon though, power-ups are available thanks to randomly placed chests that act as slot machines. If successful, the player is rewarded with a bonus, which he can accept, or refuse and reroll for a new chance at getting a better power-up. Some enemies will also drop tokens, which can be spent in a Token Well, giving the player another chance at getting better items.\n\nTaking everything into account, DieHard Dungeon feels alive and responsive. The sense of progression is present throughout the different levels. The fact that the dificulty adjusts itself depending on the player’s performance gives him the feeling to be “fed” in a good way: the game grows with the player, and the challenge curve always feels right. The randomly generated levels make the game a new challenge to play each and every time. Unfortunately, unlike in The Binding of Isaac, you are not able at this time to input your own seed. “At this time”, because while the game has been released for over two years now, it is still in active development. TrickTale is constantly improving its creation by adding powerups, challenges, enemies, and by working on the game’s balance. One clever decision that has been made for example is switching the player’s speed from low to high when carrying a key. This change, which will certainly be available in the next patch will definitely help in the game’s dynamics by making the player’s escape a positive action instead of a struggle.\n\nThe main drawback with DieHard Dungeon though, is its lack of diversity in graphics. While trying a bit too hard to pay its respect to its elders, the game lacks creativity in getting a strong visual identity of its own, and therefore may look a bit bland for some people. This problem is felt up to some of the enemies’ patterns which act just like their grand-parents counterparts, or even the charge ability of the player’s sword. While it’s always a good thing to throw a wink at the games that made your childhood and help the player overcome enemies by putting him in a familiar place, it would have been appreciated to see a bit more diversity in this regard.\n\nThere are also a few points in which the game could benefit some tweaks, such as an in-game user interface showing your current collected gold, a timer that could certainly attract the speedrunning scene, or even simply an indicator showing the current level you’re exploring.\n\nDespite these points, DieHard Dungeon feels really nice. The dungeon theme combined with the randomly generated levels, the variety in powerups, and the fact that the dificulty adjusts itself in real time makes it a game that is a real joy to play. The replay value is definitely great, and when you take into account the fact that the game is in active development, that it features a champion level (which is some kind of new game + once you’ve beaten the last boss), and even minigames, all that for a mearly $5, you get a game that not only is an excellent introduction to randomly generated dungeon crawlers, but can stand on its own with no problem whatsoever and definitely deserves your attention.","November 8, 2014","true","1.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

You can choose your own path although some routes dont have that many differences. You will die A LOT in this game, trust me. It starts very slow and easy but it'll eventually get way harder and you'll rely on dodging and knowing your enemies to successfully beat a floor without losing any hearts. There are a few upgrades that upgrade your gun, sword or movement speed. The game is rather short BUT, like i said, you'll die A LOT so it'll provide you with a few hours of fun. If you decide to do the achievements the game gets even better although most of them unlock fairly easily if you keep playing.\n\nI highly recommend this to any rogue-like fan.

Booth are good, and the developer is working on a third one.\n\nIt may not have the deep of other games of the genre, but I still think it's well done and deserves a recommendation.","October 1, 2014","true","4.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'm compelled to compare the combat and weapons of this game to the first Legend of Zelda. While the combat in Zelda is simple, it is polished and immersive on a level this game does not come close to matching. This is primarily due to Diehard Dungeon's combination of an ultimately unremarkable arsenal, boring enemies, and the mechanics that drive it all. Your primary weapon (as in Zelda) is a sword that is somewhat satisfying to use but is otherwise unremarkable. Your secondary weapon is a very strangely ineffective canon that fires weak, timed mortars that never go where you want them to. While you can get 'upgrades' that improve these weapons and that slightly alter their behavior, you're stuck with just these two. Meanwhile, in Zelda (and several other games you can draw comparisons to), you have a fairly broad array of secondary items to choose from.\n\nIt's no wonder I couldn't be bothered to delve deeper. The foundation of Diehard Dungeon is simply not fun from the get-go. The dull art style does not help either. Overall, the game is just a chaotic mish-mash of genres and is unrewarding and uninspired. I say this because, while it can provide a good challenge, the game feels so average across-the-board that it is a very niche experience.","October 10, 2014","false","0.5"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

This game is innovative in how it feels like you are playing something like a RNG based Legend of Zelda, or something like it.\n\nLet's go over the Pros, Cons, and Neutrals I have found:\nPros- This game is very responsive. The controls are tight, and there are no mystery hits from you or monsters. You know when you get hit or you hit enemies.\nI love the art direction they took with the game, making it 16-bit. It truly feels like I am playing a game straight from the Super Nintendo!\nThis game has a challenge to it, just like a Roguelike should. If Roguelikes are too hard for you, you shouldn't be playing them (Being honest here, so don't whine.)\n\nNeutrals- This game was made for the PC, so the movement is WASD, whereas the attacking buttons are located on the mouse. For someone like myself who is attuned to playing PC games, this wasn't an issue. For all you Console gamers out there, this will be for the fact that you cannot remap your controls.\n\nCons- Every time you start up the game (Be it for the first time, or if you close it and come back to it later) You go through the tutorial. I'm sorry, but I should only have to go through a tutorial for a game ONCE. Having to do it over and over again is just tedious.\nI have not run across any kind of weapon pickups in the game, and this is a shame. Using the same stuff over and over again really hinders the replay value. Would I like to keep playing? Of course! But, give me some new stuff to lay waste to dungeon minions please!\n\nOverall, I give this game am 8/10. Great game, just needs some added work to make it amazing.","March 16, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Using a controller is significantly better, and perhaps the way to go. if you dont have a controller, dont be encouraged to pick this up. if you dont a have an official controller (meanign the game doesnt detect it) google and download "joy to key" program, you can rebind your controller to make each button count as a specific key stroke.\n\nEDIT: I left the statement above to serve the purpose of showing that the developers do care for the game. the keys are now rebindable allowing for a custom configuration, which permits for a much confortable expeirnce\n\nThe game is hardcore roguelike, meaning it follows tipical standards of the genre. you only get 1 life, once its gone, you gotto start all over again. the game is going to be repetitive, however each time you learn something more, you improve, and the feeling of stepping into new heights is unique, and personally, very gratifying. I dont feel this game hits that feeling just yet, so far I have only dropped about 1 hour, so this learning feeling hasnt kicked in yet, maybe it wont.\n\nEDIT: after revisiting the game and passing it about twice, I can openly say that the experience has been enhanced while maintaining a good sense of difficulty, as some mechanics which made it a unfair for the player were polished and/or eliminated, EX: the sword swing delay\n\nThe combat is simple. your given a sword and a handcannon (think of it as a bomb launcher, meaning this "bomb" has a fuse on it. it wont explode on impact, it actually damages and bounces away from whatever is struck). the handcannon is unique in feel and learning how to work it out is solid.\n\nEdit: The sword on the other hand is the true meaning of "mastering simplicity." it is a basic horizontal swing forward, not much more/less, and perhaps is its simplicity that gives it its charm.\n\nThis new style allows for a fresh feeling. some enemies make you weight the importance of your sword and its contrast with the cannon. while you can swing your sword much faster for much higher damage, your cannon allows for a safer aproach, and mixing but properly is what gives you a gratifying feeling of success.\n\nThere is also a score attack called "mayhem", its strainght to the point a and you will play it once or twice for the sake of taking away the taste of a failed run, it helps to steam down very well.\n\nThe asthetics of the game are ok. the music isnt spectacular, but gets the right feeling going, meaing its just fine.\nThe game uses a pixel style meaning it feels like "Legend of Zelda a Link to the Past" nothing that will win an award, but a nice style considering the gameplay. fits nicely.\n\nMost discussed above can be disregarded almost entirely by personal taste though. The game can be picked and played quickly, specially for the low cost of the game itself and the simplistic gameplay, while still providing that roguelike feeling of "learning through repeated failure."\n\nIf your looking for a hardcore Roguelike gamplay, "the binding of isaac" or "our darker purpose" will quench that thirst. but if your on the much more into quick and simple, this is a  better choice. the game is also getting updated, sentence that I hold strong.\n\nNonetheless, if you have found great experience in games like rogue legacy, binding of isaac or risk of rain, this might come as a shorter burst of that flavor\n\nEdit: I would also like to make a strong sense of respect as my original review used to say that i didnt recommend this game, mostly on a bases that if 100 ppl played it, less that half would like it, (some original machanics, which are no longer there, made it difficult to enjoy properly).\nI stand chaged, most wont love it, but will play it, and few will learn to cherish it, enogh to comeback untill that 100% is there.","March 5, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","8"

You have a sword and a strange...exploding bowling ball gun, and generally hope to get as deep into the dungeon as possible...with your animated treasure chest at your beck and call.\n\nThe treasure chest levels up as it gets more gold and will begin to act as a support turret follower in addition to a treasure scavenger, which is an interesting touch.\n\nI've never beaten Diehard Dungeon, because, like many roguelikes, it is intended that you will fail repeatedly, and you cannot save and reload your progress. I imagine if I kept working on it, I would eventually succeed, but while the game isn't bad, I don't find myself drawn enough to it to favor that objective over other gaming options.","March 23","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maggiesfarm/recommended/277870/","maggiesfarm","Gentleman Death","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maggiesfarm/","116 products in account","Well, this is an all new record for me.  I've played less than thirty minutes of this game and already love it.  As you know me (if you have read past reviews of mine) I am a frugal gamer.  Perhaps that should be my thing?  Anyway, this game went on sale recently for $2.24 and couldn't resist.  "Zelda" was in the description, so I threw my money at Steam.\n\nSo, like I said I love it.  It'll probably get stale with time, but this is a great pickup-and-play-rogue-like adventure.  The way it plays reminds me a lot of "Binding of Isaac".  You go through various rooms picking up keys, hearts and power-ups.  Every so often you enter a room with a big-ol' boss baddy you have to defeat.  And just like "Binding of Isaac", the level layout is always changing so each time you die, the whole structure gets rearranged (thus my "rogue-like" description) and you lose your power-ups and have to start over again.  This makes each time you play a bit unique and different.  Any subtle hint of change always gives a game a bit more life to it so it doesn't become stale so easily.\n\nNow, I'm going to say this and I'm sure many people will disagree, but I like this much better than "Binding of Isaac" (Sorry to keep comparing it to that, but it's the only relation I know as far as style and I know MANY people have played "BoI").  The main, and probably sole reason, I like this more than "BoI" is that it is much more forgiving.  I'm not a great gamer, but I'm also no newbie. With that said, "BoI" is TOUGH for me.  Bosses are tough to get through, and when I make it I'm shocked and awed.  This does make it all the more rewarding, but like I mentioned before, when you die in "BoI", you lose everything and have to restart.  Needless to say, I die a lot in that game, become discouraged after ten minutes of play, and don't touch it for four months. With "Diehard Dungeon" I feel like I can make it pretty far without dying.  There's still a challenge, but I'm not getting slaughtered after only a handful of rooms.  I also feel like they're a little more generous with the power-ups, which makes this a little more rewarding and fun.\n\nNow, enough comparison.  Overall this game is addictive and makes me want to go deeper and deeper into this dungeon.  The style is very much in the vain of "Link to the Past" which is a lazy description I know, but it's the first thing that comes to mind.  It's got that heavy pixelated look which has become ever so popular.  As far as game play goes, yes it is like "BoI" (I swear that's the last time) BUT there are mini-games, too, with a global scoreboard, which definitely adds some replay value.  If you have just a bit of hardcore gamer in you, but also just want a casual game to play, this will be a perfect game to fulfill that need. A great edition to any gamers' Steam library.\n","October 4, 2014","true","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Diehard Dungeon is one of the few that I really love.\n\nI'm not a fan of 8-bit style anymore, but it works well for this game. Sometimes the screen does get cluttered and you accidently step on a pressure plate, triggering a trap, but you learn how to watch out for things like that.\n\nYou have a loot chest (like a mimic) who follows you around and collects the treasure, leveling up when it gains enough. At higher levels, the chest will gain ranged attacks and join you in fights. But there are also little imps who only attack the chest, and prevents the chest from collecting any loot while it's being chased around the room.\n\nThe games difficulty adjusts with your success or failure, so you always get a suitable challenge. It took me 6 attempts before I first escaped the dungeon, and it unlocked optional champions who wander the edge of the dungeon on top of the walls and jump down to attack you... all while you are dealing with the regular room stuff like traps, monsters, etc.\n\nThe game has a large variety of perks you can gain through a single dungeon delve and the ones you find are randomized. In one game, I gained the ability to hide in my loot chest, so monsters wouldn't be able to find me. Great if you need a breather and accidently bite off too many monsters at once. Other times I'm gained throwing knives, or flame resistance. All of them offer different ways to play the game, so it always keeps it fresh and interesting.\n\nOverall, I think this is the first rogue-like game in a long while with enough variety to keep me coming back time after time. Highly recommended.","January 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a fun game but it can be pretty hard and the bosses are tough in my opinion.\n\nMain ReviewIn Diehard Dungeon you control a character that has a sword and a gun that shoots out bombs. The gameplay and controls feel very similar to an older Legend of Zelda game. There is even the spin attack. Each time you enter the dungeon you fight against random rooms of enemies. Eventually after clearing so many rooms you fight a boss. You do this about three times and then you fight the final boss. I think the gameplay is fun but it can get repetitive. Maybe I just suck but I rarely can beat this game. That being said I am trying to get to Diehard rank. This is like playing the game on very hard. The game has multiple challenge modes if the main game mode gets boring.\n\nThe Good The game has lots of replayability.\nIf you like being on lists then this game can scratch that itch for you.\nThe bad The game does feel repetitive after so many plays.\nIf you let the difficulty get too high without ever lowering it the game becomes very difficult.\nFinal ThoughtsIf you like the look and feel of an older Legend of Zelda game, for example A Link to the Past and you like Rogue-Lite games then this game will be fun and I recommend it. That being said if somewhat repetitive dungeons and irritating enemies and bosses is a turn off then maybe you will not like this game.

Not the first game I'd point to when recommending a game from the genre, but it should prove reasonably enjoyable for fans of the genre.  The one point I'd have to complain about is the weapon system.\n\nIn the game you're given 2 weapons, the sword and the hand-cannon.  The problem with sword is that, even with all the upgrades, its reach is far too shallow, causing the player to get hit himself 50% of the time.  The problem with the Hand-Cannon is that it launches something akin to grenades, the projectile having a delay before it detonates.  This often leaves the player with the only option of launching the projectiles at enemy and having them bounce off, causing sub-optimal damage.\n\nNeither of weapons gives a lasting satisfaction when defeating an enemy like almost any weapon in a comparable top-down dungeon crawlers does (eg; Zelda).  If you can get past this fact, then it's pretty enjoyable, and definately recommendable at such a paltry price as $5.","March 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you grew up with 8-bit graphics and you like a challenge that would be another reason to pick this up. It has steam cards and if you sell those on the market this game is less than 4 bucks for hours of entertainment.\n\nThere is a mayhem mode which is basically a twin stick shooter where you compare scores on a leaderboard with your friends and other gamers world wide.  Nothing spectacular but again...the game is $4.\n\nGameplay wise it doesn't get old until a few hours in.  This is a rogue-like so it's one of those where after 1 death, you start over from the very beginning.  You will lose health is some really cheap ways too.

You get a sword, a gun that shoots time-bombs, and a chest that follows you around. If you die you lose some of your stuff and have to start over, but since the dungeon seems to be more or less the same everywhere, this is not really a huge setback.\n\nThis is not a ♥♥♥♥ing rogue-like. You idiots need to stop slapping that tag on every ♥♥♥♥ing game on Steam. Go play Rogue so you can tell the difference, ffs.\n\nAnyway, this is not a bad game. It's fun to play and it looks like there's still updates happening. My only real complaint is that it leaves too much debris everywhere, which detracts from the gratifyingly clean feeling that you get from clearing a room in Zelda.

If you really love classic topdown Zelda combat, you could get something out of it. Still, you're probably better off with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, since this game is just a less fun version of that.\n\nOther things that suck about this game:\n\n-The powerups you get are all really minor and inexplicably rare.\n-Really awful graphics. Blocky 16-bit sprites can look great, but this is muddy and ugly.\n-The ranged weapon they give you highly discourages actually fighting enemies, since you can plink at them forever and not risk taking damage. This is boring.\n\nTo its credit, the game does the following well:\n\n-Good difficulty curve. Tough but almost always fair, you can generally learn from your mistakes.\n-"Champion" mechanic where your character can screw with other people's games after you beat it once. AI controlled, so this is more just a "oh, that's cute" thing than really interesting or annoying - it basically just puts your name over an ingame monster.\n-The combat itself is fairly solid, if you don't just hang back and shoot at enemies 1 damage at a time.\n\nThis one is up to you. Personally, I won't be playing any more of it, but like I said, if you're super into Zelda combat, go for it.

Its fun and unique. Its a roque like game to be sure but there are some things that make it stand out. Slot machine chests are one example of thinking outside the box.  You touch a chest and you have might zero spins or 3 spins and then it gives you a powerup of some kind. The action is kind of a slow paced robotron with traps you have to watch out for.\n\nThe game has a difficutly lever that can work automatically or you can adjust it for higher or lower. That to me is smart. The game does have boss fights and they are fun. The graphics while not super sharp looking look incredibly sharp in action.So the game is perfect? Um No. I kind of wish the color pallet of the game was a little more vivid its very hard to see the plates in the floor sometimes. The randomly generated rooms can sometimes be a big pain. While it makes every game unique sometimes you will get a bad spawn and a spear dude or a medium boss  will be right in your face with no where to run or to hide.\n\nAlso when you break stuff in the game it scatters debris every where and that sometimes obscure the key you need to unlock the door. Also no multiplayer of any kind is in this game.  However these are mostly minor nitpicks and I enjoyed the game for the low price of under $2dollars its a bargain. Even at the normal price of $5 its still a solid value. If you enjoy Legend of Dungeon or the stars and the pit then this is a game you should consider picking up.\n\nI actually consider it a better game then Legend of Dungeon. Legend is a nice game but it mostly depends on 2 item that if you can get you can beat the game and if you dont then you better start over again. Also when I died in this game it didnt feel cheap. The game treats the player more fairly inside the game world. My rating would be an easy 8/10 right now. Its super good with few flaws.\n\nJust an update I have finished the game on the regular mode and unlocked champion mode. I also finished the game and did not get the set number of keys. Fun game and the developer is still issuing updates to this game.","June 28, 2014","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You collect coins and rings which serve absolutely no purpose, no long term investments that make you want to play again after you die or beat the game.

Hearts are pretty rare which isnt the worst thing in the world, but honestly the gameplay is just very repetitive and boring.  The fact that the coins and rings are in the game is just stupid, i was expecting there to be shops or equipable items (i know there are some, but they are rare and the benefit is hardly noticable or worth it).  Even the most simple thing like different weapons or gear to equip would have made this game more enjoyable, but there was little suspence in terms of finding new items for me.\nAgain, i bought this for like a dollar so i guess it is worth the money, but compared to other roguelike games, there is little to no character progression that would make me want to play for hours and hours much like other games have (binding of issac, risk or rain, FTL etc) from somone who has hundreds of games on steam and is always looking for a great time killer i have to say there are way better options and this game will simply go in the folder of "not bad but dont really want to play again"","April 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I bought Diehard Dungeon while it was on offer, the reviews warned that it was like a very hard Zelda style dungeon slasher. When it said hard, I didn't expect it to be AS hard as it is.

If like me, you play games to relax and have an hour of enjoyment, Diehard Dungeon will leave you ever so slightly frustrated.\n\nMy hat is off to the developers, it's a lovely thought out game and really looks like something you'd see on the SNES, but thats about all it does do. DD feels like it only caters toward a certain type of gamer. Those who dont mind repeating the same motions over and over again. Frankly I got bored very quickly of dying and loosing everything I had achieved. What is the point of a retry, if you dont continue from were you left off?\nI was really looking forward to some old skool style gaming and for the first 2-3 minutes DD felt like it actually would come up with the goods. Then as I played more, disappointment set in as I realised thats not what this game offers.  Games should leave the player feeling they have a fair chance at winning and I dont get that feeling from DD.

This game is a waste of the seventy-five cents I paid for it.  The 'roguelike' elements are extremely shallow.  There's little form of character progression other than unlocking harder modes.  A treasure chest 'companion' levels up (and it caps out fairly quickly) although not to much effect.  Itemization is similarly lacking: you have a sword and a gun and... that's it.  They don't upgrade.  There are 'perk' cards you can find although I only manged to stumble on one in about an hour of gameplay and you are limited to two total.  Overall you have an extremely low budget take on the original Legend of Zelda... sans overworld, loot, enemy variety, dungeon variety, etc.","March 5, 2014","false","1.4"," 25 of 61 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","25","61","0","4"

The main glitch I am talking about is how sometimes I can be walking away from an enemy and swinging at him but my attack direction gets, for no reason, temporarily locked in the opposite direction. So I am desperately trying to swing in the right direction but instead am taking massive dmg from that side because I am defenseless. That and I can be having a perfect run, never even taking one hit, then all of a sudden I get thrown into a situation that is unavoidable and all of my life is drained right away, game over permadeath. That is one thing I also hate, permadeath games. That is just what I want, for all of my hard work to be thrown down the toilet because the developers programmed the game to screw me over as hard as it can in certain spots. In my mind, permadeath is just an excuse to pull a blanket over a game's other flaws such as how short it is, in which I have no doubt this one is probably pretty short. But i may never beat it because of the sheer amount of different ways to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttingly die, especially boss fights. You have to get too close to attack and it is way too easy to get hit by a boss and they just obliterate me and I feel totally powerless. I started just hitting them with my cannon and it worked and I could beat them, but after beating 3 bosses and playing for over an hour, the real problem dropped: I was doing great then a guy with a spiked wooden shield backed me into a corner and drained me from 6 hearts to zero, game over, all that work lost. There are some enemies who run from you and you have to chase them to the other side of the room to kill them, and little green things that hop around the map and hit traps that send an arrow from off-screen to hit you unknowingly. That is probably the game's biggest flaw, other than the BS deaths, is that it is zoomed in way too far. It seems like I only ever take dmg because I have no idea what is going on around me because I can only see a few feet around my guy. It really is terrible how far in it is zoomed. I mean I have two and a half hours in this already and do not feel like I have gotten even a slight bit of progress towards ever beating it, and probably never will, and do not care in the slightest bit because it only cost a dollar to find out if this game has any redeeming qualities, in which it has zero. I just uninstalled this and couldn't be happier.","November 5, 2014","false","3.7"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","5","22","0","0"

The perk system makes every run a unique play, as different combinations of perks lead to different playing styles. You also have a companion chest that upgrades to fight enemies as you collect loot. Combat in the game is acceptable and reminds me of a top down Zelda but there is less than ideal enemy variety. The boss fights are uninspired and lack any challenge the second time around.

Just not worth more than $5. Within 10 to 20 minutes you'll "get it" and within 2 hours you'll beat it. At that point you'll either want more or be done. $5 for 2-3 hours of entertainment with the possibility of much more isn't so bad.\n\nFor the most part, what's new in this game isn't fun and what's fun in this game isn't new. It's still very enjoyable, but it will be very familiar. Unlike many dungeon crawler games with this camera angle, you have a gun! It shoots cannonballs that explode, dealing more damage. It's supposedly a skill-based projectile, but in reality you just fire it directly at the enemy because all the enemies AI is "walk towards you" or "walk towards you, run away when you get near" or "run around like a chicken with its head cut off". I feel that it would have been more fun to use the projectile if the AI took a bit more thought to outsmart; most rooms can be flawlessly cleared by standing in a corner and shooting your cannon over and over until you kill things off screen, doubly so with upgrades.\n\nThe upgrades are sensible and fun and your playthroughs are basically determined by them. If you get good ones (see: relating to ranged attacks) you'll win easily, if you get bad ones you'll have to make smart choices to win. It is fun to get ugprades and change your play based on how you get them, but its mostly just more effective versions of the same thing.\n\nThat said, it's a fun game that actually gets harder the more you play it. If you REALLY enjoy this type of game, you can keep playing and it will get harder and harder. Get frustrated from losing? The game gets easier. It's a good system, although it's kinda "meh" in its implementation; I beat the game at the "warrior" level, which is the 3rd level in the chain. There's many more levels and I'd imagine the game is way more fun at those levels, but it doesn't allow for it without extensive playtime, so I guess I'll never see it.\n\nThis is a pick up and play when you've got 30 minutes to play a game or don't want to get invested in a long term committment.

You also get a ranged bomb attack that you shoot out of a cannon. You progress from room to room, always forward through the dungeon, with each room needing some basic goal to be completed: kill certain enemies, unlock a lock, or press some buttons. Sometimes there are secret rooms you can go to instead! What each room contains is random, I'm not sure if it is many stock rooms, or procedually generated, or a mixture, but the variety seems good enough. After a certain amount of rooms, you come to a boss, and there seems to be quite a few you can possibly encounter. The title should say it well enough, but it is also a challenging game!\n\nThere are powerups to collect, all I've seen so far are passive benefits like immunity to status effects, or better attacks. My favorite so far lets you shoot 3 bombs at once. There is also gold/jewels to collect, which apparently levels up the treasure chest that follows you around? I'm not fully sure what the deal is with that, but it seems like a friendly sentient treasure chest, so it's fun. :D\n\nThere are also some little minigames you come across during the adventure, and also some you can play from the main menu. These little extras are great and nice little breaks from the standard. One on the main menu is locked needing tokens to unlock, which can be collected through multiple playthroughs, but the tokens are also useful in the dungeon for various things.\n\nI should also mention that the game simply 'feels' right. I'm not sure how better to put it, but I think anyone reading this review have played enough games to maybe understand me... there are many an indie game that looks cool but when you play there is just something(s) missing that you can't put your finger on that the game lacks in it's polish to really make it sing. Well, here, everything just seems to be right. The art and the sound/music are consistent and done decently well.\n\nRecommended, especially to anyone who was a fan of Binding of Issac or Zelda, and likes a challenge.","July 3, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

More items to unlock, different bosses to fight, and champion mode to complete (the 'true' ending of the game) There are also minigames (alternate modes) to play whenever you want a break from the main run.\n\nFans of The binding of isaac and other similar roguelikes should find a good few hours of gameplay in this, certainly worth it for the price. I do think it is one of the easier ones though, which is not necessarily a bad thing. 7.5/10, Recommended!","June 26, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The second play session I totally caught the motion of this game and made it completely through the dungeon, don't forget to look hard for those gold keys so you don't fall short of the 10 key chest. Completed dungeon runs reward you with perks for your perks, for example the first time through you recieve a perk to recieve a random perk after starting a run after another run. The atmosphere is lit well enough and creepy, giving a sense that you really don't know how to get out. Each floor has a choice to go towards harder or easier rooms. The game is hard, most likely for replay value like The Binding of Isaac, don't let that discourage you too much though.

I'm only about an hour and 10 minutes into the game at the time of writing this, but I can honestly say I'm enjoying this far more than Binding of Isaac.\n\nPositives\n+Graphics are pixelated, many people get upset by this but honestly it fits the game and doesn't bother me.\n\n+Minigames on certain chests, that are actually kind of fun so far. The one I have seen (I know there are more) is a pacman like one. (There is a seperate minigame menu that leads to different minigames, one of which is akin to Geometry Wars/Asteroids but with a theme that matches the game)\n\n+Controls are easy to learn, and offers controller support for at the least XBox 360 controllers (have not tested ps3, ps4, XBox One, etc)\n\n+Two weapon types that I have seen thus far, a sword that controls similarly to Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES, and a sort of grenade launcher with bombs that bounce off walls and enemies (takes some getting used to, but once one gets the hang of it, it becomes very useful).\n\n+The game actually has a tutorial as opposed to a one room picture of "lol space is bombs and left stick moves while right stick shoots, good luck out there!"\n\n+You can change the color of your character's clothing (Yeah, I consider this a positive. What of it?)\n\n+You start with a companion chest which stores treasure for you. When you collect enough, the chest will upgrade and eventually start defending you and fighting back. Chest gets stronger with each level, naturally.\n\n+If you have collected 10 golden keys throughout your run, you can open a special chest and receive a "perk" which will carry through to the next game (I think this is how it works, anyways.) This was one thing I didn't like about Binding of Isaac, not one thing carried over no matter how good the run was or how much effort you put into it; all you could do was unlock new things.\n\n+Very reasonable price, I got it on sale for $1 and some loose change, and after playing it can honestly say I'd have paid for the full price and still felt good about my purchase.\n\n+Tokens go into token wells, which will give you money/health/items. Any un-spent tokens will carry over into the next game.\n\nNegatives\n\n-Hitboxes can sometimes be janky\n\n-In the tutorial area, there were chests on top of the walls. Maybe there is a secret way to get to them, or it was a one time bug on my end; but either way I felt this should be noted. However, there have been no other issues with wall-chests after tutorial.\n\n-The sword isn't particularly useful past smashing crates or hitting switches, unless you get some upgrades for it. Most of the time, you will end up spamming your cannon.\n\n\n\nAll in all, I feel this is a very good game for a very good price. Now I'm off to get another hour or two into it!","July 10, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The keyboard/mouse controls are absolutely horrible though, so I highly suggest you play using a gamepad and joy2key or something similar.\n\nThe game uses a perk system to power up your character as you progress in a very similar nature to hero siege. The perk system makes every run a unique play, as different combinations of perks lead to different playing styles. You also have a companion chest that upgrades to fight enemies as you collect loot. Combat in the game is acceptable and reminds me of a top down Zelda but there is less than ideal enemy variety. The boss fights are uninspired and lack any challenge the second time around. I would suggest the game if it is on sale.","December 28, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The second play session I totally caught the motion of this game and made it completely through the dungeon, don't forget to look hard for those gold keys so you don't fall short of the 10 key chest. Completed dungeon runs reward you with perks for your perks, for example the first time through you recieve a perk to recieve a random perk after starting a run after another run. The atmosphere is lit well enough and creepy, giving a sense that you really don't know how to get out. Each floor has a choice to go towards harder or easier rooms. The game is hard, most likely for replay value like The Binding of Isaac, don't let that discourage you too much though. All in all, good game for a loot based dungeon crawler.","August 25, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Diehard Dungeon is one of those quick consumables that doesn't leave you wishing you just had your main course instead. A fantastic, admittedly short, roguelite with all the elements you need for repeat playthroughs.\n\nWhat I believe to be one of the greatest things about Diehard Dungeon is that it's really not inteded for your more "extreme" Roguelike audiance, and is heavily pushing to the Roguelite gameplay.. while, at the same time, still appealing to that "harsher audience" due to the game's initial appeared difficulty.","August 26, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This crawler delves deep with a multi-layered, non-linear core game and various mini game options that deliver.  I'd recommend this game to players looking for a dungeon crawler with shmup elements that rewards multiple sessions. With a price tag of $5.49 it might cost you your last few coins, but the hours of variable gameplay and Steam content it provides is worth it.\n\nCheck out the full review for this game and many more at Budget Gaming Review!\nhttp://www.budgetgamingreview.com/2015/07/diehard-dungeon.html","July 18, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
