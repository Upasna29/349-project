"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlanetTerra/recommended/467310/","PlanetTerra","Sir Pugsalot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlanetTerra/","139 products in account","Rogue Port - Red Nightmare, while clearly inspired by classics such as EarthBound, does well to hold it's own.\nThe day/night system, dynamic lighting and randomised loot drops help to give Rogue Port it's own identity.\nThe battle system is a classic take on the turn based system you'll remember from early Final Fantasy games, with a few more modern inspirations. Approaching the enemy from behind to get the jump on them for example.\n\nThe visuals are cutesy and again, hugely EarthBound inspired. The combination of dynamic lighting and a fantastic musical score, does a great job of creating atmosphere, pulling you into the world of Rogue Port.\n\nIf you grew up with your mind buried deep inside the huge worlds in games like Final Fantasy, Earth Bound and even Chrono Trigger, then Rogue Port is most certainly for you. If not, you might still be surprised.\n\nIt's awesome to see more indie developers working on retro inspired RPGs. The more the merrier, I say.\nGo and grab it now.","May 23","true","2.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dontstalkmepls/recommended/467310/","dontstalkmepls","[OpK] Moon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dontstalkmepls/","512 products in account","Product received for free\n\nRogue Port - Red Nightmare is an adventure RPG game heavily inspired by various\n16-bit titles (such as Earthbound and Pokémon).\n\nGameplay:The game plays similar to other games made in RPG Maker: You have your main quest (which is rescuing your friends), various sidequests scattered around the world, monsters roaming everywhere you go, standard stuff. However, there are a lot of little things that make this game different from your normal RPG Maker game, like stamina bar (more stamina means more sprinting time), day and night system with dynamic music, calendar system, pretty dynamic lighting effect, character customization (every piece of apparel that you equip changes your sprite), and so on.\n\nThere are quite a lot of different places to visit, like towns, caves, and forests. A lot of those locations don't have anything to do with the main quest, but It's wise to explore them anyway, as they commonly contain hidden treasure chests and key items for sidequests.\n\nGraphics:They are really, really good (for a game made in RPG Maker, duh!). You won't see any sprites ripped directly from RTP packages, like in other RPGM games here on Steam. As previously said, game has a nice dynamic lighting effect, meaning that the light changes depending on location and time. Character and enemies sprites are all nicely made (bonus points for animating them). The only complaint I have about graphics, is that the text is kinda hard to read, I think making the text window a little less transparent would fix the problem.\n\nControls:RPG Maker standard: Arrow keys to move, Shift for sprint, Esc for opening up the menu, Space for everything else. Those are standard controls in those kinds of games, because they are comfortable to use. If you don't like them for some reason, there's a remapping menu available under the F1 key.\n\nSound:Sound effects are fitting in most situations, so is music. I liked how it changes depending on time of the day, exploring the forest in the middle of the night is much more chilling because of that. But, no matter how great the music is, it still wouldn't hurt to implement the mute option within the game.\n\nConclusion:One of the best RPG Maker games I've played. Developer put a lot of work in this small indie title, didn't take any shortcuts by using default sprites and music, and for that sole reason this game is already better than 75% of other RPGM titles, at least in my book.\n\nDo I recommend buying it? It depends. If you like those kind of games (simple turn-based RPG's with retro graphics), then wait for the sale, because as of now, almost 9€ is a little too much for that kind of game. If you played a couple of RPG Maker or 16-bit RPG games before and didn't enjoy them much, then don't buy Rogue Port, because you probably won't enjoy it too. All in all, I personally liked the game and I think that playing it is a good break from mainstream RPG's.","May 18","true","7.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","6"

I also haven't played Earthbound. This is just another RPG Maker Game on Steam but with a coat of paint covering its stale pre-done engine that jumped on the Underbound train.  Only Undertale was made with Game Maker, has a story worth following and doesn't depend on a stale turn-based combat system.\n\n\nLong~\n\nThe Story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe intro/story is poorly explained, right from the start you choose your characters name and class along with the other friends and your dog after that all you get is a few sentences of dialog that "explains" the story.  After that you get a very limited selection of choices that will effect your starting stats.......then a meteor crashes in the town and your friends are kidnapped.  From then on its just doing random quest that are just joined together with very little dialogue.\n\nThe Gameplay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou walk around (you can also run as well) on the over world like every other RPG Maker Game, the only difference is that the battle changes depending on which direction you face the enemy, the battles are simple enough during the intro sequence while in the house, but don't be surprised if you die right after leaving the house, which also leads to a terrible choice the developer made.\n\nAt No Point Are You Told That The Phone Saves Your Progress\n\nSo after making your characters and going all the way through the intro and making your character....you die and lose your progress. all of it~\n\nAnd the save button is grayed out in the menu.  I actually had to ask the Dev about this and waited a few days for a response.  By that point I was pretty sick of this game and really couldn't see any difference between this and any other crappy RPG Maker Game that I have seen on Greenlight.\n\nTHE GRAPHICS!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWidescreen in 2016 - Nope!!!!!!\n\nFull screen - Yes, but its not adjustable ingame with an option screen or anything like that.  You had to use Alt-Enter to adjust it in early versions, but now F1 brings a generic RPG Maker text box up with limited setting including start in full screen.\n\nBlury Graphics in Full Screen Mode - But Of Course~  It even makes the text nearly unreadable at times.\n\nThe Graphics - Very Mediocre~  Every character looks the same but with different hair and clothes, the enemy sprites look okay, but have been scaled up and look very pixelated.  The battle background have the same distorted look that Earthbound has and honestly don't look good at all, I'm sure that the code for that effect is either already in the RPG Maker Engine or was just found on a forum/tutorial.\n\nI didn't enjoy my experience with this game nor with dealing with the Developer.","May 21","false","1.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","7"

While not anything earth shaking, the game is still quite solid indie RPG.\n\nI did like the character creation quite a bit. It reminded me of Ultima IV, but instead of selecting tarot cards, player selects how they react in a given situation. This selection is accompanied with a small animation. Very good example of "do, don't show" principle in action. Story looks somewhat interesting, albeit a bit cliché.\n\nCharming indie game, that you might like if you enjoyed old Final Fantasies and such on NES or SNES.","May 17","true","5.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","4"

This will not affect my review.)\n\nFirst off, The text was nearly unreadable, it gave me head aches for looking at/reading it.\nThe graphics are good enough for a RPG, I do like some pixel art.\nMy biggest complaint:\nThe game would barely run correctly, moving would lag, moving was stiff, combat was a bit stiff.\n\nNot sure what it qualifies as, a good thing or a bad.\nThis game is basically Earthbound at the start, everything from waking up in your house from the meteor falling,\nThe swirly battle patterns, getting your dog to fight with you and even the battle music distortion/wavey background.\n\nI did want this game to be good, I just couldn't play it very much due to blatant copying and just a lack of basic features and polish.\n\nOther issues:\nThe classes made no sense.\nThe character creation kind of sucked.\nThe font is awful, some nastly low res thing I actually have to squint to read (adding to my headache the game gave me)\nThe map sucks.(The overhead map on the top-left, it's low res, unzoomable and has bad/clashing colors)\nThe game is laggy even though it's a 2D RPG\nThe sound effects were lacking\n\n\n\n-FINAL RATING-\nStay away for a while and wait till they "fix" it.\nIf they don't don't take it at all, not even for free.\n\nEDIT:\nI do not reccomend supporting this developer/team until or unless they can accept creative critisicm.","May 18","false","0.4"," 13 of 36 people (36%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","36","13","36","5","227"
