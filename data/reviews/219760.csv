To get more information about this game, I decided to look at a Let's Play (http://lparchive.org/Beyond-Divinity). Some information is good - for example, sneak is absolutely invaluable. Some I'm unsure of, like all the skills he calls useless. One thing I know for sure he's dead wrong about - magic. Magic is wonderful. Magic is incredible. Magic can break the game in half, especially with the wonders of Hammer. Summoning dolls I'm less sure about, but I think they're worth more exploration.\n\nTo me, this game really hearkens to Warcraft 2 - the music is really reminiscent of something you'd hear during the Orc missions and the cartoonish graphics are similarily familiar (maybe Warcraft 3). It's got RTS-lite gameplay where you control two party members, each with their own skills and stats, with the option to summon more temporarily. The comically bad voice acting is comparable in tone although not in quality.\n\nI do have one big problem with it, though. If you click on the wildlife by accident, -all- wildlife of that type aggro you. There's a lot of wildlife. It gets tedious.\n\nOverall, I'd say give it a whirl. It's a fun adventure and continuation of the Divinity plotline. I'd also recommend finding the Novella, Child of Chaos - it's a short read that sets up the plot of the game and makes later events make a lot more sense.","December 9, 2013","true","36.9"," 55 of 68 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","55","68","3","6"

A lot of very amusing moments, one or two that made me outright clap.\nThe very end of the game and the thought behind it blew me away (although the last fight was a dull potion chugging simulator).\n\nBe mindful of the flaws, however:\nMost of the voice acting is terrible.\nThere are many bugs (nothing major or game-breaking though as I've evidently managed to finish it). Quicksave often with CTRL+S (load with CTRL+ L), and make manual full save checkpoints frequently, though.\nSkill system is deeply flawed, there are not enough skill points for both combat and utility skills, while some skills are also useless (luckily unlearning skills for gold is an option).\nUnique items are almost all outclassed by random drops and are very disappointing.\n\nTips:\nGoogle for "Divinity Child of Chaos" and read the brilliant novella by Rhianna Pratchett.\nBattlefields are a timewaster and can actually be skipped entirely to experience the story content quicker (battlefield merchants are nifty though)\nUnlike in Divine Divinity, you can find keys for every story related chest or door so lockpicking is useless (the random locked containers it allows you to open are not worth the skillpoints).\n","June 13, 2015","true","55.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

As DD was one of the best games I've ever played on PC, the expectations were very high.\nOnce again Larian studios offered us a BIG game. Elder scrolls Oblivion was big, but I could say that this one is EVEN BIGGER. With hundreds of quests and vast worlds, BD has one of the BIGGEST worlds in gaming kingdom ! You get to play with your companion right away and can tune him nicely. Also, you can later summon four more companions and then BD looks like a decent RPG. The only flaw is that the skills of characters are horrific. There are too many skills on the menu for every character, but 70% of the skills are useless ! This is not the way you should develop a good RPG. Refer to Diablo 2 : Couple of skills, choose this or that and everybody's happy. That's the recipe to success. Larian tried to get BD very deep in every term and got lost in the half way.\nHowever, with good story, many non PC's and vast world, we got ourselves a great RPG. With good graphics and decent sound, everybody can play it if they have a good amount of time. On the other hand, technical issues are over the edge. I don't remember that I have ever played a game with some many bugs ! The more you play, the more bugs get along the way. I even couldn't finish the game entirely because of that and that's why I'll give it\n\n79/100","October 25, 2015","true","34.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

It is frustrating in the beginning and you die often. Here is my tip to get past it. save alot, and RUN if it seems impossible. At first, you need to click on top right icon to select and play as the death knight. Now near top right is option to "Select all" You can now fight and control both people at once. You can right click items to send to opposite character if it suits them better. Also click on potion symbol to access all the potions you have, but you have to click it for the corresponding character to heal them.\n\nAlso near top right is option to set your secondary skills. I set the human to lockpicking and skills can be upgraded via vendors to either add new skills, or in essence increase the max level your skills can get to. If you skip one of the imps, it may not let you get skills to +10 as the imp allows. (Thief skills like pickpocket, sneak, lockpick, etc) I would make sure to talk to him and get enough money for atleast lockpick 10)\n\nThe torture chamber master seems impossible. Just backtrack after getting some keys to the burning area that you started at where you first meet the death knight. There should be a small bow in top left area beyond previously locked gate. In battle press space much like dragonage origins, and make sure to click select all and then click enemy and unpause. I control the deathknight to hold aggro and have human archer stay back. Your bow will eventually break, but as soon as you can warp back to base camp from the key you can buy repair skill up to level 6, drag the basecamp key into your inventory and topright skill menu, you will see ability to warp to battlefield, which is an area with many shops but also areas to level up at. Skeletons won't level you up so skip the long dungeon full of them. Once you get a little further where you fight deathknights in chambers, you will soon find another battlegrounds upgrade to lvl 2.\n\nYou can now access new dungeons around lvl 7 area (Keep crossing bridges to the right of battlegrounds to reach these crystal staircase like places) You can only reach the new ones as you get higher level battleground keys.\n\nLook for levers around, hold ALT to see items. Make sure to find a large key that allows you to travel to battlegrounds.\n\nSEE ISN'T IT EASY TO FIGURE OUT_ OF COURSE IT IS! I recommend playing divine divinity first, i got to lv33 in divine divinity, and want to play through both of these before i get into divinity original sin further. Great game, but not as good as divine divinity, but it feels like an accomplishment to get into this game and overcome the learning curves, to get a new experience much like the previous game, but with gameplay that reminds me a bit of dragonage origins.","April 7, 2014","true","6.8"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","0"

Filled with illness people (imps) dying everywhere.\nYou can choose to save the imps or massacer them. I went this good guy way and i am currently attempting to save them.\n\nI have obviously not beaten this game yet so i cannot say to much but this is a diablo clone and a good one. I have heard divine divinity is better but i have not played that (yet) so again i cannot say\n\n\nYou are playing as a prisioner and you have a dark night as a companion. You are both under a spell where your souls are connected meaning If you die so does the other at least until the spell is broken. It puts a nice touch on gameplay and makes keeping both characters alive a top priority.\n\nIf you find your self in a tight spot and cannot heal fast enough there is an in game pause feature where you can still interact with items and your inventory character sheets ect. This puts a touch a stradegy in the game which is a nice thing.\n\nExploration is also a key factor in this game. You can actually move in game items like boxes and things on the world. somethings maybe hidden underneath like keys potions ect. Not a whole lot of games do this which makes finding things a bit harder that you may need. You can also make map notes to help  you remember things you may forget later like entrances to areas, where someone is ect.\n\nyour weapons/armor have a durability status as well which adds an added effect of keeping things well kept.\n\nI do plan on beating this game so if i have any more to add i will update this.\nLast updated 3/11/15\n\nDefinitly worth the $6 you get more then $6 worth of gameplay here.\n\nAs always this is an older game so keep in mind that it may have issues running on newer hardware I probebly will not get updated any time soon to run on newer hardware now. So far i have had no issues with it.

I suspect this game is what inspired Larian Studios to make the upcoming Divnity: Original Sin co-op compatible.\nBeyond Divnity is probably the weakest link in the Divinity series, and it is still at the very least worthwhile.\nKirill Pokrovsky remains the composer of this game's music, and the additions to the  collection of Divinity soundtracks it brings are between good to awesome.

And several female NPCs throughout the game had male voiceovers.\n\nI'm scared.\n\nSerious review:\n\nLet's get the bad out of the way first:\n\nThe voice acting is inconsistent, the game is coded like a pile of bricks, so it runs like ♥♥♥ and there's bugs crawling out the walls everywhere, and savegames like corrupting sometimes (mainly in the last 5% of Act IV), so make many different hard saves every now and then. The skill system got even worse, yet more varied (too varied, really.) and you can't backtrack after completing an act, and probably twelve hundred other things. Now for the rest:\n\nIt seems they decided to randomly pull a Fallout Tactics, and make the game squad based. Well, sort of. You've got your avatar bloke of choice, and the Death Knight who's armor is literally superglued to his ♥♥♥. So he can only equip half the stuff your character can put on, like a belt, and jewellery. As for more party members, you get these summoning dolls which temporarily summon something like a skeleton, or a demon, and have varying stats and equipment restrictions and whatnot. But they disappear if they move too far from the area they were summoned in, so I only use them if something really needs a beating, except not really, because my summons die in nanoseconds because I can't be arsed to spend\na single point in doll upgrades and would rather murder everything with heavy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords instead. So basically, portable stash monster.\n\nAlthough, this game didn't suddenly go turn based, it's still realtime like the first Divinity game, with the exception of the MMO thing where your characters attack in intervals, instead of fast-like, like in Divine Divinity, Diablo, etc.\n\nYou and your Death Knight companion are soul bound, so if one dies, the other one dies as well. It's basically what the Commandos games should have done, wire the whole team's hearts to flatline if any of them die, cause you can't lose any of them either. So you basically have to nervously keep your eye on the tiny health bars in the top right of the screen and keep your hand on a potion when screwing with tougher enemies.\n\nThe skill system got a major rework, you can unlearn skills and get points back AKA respec for gold, they swapped the glorious character sprites for weird 3d models, because lazy- I mean, because animating sprites is hard, son. And the game got a bit more linear. The game decided to do the Diablo II thing and have 4 acts, except be more linear and throw waypoints out the window. When you reach a new act, a FMV plays, and you cannot backtrack beyond that point, and it deletes the previous battlefield and gives you a new one. Aside from that, there's still at least 2 pretty big overworlds throughout the acts and plenty of sidequests.\n\nThe battlefield is a town instance of sorts, once you click a giant magical key at least once in an act, you can enter and leave the battlefield at will anytime, until you reach a new act and have to find at least another key in that act. There are 4 NPCs here which sell and buy stuff and can unlock skills for you to put points into for a fee, as well as 3 dungeons\nthat have several floors each connected to sidequests the battlefield merchants give you unlocked by touching more giant magical keys, or the last key of the act which unlocks all 3 anyway.\n\nThis game has a silly RNG system in where the second you hover your mouse over a container for the first time, the contents are randomized, or should I say, the pocket of air is randomized, because sometimes nothing, and can result in some serious cheese if you save and reload a bunch, which I seriously do not recommend, because you'll probably murder your hard drive slowly with the 20+ MB saves, and also it makes the game a bit too easy, and you a bit too rich.\n\nSo if you go in this game not expecting a super great sequel, can look past the horrible bugs, instabilities, and other game breaking things, and can enjoy a big dumb semi-tactical squad based-sort-of ARPG with varying inconsistencies in it's sometimes hilarious voice acting, then you won't be very disappointed.\n\nI also literally found a developer note ingame past a locked door in black nothingness saying there would have been more to this area if their boss would have payed them more.\n\nExplains everything.\n\nIt looks like this game is... Beyond Their Pay Grade.","May 23","true","32.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Here are my first few impressions before I decided to throw this game out the door. Might be some spoilers below\n\nFirst, I loved DD, however BD at first glance looked like it was going to be fun. It didn't last too long though, some of the first few fights literally steers you away from the game. The DK party mechanics are so horrible, it makes you want to turn the game off. I felt like I was playing a poor mans version of starcraft micro managing 2 characters. So you would think ok, so build this DK tanky and be a wizard or a ranger. Assist your DK while he tanks, nope....its literally a cluster of healing, attacking, and healing some more while you try to kite in a circle.\n\nThe skills system is a complete mess, offering slash? crit? accuracy? to use your skill points on? Isn't that what your character points already do? not a fan...of this...not going to even go into the "how to obtain skills"\n\nThe worst part of the game for me? was the Dark Knight mechanics/party system. I mean this is game killer.  Reloading the saved files 10x because your DK simply is not smart enough to do anything other than die. He stands two miles away while you are running away from the fight. Healing two characters at once (perhaps there's a better way to heal later in the game or I may not know of) from the drop potion icon.\n\nMy final thoughts? perhaps if you went a warrior/warrior combination it might be more enjoyable. I went wizard with a warrior DK. Some people on the forums mentions archerDK/warrior.  I got it on sale, for a couple bucks, even at 5 bucks its not bad for a old school game if you are capable of dealing with bad mechanics","October 19, 2014","false","4.7"," 22 of 44 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","22","44","0","1"

I purchased this game thinking it'd be just as fun as DivDiv 1, but it turned out to be a pile of ♥♥♥♥, from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3d models to the new overcomplicated spell system, and the huge nerfs to almost everything.

I ran back to the guy who set me free, assuming he would protect me from the bloodthirsty guard (he cared about me enough to set me free, so it seemed like the smartest move at the time), but to my surprise, watching me getting stabbed repeatedly by the guard did not seem to move him one bit, which made me realize that the guy must have been a sociopath—I highly doubt he released me out of altruism. Maybe I was better off just letting myself get executed by the guard, I mean, I met two people in my short time there and both of them seemed to have very diminished empathy and remorse, which leads me to believe that thats the way things go around there...

Boy, was this an awful way to get into the franchise. I just hope this game doesn't reflect the other Divinity games. Though, to be fair, I did get warned by the reviews that this was one of the worst ones when I bought it. You start off at the character creation screen. And right off the bat i'm jaw dropped at how awful the graphics are on my character. So I note that down and go about creating my chracter. The classes are Warrior, Wizard, and... Survivor? I think you mean *Thief*, Divinity. Anyway, the character creation is pretty bland. I think you have the choice of like 5 or 6 hair styles and you can't really change your appearance at all. So I pick my stats and my generic character, and I think: " Okay now I'll spawn in. " Nope. Without explination, they throw you into ANOTHER creation screen for some guy called the death knight. I thought they turned my character into this guy. So naturally, i'm like: " What the hell divinity? I wanted to be a thie- er uh.... a *Survivor*... Not a knight?" So tack on an additional five minutes of fumbling with the menu before I realise he's your companion. Could've EXPLAINED that to me. So you start off in a jail cell ( The elder scrolls called, they want their plot back ) and the knight that I had trouble with in the menu comes up to my cell, to speak with me. Real quick, have you ever played a new game and something bad happens and you think: " Oh No.... It's gonna be one of THOSE games... " Well this was one of those for me.  In the next 60 seconds, two things about this game became crystal clear. 1: The voice acting... Is some of the worst i've ever heard in a video game. 2: The story is REALLY bad. I'm not even gonna talk about the story. Just google it if you're curious. I played maybe 10-20 more minutes of this game. It's isometric, which is fine. I love the clasic fallout games so i'm used to isometric. In fact, the isometric combat is the only SINGLE thing this game did decently that I can name off. And it's only decent. I also should mention, the backgrounds suck. They're ugly. And why is this dungeon that looks like something from the 9th circle of hell being gaurded by dumb generic soldiers that adress you with " HEY UHH ERRR HOWD YOU A GET OUT OF YOUR A CELL YOU'RE ONLY LEAVIN HEAR IN A COUGHIN (I know it's coffin Lol)". Just awful. The exit was locked so the knight recommended I search the cells for a key or something. I try, and something comes out and one hit kills me. Thus marked the end of my adventures in "Beyond Divinity". Honestly this game was awful. I got it for like $1.49, and i kind of want my money back. I can't recommend this game to ANYONE. Sale or not. There are better isometric games, and better RPG titles. Every little thing in this game is either a HUGE flaw, or a small flaw that adds up when put together with other flaws. This game SUCKS. 3/10 Simply because the game functions. Hopefully the other Divinity games are better.","February 19","false","0.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Definitely one of the worst games I have every played. The voice acting is bad, I mean, really really awful. You also get basically chained to an annoying death knight npc because you and he share souls. You can't be apart and niether of you can die, so you have to babysit both characters. It's pain to micromanage them effectively, because added on to all of that everything about the game (including attacks, enemies. damage, etc) moves ridiculously fast.\n\nAnother thing is that this game is stupidly hard. I died about 5 times in the first few minutes of the game. This is because my first guy was a wizard, but for some reason you don't start with any spells. My second was a thief but apparently stealth is useless because enemies automatically see you if you get to close. Basically, I got beat to death in a few seconds.\n\nIt's possible to keep your main guy seperate, so I probably could've beaten the first dungeon, but that means you cannot use the "select all" button, meaning you have to switch back and forth to move both characters over and over, which is so tedious. Also, the death knight will just get beat to death if you try to send him in as a tank, so it doesn't solve the problem.\n\nThis game just gives me a headache, so I decided to forget it.

Beyond Divinity... the sequal. A brilliant idea...although a little weird...being partnered up with a deathknight.... i was told most of this game is a based  in a dungeon ...but this aint quite true.... A lot of the game will be spent outside (all be it a different planet) There is much more focus on quests and puzzles in this game rather than mindless clicking combat (which i love) from the first game. The stats screens have been changed into a single window to make it slightly easier to use and a very strange system for your skill set...(choosing your own icon and to be honest a bit confusing. First game was better laid out) The game play is very similar to the first game...although there is now 3D characters which to be honest makes little to no difference. The other big change is the battlefield addition. Where you find keys and you can leave whereever you are...and goto the battlefiled (there are 4 acts and 4 differenct battlefields..1 for each act) once you leave an act you cant go back and use the old battlefield.... anyways these are used for small side quests and to boost your stats and find treasure...  I found these boring after a while....as every dungeon is roughly the same layout...(and there are 3-5 dungeons for every Battlefield in every act) so you can imagine getting pretty bored doing the same thing nearly 20 times!  Regardless of a bit of treasure......\n\nOk now to my biggest complaint about the game.... they must have launched this game in a hell of a hurry... they were moving faster than a nuns first curry! There is SOOOOO many F$%^& bugs with this game..... and im not talking just the original release... Im playing the Steam version...but I also have the DVD version and played years bacl with similar bugs....  The game is almost unplayable at points...... The menus in game (quests) the scroll button never worked for me... so cant see whats been done.......cant read conversations either or game crashes...... When you complete a quest .... unlike Divine Divinity where you were given rewards and SHOWN what they are...... this game it just says... ITEM ACQUIRED and if your carrying a lot of stuff which in this game you will.....uv no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what u got and where it is!!...... Then theres the charms..... why in christ would you make a game with charms and absoultely no information about them wotsoever... just a stupid name like...  PAG-YDRA ...and a colour.... so you dont know what your charms mean... manual says ♥♥♥♥ all! so you have to then ♥♥♥♥ about online to find out about these things....Also you can use charms from word go....but they are all crossed out.  weapon colours ......again no info, although you figure it out over time...but why cant they just have it all down in the manual and make life and the game easier...battlefields arent marked...so you can have 5 dungeons and 2 keys (2 unlocked dungeons) and uv no idea which ones are unlocked so you have to go round them all..... just these annoying little things missed, for me ...really bring the game down.. making you work to enjoy the game....... I could go on but to be fair the game is still enjoyable even with all the bugs.... the storyline is fairly fun, will keep you ammused til the end.  Overall Beyond Divinity is Divine Divinity on magic mushrooms....It has A LOT of bugs ive only mentioned a few...and if i didnt love Divine Diviinty so much i wouldnt recommend this game... but if you like the first then its defo worth a go... i wouldnt play this one first though.","November 24, 2015","true","61.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The stats screens have been changed into a single window to make it slightly easier to use and a very strange system for your skill set...(choosing your own icon and to be honest a bit confusing. First game was better laid out) The game play is very similar to the first game...although there is now 3D characters which to be honest makes little to no difference. The other big change is the battlefield addition. Where you find keys and you can leave whereever you are...and goto the battlefiled (there are 4 acts and 4 differenct battlefields..1 for each act) once you leave an act you cant go back and use the old battlefield.... anyways these are used for small side quests and to boost your stats and find treasure...  I found these boring after a while....as every dungeon is roughly the same layout...(and there are 3-5 dungeons for every Battlefield in every act) so you can imagine getting pretty bored doing the same thing nearly 20 times!  Regardless of a bit of treasure......\n\nOk now to my biggest complaint about the game.... they must have launched this game in a hell of a hurry... they were moving faster than a nuns first curry! There is SOOOOO many F$%^& bugs with this game..... and im not talking just the original release... Im playing the Steam version...but I also have the DVD version and played years bacl with similar bugs....  The game is almost unplayable at points...... The menus in game (quests) the scroll button never worked for me... so cant see whats been done.......cant read conversations either or game crashes...... When you complete a quest .... unlike Divine Divinity where you were given rewards and SHOWN what they are...... this game it just says... ITEM ACQUIRED and if your carrying a lot of stuff which in this game you will.....uv no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what u got and where it is!!...... Then theres the charms..... why in christ would you make a game with charms and absoultely no information about them wotsoever... just a stupid name like...  PAG-YDRA ...and a colour.... so you dont know what your charms mean... manual says ♥♥♥♥ all! so you have to then ♥♥♥♥ about online to find out about these things....Also you can use charms from word go....but they are all crossed out.  weapon colours ......again no info, although you figure it out over time...but why cant they just have it all down in the manual and make life and the game easier...battlefields arent marked...so you can have 5 dungeons and 2 keys (2 unlocked dungeons) and uv no idea which ones are unlocked so you have to go round them all..... just these annoying little things missed, for me ...really bring the game down.. making you work to enjoy the game....... I could go on but to be fair the game is still enjoyable even with all the bugs.... the storyline is fairly fun, will keep you ammused til the end.  Overall Beyond Divinity is Divine Divinity on magic mushrooms....It has A LOT of bugs ive only mentioned a few...and if i didnt love Divine Diviinty so much i wouldnt recommend this game... but if you like the first then its defo worth a go... i wouldnt play this one first though.","November 24, 2015","true","61.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of being a purely old-school isometric RPG, this game adds a bit of action RPG elements to create a different kind of experience.\n\nBack in 2004, this game was actually decent, however it doesn't have the elements to make it reach classic status that Baldur's Gate (or other D&D-based games) holds in this category. You may enjoy it, as there is a lot of content in this world, but when you play it, the game really feels old. Especially since the same developer has now created Divinity: Original Sin (Enhanced Edition) that lets you experience a truer old-school role-playing experience with many modern day conveniences.\n\n6/10 "Okay"","January 8","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Repetitivity, general boredom, and no challenge at all provided by enemies after some levels and skill points spent in overpowered abilities, made me quit before ending act 2.\n\nBattle grounds teleport kills any challenge, as you can restock and resupply at any time even during combat. Abilities, especially Mage / Shaman one are totally OP and can destroy hordes of enemies with ease.\n\nThis game is repetitive and boring, it does not stimulate the player to progress in the right way, like DD did. The devs tried to innovate with extravagant gameplay additions that resulted in failure.\n\nNot recommended.\n","May 5","false","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunetly It is a downgrade to Divine Divinity in many aspects but it does not make it a terrible game . Voice acting,controls,skill animations,models,boss fights and quality of game in general is not as good .\n\nAll games in Divinity series have very creative side quests and hidden secrets that you may find by interacting with enviroment . Beyond Divinity is no exception and if you like games that reward exploration then you should definitely give it a chance . Also on a side note this game has good sense of humor and you never expect it beeing caught up in some evil plot ;)\n\nLet me just say that I do like this game for its immersion but I do not recommend if you looking for easy game to play. The party system controls are execetued very poorly . If you play this game on hard or even normal you will have hard time switching between skills of 2 characters during combat . Skill Systems and RPG portion of this game is not very self explanatory ( you may run into trial and error when it comes to skills more than once )\n\nYou will have a choice of 3 classes Mage,Warrior and Thief . Since you can reset skills with gold and buy new options from NPCs it really does not matter after about 2 hours into the game. Beside you can brake game economy with smart use of pickpocket perk so you can pretty much reset your skills at your will .Basicly there is one universal character that with enough gold and exp can have all percs and spells . If you want to view it as good or bad thing it is totally up to you .\n\nI want it to be very clear that this game has a very steep learning curve and I did not like the game for a long time myself . This game is a Diamond in a rough and it may not be obvious at first . If you hate it on first impression , give it more time and it will win you over .\n\nThere are some major glitches ranging from FPS loss , enemies not spawning and doors not opening . It may make game broken depending on how compitable your system is with old games .\n\n\nThis game has mixed reviews for a reason but it is a good game . I think some people will hate it right away but it is worth playing all the way if you into oldschool rpgs .","November 24, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
