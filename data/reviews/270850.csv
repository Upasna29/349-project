What you will find, however, is a great puzzle game that is a breath of fresh air compared to the thousands of other puzzle games out there.\n\nThe premise is simple:  you own a mechanic shop, and people bring you cars (problems) to fix.  You get a short blurb to tell you a bit of information, but the amount of information that you get can vary- going from "Hey, my battery is dead, can you fix it?" to "Something squeaks under the car.  Fix it."  Your goal is to find and fix the problem while trying not to run out of cash- you get an extra amount of cash for each order, and if that runs out, you can ask the bank for a loan that you have to pay back.  To be honest, though, if you're careful about what you buy and aren't replacing stuff willy-nilly, you ought to be fine.  Just remember- fix it if you can, or replace it outright if you need to.\n\nAnd don't worry about losing parts- the game will not only make you remove items in order off the car, but it will also force you to put them back in order, as well- there's no need to worry about missing any parts- unless it's something like a starter or a plastic engine cover, but even then it won't let you mark it as done until the car is completely put back together.\n\nOnce each objective is met, you'll be able to mark the car as "fixed" and send it on its way.\n\nThere are over seventy problems in the base game alone- plus another twenty in the DLC pack that comes free with the game.  There's another free DLC pack launching later this month with another pack of problems, and that will add even more value to it.\n\nThe problems I have with this game are actually somewhat slight- for one, some of the detection on th orders can be really, REALLY picky.  If it tells you to replace the right front tire, then your new wheel must go on the right front- you can't just move a used wheel from the other side of the car onto there, because it's not explicitly a new wheel. It's smart to take big orders a step at a time for this reason- work on one region of the car at a time, and replace everything needed- or make notes as to what the busted parts were.  There is nothing more swear-worthy in this game than completing a huge order, but being unable to continue because you didn't put some tiny part back in its right space- and then you have to pull the whole blasted thing apart to hunt for it.\n\nThe only other complaint I have is that you will want to hit the radio with a wrench and kill it dead after a half-hour of its awful music.  If you need music, bust out an iPod or turn on an actual radio, because this one will make you want to take it out to the test track and drive over it a few dozen times.  Would it have been too much to ask to get a simple MP3 player in there or something?\n\nAll in all, though, if you're looking for a puzzle game that isn't something about jewels, you'll enjoy this- especially if you have an interest in cars.","October 23, 2014","true","15.5"," 357 of 376 people (95%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","95","357","376","20","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phreakindee/recommended/270850/","phreakindee","phreakindee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phreakindee/","1263 products in account","Several notable annoyances, but this is an enjoyable "lite" simulator of working on cars!\n\nI say lite because it is not a true simulation by any means. It's a moderate approximation of working on modern day cars, but plays more like a puzzle game. That said, what it does offer is quite enjoyable if you like cars or just problem-solving in general. You're given a car and a description of the problem, sometimes specific and sometimes vague, and it's up to you to figure it out.\n\nOften this will involve poking around with a magnifying glass to see if something is glowing red, other times it will mean taking a test drive and seeing what rattles. Come back, take it apart, buy a part online or repair it, replace the part, there you go. Sometimes it'll be as straightforward as changing the oil or brake pads, other times it'll involve tearing down a significant portion of the drivetrain to get to a hard-to-reach part. It's not too complex either, with just the right amount of detail to be believable, but not *every* nut, bolt, and wire from a real car is accounted for. I find it very satisfying to be presented with a car that doesn't work for who knows what reason, poke around and inspect all sorts of parts, go shopping for new ones online, install them, find you need more parts, finish it off and finally take it for that successful test drive around the track. It also looks and sounds fantastic while you're doing it, which is not a requirement in this genre but it's a nice plus if you have the hardware.\n\nMy biggest issues: sometimes it's far too vague and makes a lot of assumptions about what you know. If you don't have a basic knowledge of car parts and their locations, too bad, you're going to be stumbling around a lot since it doesn't tell you where most things are or how many of them to look for. It's also not initially very clear *how* exactly to get to the parts you need to repair, even if you can see them, which is made worse by the camera being finicky. Also, some jobs are insanely picky, like one where you have to replace an ignition wire with a new one: the game gives you the option to replace the wire with used ones, but nope, it has to be new (or over some ambiguous percentage of quality) even though it doesn't tell you this. It is also incredibly easy to screw yourself out of money, since there is a way to upgrade your abilities in the game. If you spend too much on these upgrades before finishing a job, you may not have the cash needed to buy the parts to finish it, leaving you stuck.\n\nI'd still recommend it for sim enthusiasts and the car-curious though, as the price seems *just fair enough* for the amount of enjoyment I've gotten out of it! However, it's lacking in some areas as far as accessibility, clarity, and variety in things to do. It's not as in-depth as some previous games like Gearhead Garage, but it's not nearly as simple as some of the flash games I've played either.","January 24, 2014","true","7.2"," 919 of 1,054 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","919","1","0","12"

There isn't that much more to it.\n\nThe major part of this game that is worth pointing out is that apart from the very first level, you're left completely on your own. If you don't know where something is or how it works you may find yourself stuck. I spent a great deal of time trying to find where the fuel filter was despite me knowing where one belongs on my own car in real life. However because of this fact, I do feel that makes the simulation part of this game rather accurate. I am not a mechanic and obviously I don't know how to work on a car all that much, and you do kind of feel that way when you play this game. Is that really a sign of a good simulator game though? Should the simulation of menial tasks in a video game make the game almost as boring as real life? I think the prospect of at least tinkering and having a go in the comfort of your house without getting dirty is what may warm some people towards this game. Perhaps namely, the teenage car enthusiast / wannabe mechanic market.\n\nThis game is different to the usual game with "simulator" thrown at the end of the name though, although maybe that could be due to the fact for the most part, games that have simulator in the title generally set the bar quite low other than a few of the major players in the simulator genre. I do feel like this one actually gave it a go. It feels like there has been some thought put into it, it doesn't feel half-arsed as you may initially think. When you compare it to other simulator games, it does actually have a lot of things to do, and the way the gameplay works it means you won't ever run out of things to do if you were to find yourself continuing to enjoy playing the game. It's not linear or working to a dreadful storyline, it's just completely honest. Here is a car, here is a list of jobs, go buy the bits, go change them. Admittedly though this will probably get monotonous rather quickly.\n\nAs for the feel of the game, the graphics are actually rather pleasant. Nothing was too garish and nothing of low quality popped out at me, it all felt quite warm and had a nice charm to it. The cars are kind of all the same. They are all generally front wheel drive European style cars. However they do look rather nice, and clearly take inspiration from real life cars but with a few twists and tweaked badges to perhaps avoid any legal issues. The driving aspect is pretty dreadful, the handling is terrible and it's definitely more of a very small almost mini-game function of the game rather than a key element.\n\nI think it's reserved to perhaps car enthusiasts who want to try a car game that's different to the norm, but I wouldn't expect a huge amount of game time. Maybe in the future this game will see a modding community as seems to be the case with a lot of car games. I think this game would appeal most to the typical teenage car enthusiast, but not much more.","January 24, 2014","true","5.8"," 519 of 690 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","519","690","0","5"

The repairs themselves usually follow a standard plot:  run diagnostics (test drive, OBD checker, etc) or examine the parts yourself until you find the one or two parts that are bad, remove as many parts as are necessary to remove the bad parts, buy replacements for the bad parts from your garage computer (or repair them if possible), then install the new parts and replace everything else.\n\nAt least, that's how it's *supposed* to go.  If you want to go a different (*cough* chop shop *cough*) route, you can make use of the otherwise mostly useless used parts store also on your garage's computer.\n\nSay your job is to replace some bad brake pads.  To get to those pads, you'll also have to remove the tire and the brake caliper.  The parts that you don't need to replace for a job are usually in pristine condition, meaning that if you sell them, you'll get a much higher price for them.  All you have to do is go to the used parts store and see if they have a working caliper and tire for that car that's in okay condition (as long as it's better than red condition, it should work).  Of course, they might not have a barely working caliper or tire for that car, but they might have an exhaust manifold that will be just perfect.  So, remove the original exhaust manifold too.  As long as it's in better condition than what the used parts store is selling, you'll profit.  Sell off the originals, buy/install the used parts, and pocket the difference.  Your clueless customers will drive off happy, and you will have sold off perfectly good parts of their car for a tidy profit.","July 1, 2014","true","6.6"," 111 of 124 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","111","124","0","5"

I have a Quad Core 3.8ghz AMD, GeForce 730 2gb Graphics Card, and 8gb DDR3 RAM. As soon as I loaded up the first vehicle in the game, I experienced low framerates. I exited and changed the video settings to Quality High, Resolution 1280x720, VSync OFF, Antialiasing DISABLED (These are the same settings I use for DayZ, which gives me 40+FPS). I now have 0 drop in framerate, and the game still looks beautiful. I've been an experienced mechanic for over 10 years. I am a certified CNC Machinist, as well as a certified Mercedes-Benz Technician. I've been a gamer since the NES days. The graphics are really good, and I haven't experienced any noticeable bugs, glitches, or clipping issues. The sound is ok, but nothing to brag about. I did listen to the radio, but had turned it down 50% before I even started. I never found it to be annoying. Movement around the shop environment is pretty smooth. No issues there. The game starts every level with a worksheet that explains what the customer wants you to check for or replace. Great thing is, you can refer back to this worksheet at anytime. Most of the parts can be visually inspected without removing them, but a lot of parts can only be inspected upon removing something in front of it (i.e. a timing belt before inspecting the water pump). The electrical components must be checked using the OBD Scan Tool. You are also able to test drive vehicles in order to diagnose bad parts, and the physics are good. Right clicking the mouse opens a menu allowing you to install parts, remove parts, turn the chassis transparency off/on, and turn the parts color, such as red, yellow, and green corresponding to the condition, off/on. Some of the parts can simply be removed, others must be unbolted and bolted back on. Everything must be installed in the reverse order of removal. Yes, you can forget to install parts, but you cannot give the car back to the customer until you fix your mistakes. The game automatically checks tasks off your worksheet as you complete them. After a little over an hour of playing, I found this game to be very fun. I'm impressed that any developer would tackle a game like this, and with such detail. Don't expect it to be 100% realistic, such as every nut and bolt, accurate pricing, names of cars, etc. I don't think anyone could learn the basics of car repair from this game, but I do think someone can use this game to understand the overall concept of automotive repair. I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this game. I wish the concept of this game would've implemented on Forza, Grand Turismo, or Need For Speed a long time ago! If you're interested in automotive repair, get this game now that it's on sale.","November 11, 2014","true","4.0"," 101 of 118 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","101","118","5","7"

But the game is far, far away from simulating the really important things about being a mechanic.\nI guess if the devs implemented a few more challenges like stuck bolts, and the need to use the right amount of force (and maybe to pick the appropriately sized tools for the task), this would be much more challenging. I'd love to see that implemented, maybe by dragging the mouse to keep a "torque bar" in the green area or something.\n\n\nPros:\n+ you get to learn about lots of car parts and what they do\n+ it's fun to figure out what the problem is\n+ sometimes you get one symptom with several causes - just like in real life. Very good.\n+ sometimes, you can fix parts instead of replacing them. That's something many real life garages seem to have forgotten.\n\nSo why am I giving it a thumbs down?\nWell.\n\nSome of the most basic and most important things about fixing cars are missing. The game reduces disassembly and assembly to clicking a few bolts:\n- No torque requirements for bolts in sensitive places.\n- No stuck bolts that you can break off.\n- No need to pick the correct tool for the task.\n- No caveats where order of disassembly is important because of the mechanics or the electrical systems. You're either prevented from making mistakes, or the things that would be mistakes in real life don't matter. The worst I've seen so far: I can rip out the starter without even disconnecting the battery - now there's a recipe for disaster.\n\nOther cons:\n\n- the real life challenge of saving time by disassembling as few things as possible in order to get to the damaged part is missing. Maybe it comes in at a later stage of the career, but as far as I've played, you can happily rip apart the whole car if you feel like it without any financial repercussions.\n\n- Different versions of the same part for different model years? Multiple vendors with different price and quality levels? Delivery times?

You certainly play as a car mechanic, although I think the ‘simulator’ part of the title is a bit of a loose term.The game is slightly educational though. I knew the basics about the inside of a car and how it works, but I definitely wouldn’t have been able to fix one for you. I still can’t, but at least I can tell you where most of the stuff is. In CMS2014, you are tasked with fixing a stream of cars with various problems. At the start of each level, you receive a clipboard with a check list of objectives. Change the brake pads. Check the exhaust. You’re also given a note from the customer trying to give more details about what’s wrong with the car. I wasn’t sure if the poor grammar in these sections was intentional to give a sense of dealing with idiotic customers, but I fear it wasn’t. Your job is to fix the car, stamp the form, and send your customer on their merry way.Early levels are simple as your customers appear to be mechanics themselves and know exactly what’s wrong with the car, leaving you with the simple task of replacing the broken part.However, it isn’t long before someone shouts “IT’S MAKING NOISES”, and runs off leaving you to figure out what’s wrong. This is when you will have to start examining the ins and outs of the car. Damaged parts will be shown in red and must be replaced. This often means taking large sections of the car apart. Who knew it was so complicated to change part of the suspension? Maybe complicated isn’t the right word here. I’m sure it is in real life, but in CMS2014 it’s just… lengthy. You have to unscrew bolts one at a time by holding in the mouse button, but that’s about as tricky as it gets.The only barrier is knowing exactly where the part you’re looking for is when you’re trying to fix it. This is quite a high barrier when you don’t know, but each part is labelled when you mouse over it, so you’ll find it eventually.The monotony is broken every now and then when you’re asked to take a car for a test drive to test acceleration, braking, handling and suspension, but after the first drive of unresponsive handling, I wasn’t particularly looking forward to the next one.You never really feel like you’re progressing. The garage I was working in changed a couple of times suddenly, without any fanfare. It looked nicer and there were some more gadgets, but it was odd that I was plonked in there with no warning. It was as if I had walked into someone else’s garage and decided to work there for a while.Maybe you need to be a lot more into cars than I am to get something out of CMS2014. Objectively though, it just doesn’t seem like a whole lot of fun. There’s a lot in there for the price, but there’s only so much you can fix in a car, and with 75 levels in the main game, along with an “endless mode”, things become repetitive fairly quickly.Overall 6/10.","December 29, 2014","true","27.2"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","34","39","3","0"

Any way here are some pros and cons I have for this game.\n\nPROS:Can “learn” skills\nLots of puzzles (more of a puzzle game then simulator which isn't too bad)\nYou get a new shop as you progress (I would of preferred to have to buy the shops)\nThe tests you run on vehicles are pretty cool (but can become boring)\nMay help you learn about vehicle parts\nCONS:Can become repetitive and feel like a chore\nSometimes too simple\nDoesn't feel like a true simulator (more like a puzzle but still not too bad)\nNot many parts some don't even get used and USED parts are pointless\nLots of parts are missing (compared to a real car)\nStrange sun glare that can become annoying\nCamera sometimes does not want to cooperate\nNo exotic cars\nVery empty shop (would be cool to have coworkers working on other cars and maybe seeing customers in the lobby)\nEnd of career kind of a let down (didn't really feel like I accomplished anything)\n\n\nWith all those cons I still really enjoyed the game. My favorite repair order was 42 which had you finding out what parts are missing, kind of wish more were like this.\n\n\nAnd now for the DLC. I have not fully completed the DLC but I did try it out to get the basic idea of it.\nFor the 4x4 DLC I felt like it would have been better to combine it with the career mode.\n\nPROS:New Test track for 4x4 vehicles (I thought it was pretty cool)\nNew vehicles\nCONS:Things you learned from the main career (books skills) don't transfer over\n\n\nAll in all its basically the same so yeah nothing to special.\n\n\nAnd now for the Drag DLC\nI really liked this one and wish the main career was similar towards end game. They added a lot which is nice.\n\nPROS:Shop is a bit dirtier (made me feel like cars have been worked on earlier)\nNew parts (instead of learning books you get a whole new store for racing parts)\nNew test track (drag)\nYou get more options when it comes to working on the car, this time its not about oh my muffler broke, it's “I need to beat this time so here's money, make it happen!”I didn't have any cons, I really enjoyed this part.\n\nLike i said I know this review is late and I'm sure the new game will be much better.","September 30, 2015","true","12.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","21","25","4","0"

Sadly, the difference between the car in game and a real car is seriously just enormous. The only way this could be a solid game is if at least all of the parts of a car that aren't chassis, interior, and automatic transmission were correctly modeled and there were at least several variations to encounter, or the game at least had an interesting metagame that rewarded efficiency. Instead, it's seriously just a super simplified engine, suspension, exhaust and fuel systems, and that's it. Basically just a rough approximation of a car. You'll do the same three or four things over and over and you almost don't even need to read the scenario information, just find the grubby looking part and replace it. The game trailer says there are around 150 parts in the game, what they aren't telling you is around 130 of them are screws.\n\nThe money in-game is seriously worthless because there is no metagame, at all. None. So, no matter what you do, efficiency is irrelevant. Buying used parts is a waste of time, even good used parts aren't counted as 'good' parts for the repair. Selling off the old parts from each scenario is a pain, not to mention worthless. The diagnostic track seriously does nothing; no matter what is wrong with the car it is the same every time, you just magically know what's wrong after wasting your time driving around. Which is something you are often required to do for no reason even if you know what to fix because it's included in the scenario objectives. The music is good for about twenty seconds, after which it becomes patently awful.\n\nOverall, the fun petered out after about two hours and eventually I realized that the game isn't ever going to get any more complex, approaching that of a real car. New garages don't matter because the car and its problems are always the same, the extra space is actually annoying. The game is more of a tech demonstration than a game, I would expect it to be nearly free, so I'm glad I got it at a significantly reduced price.","May 3, 2015","false","6.7"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","29","40","3","0"

If you have an interest in one or especially both than you might be surprised that you could enjoy something like this. And that's what this is, it's a puzzle game based on car repair. Customers bring you work orders with complaints or requests much like in the real world and you have to diagnose and repair the problem. There are 76 work orders (many of them with rather humorous descriptions) in the base game and 20 in the included offroad DLC with more to come soon.\n\nMalfunctioning vehicles are basically the puzzle to be solved and it's a very simplistic puzzle at that compared to a real car. You don't have to be a pro mechanic to play this but some basic troubleshooting knowledge does help. Otherwise you might find yourself tearing down the entire car to find the bad parts if you're clueless where to start when someone brings you a car that has trouble starting for instance.\n\nThe repair jobs vary in length, time and complexity as you go. You can order the parts you need online at your terminal and fix some of them at your workbench to save costs and increase your profit. You can also spend money on training to increase some basic skills that earn you more money per job, discounts at the parts store and speed up disassembly and bad part identification. There is also a test track and diagnostic path that you can drive the car on to help identify malfunctioning systems.\n\nThe in game music is this terrible dubstep crap that just annoys the hell of me but thankfully it can be turned off.\n\nYou won't become an ASE certified mechanic or learn to run your own repair shop by playing this, but it's a good way to kill some time without a huge time commitment with no pressure. It's definitely worth picking up on sale at the sub $10 price point that I got it at.","July 10, 2014","true","15.4"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemyLabue/recommended/270850/","RemyLabue","RemyLabue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemyLabue/","394 products in account","The primary objective of a simulator is to accurately recreate the feeling and control of completing an existing real world task, like driving, managing, farming, dating, etc. Obviously, not all real world tasks are entertaining, in fact, most are repetitive jobs you work day after day for a paycheck. The draw of a well made simulator is the ability to experience a career virtually that you may never have the chance to experience in real life. Sometimes this can be interesting and educational, sometimes a lot of fun, and sometimes extremely boring. It's up to the individual to decide if the simulator is fun or repetitive, which makes this genre extremely difficult to review. Do I review it based on its entertainment value alone, or how accurately it depicts the task it's trying to recreate?\n\nThe focus of this particular simulator is in the title. At the start of each job you are provided with a work order explaining what the issue is, and it's up to you as the mechanic to resolve the issue as best as you can. Generally this requires you to remove and check individual parts, and replace the ones that are damaged. If you don't know anything about cars it can be difficult to locate the issues at first, but once you fix the first ten cars or so you'll know exactly where to look for the problems and how to fix them.\n\nDon't worry, there is no time limit or grading system to worry about here. Each job takes however long you need it to, so you never feel rushed or stressed. In fact, later on the game feels entirely too easy, since turning off the body model of the car grants you immediate visual access to most parts, and the ones that are in bad shape stick out like a sore thumb with a very different texture than the rest.\n\nLocating and resolving the issues is very enjoyable. Removing and replacing the individual parts is very intuitive and even a little educational if you have zero experience with fixing cars. The models are easily recognizable, even though the vehicles are generic due to licensing constraints. There's even a radio in your garage to listen to while you work, though I hope in the future they provide a way to point it to your own music directory. You really do feel like a professional mechanic, which is the most important thing when developing a simulator.\n\nAs you progress through the 70+ jobs that come with the main campaign, you'll unlock new garages to work in with new tools such as the Path Tester, Workbench, and Chip Tuner. The interesting thing is, you don't really feel like you own the garage, even though it's implied. Each car that comes in is paid for in advance and you have to fix the problems as cheaply as possible to profit. Not being able to set your own prices or contact the customer after inspections seems like a missed opportunity here. There are zero management duties when it comes to running the garage. No rent or utilities payments to make, employees to manage, cleaning to be done, inventory to take, or anything else that comes with running a business like this. Car Mechanic Simulator is very focused on the act of fixing cars, and little else. That can be a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for, but personally, I hope that these aspects will be added in later updates.\n\nFeatures such as the OBD Reader and Obstacle Course seem more like novelties than required mechanics. Neither helps with diagnosing the issues with the cars, but both were required on multiple occasions for completing a work order, which is a shame. Providing more feedback from these features in the future would go a long way to improving on this idea. Even having your character mutter to himself while driving about how the car is handling would be a fantastic addition.\n\nCar Mechanic Simulator feels like a great base for what will eventually become a fantastic simulator. I feel that the developers are on to something special, and cannot wait to see what the future holds for this franchise. If you are even a little interested in working on cars, but don't have the money, energy, or are generally against getting covered in grease, then look no further. With multiple free add-ons, and an endless mode, you'll get hundreds of hours out of this title. It does a great job of simulating the act of working on cars, so in that respect, it succeeds in its primary goal.

First of all I recommend this product not because it actually captures the essence of being a auto mechanic but because I felt this was an innovative concept worthy of people's attention. This game only introduces you to the very basics of being an auto mechanic\n\nI think that this simulator is a good bases of a game, but if the developer does not add levels of complexity in future versions I would not be willing to purchase in the future.  It would be a shame if the developer simply changes the look of the garages, adds a few cars and slaps a 2015 on the title.\n\nBeing a mechanic is more than just diagnosing problems, taking parts off, and than putting them back on.  Imagine you are a mechanic and you have eight vehicles needing repaired with one bay and all eight customers wanting their car done now.  In addition, you have to battle the different part stores trying to locate the parts you need to complete the jobs.  It is a constant juggling act and this simulator does not even touch this aspect of being a mechanic.\n\nFurther more, parts do not come off as easily as they do in this game.  Bolts seize, snap, and get cross threaded making the repair more difficult and resulting in a lot of lost time.  The time of the mechanic is very important.  The quicker the mechanic can complete the job the faster they get paid and get the next vehicle in their garage.  Mechanics receive their pay through their labor which is determined by the amount of time it takes to reasonably complete a repair job.  If a repair job takes longer than expected the mechanic loses money and has an upset customer.  This is also not captured in the simulator.\n\nThis simulator does not let you misdiagnose a problem.  mechanics screw up all the time causing themselves lost time trying to fix the problem and make things right with their customer.  This game does not let you advance until you have complete the entire repair job correctly.\n\nFuture versions of this game  could have a lot of potential.  If I was rating this game from 1 - 10 I would give it a 6.","January 25, 2014","true","4.8"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

If you're like me, and was a huge fan of GHG and was patiently waiting for a sequel that never materialized, I'm happy to say that you'll finally be able to scratch the itch one more time.\n\nWhile Car Mechanic Simulator doesn't have as many features as I'd like, for example you can't completely tear down an engine (the block and all it's innards are inaccessible) but, there's a huge amount of features that really do a great job of simulating the act of car maintenance. Unlike Gearhead Garage where cars could be snapped back together in under a minute, things in CMS actually take time. All the bolts need to be twisted into place, parts need to be observed to determine if they're still good or need to be either repaired or replaced, and approach angles to get at certain parts that you can't reach from overhead or underneath.\n\nYou're given a garage space which you can walk around in and interact with. Turn on the radio if you like, though most of the songs are terrible dubstep beats. There's a repair bench and a computer where you can do some online shopping and buy new or used parts. There's even an rig for draining oil that you can drag into place.\n\nIn career mode you take work orders from customers who either know what the issue with their car is or just vaguely describe what happens when they drive. You can determine this yourself as well by taking the car for a test drive and seeing how it handles giving you some insight about the parts you should check.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the camera is a little sluggish and takes time to zoom in and out some times making the bolt you're trying to reach very awkward.\n\nThey are of course planning updates and expansions, my biggest of which (maybe for a future sequel) would be the ability to own and race your own cars as well as tear cars down completely. For now though, if you're a car guy or gal, considering it has zero competition, it's pretty fun. 7 / 10","January 24, 2014","true","7.7"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

Who did not may actually enjoy this game.\nI expceted some "new GG" and bought the game on Steam Sale without really checking it on some gameplay video.\nHere are my main problems with the game.\nThe UI design and general controls are really touching my nerve. How camera works and how you actually select and use various parts is not very well designed. It lacks some swiftness, it feels really clumsy. Also - the game touches only the surface, it does not go deep, it is very basic level of simulation. One example for all - if you need to determine what is wrong with the car, you just take it to the same track every time, doing exactly the same things and then it will automatically show you which exact parts are damaged or busted. Another example? Starter, that was worned out to the point it showed only 5 % of it's "health" was repaired back to full 100 %. I mean, why do even need spare parts then, if it works like that?\nOh and the soundtrack...I'm only grateful, that you can turn the radio in your workshop off...\n\n\nIt's hard to explain.

You'll delve into the life of an automotive mechanic, starting out in a basic "shade tree" style garage and work your way into more professional garages, which is a neat.\n\nThe depth of which the game delves into auto-repair in my experience with the game so far, has been very basic; but a couple steps above "Gearhead Garage" of yester-year. If you aren't very knowledgable in the automotive service arena, you might find this game entertaining in it's own right.\n\nHowever, if you are knowledgable with cars and car repair; you're going to find yourself pointing out flaws in the details of this game. For example: The lower suspension arm on the cars in game doesn't look like it would work because only one side that mounts to the chassis is designed to pivot while the other side is a solid mount. And $200 oil changes.\n\nBeyond that, the camera movement controls can be frustrating at times. In dissassemble/assemble mode the camera orbits around a selected object, which often makes some parts difficult to select or view. Once you get used to it you'll figure out quickly how to work around it.\n\nThe test drive feature is pretty much useless in my experience with the game, I've test driven cars numberous times and this feature just doesn't communicate problems like you'd expect. I've never heard an odd sound, or experienced problems with the handling or performance of cars I've test driven. And if you have any knowledge of cars at all you can pretty much track down issues with just a few clicks of the mouse.\n\nIf you're an autoentusiast like myself, I don't think this game will scratch that tinkering itch for very long. If you aren't an autoenthusiast, or very knowledgable of automobiles; this game could serve as a basic introduction to auto repair.\n\nBut the important question is: "Is it fun?" Sure, I enjoyed playing it for a little while; but due to certain details and a lack of interesting cars to work on, I lost interest.","June 25, 2014","true","8.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Check the  specs for details!\n\nYou start out small in a hole in the wall garage and work your way up to a nice fancy garage with a test path and a dyno to do chip testing so you can boost up the HP (horse power) of the car! There is a way to set up the chip without just clicking the + or - countless times to get that perfect setting. I figured it out after a few tries when I noticed how they move. You'll see what I mean when you play it.\n\nAnother feature I like is the test track outside the garage! The career track is straight forward marked off with cones that you try not to hit to complete each of the 4 test runs. The 4x4 has the same test track but with mounds of dirt to really test the suspension and can be very hard to controll but do-able if your careful. Then the tuning track which is a straight 1/4 mile track to test the cars for drag racing, which by the way has it's own upgrades in the garage to buy to boost HP. Love that!\n\nI have had no glitches in the game play at all since the updates and really enjoyed my time playing it! 2 thumbs up!\nThis game is worth the money you pay for it!","June 6, 2015","true","38.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

There are multiple elements of the game which while they exist, seem to serve no other purpose other than a tick box to check. In particular I'm referring to the Test Drive and/or Diagnosis Path, which no matter the problem with the car, is just a short series of actions to do before returning to the workshop essentially none the wiser of the problem as it plays out the same every single time.\n\nThis, however, doesn't even present a problem as once you've had 5 minutes of gameplay, you quickly see that the whole repair is simply a case of looking for the grubby/rusty looking part, removing it and replacing it. You barely need to look at the description at all.\n\nAs others have also said, the gameplay is just simply not deep enough to be challenging or rewarding in any way. Just plays out as a time sink with little to no pay off.\n\nThankfully I picked this up for very cheap in a sale, but definitely not worth full price and wouldn't consider it a "sim" at all.","August 31, 2015","false","2.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

I suppose it's really possible to find a solution for every mission by checking every single part on the car and replacing it but this would be quite boring and mundane so I really don't think it's for people who are clueless about the thematic. Sometimes customer has an idea what's going on and tells you straight up, sometimes they just want you to repair all the damaged parts and it can be difficult to narrow down the last part or two that need repair/replacement.\n\nIn terms of reality/simulation it's definitely simplified but the game is featuring all basic parts and especially the usual suspects that mechanics are dealing with. A lot of missions are based on changing oil, filters, or timing but then again I guess this is most common in reality as well.\n\nProgression is such that you start in a basic garage, and as you work through the missions you gain access to better garage with additional tools for tuning vehicles. You can also shop for upgrades (faster unbolting, discount at parts shop, etc.)\n\nI would add that on graphics side it's really well done, the parts look very realistic. Damage can also be observed visually, for example worn rubber, or corroded metal can indicate that part needs replacement before even checking it out.\n\nOne negative that I would mention is lack of absolutely any kind of help or tutorial system - you're completely on your own. I guess this can really put off a number of people who are not really familiar with all of this.","May 18, 2014","true","15.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Otherwise, stay away.\n\nI honestly I shelled out 7 bucks for this product simply because this one actually featured a full demo, and seeing that in a game was worth my money. Now that I have completed the main campaign, clocking in at around 8 hours, I have to say.... sure, this was worth my 7 dollars.... but not much more than that.\n\nI enjoyed the automotive themed puzzles, I enjoyed learning (*cough*) more about the underpinnings of cars than I neccessarilly knew before, and generally had a pleasent time with the game. However, there were several aspects of the product that caused it to suffer not only as a game, but as a 'simulator'.\n\nFirst and foremost: the game is shallow. At the risk of it no longer being offered: after playing through the demo, there really isn't that much more to the game. You basically do what you do in the demo... 73 more times. Sometimes you'll receive a fairly realistic customer complaint "It's making noise when I do this, fix it" and have to tear apart the car to find the solution, but more often then not the game boils down to "Run the diagnostics, testdrive or simulate a test drive, replace the red bits, repeat." There honestly is very, very little more to the game beyond what you see in the demo.\n\nThe developers seem to have spent both far too much effort and not nearly enough in developing their little driving simulation. It looks great, I'll give it that. However, as far as I can tell, there was absolutely no feedback you received while test driving the vehicle. You never hear any noises that the customer complained about, despite having 'completely wrecked' suspension a car can handle just fine, etc. Crashing into a wall, peeling out, revving the engine unneccessarilly, or just about any stress at all performed during the test drive seems to have no impact at all once you are back in the garage. Completing the test drive requires you to pass through certain highlighted green areas, and stop in certain red ones. You can completely blow the 'course', as long as you meet those two criteria, the 'test drive' is a success..... which automatically displays the condition of some of the parts for you. Hurrah. It would GREATLY benefit from greater response/interactivity while driving, some added realism, or even just getting a REPORT at the end of it saying what the test driver found... rather than automatically highlighting specific parts green/orange/red.\n\nAs previously mentioned, if you've played the demo, you've seen nearly all the game has to offer. Repairing a part never gets more exciting than taking it to a workbench, clicking 'repair', then putting it back into the car. Despite having RPG-esc features involving 'training' your in-game avatar, none of them revolve around any manner of increased skill, ability to repair parts, diagnose problems, or any such thing. You can arbitrarilly get more money, get new parts for cheaper, auto-magickally know the quality of random parts on a new car, and turn bolts faster (that last one being the only actually handy one).\n\nSpeaking of turning bolts (Which is all we do), that enterprise itself is surprisingly shallow. From the first time you take off a wheel in the demo, your only interaction with a tool is to click on a bolt and hold down the mouse button until the bolt comes off. The immersiveness of the game could be SIGNIFICANTLY improved by just giving us some darn wrench or ratchet action. Why not make an 'upgrade' being going from a wrench, to a ratchet, to a powertool? You know, get some actual hand movements in there, cranking on a rusty bolt on some of these clunkers. Instead, we get the magical mouse pointer of destiny. The pointer looks like a little wrench icon though, so, that's something.\n\nAt several points throughout the experience, I began to feel that I, having watched/supported my uncle do some engine work on my car, had more automotive knowledge than the developers... or they are choosing to be overly simplistic. They make you pull a little oil catcher over to catch used oil or they fine you every time, but not once do they ask you to grab a torquewrench and tighten some sparkplugs to specifications, actually referance some OBD codes from their magical color-painting hand device, worry about the brake fluid line as you yank off the calipers, or ever once worry about putting a gasket back on the crankcase.\n\nRather than put more effort into the mechanic part of their simulator, the developers seem to have put too much effort into the CAR part of their simulator.... the test-drive, the high-resolution interiors that you get to see when you're waiting for the OBD wand to finish, and the schnazzy custom car you get after completing the campaign!!.... whose parts you can't modify or even inspect... and you can't even sit inside.\n\nNow, onto the GAME part...\n\nYou are prohibited from finishing a job unless you caught every broken part and replaced the oil if it was bad. You never lose cash, get reprimanded, or suffer any form of punishment other than being required to find the missing link before moving on.\n\nYou might be fooled into thinking you'd be able to haggle prices, make estimates, charge customers for parts and/or manhours.. you can't. The game's claimed 'interaction with customers' consist of you being told what you will receive for the service, regardless of how much it costs you to perform said service.\n\nDespite a customer telling you they want the car to be 'driveable', attempting to purchase and mount a 'used' part and then driving the vehicle around the test area does not count as a successful repair. Only after purchasing and mounting brand spanking new 100% quality parts for almost the entirety of your budget will you be allowed to move on.\n\n\nThis game has a lot of potential and fills a little gaming niche that I haven't seen approached before, but is lacking some serious development and thought put into how to make it a more engrossing and interesting experience. Despite the 'add on' having been published last april, a cursory look at the forums shows the devs crowd sourcing ideas for a new product (Simulator 2015!) rather than improving on this one.\n\nALL of this being said, I paid 7 bucks and was entertained for 8 hours. Despite all the little annouyances that really bugged me, there's a certain satisfaction to reading off a random customer complaint and now knowing to check X, Y, and Z.","July 11, 2014","true","12.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's nothing more than a basic simulator on garage repair. It may not hold all the detail needs of work but it is a game. Your given a work order to fix a problem. On the work order is the budget amout for parts you may need. So you get to see the mechanic fustration of a small budget with a customer who wants one thing replaced and the vehicle has all thease other problems too. Some parts can be repaired on the work bench such as starters, altenator, and what not. You go through the mechanic foot steps on inspecting parts by means of trouble shooting and problem solving. Not much different than a regular car repair. Just like fixing a real car you go through the pains of having to take parts off to get to the ones you need to replace. How ever unlike a real car everything comes off perfact. The only thing I find useless in the game so far is the OBD scanner. It is sopose to trouble shoot problems depending on any failuer that is given to the on board computer from the sensors. It dose nothing but just scan and tells you nothing. And you can't hook to the computer in the shop to get a reading. Other than that its good game.

These second rate parts can be bought for real(see fake) money, installed, then removed and replaced with new ones after you discover that junkyard sourcing is not acceptable for any application.

But once you have completed a fair few "missions" you can find the game to be repetitive (especially if you're like me and take all four wheels and track rods off just to change an air filter (it takes a lot of wrench work!)) However I'm not bored of this game after 4 hours, but I do wish it had some achievements.\n\nShould a sequel be released, I'd hope for more ways to fix the cars, as in this iteration, although you can do a lot of work on the cars, you can't change anything in the interior of the vehicle, and you can't work deep within the engine. You can change belts and starters and gearboxes; but pistons and manifolds are out of reach, sealed in the engine block. Maybe add some cosmetic work too? Someone brings their car to you because they want a dent removed, or it repainted? That'll be fun! Maybe even work on your own car/garage with the money you earn?\n\nSo to summarise, it's a fun game, even more fun than I expected from a game called "Car Mechanic Simulator 2014", but in the next one I'd like to see a lot more jobs and mission variation.","June 26, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

But it leaves a lot to be desired.  This is a review about as game that could have been much better, and instead is just a fun play if you get it cheap.\n\nThe "simulation" aspect is weak.  I am not saying that the game is bad, I am saying that I wish it was better.  For instance, a customer's car won't start:  I thought it would be a good idea to check the battery cables but alas there are none.  There are also no radiators, no fluid in the transmissions, no tire pressure, the list goes on.\n\nThe game also features repairs of an individual part; you can, apparently, repair a water pump!  I have never known a mechanic to repair something like that.  Maybe it can be done but typically they just install a new part on your car and charge you for it.  The only part-repairs I have seen are things like splicing wires or welding a busted exhaust pipe.  Simple stuff.\n\nThe pricing is crazy too.  People are spending over 10,000 USD to repair used cars.  Things like a new battery cost 350 USD even though they can typically be had for under 100 USD in real life.  Other things are odd too, spark plugs are 35 USD but again in real life they are perhaps 2-5 USD.\n\nThe game play gets tiring.  In the beginning you are using your mind to try and troubleshoot problems and find a damaged part.  As the game goes on you learn to, 1: diagnostic scan; 2: test drive; 3: path test; 4: click hide body and show part condition.  9/10 times it will show the damaged parts in red and then you just have to spend the time disassembling the vehicle.  The only time this won't show you the damaged part is if its in the transmission or if its the air filter.  Very little challenge at that point.\n\nThe 4X4 add on is a good idea but it mostly consists of unlicensed Jeep Wrangler models.  Not One Pickup, Not on Land Rover, Not One V8, Not One Lift Kit.\n\nThe 1/4 mile add on is the best part of the game.  In the beginning you have limited money to upgrade the parts and tune a car to hit a 1/4 mile time.  This too grows easy over time as the budget increases you start having enough money to simply buy ALL the performance parts for each car.  Most of the bolt-ons give ridiculous amounts of extra power.  Worst of all, there are no Cold Air Intakes in a performance shop - just crazy.  Unfortunately, while drag racing there is no shifting to be done by the player even though many of the vehicles have manual transmissions.  What a shame, its one of the main aspects of drag racing titles that you find on your mobile phone.\n\nThis could have been an incredible game - and I hope they make another one, because developers can usually build on simulations until they are truly great.  For now, its a fun game and I gladly played through the whole thing.  I think its enjoyable, but it won't give you any real world knowledge.  It might be damaging if you learned that its normal to pay 800 USD for a mechanic to install a new battery, or perhaps you think that your transmission ought not have any fluid in it.  I don't consider this any more educational than I do Need For Speed Hot Pursuit.  But its still fun - Happy Gaming.","January 2, 2015","true","19.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

If the clutch is bad the car still drives fine etc.\n\nThe career mode is repetitive and towards the end offers nothing except the enjoyment of fixing cars. They have only two different motors so far and I'm towards the end. You only replace basic parts on the car. Nothing internal in the engine itself just external stuff.\n\nThe game is simple and if you do not know much about cars you could kinda learn the basics from this game. I recommend this if your a car/motor enthusiast but if your looking for something on the lines of NFS stay away.","January 27, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kicmorikic/recommended/270850/","kicmorikic","gicek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kicmorikic/","451 products in account","Fun puzzle game. Executed reasonably well. If you ever played Gearhead Garage, then you're in for a treat. It is essentialy that game, but in a modern package. It is in some cases much more realistic than Gearhead Garage. There are more aspects of being a mechanic than just assembling and disassembling cars depicted. I really liked the game, but i have few things that are less than ideal.\nUnfortunately you cannot disassemble the whole car- engine is almost monolitic, there are parts of the suspension that are non interactive. Also there is no way to disassemble the body of the car.\nPart of the game is test-driving a car. Unfortunately it is almost the same every time. Car drives the same way no matter what faults it has- you don't hear additional noises parts of the suspension are shot, there is no indication that steering is off or if there are problems with the ignition or anything else. The only diferences between cars are acceleration rates and interior design. It works like this- there are parts of the suspension that cannot be examined to see if they are broken unless you disassemble them or take the test drive. Also sometimes it is required by a client for you to test drive the car and there is no way around it. All these things make the test drive fun for one maybe two times, then it becomes more of a chore than fun. Thankfully test driving a car takes about 1-2 minutes, so unless you play for a long time it will not bother you much. Don't get me wrong- i absolutely like the idea of test driving a car. I just would expect it to be more consequential and let the player to figure out what's wrong with the car instead of giving him an answer.\nThe last thing i'm going to complain about is number car models and parts you can buy. I hope developers will add more cars and parts to the game, but now there are two different engines and i belive there are 3 types of suspension, but there are no real diferences in them beside names of the parts that were used.\nTo sum up- I played 6 hours and I think i saw all the content there is to see, but i cannot say for certain. What i saw so far was mostly good. If you like this type of game (which is essentialy a 3d puzzle game) you'll have a good time, but keep in mind before you decide if you are going to buy it- at the time of writing this, game is somewhat limited, there is no much variety when it comes to cars. Game is rather easy, but i believe there is almost no competition- if you look for similar things look for gearhead garage (a bit dated, but i think still playable).","January 29, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I hear the word simulator in a gaming context, I think of intracacy and attention to detail in design, and an attempt by the developer to make the experience as close as possible to the real thing (whatever it may be). That said, Car Simulator 2014 is definitely not a simulator. As others have said, it's more like a car mechanic themed puzzle game.\n\nThe gameplay is relatively simple: you get three different functions when interacting with the parts of several different cars (analyze, remove, and install). Parts on the vehicle are colour coded, ranging from red (bad) to green (good), with percentage values. You'll get repair orders, always with some description that will hint at the problem (e.g. "my car won't start"), and then you use the tools and the aforesaid functions to solve it. You start out with a basic garage, but eventually you progress to two better shops; the second shop comes with the ability to path test vehicles (a minigame that analyzes suspension and brakes) and, additionally, a module for chip tuning vehicles in the last. In all of the shops you have the ability to take drivable vehicles on a test drive, which is yet another way to check for damage to parts without having to tear the vehicle apart - it's not very fun, and a little clumsy, but it gets the job done.\n\nWhat I like:\n\n* There are several different models of vehicles, many with different arrangements of parts (e.g. "V6" versus four cylinder, 4x4 versus 2wd)\n\n* The visuals are nice for a game of such small scale\n\n* Some progression (spend money to make bolt removal quicker, for example)\n\n* The interface is simple and relatively intuitive: you can hide the car body and turn on a filter to show the condition of parts\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n* Realism isn't a big factor in the design of this game at all (e.g. an air filter will keep the engine from running)\n\n* The number of parts is quite limited; some front-end pieces, brakes and wheels, and stuff around the motor - you'll never see the inside of the crankcase\n\n* Customers don't pay for parts or labour; they pay a flat rate, and your profit is what's left over after you've bought the replacement parts (or repaired the limited number of repairable ones)\n\n* Despite the limited progression above, the game becomes very repetitive\n\nSummary:\n\nIf you're looking for a simple (if not simplistic) puzzle-like mechanic game, then you might get some enjoyment out of it. But, if you're looking for a proper simulation of car repair or running a shop, then you may be disappointed with the limits of Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. I was hoping for the latter, and I was disappointed by the limitations of the game, but I did enjoy tooling around with it for a few hours.","January 28, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For example, you'd never change your oil and not change the filter at the same time and if your brake discs are worn out, you would normally change the pads with them as well. Coming from a background where I work in a parts department at a local car garage, it is easy for me to spot these little details but at the same time someone who doesn't know about cars wouldn't necessarily know to do those things.\n\nDespite these minor details, it is actually a really good way to introduce someone to how a car works because it keeps things simple enough so that it is easy to understand but goes into enough detail to make it interesting to the casual audience or people who may well be just getting interested in cars. It does end up getting a little repetitive and that may put some people off and for the petrolheads out there, some different layouts for engines/mechanics would help to mix things up a bit more but ultimately, I enjoyed this.","June 3, 2014","true","30.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But it leaves a lot to be desired.  This is a review about as game that could have been much better, and instead is just a fun play if you get it cheap.\n\nThe "simulation" aspect is weak.  I am not saying that the game is bad, I am saying that I wish it was better.  For instance, a customer's car won't start:  I thought it would be a good idea to check the battery cables but alas there are none.  There are also no radiators, no fluid in the transmissions, no tire pressure, the list goes on.\n\nThe game also features repairs of an individual part; you can, apparently, repair a water pump!  I have never known a mechanic to repair something like that.  Maybe it can be done but typically they just install a new part on your car and charge you for it.  The only part-repairs I have seen are things like splicing wires or welding a busted exhaust pipe.  Simple stuff.\n\nThe pricing is crazy too.  People are spending over 10,000 USD to repair used cars.  Things like a new battery cost 350 USD even though they can typically be had for under 100 USD in real life.  Other things are odd too, spark plugs are 35 USD but again in real life they are perhaps 2-5 USD.\n\nThe game play gets tiring.  In the beginning you are using your mind to try and troubleshoot problems and find a damaged part.  As the game goes on you learn to, 1: diagnostic scan; 2: test drive; 3: path test; 4: click hide body and show part condition.  9/10 times it will show the damaged parts in red and then you just have to spend the time disassembling the vehicle.  The only time this won't show you the damaged part is if its in the transmission or if its the air filter.  Very little challenge at that point.\n\nThe 4X4 add on is a good idea but it mostly consists of unlicensed Jeep Wrangler models.  Not One Pickup, Not on Land Rover, Not One V8, Not One Lift Kit.\n\nThe 1/4 mile add on is the best part of the game.  In the beginning you have limited money to upgrade the parts and tune a car to hit a 1/4 mile time.  This too grows easy over time as the budget increases you start having enough money to simply buy ALL the performance parts for each car.  Most of the bolt-ons give ridiculous amounts of extra power.  Worst of all, there are no Cold Air Intakes in a performance shop - just crazy.  Unfortunately, while drag racing there is no shifting to be done by the player even though many of the vehicles have manual transmissions.  What a shame, its one of the main aspects of drag racing titles that you find on your mobile phone.\n\nThis could have been an incredible game - and I hope they make another one, because developers can usually build on simulations until they are truly great.  For now, its a fun game and I gladly played through the whole thing.  I think its enjoyable, but it won't give you any real world knowledge.  It might be damaging if you learned that its normal to pay 800 USD for a mechanic to install a new battery, or perhaps you think that your transmission ought not have any fluid in it.  I don't consider this any more educational than I do Need For Speed Hot Pursuit.  But its still fun - Happy Gaming.","January 2, 2015","true","19.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

That also makes it hard to know what customers actually want fixed. Eg. "Replace all damaged parts" does that mean you want everything less than 100% condition repaired or is 90+% okay?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0x80/recommended/270850/","0x80","0x80","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0x80/","107 products in account","Overall, the game felt more like a beta, or an early development concept than a fully fledged simulator. Decent in some respects, but not phenomenal. Most of the top-most "helpful" reviews have listed all the obvious deficiencies of the game. There are a few I'd like to add, along with some suggestions for what would make the game better:\n\n1.) Improve the camera behavior; feels like you have to fight the camera to focus the tiny dot reticle on an interface target. If I've tried every mouse sensitivity, and still have to adjust the mouse an average of 5 times every time I try to interact with something, there's a problem with the interface design.\n\n2.) If you must include a test track feature without much ability to control look camera or any rear-view features, add some flashing directional arrows or something to tell the driver where to go.\n\n3.) Also, if the test track is something that I just drive a car through demolition derby style, from highlight pad to highlight pad, requiring no thought from the player in actualy formulating the diagnosis, maybe it's a feature that should just be done away with entirely, or reduced to something in the game menu along the lines of "send for test drive". Since it requires me to do nothing except pilot a car in the same repetitive fashion around the same track, it just feels like a time waster or a pointless minigame. Since I'm not actually doing repairs with this feature, just basic piloting of a simplistic drive simulation, it detracts from the point of the game -- to actually repair cars.\n\n4.) If possible, add some real life makes/models to the game. This was probably the one thing I found myself most yearning for while playing, and would truly make the game engaging. To actually be able to work on, say, my own car, or some recently released model of car, or some exotics, classics, etc. would be truly amazing. If licensing or IP constraints make this feature impossible, I'm sure there are some foreign or outdated models of cars that can be reasonably cloned. Like older cars no longer in production, or made by defunct manufacturers who wouldn't sue you for copying their schematics. The point here is not simulating the actual mechanical issues of any particular model, but rather, letting players actually dismantle particular models that are interesting.\n\n5.) If trying to simulate real mechanical challenges seems too daunting, consider adding a feature for players to design their own repair missions to share with other players. Players with a lot of experience with a particular model might come up with something really clever to challenge fellow players with. Such a feture would help build a following for the game.\n\nConclusion: overall, the game philosophy seems to be shaky: why check obd if all it consists of is clicking "check obd", then watching a little bitmap image of a low res display pop up and tell me I'm checking OBD. Can we actually simulate an OBD unit somehow, like, make me look for a data port? If I'm going to take a car to a test track, can we figure out how to actually make the player responsible for diagnosing a problem? If I'm going to repair a part, is there any way that I can actually learn to repair a part, or be responsible for fumbling with a facsimily of what it takes to repair each part? Again, if it's not requiring the player to actually be a mechanic to some degree, it just feels like a time waster. What aspect of mechanic behavior is it simulating?\n\nOverall, good start on a cool idea. Not many mechanic simulators exist. I would love to see this idea develop further, because as a simulator it seems to fall short.","January 26, 2014","false","3.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I can imagine it would be hard with someone with little car maintenance knowledge to grasp the concept of "theres a problem, fix it". Once the main elements have been completed the game gets repetitive due to duplicate tasks. Different cars and different vans have no difference in the parts and/or the design of the engine or chassis so gets boring pretty easily. I thought this game would be quite interesting, and it is but the game has no feeling of progression and repeats itself very often.","February 5, 2014","false","3.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I found the controls a bit wonky and wished I could remap some of the default directional controls, but it didn't prevent me from enjoying the experience. As I've owned the game additional features have been added so I can't say whether remapping keys is an option at this time.\n\nThe graphics are very clean and sharp, allowing one to see where the various car components are in an uncluttered transparent skeleton model. I know looking under the hood of my car certainly doesn't look remotely like this game. Where's the boundless layers of grease, rust and leaves. Why do I have leaves under my hood?\n\nThere are a few good songs that play in the game, one of which has a heavy riff guitar that I enjoy the most. The songs are basically just background music now that I've turned the volume down some. The variety of songs is varied enough to keep things from getting too stale.\n\nI would agree with some other reviews that there is certainly some repetition to the repairs, but that's exactly why I got the game. I wanted to learn about car parts and where they are on the vehicles. So this is probably not a sim well suited for the mid to high level car tinkerers out there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whiteydm/recommended/270850/","whiteydm","Whitey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whiteydm/","229 products in account","I'm yes and no on my recommendation for this game. This is the groundwork for a game I'd love. Kind of a long reading following but this'll give anyone looking into game an exact idea of what they're jumping in to. This game is a nice buy for car/mechanical enthusiasts. This game would be best set up for someone who is just getting into cars, but isn't very familiar with their mechanicals. You could learn how basic parts go together and what some of their effects may be. However, to advance through this game at a decent pace you need a little prior mechanical knowledge. For example, you may be told that you need to find a power issue and not know that the fuel pump or fuel filter could be the problem.\n\nThe problem with this game though, is that no matter whether you're a mechanic yourself or someone learning, The game will have become mind-numbingly monotonous about 3/4 of the way through. At this point you'll have seen all the vehicles, driven them, taken care of every problem, and you'll be running on repeated problems so you can buy all the Learning Book upgrades. All the concepts are presented less than halfway through the game, then the later garages simply allow you to diagnose parts faster. At the time of writing this I quit the campaign about 6/7 of the way through out of sheer boredom.\n\nIf you've ever played the 1989 Street Rod DOS/Commodore 64 game, then you've played this game. Infact, in the first garage, the game can be seen lying on one of the shelves as a neat little reference. I would recommend searching around for Street Rod, since it's a nice little game to play. The only problem is that this game only has slightly more detail than Street Rod did 25 years ago.\n\nIn Street Rod, you changed wheels and clicked the bolts much like you do here. You changed out engines, removed heads, carburetors, and upgraded your car in general. After upgrading, you'd go do a basic NES-era street race to earn other cars or money and continue until you beat the fastest racer in town.\n\nIn Car Mechanic Simulator, I'd say you have a little more variety of detail but not where most would enjoy. Put graphical detail of 3D models aside. When it comes down to it, you're changing air intakes, timing chain/belts, suspension parts, gearbox parts rarely, and the exhaust. You will never touch the engine block, the sub-frames, or any body work (on that note, the feature list specifically states that you will do body work). These parts are off-limits and can't be removed. You will never be able to customize any setup; it's Part-On, Part-Off, and what condition the part is in.\n\nThe car models themselves are nicely detailed, but are static and feel a bit bland with the way they are rendered. The cars are modeled after real-life cars, but use slightly different design and names. Most of them will be European/Japanese economy cars or small vans/SUVs. The 2010+ Mustang replica is the most distinguished car, but oddly one of the SUVs seem to the fastest car you can test drive.\n\nAs parts wear, they begin to show slight signs of rust, which is a nice detail. That said, parts are fixed. There's two engine designs: I4 and V6. The two engines are the same in each iteration, and the V6 will sometimes have a RWD dif or 4WD dif with an additional driveshaft. Also, both engines are always transversely mounted, which is a bit odd considering most V6s in this game are RWD rather than FWD.\n\nGameplay wise, there are a few minor annoyances. While part selection in general is nice, there are times when you'll find yourself clicking to a part 5+ times because of the cursor trying to select a part that's behind the one you want to click. Certain parts, while obviously accessible from your current position (under the car, left side wheel well, etc), can't be touched unless you exit the current area, walk around, access the "proper" area, and then remove the part. Often, the camera will zoom or align to an impossible angle to remove the bolts you just selected, so you'll have to fiddle around and zoom out to remove the part. Occasionally, the bolt removal will glitch and you'll have to move the camera to be able to click the bolt again. You'll find yourself constantly moving between nearby areas and lifting the car up and down repeatedly to reach nearby parts. One of the bigger annoyances was the removal of air filters and exhaust parts.  To remove the air filter, you have to remove the plastic engine cover, the tube, the MAF sensor, the cover, and finally the filter (VS just taking the cover off in real life). God forbid you have to remove the exhaust manifold or the catalytic converter. You will have to start at the back of the car, removing every section of exhaust until you reach the desired part. In real life, you'd either drop the whole assembly or simply remove the problem section by itself. These little things, while not that big a deal by themselves, can become annoying after a short amount of time.\n\nAlso, never buy used parts. Just don't. Often the game requires the replaced parts be of a very high condition and often the random part will be in the green and still not be accepted as a replacement. In regards to replacement parts, often you are not told what the complete requirement of repair is. While not knowing a problem is true to real mechanic shops, some work orders (goals to complete a repair) simply don't give you the full goals. One example in an early mission is how you're given a work order to "Do an basic examination of my engine." Do a full examination, and the requirement isn't fulfilled. Turns out you have to just replace broken parts even if the service is not requested. This causes confusion, as early on in the game, you're given specifics that ask for examination but not service. Perhaps the work orders need to be re-written.\n\nFinally, a small personal gripe of my own. The game feels like a hospital bedroom. Everything feels stark and bland. Everything on the cars are perfect save for part discoloration. There's no character to any of the vehicles or the locales (save for the first garage itself). Perhaps if there was unique body damage, difference between cars (other than color), or visual dirt/grime and broken part models it would feel a bit more lively.\n\nOver all though, this is a fun game for the auto enthusiast for a few hours. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes cars and wants to learn the basic setup of car mechanicals. I feel at the current time it's more of a $10 game rather than $20. I'll have to see how the game evolves with updates, but as the core game is now I'm going to let the last of the campaign sit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrominance/recommended/270850/","chrominance","chrominance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrominance/","1147 products in account","This is the real deal. I mean, not literally the real deal, Car Mechanic Simulator won't leave you covered in grease or anything. Like most sims, the fundamentals of CMS are simplified--you don't, for example, have to worry about things like re-tightening the bolts on a wheel in a star pattern, and you don't have to think about what kind of oil the car takes, you just empty it and refill as needed. But the basic idea is there: figure out what's wrong with the car, identify the parts to fix or replace, and bolt the new parts into place. Simple! Or maybe not.\n\nThe first few tasks are very simple, but as the game goes on you'll run into more difficult or more vague problems. Sometimes, this isn't so great--a few of the orders, for example, want you to restore a part of the vehicle to tip-top shape, not mentioning that all parts must be green (hey, the car still drives with yellow or orange parts, and some cars come in so beat up that every part is orange, so clearly the game doesn't expect me to replace every non-green part, right?). But most of the time, the challenge is fair. Why does the engine cut out occasionally? What's causing that odd sound at low RPMs? If you don't already know the possible answers, you will soon.\n\nThere's still more the devs can do to make this an awesome game--the garage management aspects aren't very interesting, and sometimes you'll get a request describing odd behavior with the car only to find the test drive doesn't show any of these aspects (it's not supposed to, it turns out). But this is a surprisingly absorbing sim. Definitely recommended if you like the idea of tinkering with car engines without having to get your hands dirty.","September 1, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If this is based on real life car maintenance, it is a great way for a guy such as myself to learn the fundamentals of maintaining my own car just in case. I am a big fan of simulators generally speaking and this is one simulator that I have never seen before. The graphics fidelity is good but not great, then again it is focused on car maintenance and not really a racing simulator where every visual has to be perfectly crisp. As a person who never touched a car bolt, it is quite fun to learn the quickest way to get to a part and replace it. Took me quite a bit of time to realise how easy it was to get the engine start part out.\n\nHowever the down side to this game which I noticed, taking a car for a test drive for assessment is completely useless. Reason being that you won't be able to know what is wrong with a car just from a test drive or at least you don't receive a test drive results.\n\nI have done a test drive before I repaired a faulty muffler, to see how loud the car goes. Did the repair and tested it again, there is no difference in engine sound. Customer said the the car is too loud because of the muffler isn't doing its job. But you can't really tell because there is no such thing.\n\nSecondly, Suppose as a mechanic you want to save some money by buying used car parts in very good condition to use for repairs. Sorry to ruin the fun for you, you can't do that. This is because A) in-game used car parts shop does not show if a particular part is in good condition or bad.. Maybe a percentage scale??? and B) Even if you are lucky to snag a gearbox which scores 80% out of a 100% with a really good price tag, you replace the old damaged gearbox and Job done? No, the game does not allow you to do that and you wont be able to progress to the next job.\n\nI hope this review reaches the game dev team to make it better in future updates.\n\nWill I recommend this game to friends or simulator enthusaists? Answer is yes, despite those little quirks in the game but I do agree I personally found it fun to play and this is just starting out, did not reach the point where I do complex jobs and tweaking engine power using power commander etc.","February 4, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Removing certain parts around it to find the problem.\n\nAlthough the test drive phsyics and mouse movement are something to be questioned and get used to, it is in all a simple yet enjoyable simulator which addresses an area of the game market which is very much neglected.\n\nGraphics (especially for game type) 9/10\nGame Concept 8/10\nPlayability (so far) 7/10\nUnderstanding (straightfoward) 8/10\n\nOverall 8/10\n\n*Would highly recommend if you thoughly enjoy unscrewing blots*","February 25, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You're presented with various customers' auto problems that range from the very specific "I hit a giant pothole and destroyed my left side suspension" to the very vague "my car makes a rattling sound on startup." You can visually inspect various areas of the car, or go on a test drive, or use an OBD scanner and later in the game you get access to a suspension and brake tester. You have the choice of buying new parts or buying used parts of dubious quality from the junkyard to make the repairs with. My favorite part of this game is that it lets you keep all the messed up parts in your inventory. Pretty soon you'll have a nice collection of busted water pumps, torn up clutch wheels and a mountain of worn out shocks and springs. The game gives you an option to sell these (presumably to the same junkyard you buy stuff from), or you can be a completely unethical thief and slap the busted parts on a later customer's car, taking their good parts for another customer. See, the game has certain milestones you have to do in order to pass a scenario, like "replace oil and air filter." It doesn't care if the rest of the components of the car go down in quality, as long as the parts the scenario cares about get fixed. So sure, I replaced Mr. Smith's dead battery, just like the game wanted me to, but unbeknownst to him, I also swapped out his perfectly good gearbox and ignition system with almost broken ones from Mr. Johnson who was my previous customer. In the scenario where I had to fix the guy's left side suspension, I simply flipped the parts from his good right side onto his left side, then sent him on his way. If this game has taught me anything, it's not about learning how to fix cars, rather it is to WATCH YOUR MECHANIC LIKE A HAWK in real life. I think I spend more time essentially screwing over each one of my customers than I do actually repairing their vehicles. Remember that junkyard? I regularly buy crap from them and swap it into my customers' cars, just so I can have a good copy of a part when I need it, without having to pay full price for a good one.","June 28, 2014","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're presented with various customers' auto problems that range from the very specific "I hit a giant pothole and destroyed my left side suspension" to the very vague "my car makes a rattling sound on startup." You can visually inspect various areas of the car, or go on a test drive, or use an OBD scanner and later in the game you get access to a suspension and brake tester. You have the choice of buying new parts or buying used parts of dubious quality from the junkyard to make the repairs with. My favorite part of this game is that it lets you keep all the messed up parts in your inventory. Pretty soon you'll have a nice collection of busted water pumps, torn up clutch wheels and a mountain of worn out shocks and springs. The game gives you an option to sell these (presumably to the same junkyard you buy stuff from), or you can be a completely unethical thief and slap the busted parts on a later customer's car, taking their good parts for another customer. See, the game has certain milestones you have to do in order to pass a scenario, like "replace oil and air filter." It doesn't care if the rest of the components of the car go down in quality, as long as the parts the scenario cares about get fixed. So sure, I replaced Mr. Smith's dead battery, just like the game wanted me to, but unbeknownst to him, I also swapped out his perfectly good gearbox and ignition system with almost broken ones from Mr. Johnson who was my previous customer. In the scenario where I had to fix the guy's left side suspension, I simply flipped the parts from his good right side onto his left side, then sent him on his way. If this game has taught me anything, it's not about learning how to fix cars, rather it is to WATCH YOUR MECHANIC LIKE A HAWK in real life. I think I spend more time essentially screwing over each one of my customers than I do actually repairing their vehicles. Remember that junkyard? I regularly buy crap from them and swap it into my customers' cars, just so I can have a good copy of a part when I need it, without having to pay full price for a good one.","June 28, 2014","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If this is based on real life car maintenance, it is a great way for a guy such as myself to learn the fundamentals of maintaining my own car just in case. I am a big fan of simulators generally speaking and this is one simulator that I have never seen before. The graphics fidelity is good but not great, then again it is focused on car maintenance and not really a racing simulator where every visual has to be perfectly crisp. As a person who never touched a car bolt, it is quite fun to learn the quickest way to get to a part and replace it. Took me quite a bit of time to realise how easy it was to get the engine start part out.\n\nHowever the down side to this game which I noticed, taking a car for a test drive for assessment is completely useless. Reason being that you won't be able to know what is wrong with a car just from a test drive or at least you don't receive a test drive results.\n\nI have done a test drive before I repaired a faulty muffler, to see how loud the car goes. Did the repair and tested it again, there is no difference in engine sound. Customer said the the car is too loud because of the muffler isn't doing its job. But you can't really tell because there is no such thing.\n\nSecondly, Suppose as a mechanic you want to save some money by buying used car parts in very good condition to use for repairs. Sorry to ruin the fun for you, you can't do that. This is because A) in-game used car parts shop does not show if a particular part is in good condition or bad.. Maybe a percentage scale??? and B) Even if you are lucky to snag a gearbox which scores 80% out of a 100% with a really good price tag, you replace the old damaged gearbox and Job done? No, the game does not allow you to do that and you wont be able to progress to the next job.\n\nI hope this review reaches the game dev team to make it better in future updates.\n\nWill I recommend this game to friends or simulator enthusaists? Answer is yes, despite those little quirks in the game but I do agree I personally found it fun to play and this is just starting out, did not reach the point where I do complex jobs and tweaking engine power using power commander etc.","February 4, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The majority of the jobs (tasks) require you to solve some mechanical or other problem to complete the job, which becomes harder and more complex as you advance. But the whole car experience is presented well enough, even for people without the know how of the inner workings of a car, e.g. its engine, electrics, suspension etc to be able to grasp and visualise each aspect quite clearly from earlier on. No need for a manual either, as the examine tool is enough to help you identify the majority of the problems in earlier jobs. The knowledge can then be used later on in the game to solve more complex (or vague) faults having learned by now where to look (if only it was that easy in real life!).\n\nThe release of Car Mechanic 2015 has improved almost every aspect of the 2014 one but hasn't reduced it's worth. Mostly the improvements are over small niggles which we were used to anyways, such as lack of achievements, multiple jobs, the annoying auto zoom in/out of the examined part, inventory sort, lack of keybinds, cursor slip in window mode, etc etc Also the 2 addons included in the "Complete Edition", the "4x4" and the "1/4 mile" add little value overall and should have been included in the main game, as they are just distractions overall.\n\nI would recommend Car Mechanic Simulator Complete Edition to anyone that likes puzzle games as almost all the jobs given require you to investigate an existing car fault(s) and fix them as cheap as possible. Also would recommend to anyone that wants to learn about the anatomy of a car as a learning tool, as it does demonstrate quite accurately some of the main aspects of a car, which otherwise would need to spend a long time in a garage to visualise.\n\nAnd with the 75%-80% off sale this week from steam, makes this a worthy addition to everyones' library.","May 14","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The majority of the jobs (tasks) require you to solve some mechanical or other problem to complete the job, which becomes harder and more complex as you advance. But the whole car experience is presented well enough, even for people without the know how of the inner workings of a car, e.g. its engine, electrics, suspension etc to be able to grasp and visualise each aspect quite clearly from earlier on. No need for a manual either, as the examine tool is enough to help you identify the majority of the problems in earlier jobs. The knowledge can then be used later on in the game to solve more complex (or vague) faults having learned by now where to look (if only it was that easy in real life!).\n\nThe release of Car Mechanic 2015 has improved almost every aspect of the 2014 one but hasn't reduced it's worth. Mostly the improvements are over small niggles which we were used to anyways, such as lack of achievements, multiple jobs, the annoying auto zoom in/out of the examined part, inventory sort, lack of keybinds, cursor slip in window mode, etc etc Also the 2 addons included in the "Complete Edition", the "4x4" and the "1/4 mile" add little value overall and should have been included in the main game, as they are just distractions overall.\n\nI would recommend Car Mechanic Simulator Complete Edition to anyone that likes puzzle games as almost all the jobs given require you to investigate an existing car fault(s) and fix them as cheap as possible. Also would recommend to anyone that wants to learn about the anatomy of a car as a learning tool, as it does demonstrate quite accurately some of the main aspects of a car, which otherwise would need to spend a long time in a garage to visualise.\n\nAnd with the 75%-80% off sale this week from steam, makes this a worthy addition to everyones' library.","May 14","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The most simplest job in the game is changeing brake pads on a disc brake system. In the game all you do is... 1. take the wheel off 2. take the caliper off 3. remove the pads from the brake rotor 4. Replace the old pads with new pads 5. Reinstall the Caliper 6. Put the wheel back on. In real life this is the basics, but so far from the actual thing, its great for the casual gamer who dosen't know anything about cars, but when you do this stuff for a living its somewhat silly and mundane. If your wondering how many steps their actually is to replace the brake pads in real life... 1. Break all lugs on wheels 2. Jack car up 3. Remove all wheels 4. Disconnect all brake lines from calipers and allow time to bleed off. 5.  Remove calipers 6. Remove brake pads from Caliper 7. Compress cylinder within Caliper to allow new Pads to fit 8. Install new pads to fit 9. Reinstall all Calipers with Pads 10. Not a bad idea to check the rotors as well, Replace if worn or galded 11. Reconnect brake lines to all Calipers 12. In respect to the posistion of the Master Cylinder start from the farthest corner and work inwards bleeding the calipers to fit, make sure no air is in the lines. 13. When bleeding your Brake system pump your brake pedal and depress on the third pump, while another person cracks the bleeder on the caliper, repeat until clear fluid is coming out. 14. Frequently check the Master Cylinder to ensure it is not empty when you are bleeding the brake system. 15. If everything checks out, put your wheels back on and torque them to their respective torque rateing.  But in all honesty, if the game did this i would be impressed, and probably not want to play, that sounds like a lot of work. There are also some things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, like stupid ♥♥♥♥ that your best position to remove a starter is from the top of the engine compartment, and rubber bushings just slide out, and even the fact that everything you do is by hand with a wrench. Not going to lie, i like this game, i suggest you buy it if you wanna get some general car knowledge, but this thing is far from a simulator.","January 28, 2014","true","6.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

As the blurb says you run a car workshop, carrying out orders to test or repair customers cars.\n\nUnfortunately, even if you over look the base graphics and the eyestrain inducing distance blur (it renders a workshop and despite this small space it blurs walls and details out when you walk too far away) the meat and potatoes of the game is sadly lacking.\n\nFrom a mechanically point of view the game is very basic, almost child like in the way the disassembly and assembly of the car and components occur. It's very much by the numbers and sometimes incorrect (good luck installing a helical spring into the car before the shock assembly) or removing a wheel without jacking the car up or using the car lift or even removing wheel nuts in the correct manner or any sort of torquing.\n\nFrom running the workshop point of view the business side of it is sadly lacking, I repaired a starter and charged the customer $100. Repairing the starter cost $92, so I made $8 on that job not including my time, any consumables, taxes or running of the workshop itself.\n\nThe UI is terrible, the camera controls frustrating and the restrictions on how you can inspect components irritating.

There's some variation, but it's mostly- Find red parts (Sometimes through a test drive), replace, next mission. It would be fine if there was some sort of way to move through the game other than buying books for faster screwing.\nAnother problem was the interface. I was hoping more of a simulation, but that wasn't there. Instead of a visual damage (Which would be nice in a Simulator) the part is just regular, yellow, orange or red colored, which is headache inducing at times. Also, while I was hoping for a mechanic's view, it's just a camera with wierd controls. This makes taking out bolts and small parts very repetitive and boring.\nOverall, I can't really reccomend this game, as it lacks both the gameplay elements of a game, and the realism of a Simulator.","July 8, 2014","false","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's not a true simulator, but it's more of a puzzle game. In the early part of the game, you are already given the areas that need to be fixed, and it's more like unbolting parts, fixing them, and rebolting them and finishing the mission. You are given several basic situations of what to fix in a given situation. Later on though, like a real mechanic, the customer will only give a general situation, and it's your job to figure it out. Pretty much anything that is red, you have to fix.\n\nI think the only negative is probably the variety of parts to fix. All cars have (more or less) the same parts, like the engines all look the same. Things like supercars with turbos aren't in the game, as are aftermarket parts.

It's not a true simulator, but it's more of a puzzle game. In the early part of the game, you are already given the areas that need to be fixed, and it's more like unbolting parts, fixing them, and rebolting them and finishing the mission. You are given several basic situations of what to fix in a given situation. Later on though, like a real mechanic, the customer will only give a general situation, and it's your job to figure it out. Pretty much anything that is red, you have to fix.\n\nI think the only negative is probably the variety of parts to fix. All cars have (more or less) the same parts, like the engines all look the same. Things like supercars with turbos aren't in the game, as are aftermarket parts. Everything is a FWD car.\n\nIf you like puzzles and you like fixing cars, this is a good game for you","April 18, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WildKarrde/recommended/270850/","WildKarrde","WildKarrde","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WildKarrde/","794 products in account","So, two things up front, then I'll get into the review.\n\nFirst up, this entire review can also be read on Youtube, with almost 19 minutes of gameplay that covers a lot of the features in the game.\nhttp://youtu.be/Nj82Zw_eABk\n\nSecond... I wish there was "Maybe" button for recommending the game. That's the one I would choose, and the review will explain why.\n\nOk, so I'm a huge fan of Gearhead Garage. I've been waiting and hoping for a new version of it for at least 12 years now, but obviously at this point it's not gonna happen. When I first learned about this game a few weeks ago, I was estatic! My hopes were high, and when it released today I only lasted a couple hours before I bought it. Now I'm here to tell you how I feel about it.\n\nOn the surface, it does seem very similar to Gearhead Garage. You get jobs, in which ou need to take parts off cars, and put new parts on cars. Not real cars, but make-believe cars that loosely resemble real cars. For those of you that don't remember, Gearhead Garage didn't originally have real cars either, the only real cars in the game were third party unofficial modifications. So far, looking good.\n\nPersonally, my favorite part of Gearhead Garage (other than 3rd party mods) was the ability to buy crappy cars at auction, fix them up and resell them at auction. After 25 or so missions, I haven't seen anything like that in Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. It's just been mission after mission after mission. The only thing I see to spend your har earned money on is mediocre upgrates to make you 5% more money on jobs, make bolts loosen 5% faster, or other trivial upgrades. In other words, there really isn't much of a reason to make money in Car Mechanic Simulator 2014.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, the game is somewhat entertaining. It's not extremely educational, if you know virtually nothing about cars it will give you a basic idea of where car parts are, what parts are named, and a very basic understanding of car diagnostics, if you pay attention. But a lot of aspects of the game aren't very obvious. I've changed the oil on more cars than I can count, but it took way longer than it should have to find the oil drain plug in this game, and once I did it looked NOTHING like an oil drain plug looks like in any real car I've changed the oil on. I also didn't find out there was an oil draining pan until I read about it on this forum. This is good, and bad, a double edged sword. The game does not hold your hand through the car repair process... it gives you the opportunity to figure things out on your own. Still though, it would be nice if something had told me I could click on the oil catch pan, instead of wasing $100 on every oil change for a clean up fee.\n\nAlso, the test driving physics are laughable. They made Grand Theft Auto feel like Gran Turismo. It's a nice touch... but don't expect any of the cars to handle even remotely realistic. It's a gimmick, at best. A cheap way to see the quality of some of the parts on the car. Not entirely useless... just not well executed. But what can you except from a game that released for $15?\n\nOverall... the game is decent. It's the best car mechanic game since Gearhead Garage... but it's not more fun than Gearhead Garage... not even AS fun as Gearhead Garage was, IMHO. The graphics are ok. The part location accuracy is decent. The gameplay mechanics are not bad. It's a combination of point and click searching, along with some puzzle solving. Once you start figuring things out, you can build a decent strategy to solve most car problems. The game still throws you for a loop though. Sometimes because it's a genuinely good puzzle. Sometimes because the game should have let you know where to go to find an option.\n\nI want to fully endorse the game... but I'm having a hard time doing that. For $15... I guess it's ok. If I knew what I know now, I'd wait for it to go on sale at $5, but I had to find out for myself. I'm not strongly disappointed with my purchase... just a little. I'm still hoping the game will get better with mods, expansion packs or maybe after a few more missions... but I'm not holding my breath either. If you loved Gearhead Garage... you might like this game. But personally... this game has mostly just whetted my appetite to try to get Gearhead Garage running on my PC again. Other than that, I think it'll be a decent diversion when I want a game to just burn time with. The mechanics of the game are ok, if you haven't played Gearhead Garage then I think you might find it a refreshing turn of pace from the average lot of games on the market today. If you did play Gearhead Garage, and loved it like I did, then I think you'll appreciate this game, but find it mildly disappointing... as I did.","January 26, 2014","true","6.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

And I do mean it. If you, like me, were seeking for challenges and in-depth content, then maybe this game is not for you. Here's why:\n\n1. It's too easy and repetitive.\nThe first assignments will feel fresh and may be fairly challenging if you haven't had any experiences with car maintenance. After a while however, 2 hours in my case, the game gets boring. Problem searches become extremely easy as bad components will be very obvious to spot. This is also due to how the cars are built; every single car has almost everything put in the exact same place. Even GM couldn't pull that off.\n\n2. It's way too simple.\nThere are no rusty nuts and bolts, anything can be taken out with a simple wrench, because, what are ratchets? You never have to appy oil, silicone grease and whatsoever. Basic car programming tasks are completely absent. There are also no customers that would pressure you, make work difficult, etc. (conversations would be nice). The only thing that requires you to actually do more than pressing LMB and RMB are freaking oil changes, but even those get repetitive after a while.\n\n3. Not enough content.\nAnother problem of CMS is the little depth of content. You never have to pay for garage bills, every car has unlimited supplies of headlight fluids, the wrenching upgrades do not offer enough and, like I said before, no angry customers and competition. The biggest problem for me however is the lack of variety in cars; You can't find a diesel car, truck and anything that doesn't have its engine up front. So, if you ever wanted to do some car projects that would make you insane in real-life such as an V8 Audi or even Kim Jong-il's Merc 600, look away.\n\nVerdict: CMS is alright for anyone that wants to get a very general understanding of car maintenance. But then, you will have to shell out 6 or 12€ for a so-called simulator that makes car maintenance and engineering look as simple as a Volkswagen Beetle engine. There are thousands of literature and internet sites with more depth that are dedicated to these topics. Most of them don't even cost you a penny. If only the game offered much much more in terms of entertainment value, I wouldn't mind recommending it.","December 31, 2014","false","3.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Kept me occupied for a while but is a limited experience with less replay value compared to the old Gearhead Garage game that I remember fondly.\n\nThe entire game suffers due to long load screens between the garage and different test areas\n\nThe main negativity comes with the two expansions.\n\nThe offroad expansion adds little apart from some new vehicles and a tweaked test track, while being littered with multiple spelling errors and occasional broken orders. Order 13 broke for me and seems to be an ongoing unfixed problem for some on forums.\n\nThe 1/4 Mile expansion becomes repetitive extremely fast. The early orders I played simply set a time to beat and I just buy and fit enough tuning parts to beat said time. I quickly lost interest and stopped playing this mode. There are two big problems apart from the repetetiveness  with this expansion for me:\n\n1. Due to hitting the drag strip after each upgrade I spent most of my time staring at the load screen (seems to take nearly as long as the drag test itself).\n\n2. The learning book upgrades unlocked in the career mode are not implemented in the 1/4 mile version so despite being in the endgame garage, changing parts takes a long time as though I'm back at level one. The skills should carry across from the completed career mode in my opinion.\n\nOverall, worth picking up on sale to play through the career mode and then move on, maybe dabbling with endless mode if you get the itch to play some more. Forget about playing the expansions in their current form because they add little, while having drawbacks and bugs. I cannot recommend buying this at standard retail price.","November 13, 2014","false","19.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You start off in what looks like your garage and then move on to bigger places as you get more money and more customers.\n\nGameplay\nIt handles nicely, sometimes the controls can be a bit bulky. You get a car, the customer tells you what is broken or what he thinks is broken and then you fix it. The way you do that is by examining parts and determining which ones need replacing or servicing. You can do all kinds of tests to see how the suspension is, how the engine is, how the tyres are and so on. You can change just about any part of the car and engine.\n\nYou can even drive the cars on a closed course to check brakes and stuff, but the handling is really poor, almost farm simluator poor. And even though let's say the brakes are almost non existent when you checked, it brakes fine on the driving course, same with traction and speed, it's always the same no matter how broken the car is.\n\nYou can magically reach into the car after removing some parts that are in the way, so you can after removing a lot of stuff for example change the flywheel or gearbox even. You would think that it will get repetitive after a while but as you progress further into the game you are completely on your own in trying to find what the problem is, you might only know that "when I accelerate there is a clunking sound from the eninge" or something. You can also tune cars and try to make them go faster on a dragstrip, I have not fully understood how to do this, I don't really have the know how on how to make a car faster, but not too fast.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are really nice, way better than I expected. The cars are well modeled, so are all the parts. One thing that bugs me is that the cars look way too nice for some customers, there was one guy who had just bought a car for like 200€ and it wouldn't start, but it still looked really new out of the factory and recently waxed, you would expect it to be old and dirty.\n\nSound\nThere is a radio which you can turn on and off for music, no real masterpiece music, just some generic simulator music, still good to listen too while working on cars. The sound the tools and engines make seem pretty realistic.\n\nPrize/Rating\nIf you are a fan of simulators and you are interested in how cars work this is the game for you. It's almost like a puzzle solving game once you progress a bit into it aswell, so if you are into that I would also recommend it.\n\nIt is correctly prized, almost a bit too cheap even.","August 17, 2015","true","9.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

For example, to remove the starter you have to take it looking in from the hood, behind the motor. No way you would do that in real life when it's accessible from below and no way you'll get your face, hand and a tool down there from above. Second, to remove the power steering you'll have to remove BOTH Tie Rods from both sides, which also makes no sense.

Ultimately...this is more or less a "diagnostic simulator" more than a car mechanic simulator.,,knowledge of a parts' function will prove invaluable!\n\nAnother thing to note, the english translation is (though mostly understandable) a smidge sloppy......so occasionally you'll get a problem to diagnose that can be a little....misleading, if you will...nothing too bad though.\n\nThe graphics, I have to say, is definitely one of it's strong points.....honestly one of the best looking simulators I've seen as of late. I must also note the soundtrack.....though it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I find it pretty enjoyable, and it's long enough to where I didn't seem to find it too repetitive, even after 5 hours straight of playing.....and if you're wondering, it's primarily DnB and Dubstep.\n\nOverall, if you're a car guy or gal, and you at least somewhat know your way around an engine and drivetrain...this might prove pretty enjoyable.\nIf chilling out in your garage wrenching on your car for an evening is something that you'd willingly do...this might prove pretty enjoyable.\nIf you're looking for a software that will turn you into a legitimate mechanic,,,you should probably look elsewhere.\nIf you're someone like a very special lady of mine, who is totally loveable and extraordinarily smart in certain aspects of life but couldn't identify a starter from an alternator.....you should probably look elsewhere, lol","January 25, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have learned alot about cars, was up till 6am playing.\n\nEDIT: After reading the other reviews I just had to stand up and defend this game. Let me start by saying that I know almost NOTHING about cars. The learning curve is not that steep. The missions slowly step you up to higher levels of knowledge. I only "almost" got stuck once. Now they added a resart mission button though. There IS 4X4 and V6. Now I want it to be MORE complex. I have learned alot. After a repair sometimes I wikipedia the parts I replaced and as a result my knowledge has gone up.\n\n\nTo sum it up, yes this game has flaws, and the comments from the makers have bad grammer, but at $15 you really cant lose if you are interested in cars. If you went to the movies you'd spend the same amount and that experience only lasts 2 hours at most.\n\n"Skip the Big Mac and buy the game"","January 25, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You will receive orders from the costumers and you will have to find the problem by investigating and/or disassembling the car, then fix it..\nAt start you can only do a little test run with the car (other than disassembling it piece after piece), then you will unlock the diagnostic center and the chiptuning.\nThe structure of the mechanical parts is a good compromise between detailed and "Let's not freak out who doesn't do this job", the only flaw: Almost nothing change between different cars model.\n\nGame engine:\nDo not expect too much from that, it's not made to amaze you. It has a simple graphic, you will never see your character, when driving a car it feels really "arcade". Music and sound are minimal as well.\n\nConclusion:\nEven if it's a little repetitive and I hated the quarter mile addon (the 2 DLC are included in the steam version) I suggest you to buy it even if you are slightly interested in the subject.\nIt's well done without being too demanding and it's quite cheap (even better when discounted)\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nPremessa: Non guardate le mie ore di gioco, lo avevo come DRM free e ho importato i salvataggi.\n\nCar Mechanical Simulator 2014 è uno dei pochi titoli nella giungla dei Simulator che esce a testa alta senza sembrare un brutto programma creato solo per intortare i fessacchiotti.\n\nGameplay:\nVoi siete un meccanico e nella modalità storia inizierete in una modesta officina. Riceverete vari ordini dai clienti e smontando e/o investigando dovrete trovare la fonte del problema e ripararla.\nAll'inizio potrete fare solo un test a parco chiuso della macchina (oltre al controllarla smontando pezzo per pezzo), poi man mano che andrete avanti sbloccherete il test diagnostico in officina e il chiptuning.\nLa struttura delle parti meccaniche è un buon compromesso tra dettagliato e "non spaventiamo chi non ne sa nulla", unico neo: Non cambia quasi nulla tra i vari modelli di auto.\n\nParte tecnica:\nQui non aspettatevi molto, non è fatto per stupire. Ha una grafica semplice, non vedrete il vostro personaggio, il movimento delle macchine è molto "arcade". La musica e il sonoro sono anch'essi minimali.\n\nConclusione:\nNonostante sia un po' ripetitivo e pur avendo odiato l'addon del quarto di miglio (i 2 DLC sono compresi nella versione steam) vi consiglio di prenderlo se siete anche solo un minimo interessati alla tematica.\nE' fatto bene senza risultare pesante ed è anche abbastanza longevo, inoltre non costa molto (ancora meglio se lo trovate in sconto)","August 6, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I’ve played a good 17 plus hours so far. For less than $4, I got my money’s worth. At full price however, I don’t think it’s really worth it.\n\nFor one, it is very unrealistic. You can’t rebuild an engine in this game or even replace one.\n\nThey have a used car part option to save money, but it is completely useless. Often times, I buy a part from here only to either sell it back because it is damaged/broken or the game wants you to buy a brand new one instead; but you don’t find that out until you reassemble the car back together only to see that the checkmark box on the paper is still unchecked. Only a very few times it was necessary but that was far in between and you waste a lot of time (trial and error) in doing so.\n\nThere is a progressive system but it’s pretty basic. There are only four things to level up: your tools (to unbolt things quicker), business management (to increase money after each fix), better mechanic (at the start, a few parts will already be checked for you), and price discount on parts (new parts costs less with each level up). Each category can be leveled up ten times and then it maxes out.\n\nThere is a bank loan option but I have never used it. I never needed to borrow money during my time of play. All I did was found the part that needed repair; repaired it or bought a new one and replaced it and pretty much did the minimal until the checkmark box was checked. I didn’t go the extra mile and replaced parts that were in yellow or in orange because that would be wasting time/money.\n\nOverall, the game is repetitive and does get boring after a while. The game starts you off with some easy fixes then it gradually progresses into harder or multiple fixes. Sometimes, the problem is given to you very broadly like “the engine won’t start, find the problem.” Other times it is given to straight forward, “change my oil.” You get three things that help you test most of the parts like the suspension, brakes, starter, alternator, etc. There are four colors that each part will display to determine its wear: green, yellow, orange, and red. Green means the part is new or in excellent condition. Yellow means it is okay. Orange means it is about to go out (does not mean you need to replace it though). Red means it’s worn out or broken and needs to be replaced. All you have to do, to be successful in this game, is replace the red parts and ignore the rest. Viola! I’ve had four garage upgrades (they upgrade by themselves after doing a number of fixes for each garage). I’ve maxed out all my upgrades (level 10 in each category). If I had to give this game a grade it would be a B-. It’s okay, but it could be a lot better.\n","December 26, 2014","true","19.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First starting it was a little clunky, getting the camera angles down, (I turned off the music, too. Just not my style), but very addictive once I got a work flow going. The bad, There isn't a lot of variety of vehicles or parts yet, the money model is not realistlc, and moding is not yet available. I really liked the 1/4 mile add-on, but it needs a lot more part options. A mod community, I'm sure, could cure a lot of these issues, if they add the modding ability later to the game. The good, easy controls and parts ordering. Not overly complicated feel. Overall, it is a realy fun game, and I think it has the most potential to end up one of the great game series, in future realeases.

By slowing it down I was able to begin t enjoy this game it IS a modern update of Gearhead Garage but without the ability to buy cars to fix up and sell. You start out in this great one car greasy little garage that fits like old jeans, and after doing innumerable repair jobs you transition to this beautiful spotless three car garage whose floor you could lick. No warning no congratulations, just boom, you're there. I find the game terribly lacking in direction or helping anyone who doesn't know much about cars. You're on your own pal. No tips, suggestions, arrows, manuals you can check, nothing I found. I also wish it offered more advanced repairs like total engine repairs not just sub-assemblies. The game is a good start but needs a lot of improvement. More variety of cars and parts, American cars, hints and tips. It's a good time for $10 but mybe the future holds improvements.

But I'll just say I can tell whoever designed the vehicles has never touched a wrench, and decided against having someone who is a Mechanic or at least mechanicly inclined to assist in even naming parts, yet alone on how some parts come off the vehicle. I have to remove the rear differential to remove the drive shaft? Uh, no. And 90% of theparts you have to access from the wheel well can be accessed from under the vehicle, without even removing the wheels.\n\nAll in all, I actually would recommend this game amazingly, but that's because it's still a work in progress and has time to improve. Only advice is don't take mechanics lessons from it, you won't learn anything.

It is obvios that they did not employ anyone in the staff that is a mechanic. There are a huge amount of things overlooked (like where are all your tools?, theres a red tool box that is smaller than anything that could hold any usable amount of tools) Or how you buy brake pads individually(4 per car) (irl they are sold as a set per axle), and why is it harder to find parts in the game then it is in real life? It is also more frustrating trying to navigate the view and be able to click the parts then it is to do it in real life. Also the OBD scanner should be better than a $100 scanner since it is just a simulation....\n\nFor the most I wanted to love it but just couldnt, 1 star all the way","November 24, 2014","false","1.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/egprime/recommended/270850/","egprime","EwanGoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/egprime/","72 products in account","DO NOT GET THIS GAME! I bought this thinking it would have some gameplay to it. It is the most shallow point and click adventure ever. Even if you are a car mechanic, do not get this! It will make you feel ♥♥♥♥ about your life. As soon as I started playing, it felt like I had wasted money, so I Alt+F4. I feel sick to the gut about how much money I wasted on a half finished, boring concept. Even if you have watched videos on this, and think it would be even the slightest bit fun, heed my warning.\n\nMy problem with this game is that it has 3 inches of gameplay. You get a car, you buy some parts, you take parts out, you put some in, then you assemble the vehichle. It's like a 3D jigsaw. What seperates this and a 3D jigsaw, though, is a 3D jigsaw does not guide your hand every step of the way! If the person giving you the car has not already told you what it is, then driving it once around a track or sitting in the car will tell you. I really hate this, as it removes any concept that this game once had. It drops from a puzzle with depth to a point and click. You get a lot of the same car in this game, and the cars aren't even real, so it's not like a lack of license.\n\nThe controls are clunky. The camera slides like it's on a demonic rail from hell sent to bite you in the f*cking ♥♥♥♥. The mouse lags, and the head-sway would make you believe that you downed 3 bottles of painkillers before each job (I certainly thought about doing so). I understand that you can turn headsway off, but if you do that you feel like you have had a neck brace put on. The music is so loud and abrasive to my ears. It's not licensed, and I know that you can turn the music off, but that's boring. This game has NO middle ground!\n\nI haven't even started on the mechanics. You can only access certain parts from certain angles. That part makes sense. My problem is that some parts make no sense as to where you extract them. You should take the gearbox out from the bottom, but no! You take it out through the top. Through the engine! Don't get me started on the nuts! You should unscrew nuts diagonally, but this doesn't matter, acoridng to Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. For a game specializing in CAR MECHANICS they don't know anything!\n\nYou can buy second hand parts from a dodgy website, but there is almost no point as you can either repair the parts, or buy them new. Second hand parts are never good enough. You could repair them, but that takes extra time, and it's a lot easier to just buy new ones.\n\nTo cleanse my ways, I am going to donate £13 worth of toys and stationary to the bravery box in a cancer ward. It's the only thing that my £13 could be spent on to justify spending so much on a game that made me feel sick. I do agree with funding indie developers, but only if they have good concepts. I was stupid to buy this in the first place. Learn from my mistake, or donate £13 to a teenage cancer trust.

If you don't really know much about cars, you're not gonna know what to do. the game doesn't offer up much in hints if you get stuck, and it's not really the best in telling you exactly what it wants you to do. That taken into account, yeah, i enjoy this game, and i recommend it. it's pretty fun, nothing mind blowing. and if you can stumble through it, you might learn a thing or two.\n\nmy main gripe is the lack of fluid lines. Usually how i'd try and feel out an unfamiliar car is i'd tract the fluid lines. In this one, you have no real way of knowing the fuel filter is in the rear, Also the camera is pretty bad. Like really really bad. You can only tilt it, and you can't morve or pan it. If this game got an update fixing the camera issue, it'd be really really good.","April 24, 2014","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealstubot/recommended/270850/","therealstubot","therealstubot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealstubot/","38 products in account","As a car enthusiast, I found the game to be overly simplified. The interface exaggerates the monotonous aspects of working on cars, while skipping entirely the actual difficulties and triumphs. The main workflow consists of getting a car with a job sheet. The sheet has a vague problem and a dollar amount you'll be paid if you fix the problem. The first assumption made here is that the person who wrote the job sheet knew what the problem was but failed to tell you. They also figured out how much it would cost for you to fix the problem and are charging the car owner that amount. If you fix exactly the problem, you will be profitable. This is a very flawed model since it gives no penalty for diagnosis. You can tear the entire car apart, find the item that has the most amount of wear, if that item can be replaced or repaired for the amount on the job sheet, then it's likely your problem. Rarely, the problem can be 2 or more parts that are marginal.\n\nThere are several "makes" of car in this game, and several different configurations. Most cars and minivans are 4 cylinder, front wheel drive, suv's are all wheel drive, and a few performance cars are v6 (LOL) with rear wheel drive. All cars share most of the same parts. A front strut for the suv fits the economy car, performance car, minivan, everything. There is no confusion about parts at all. The air filter fits everything, as does exhaust pipes, mufflers, cats, brake calipers, brake shoes, end links, shocks, struts, fuel pump, fuel filter, spark plugs, ignition modules, and about a dozen other parts.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are tedious. You get your car and job sheet. You have to figure out which part to replace, but some of the parts you cannot diagnose till you've taken other parts off. For example, if you want to diagnose any suspension component, you have to remove the wheel before you can diagnose anything else. Once the wheel is removed, you can diagnose a layer of components. Diagnosis consists of either selecting diagnose mode, and clicking on the part, or removing the part. Diagnosing the part makes it turn a color from green to red, with green being the 100% effective and red being 1% effective. It appears that anything below 30% is your bad part, with 17% being the most common threshold for failed part. Remove the part, go to the computer and buy another part, sell the bad part on the used part market, and then install the new part. Put everything back together again. Get paid, rinse, repeat till you're sick of it, which for me was about 2 weeks. One area in particular that bugs me is the brake caliper removal sequence. I have removed brake calipers many times, from many different cars, trucks and motorcycles. in every case, the brake pads stayed in the caliper when I removed the caliper. The game has the brake pads stuck to the rotors, so an additional step is needed to remove the pads.\n\nThe problems encountered are textbook, and the solutions are also textbook. Anyone who knows about fixing cars will know immediately what the problem is when reading the job sheet. Could this 'game' be used to gain experience in fixing cars... maybe. One would understand more fully what each component was and how it fits into the whole, and how it's failure would impact the whole. The part about the actual work, I believe would only help someone by giving them a general idea of where on a car that item lives. The work portion is so over simplified as to be a great source of laughs for the first 100 times, then tedious boredom after that. There is no searching for the correct sized socket, then discovering you need the deep wall, and don't have one in that size, or picking the wrong size, and rounding off the bolt, so now you have to use a pipe wrench and buy a new bolt... or discovering you cannot fit your hand into the space provided so you make an elaborate contraption of extensions and universal joints only to discover you didn't need to take that bolt out after all. There's nothing about anti-seize, lock-tite, assembly lube, torque wrenches, impact wrenches, nothing at all about tools. I never had to dig out the welder, sawzall, hammer, prybar, gloves or safety glasses during the game, which makes it totally unrealistic. None of the bolts are ever stuck, rusted, or broken. They're always easy to remove, and install. I never burned my hand on a hot exhaust, or got shocked by a faulty spark plug wire, or got battery acid on my good jeans, or spilled oil all over the engine and had a smoke bomb when the car was started. Also, you cannot install parts out of sequence, so the all too common scenario of discovering you forgot to install the wheel bearing seal after you finished putting everything back together never happens.\n\nI cannot really imagine an audience for this game. Maybe servicemen overseas who miss working on their cars, or prison inmates... A teenager should have their own jalopy to work on and learn from. An adult inclined toward this will have a project car to work on, and certainly will be working on it instead of pretending to work on it with this game. Someone who is considering this line of work as a vocation won't get an accurate picture with this sim, but will get a very general idea of the workflow. Guys like me see this as a novelty and buy it to be disappointed. Perhaps someone with less hands on experience would benefit, or enjoy the simulation. The design and artwork for the sim is good. I will recommend this sim/game for people curious about working on cars. If you already know how to work on cars, pass on this.","April 24, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Prices for parts are outrageous and then the cost you charge the people doesn't even allow you to make a profit. And what car has an airfilter that requires the removal of eight bolts to change?

Graphics are reasonable and frame rate is good on my rig.\n\nThe controls, particularly for the camera, are a little quirky.  Using WASD to manipulate the camera isn't ideal really in my opinion, the mouse is more appropriate for that function.\n\nAs you would expect from a budget title, the game lacks depth.  I found I was really quite bored after an hour.  Endless unbolting of parts, which, whilst realistic, becomes very tiresome.  The vast majority of jobs you receive are simplistic and in all honesty, even with my limited knowledge of car mechanics, there was no real puzzle here.  There is no "businesss simulation" either.  A single click awards you with a one time bank loan.  That is about the only business decision you make.\n\nYou can purchase upgrades which improve the speed at which you remove bolts, or a percentage increase in income per jobs, but there are few options besides this.\n\nTest driving the cars is exactly the same each time and even on repairs you would expected to hear an indication of a fault, such as a work order describing knocking from the suspension, I heard nothing.\n\nI found the gameplay very repetitive indeed.  There is not much to recommend here I'm afraid.  It might keep a younger person occupied for a few hours but thats about it.  Educational value is minimal beyond explaining the names of car parts and their rough locations although even these are only accurate on a very basic level.\n\nCannot really recommend this title, it is just too lacking to be called a simulator.  Buy a meccano set instead.","December 5, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were a few things that could be tweaked and added. First the camera is good but needs a little tweaking when reaching its angle limits. What could be added is random generate id codes for each parts. Why ? well for the fun of it, in one of the contracts, I fixed a water pump and bought one but could not know which was which (not a big issue but would add a little feature). Another thing that could be added is part sorting, this would greatly help. Finally, it would be great to go play in the pistons, camshafts and crankshaft.\nMy final score 9/10 Worth the purchase\n","December 5, 2014","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Even at the lowest settings (and you will want to set mouse moves to the lowest setting) the controls are mushy and awkward.  The main problem is the constant need to center the screen on what you are aiming for, rather than just using the mouse to point at it.  Also, too many things involve clumsy menus and mouse moves where keyboard shortcuts would work a lot better.\n\nThe general gameplay elements are good, and I think the game would be enjoyable if the controls didn't make every simple task a chore and a nuisance.

You're forced to use WASD and mouse look instead of right-click and drag to move your view.  It's archaic and cumberome to use.  There are some very big issues with the interface and movement of this game let alone the gameplay.  One of the first jobs includes a fuel filter replacement but there's no indication where it is because there are no fuel lines or evap lines leading you to it.  You're left searching with a horrible 3D view panel for a little box where no fuel goes.  This game is nothing like working on a real car.  If you've ever worked on a car and know what you are doing then this game is definitely not for you.  It has great potential to be a mechanic simulator but it needs a ton more work especially on the way you look around and select things.  Is it worth $5?  Barely.  I'd think $3 would be a fair price for a game that feels like it should still be in alpha development.","December 25, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game was crude but had a huge mod group where people made real cars for the game to fix up and sell.\n\nThat game prompted me to purchase this game and I have to say as a real auto/truck tech the game is very much like real life.  Every symptom I have seen from the customer was correct to the causes.\n\nHow ever there is one thing that really bugs me.  The game requires removal of items to get to another item that you really dont have to do in real life.  Example is there was one job that required the replacement of the exhaust manifold.  To do this you have to remove the rear muffler, the rear exhaust pipe, the middle muffler, the middle exhaust pipe, the catalytic converter, and the forward exhaust pipe before you can remove the exhaust manifold.\n\nWhen I have had to do this at work I have never removed the whole exhaust system, I have always broke the exhaust loose at the manifold to header pipe connection and then removed the manifold.\n\nThis is where this game in my opinion could be improved on is allowing the items to be removed without having to remove the whole system when it is not required.  Its like removal of the front strut you have to take the sway bar end link off first.  Well I dont remove them I remove the end that is attached to the strut and then remove the strut.  Like wise in the game the strut only has four bolts holding it to the spindle arm when in reality its two bolts with another three to six bolts holding it to the unibody at the top of the strut.\n\nWhile these complaints are minor and do not effect the game itself I still recommend the game for those that want to experience real diaganostics and troubleshooting of vehicle problems.","December 21, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish it was a bit more complex with more engine configurations and cars in general, but overall I had a blast with this game. I do automotive work on my friends cars for food and this was a very similar albiet simplified experience, but it gives you an idea. I would recomend it for you to get your mind in a problem solving state, and just enjoy something that for the most part is a bit expensive in real life.","July 15, 2014","true","154.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easy controls make it quite accessable.\nBut after 3 hours of playing I've found it lacking in variety and the gameplay is too simple.\n\nDespite the name, this is a car puzzle game, not a detailed simulator.\n\nFor me, someone who knows very little about cars, I got what a paid for - a learning game that has taught me more of the basics;  the names of various mechanical components and how they fit together, but I imagine anyone who already has that knowledge will lose intrest in this title very quickly.  Different vehicles in the base game all have the same components inside.\n\nThe main challenge of the game is a real world one - where is the part I need to pull out? and what else to I need to remove first to get it out?   Figuring this out is rewarding.  But there's no need to pick the right tool for the job, simply click a part to remove it or click repeatedly to unscrew it.\n\nThere's no time pressure either, no countdown clocks or waiting customers.  Having this as an option after the first few jobs might have spiced things up a bit.\n\nYour camera can fly through the transparent body of the car to give you a better view of what you're removing, which is fine except when, despite the fact you can see a part, you can't remove it because you entered this view from the engine rather than the wheel.\nThis is a little frustrating because the game lacks feedback.  A simple audio cue of your 'character' saying "Uh.  Can't reach that from here"  or "Whoops, no room under the car to pull that out."  might have prompted me to open the hood or raise the car on the lift rather looking around fruitlessly for a  prerequiste part to remove first.  Parts that are visible but inaccessable should have better visual cues, "greying out" when you mouse over them, etc.\n\nAs the career progresses, you get access to better garages, I hope this will allow me to remove engine blocks and pull them apart.\n\nIf you have children and you'd like to share your motorhead passion with them, this would be an excellent place to start, but if you tinker with real engines, this won't fire you up.\n\nStill recommended for the quality of the production but I'd love to see a "pro" mode that increases the complexity of the engines and other components.","July 19, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The goal is simple: perform the tasks on the work order using your trusty wrench and diagnostic tools (including test drives), not to mention your two eyes to find and repair the various parts and make a profit.\n\nThe game itself isn't terrible, the graphics are quite good and the gameplay is fluid enough, but the repetition and free-roaming aspect of the game can become tedius if not completely irritating at times. To give an example of this, take a work order that simply says "The car pulls to the right sometimes." You'll find yourself pulling the car apart to find the problem, then you need to walk to the computer to buy the new part, walk back, put everything back together and move on. Sometimes the simplest problem becomes a headache because you have to remove several parts to get to the part you need to replace.\n\nWalking around the car and having to work on it section by section can be a bit of a pain, but for simulation sake is pretty accurate enough to real life that it makes sense. Although, in a gaming aspect can just be viewed as a bit of a waste of time and makes some jobs a bit too long to be enjoyable. The fact that you can't create and build your own cars and sell them off is a bit of a letdown as well.\n\nAll-in-all, if you want to remove bolts and replace parts all day long, this is your game. I would recommend getting it at a discounted price if you can. Although a nice little past-time game, long-term and replayability is definitely not on the books for this title. The potential is there but unfortunately it falls just short of a good simulator.\n\nRating: D+\n\n","June 28, 2014","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course it's not hyper-realistic; get a Haynes manual and a beater if you want that. It's fun seeing the invoice "I hear a weird sound the faster I go and my dashboard is dim" and knowing it's the alternator and knowing how to swap it out.\n\nThe economic aspect is fun, too. Save some money by buying used parts and repairing, or repairing the existing part directly. Invest in "management" to get a % ROI on future invoices.\n\nThe test drive feature is really nice but a bit shallow. You're really kind of forced to do it sometimes and it's really hard to divine anything from the driving experience. It'll usually just reveal the problem parts after via color so it makes me wonder.. why even do the test drive? Some more obvious feedback (loud knocking, un-steerable car, etc) would make it more valuable.\n\nThe production value is nice, and it almost feels like a NEED FOR SPEED: UNDERCARRIAGE at some parts. The music is surprisingly good too.\n\nThe 4x4 DLC was a nice surprise. I'm looking forward to the "Turbo" DLC, too. I'd love to see the process of taking a NA car to a FI car. I hope to see (and would happily pay for) more extreme modifications like engine swaps, drive train swaps, RHD to LHD swaps, maybe import to domestic swaps (bumpers / headlights / engine), to even something like buying beaters, fixing them up, and selling them on your lot, or something.

After that, you will see condition of relevant parts immediately.\n\nThere is one bad thing about test drive - car alway acts like a perfect working car, even if order states that it makes weird noise or doesn't start at all. All that it does - it reveals condition of some parts.\n\nThere is also some illogical orders, like so:\nIt states that car don't start\nYou checks engine, find out that electrical wires and spark plugs are damaged, and everything else looks ok. You replace them and nothing happens - order doesn't complete.\nI watched that order on youtube - and somewhy, you need to replace starter as well, even if it's on 60% condition (doesn't looks so bad).\nFortunately, there is only one or two of that, other orders are fine.\n\nThis game doesn't have all the systems that real car have, and after playing it you will not be able to repair your own car.

In this game, you will find no blank stares or slow mumbles. There are no memorable answers to simple questions, such as people claiming to own a Honda Elantra. The customers usually know what's wrong with their cars and leave understandable notes on the work order, which allows you to quickly find and correct the current problem. I cannot begin to explain how far from reality this actually is.\n\nThe another jab to the title of "simulator" comes from the ease of installation or removal of parts. As any grease monkey will testify, parts just don't come off that easily. I was also sad to find that there was no way to curse at the vehicle for being difficult. The mechanic you play as must be a ghost, as you'll find that starters, located next to the transmission, are installed and removed through the engine bay.\n\nLastly, the cars are all clean. There is no grime to wash off, there are no fingernails lined with black grease. You will not find bandages on your arms and fingers because there are no impact or puncture wounds to heal.

I'm 61/75 on the normal orders and still have 20 left on the offroad add-on.\n\nGameplay is smooth on ultra settings, except I have OA and DOF disabled because of my old GeForce 9600 GSO and running 1600x900 native resolution.\n\nGame still looks very good with those settings.\n\nThe camera can be bothersome at times, but you can click on any part near the part you actually need to focus the camera quickly.\n\nThe only downfall is the repetative gameplay itself but it's still engaging and pushes you on to complete the order, and the next, and the next.\n\nPersonally I wish there was more depth, like being able to actually delve into the engine, or replace U-Joints and smaller stuff. But I understand this game is meant for everyone and people that don't know a lot about cars could get lost.\n\nI would just like to see difficulty settings.

It is, as many have already pointed out, somewhat limited in scope. You click to unscrew bolts, you inspect the condition of the parts, you order new ones from the computer and you replace the old ones. Done. Occasionally you test-drive the cars on this one small ugly test course.\n\nSo far, the insides of most cars I have repaied looked the same! If you get to work on a muscle car then the setup does change, but basically the insides only differ per type of car and not per car. All the major parts of a car are there but don't expect to be replacing some small stressed screw somehwere or repairing a crack in the windshield. This game does not go that deep.\n\nBut since I know almost nothing about cars, it did teach me a thing or two about them so mission accomplished I guess.\n\nI recommend it but only if it's on sale. 20 euros is a bit too steep. The only thing this game really has going for it is its uniqueness, which is a shame because I think an in-dept car mechanic simulator would be an interesting game.","July 13, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very basic mechanics. In real life you don't need to remove the entire exhaust system just to remove the headers. You don't need to remove the entire intake system just to remove the air filter. As a real-life mechanic, the part removal process is just unbearable in this game. I shouldn't have to keep the car on the ground to remove the tire and work on the upper suspension and then raise the vehicle to work on the lower suspension.

Their is no engine block disasembly or removal of pistons, crackshafts ect nor can you adjust the throttle.  The engines in all the cars are exactly the same, and if you work on a rear wheel drive car, the engine is mounted like a front wheel drive which is NOT how engines in RWD are monuted. The drive shaft comes out of seemingly nowhere and even if it's rear wheel drive the gear box has shoulders for a FWD.  The only engine configuration is the fuel injected I-4 and V 6 no uniquness or difficulty based on unfamiliarity, in fact, anyone can work on these cars, very basic stuff.  I took automotive service technology in vo-tech and know something about cars, this is totally inacurate.  However, I think there is a lot of BASIC stuff that can be learned from this game, as there is a lot of detail and work on suspension, though that is where it ends. No engine work some clutch assemblages to work on at times. The "test" driving is nothing of the knd, I never use it unless an order calls for it, the cars handle exactly the same whether you change out all the old parts for new or not. There is no performance gain in test driving.  Basically, you do a work order, then go to the next. There are three garages each more advanced than the last, however little difference besides a few diagnostic tools you rarely use anyway, most people just want there tires changed and their spark plugs replaced anyhow.  I like the game just to pass the time but there are more advanced games of this nature and it is not a true simulator.","March 7, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is it fun. Initially it is quite fun as you are presented with challenges. There were some problems I encountered with this game though. Some of the required parts to be changed are not clear. After you have solved all the campaign missions, things go downhill and the game just becomes routine and a bit boring.\n\nI just wish there were more to do in the post game experience. It is almost hinted that you can do more with the engine, but you can't really. I wish there are more parts to replace or at least a more advanced mode or set of tools. In a way it is boring since it breaks down to running the car on the diagnostic path and the test track and then replacing all the parts as you need them. Or you have to replace something on the car first to get it running and test it. However, there is no challenge to this.\n\nI did encounter a few things that I consider to be bugs. Some parts will not show their condition, unless you physically unscrew them. I sort of understand the logic to this, as you need to visually inspect some parts to know their condition, but it seems strange. Mostly I just wish there was more variety on the diagnostic techniques. Maybe more mini-games such as tyre balancing or having to set the torque on a wrench, add a cherry picker so we can do more with the engine, force the user to lift up the car to drop the transmission. Fix the radiator, fill it with coolant. Replace the sterring wheel, align the chassis.\n\nSome problems that I have with the game is that there are no time constraints. You are free to take your time without worrying. You are also only given one car at a time to work on. It seems really strange that they give you this super deluxe car shop with the impression that you are making lots of money, but I have never seen any car workshop that only worked on one car at once. Other things I have a problem with is with the in-game parts catalog. There is no way to filter items by name or by condition. There is no quick sell option. What would be really great would be a parts checklist or log. "Inspected x - condition y, took off part x - condition. Other issues, I think there should be a keys bound to enable switching between attach/detach, inspection, show/hide body or parts condition.\n\nI still recommend this game as an interesting distraction. Would I recommend the full price? It isn't really that much, so yes.","March 10, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What things are negative:\n\n- Dont like the radio, its quiet annoying. My girlfriend sings better then that.\n- You cant instantly turn the radio off so go for silents gameplay.\n- An other good future could be that you can listen to your own music selected by the radio.\n- Some camera views are terrible, like filling the engine oil and need to go back to the oil stick to check the oil. Also removing oil is just terrible for camera angle..\n\n- Other bad thing about the oil change, the oil collector unit is hard to position under the car, so the oil is always falling on the floor.\n- There isnt really an tutorial ingame so you can learn where the parts are on the car, (i never saw a mechanic without brains or doesnt know where to start.\n- You cant really disamble the whole engine, this is really an missed change to be a good game.\n- Maybe some complain about my bad things i listed here and saying its a cheap maded game, then make it more expensive. Ill better like a good game i want to pay for, then buying a not so good game that would chase my whole live staying on my steam account..\n- It looks like that the parts are all the same, i like to see more parts that arent interchangable with some brands of cars. This was already existing on the dos game `street rod`, and street rod 2`. How hard could it be to make a really good game and make good money on it, instead doing something an hope it would sell..\n- What i also think is worse, the secondhand parts are always `junk` as you want to buy it(not usable anymore). I thought to would be more clever to buy a second hand part, but is was really worn out and so not usable anymore.\n- I also like to see more and better music in this game..\n\nAs i said this game have potential, but i really like to see that the devlopers work this game better out! But then i could recommend it, otherwise not!!!","February 23, 2014","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What can I say??\n\nI've been wanting to play this for a little while, and I've now managed to have a little blat..\n\nFirst impressions? Well, as a mechanic by trade, I really wish it were that easy to remove bolts... But that's not the name of the game here is it? Granted the tutorial is 30 seconds long, but that, to me, sort of adds appeal, as it means you have to think about what you're doing. This isn't a mindless shoot em up. You have to think logically, especially when it starts getting into replacing a clutch and so on.\n\nWhat needs to come off first before I can get to the real issue. Pretty much like a normal car.\n\nAs a really nice touch, I like the fact you get money returned for recycling!!\n\nGranted, there's not much variation in the vehicles, like RWD, 4x4 etc, which would add more dimention to the game, but as it is, is has what a good majority of cars now are. Front Wheel Drive.\n\nI'd like to see more parts to be added, and get down to the real nitty gritty parts, like circlips and split pins, you know, all the little fiddly bits, or even having a seized stud which you've got to use oxy-acetylene to warm up to get out, even a snapped bolt..\n\nMaybe I'm being too traditional there, but these things happen!!\n\nOne thing that IS missing.. Girly calenders. Sorry for being sexist here ladies. I have yet to come across a garage that doesn't have a girly calender somewhere. And who in the world had an FSO Polonez poster on the wall?? hehehe! (1st garage, behind the lift control) Yes, I know RedDot are a Polish company before you start!\n\nAh! another good point.. A PROPER lift would be advantagous here. One where you specify the height or at least have complete free wheeling, instead of using a scissor jack??  Do garages really have lifts like these now? Be nice if the lifts were the double poster type, just so you could work at the height you want, not either on the floor or in the air.\n\nAgain, being picky because of grease monkey.. =)\n\nOverall, if you want to learn a little about cars and like a little challenge, then this game is ideal.\nTo me, this is a fun game, not a sim, but I enjoy it enough to keep playing.","February 15, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't really know much about cars, you're not gonna know what to do. the game doesn't offer up much in hints if you get stuck, and it's not really the best in telling you exactly what it wants you to do. That taken into account, yeah, i enjoy this game, and i recommend it. it's pretty fun, nothing mind blowing. and if you can stumble through it, you might learn a thing or two.\n\nmy main gripe is the lack of fluid lines. Usually how i'd try and feel out an unfamiliar car is i'd tract the fluid lines. In this one, you have no real way of knowing the fuel filter is in the rear, Also the camera is pretty bad. Like really really bad. You can only tilt it, and you can't morve or pan it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealstubot/recommended/270850/","therealstubot","therealstubot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealstubot/","38 products in account","As a car enthusiast, I found the game to be overly simplified. The interface exaggerates the monotonous aspects of working on cars, while skipping entirely the actual difficulties and triumphs. The main workflow consists of getting a car with a job sheet. The sheet has a vague problem and a dollar amount you'll be paid if you fix the problem. The first assumption made here is that the person who wrote the job sheet knew what the problem was but failed to tell you. They also figured out how much it would cost for you to fix the problem and are charging the car owner that amount. If you fix exactly the problem, you will be profitable. This is a very flawed model since it gives no penalty for diagnosis. You can tear the entire car apart, find the item that has the most amount of wear, if that item can be replaced or repaired for the amount on the job sheet, then it's likely your problem. Rarely, the problem can be 2 or more parts that are marginal.\n\nThere are several "makes" of car in this game, and several different configurations. Most cars and minivans are 4 cylinder, front wheel drive, suv's are all wheel drive, and a few performance cars are v6 (LOL) with rear wheel drive. All cars share most of the same parts. A front strut for the suv fits the economy car, performance car, minivan, everything. There is no confusion about parts at all. The air filter fits everything, as does exhaust pipes, mufflers, cats, brake calipers, brake shoes, end links, shocks, struts, fuel pump, fuel filter, spark plugs, ignition modules, and about a dozen other parts.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are tedious. You get your car and job sheet. You have to figure out which part to replace, but some of the parts you cannot diagnose till you've taken other parts off. For example, if you want to diagnose any suspension component, you have to remove the wheel before you can diagnose anything else. Once the wheel is removed, you can diagnose a layer of components. Diagnosis consists of either selecting diagnose mode, and clicking on the part, or removing the part. Diagnosing the part makes it turn a color from green to red, with green being the 100% effective and red being 1% effective. It appears that anything below 30% is your bad part, with 17% being the most common threshold for failed part. Remove the part, go to the computer and buy another part, sell the bad part on the used part market, and then install the new part. Put everything back together again. Get paid, rinse, repeat till you're sick of it, which for me was about 2 weeks. One area in particular that bugs me is the brake caliper removal sequence. I have removed brake calipers many times, from many different cars, trucks and motorcycles. in every case, the brake pads stayed in the caliper when I removed the caliper. The game has the brake pads stuck to the rotors, so an additional step is needed to remove the pads.\n\nThe problems encountered are textbook, and the solutions are also textbook. Anyone who knows about fixing cars will know immediately what the problem is when reading the job sheet. Could this 'game' be used to gain experience in fixing cars... maybe. One would understand more fully what each component was and how it fits into the whole, and how it's failure would impact the whole. The part about the actual work, I believe would only help someone by giving them a general idea of where on a car that item lives. The work portion is so over simplified as to be a great source of laughs for the first 100 times, then tedious boredom after that. There is no searching for the correct sized socket, then discovering you need the deep wall, and don't have one in that size, or picking the wrong size, and rounding off the bolt, so now you have to use a pipe wrench and buy a new bolt... or discovering you cannot fit your hand into the space provided so you make an elaborate contraption of extensions and universal joints only to discover you didn't need to take that bolt out after all. There's nothing about anti-seize, lock-tite, assembly lube, torque wrenches, impact wrenches, nothing at all about tools. I never had to dig out the welder, sawzall, hammer, prybar, gloves or safety glasses during the game, which makes it totally unrealistic. None of the bolts are ever stuck, rusted, or broken. They're always easy to remove, and install. I never burned my hand on a hot exhaust, or got shocked by a faulty spark plug wire, or got battery acid on my good jeans, or spilled oil all over the engine and had a smoke bomb when the car was started. Also, you cannot install parts out of sequence, so the all too common scenario of discovering you forgot to install the wheel bearing seal after you finished putting everything back together never happens.\n\nI cannot really imagine an audience for this game. Maybe servicemen overseas who miss working on their cars, or prison inmates... A teenager should have their own jalopy to work on and learn from. An adult inclined toward this will have a project car to work on, and certainly will be working on it instead of pretending to work on it with this game. Someone who is considering this line of work as a vocation won't get an accurate picture with this sim, but will get a very general idea of the workflow. Guys like me see this as a novelty and buy it to be disappointed. Perhaps someone with less hands on experience would benefit, or enjoy the simulation. The design and artwork for the sim is good. I will recommend this sim/game for people curious about working on cars. If you already know how to work on cars, pass on this.","April 24, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a result the game quickly becomes a tedious follow through of removing bolts in to replace certain parts. The only real difficulty lies in establishing what the customer actually wants done sometimes.\n\nIf you're looking for an updated version of Gearheads Garage, this aint it, thats for sure. The game could have done with perhaps trying to be more educational if they were targeting the non-mechanically minded. For example, instead of having someone remove a trailing rod, it'd have been clever to have a brief description available as to what this part does, symptoms of when its gone wrong and so on.\n\nAs it stands, the cars all look the same, you're limited to just how much actual work you can do on a car and it lacks the realism of your typical garage in that you can't half-♥♥♥ a job then overcharge the customer.","January 30, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although fairly detailed graphics wise, it falls flat compared to what  we all know this is suppose to replace. The test driving albeit a neat feature is terrible. An arcade racing game has better handling mechanics than this. But test driving aside the core mechanics of, well, being  amechanic, just doesn't feel the same as it did in Gearhead Garage. Not to mention the lack of an auction/build your own projects (Which IMO was what brought Gearhead Garage to life) is missing, so it's just you fixing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cars and you really have no motivation since you're essentially doing the same thing over and over without a goal to get to, like saving up to fix a beater you bought at an auction. One last point I think is pretty important is the inability to actually take the entire car apart. The game dumbs it down to only a handful of parts that can be removed and replaced while others are just static imagery, as if they didn't exist. All in all, the game does not live up to the expectations of a 15 year old game. It really should have.","April 7, 2014","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think the developers could have made it more detailed with the car parts, examining and assembling/unassembling of the cars.\n\nThere isn't many car models in the game either, you end up doing a lot of repairs on about 4 different cars, it would have been nice to have worked on a variety of cars.\n\nI found the test driving to be useless, it doesn't tell you anything about what's wrong with the car, the horrible sounds are not existent, the bumps, the steering wheel pulling to one side, none of it. You can be a dodgy mechanic in the game by keeping the damaged parts from your previous repair jobs and then taking the good parts off the cars from the new jobs and replacing them with the damaged parts then all you have to do is go to your inventory and sell the good parts.\n\nIt does start to get challenging as some jobs require you to read the customers complaint and go over the car and find the problem and then rectify it which made it more interesting to play as time went on.\n\nSomethings are completely off in this game like the pricing of car parts, since when does a spark plug cost 35$ or a battery costing 350$. Some jobs pay ridiculous amounts as well, which isn't realistic in terms of real life and since when does a mechanic repair a fuel or water pump. It is quite a repetitive game, the developers did include two add-ons which made it a bit more exciting to play but there has been so much left out of this game. also there could have been so much that could have been added to this game.\n\n","June 9, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The costumers sometimes give you very specific problems which makes it very easy to work with, but sometimes they just give you a symptom and you have to figure out what causes it using your own instincts and the experience that you have gathered so far. I really enjoyed that aspect of the game, and it allows me to test my already lousy knowledge in cars to the limit, and it might serve me well when my car starts to give in.\n\nThe mouse movement was a bit weird at first, but you get used to it. The music library is mainly dubstep music, and I wish they added a proper radio like in euro truck simulator 2. Also, there is no quick way to get to the inventory  or to switch between assemble and disassemble without pressing the right mouse key to bring the menu up, or I somehow missed it.\n\nBut overall, this game is very entertaining, and according to many people it comes very close to show how real cars work.","June 9, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At least being able to change out the cams and crank and even the pistons, 3 extra components wouldnt have been hard to implement surely?\n\nThe turbo dlc should make things more interesting if you can set psi and add boost controllers and such.\nI think what would make it perfect for me would be customers asking for performance mods.

The whole idea and the high level of detail is highly appealing. However I am struggling with the controls. There's room for improvements:\n\n* Camera rotation in assembly mode is just odd with keys: very clumsy and unintuitive. The mouse would be a much better idea\n* Ordering parts is hell on earth: So many items without a quick search or filters. Buying many things will end in a click orgy for confirmation. Why not use a checkout mechanic?\n* Options not available in game mode\n* Quick menu is a nice idea, but it should make available especially buying stuff.\n* Where are the parts I have to examine/repair/replace? I like to learn something about cars and I don't know for example where the oil filter is. This may be fun for trial and error, but can leave you at a loss in some situations. Some guidance if needed should be implemented. Could be manuals and with upgrades, even augmented reality.\n* Head/Camera swaying while moving around. Please make this an option, I feel seasick. When I look at things in real life at least my head is not moving around unvoluntarily.\n* Mouse wheel not working in game browser to buy stuff\n* Funds are covered by browser window\n\n","January 29, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At least as far as I have played.\nAnd unfortunately you can't disassemble the engine.\nThe driving part is not what this game is about, and you can feel and see that. There is no difference in the driving physics if something is damaged or not and you can't really see anything in the mirrors for example. Driving the car is good for only one thing. After your "testdrive" you can see the condition of many parts, so you don't have to inspect them each.\nAnother thing that bored me after a while was the fact, that every part in every car is at the same location. They look all the same underneath. The only small differences can be found between a V6 and a Straight4 engined car in combination with rear, front or 4x4.

It's pretty much the same except now there are work orders,a test drive section, a parts ordering mechanism,and a radio. Overall it's the same game. (but it was on sale for less than 3 bucks so what the hell I picked it up).\n\nLet me say this, as a simulator this game falls wayyyy short, I've never done a brake job that didn;t have caliper bracket bolts or a bracket for that matter so yeah not too realilistic there. The prices are very odd, there's no pressing out bearings (so far anyway) and one of the first 5 jobs i was supposed to test an alternator...well when I removed the thing it said 6% cheapest option was replacement, ordered part put it on, got the belt on, took the battery out (1%) cheapest option was repair (90 some dollars....what shop doesn't have a charger to  "repair" a battery for free?) put it all together went to close out the repair and low and behold it said to test alternator...what the ♥♥♥♥ does it matter now that i replaced it? and it wouldn't let me just check the condition of the old alternator... so ♥♥♥♥ that.\nOther things to note; the mouse is laggy in game, it has different speeds in different parts of the game i.e the menu, the game, the computer ordering , all different speeds incredibly frustrating. The test drive section is pretty pointless, I don't think I know of a single person who would want me to put their car through such strain after fixing it and it's clunky.\n\nIn summary if you have an interest in working on cars but no knowledge this game is actually a decent tool to familiarize yourself with the components of the average automobile, the version I played so long ago went a long way in helping me memorize the main engine components of the average v8 of the era and this game is more advaned. But you're better off just working on cars to learn how. so yeah don't buy this unless it's super cheap and you have next to 0 car knowledge.","June 5, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have no idea where the fuel filter might be (somewhere near the gas tank, I'd assume?).\nUnfortunately, the game doesn't even indicate where the item in question might be, unless you're already very close.

I finally settled on recommending it because it seems to succeed at what it sat out to do. It is a competent simulator. You should plan on reading the steam forums a lot if you are not mechanically inclined or not familiar with what makes an automobile work. That being said, you also don't have to be an ASE Certified master technician to enjoy the game.\n\nYou have an economy system with progression in the form of better equipment and money boosts. You do have to purchase the parts you intend to use so there is a failure state if you are not careful (you can reset scenarios though). During career you will advance from a small repair shop to a state of the art complex. Parts that you can interact with are highlighted and show colored “health” represented by a percentage meter. Some parts have to be removed to be examined. The parts that can be removed are usually highlighted and if you are required to remove a certain part to get to another they are shown in red to make things easier. An example would be removing tires to work on the brakes. There are also different views you can choose from removing the body rotating the camera and showing “health” of the parts. Graphical fidelity is competent but could have been better. Since this isn't a AAA title though I can accept it.\n\nIt is not without its problems though. I do have experience and education behind me for automotive service and repair so I didn't really get hung up on any of the scenarios that I played. I can easily see where this game may be too advanced for beginners wanting to learn about cars and it is a shame that there is no hint system to speak of (or at least that I was able to find). My biggest complaint with the game is the navigation. I had to exit the “wheel” section, for example to access the “engine” area (like the transmission bell housing) which was clearly in view already. It made it unnecessarily convoluted and drawn out even though I knew exactly what I had to do.\n\nI would have liked to have seen more choice in tools and a way to torque bolts to the proper specs as well as some tire changing/balancing stations but that may just be because I’m really into this kind of work in real life. I would recommend this to anyone with a strong interest in the game but if your interest is only passing you may want to wait for a sale.\n","February 11, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let not knowing the difference between a sump plug and a rubber bushing stop you from getting into what is a very pretty game with a solid idea behind it.\nI'd say the asking price is about right, don't expect this game to last you forever and don't expect too much of it.

As a result the game quickly becomes a tedious follow through of removing bolts in to replace certain parts.

The game could have done with perhaps trying to be more educational if they were targeting the non-mechanically minded. For example, instead of having someone remove a trailing rod, it'd have been clever to have a brief description available as to what this part does, symptoms of when its gone wrong and so on.\n\nAs it stands, the cars all look the same, you're limited to just how much actual work you can do on a car and it lacks the realism of your typical garage in that you can't half-♥♥♥ a job then overcharge the customer.","January 30, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarthCuda/recommended/270850/","DarthCuda","darthcuda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarthCuda/","493 products in account","I found it difficult to recommend this game and equally difficult not to. I finally settled on recommending it because it seems to succeed at what it sat out to do. It is a competent simulator. You should plan on reading the steam forums a lot if you are not mechanically inclined or not familiar with what makes an automobile work. That being said, you also don't have to be an ASE Certified master technician to enjoy the game.\n\nYou have an economy system with progression in the form of better equipment and money boosts. You do have to purchase the parts you intend to use so there is a failure state if you are not careful (you can reset scenarios though). During career you will advance from a small repair shop to a state of the art complex. Parts that you can interact with are highlighted and show colored “health” represented by a percentage meter. Some parts have to be removed to be examined. The parts that can be removed are usually highlighted and if you are required to remove a certain part to get to another they are shown in red to make things easier. An example would be removing tires to work on the brakes. There are also different views you can choose from removing the body rotating the camera and showing “health” of the parts. Graphical fidelity is competent but could have been better. Since this isn't a AAA title though I can accept it.\n\nIt is not without its problems though. I do have experience and education behind me for automotive service and repair so I didn't really get hung up on any of the scenarios that I played. I can easily see where this game may be too advanced for beginners wanting to learn about cars and it is a shame that there is no hint system to speak of (or at least that I was able to find). My biggest complaint with the game is the navigation. I had to exit the “wheel” section, for example to access the “engine” area (like the transmission bell housing) which was clearly in view already. It made it unnecessarily convoluted and drawn out even though I knew exactly what I had to do.\n\nI would have liked to have seen more choice in tools and a way to torque bolts to the proper specs as well as some tire changing/balancing stations but that may just be because I’m really into this kind of work in real life. I would recommend this to anyone with a strong interest in the game but if your interest is only passing you may want to wait for a sale.\n","February 11, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And while that is not necessarily a bad thing, it does mean you're likely to be hoping that this game builds on that experience. On the other hand, if you've never played Gearhead, you're probably be new to this concept of game, as nothing like it really exists. So, are you going to be disappointed?\n\nFirstly, you're likely going to have some interest in cars, if not, I'm not sure this will appeal to you. In order to get by in this game, you will need a basic understanding of car components.\n\nThe game starts of well, introducing you to the controls. The first task directs you to operating the radio, the various car tools, car lift, etc. All too quickly though, you're on your own. Each task arrives in the form of a work sheet with a list of jobs to do, and a description of the customer's problem. The list can give you an obvious task, such as replace the oil, or it can be completely useless,  such as directing you to replace all the broken parts. In the latter the customer description may give you a clue, but sometimes that can be ambiguous, such as explaining they went off-road, yet not describing if that meant they were trying some 4x4r stuff, or they happened to have some sort of accident, or they may just tell you that it won't start. A side note on the radio, the music drove me to distraction, I'm sure some people will like it. I turned the radio off, only to find it doesn't turn off, but switches channels for something equally awful. I ended up going to the main game menu options and turning the music off.\n\nThere are a number of diagnostic methods you can undertake. On the first level, you can use the ODB to check the engine and electrics, and you can take the car for a test drive. Level two upwards gives you access to a rolling road, to test brakes and suspension. After you have performed the diagnostics it will colour code the parts tested. You also have the ability to physically examine individual parts in turn, but this can be time consuming if you don't know which part might be at fault. Some part also need removing to be examined, which is even more frustrating if it is okay.\n\nThe test drive sounds like fun? Well, no. It's a very basic car driving experience, either viewed from the driver's seat or a rear third person view. The objective, of which there is no guidance, is to follow a set out course, which first tests acceleration, then braking, followed by a slalom (steering test), finally ending with an uneven road (suspension test). Follow the glowing gates and you can't go wrong. The feedback delivered through the driving simulation is poor. You have no way of judging if acceleration or braking is adequate, even more so when there are a number of different car models to try. The same goes for the suspension test. Steering problems sometimes show up on the slalom when you experience severe under-steer, but to be honest the simulation is so poor, the steering can be bad even when it doesn't need repairing.\n\nBack in the workshop, where you will spend most of your time, you can switch the view from a normal view, or to having the parts colour coded from green to red, green representing 100% quality and red, 0% quality. Sounds straight forward. Unfortunately there is no guidance as to what is acceptable quality, will 50% cut it? Or does it have to be 75% and greater? It can end up being trial and error. In the end, it is just quicker to buy new and replace anything you're not sure about.\n\nThere are seven main areas to investigate, the four wheels, under the bonnet, underneath the front and underneath the rear. So, you've identified what needs fixing. Now you need to remove the broken part. This is just a matter of click on the part to focus on it, then clicking again to either remove the part, or show the bolts that need to be undone first. Undoing bolts is a matter of clicking on them and holding the mouse button until the bolt is removed. You can alter the view, rotate around, above and below. You can also zoom in and out.\n\nSo the part is removed, what now? Well, there may be the chance to repair it, or buy a new or used replacement. Repairing parts is very limited, there are so few parts that can be repaired. Buying used is almost always a waste of time, as the condition of the part is pot luck and can't examined before buying. Also as previously mentioned, this leaves you with the problem as to just what is acceptable quality? So, if you can't repair a part you're best of buying new. The parts to be bought are listed alphabetically, and this seemed odd to me, as I would have preferred similar parts to be next to each other. As an example, the exhaust comes in numerous sections, but because each part is named after its position such as rear muffler, or middle muffler, they a separated by all the other parts that fall between the letters M and R. If you have numerous parts to buy, such a full set of brake pads, you have to click eight times on the break pads, and confirm you want to buy each one. This becomes tedious, and could have easily been rectified with a simple basket and quantity system, like all online shops employ. There is no margin for error here, if you buy the wrong part, you can't cancel it. You could sell it back at a massive reduction, but you're just best off keeping the part in a hope you have a need for it later. You can also sell back the worn parts, but you don't make much on them, and the process is only worth doing to keep you inventory tidy, as the worn parts serve no purpose, you'll not get an opportunity to use them.\n\nThe range of cars isn't very varied, and consists of 4 cylinder or v6 petrol engines. The running gear, comprises of 2 wheel drive and 4 wheel drive. There are several exhaust systems. In general though, it's not long before you seen everything, and the repetition sets in.\n\nThere are three levels to work through, the second introduces the rolling road, the third introduces chip tuning. Chip tuning seems almost pointless. You certainly won't notice the improvements in the test drive, if you can be bothered to try our the improvement (there's no requirement to do so, nor incentive). To tune the car you need to align three power blocks, and then save the setting to the EEPROM, and test. The challenge here is moving the blocks to achieve the right level of tuning, from 5% to 45%. As you move one block, it affects the other two. There may be some logic to this, but really, it's not worth the time and effort to work out. It doesn't take long to find the desired level. Once you complete the third level at 76 jobs, you unlock the endless mode. However, I'm not sure the game has anything left by this point to make me want to play forever.\n\nThere are upgrades to be bought along the way which will do the following, reduce the time to undo bolts, automatically examine random parts, increase the money made per job, and reduce the cost of parts. There are ten levels for each item. The least useful if the auto examination of parts, as most part end up being covered by diagnostic tests.\n\nThe game could have been made more interesting by adding to the challenges, for example, setting a time limit to get the job done. There is no real incentive to read the job sheet, you could just examine every part and just replace the poor quality stuff and still turn a profit. The test drive, there is no penalty for crashing the car. The used parts are almost a waste of time, I think I was able to use them in about two levels. Replacing the oil, you're provided with a used oil drum, but it doesn't matter if you drain the sump all over the workshop floor, you don't see it, there is no consequence. There are no "project" cars to be bought and worked on that you can sell for profit.\n\nThe graphics are fairly nice, and the tear down of the cars is of a fairly sufficient depth, only marred by the low number of variat","February 11, 2014","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it is a lot of fun. But it does certainly has room for improvement. But I higlhly recommend playing the DEMO first before blindly purchasing it based on players reviews.\n\nI sort went into this game thinking cool another Gear Head Garage game, but sadly it is not that in any shape or form. First off you are given jobs, and given a certain amount of how much the job cost. It is up to you to pin point the problem based on what the customer said or by test driving, or doing a test tech in bigger garages.\n\nOne thing I learned while playing is the vehicle will have a lot of red parts, but you won't have enough money to buy/fix them all, just buy/fix what the person wanted and send it on its way. Buying/Fixing the red parts will put your shop in a early grave, so while tempting. Just DON'T do it.\n\nOne job that really threw people off was the fuel filter job. While having replaced the fuel filter in my car recently. I knew it was in or near the gas tank, so I went there right away. But other's stumbled on this job for a long time.\n\nNow I said this game has much needed improvements.\n\nLike jobs, they need to be rewarding or graded on how well you did also if you missed something major.\n\nThey should of done a story line or something to make the game interesting, but there really isn't any voices. And if you shut music off it's really really really quiet. Other than the occasional sound of the nuts coming off\n\nAlso the ability to just build a vehicle from the ground up and they paint it cool and sell it. While this isn't technically what mechanic does, this game based on the jobs, isn't technically what a mechanic does either, I never been to a shop where the customer pays for the job first, unless it's routine maintenance.  With that being said it should have the option of adding parts in case there is a bigger problem than originially thought.\n\nAlso there needs to be more parts. Able to fix more parts. More second hand parts,, in much better condition. Since most of those parts are bit of a rip off.  Also the parts cost a lot. I mean A LOT. Oil Filter costing 50 bucks.\n\nThe camera angle is something to be desired. especially in the back of the vehicle. I had a hard time viewing the vehicle. Sometimes the WASD buttons would reverse.\n\n\nHow do you get to bigger badder garages, by doing jobs, that is how. I am not sure how long I played but didn't seem like very long and I got my 2nd garage pretty fast.\n\nChanging oil is pretty routine. But changing oil in the 2nd garage is odd. You have put it in this catch oil pan and you have be very percise where it is or you lose 100 dollars. The first garage wasn't like that you just drained the oil and that was that. Just seems to be a step back, instead of a step forward. And in the 2nd garage for sure, why can't you now fix tires? One of the tires in the game cost either 1600 or 1700 for one tire, I could see if it was all 4 tires. But this is just one tire. Jobs don't pay a lot, so replcaining one tire is really expensive.\n\nOn the plus side of things there is going to be FREE DLC. So perhaps some improvements in game play as well more things to do. While I do reommend this game. I really recommend playing the DEMO first.\n\nHere is hoping the Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is taking the ideas of the fans and making EVEN better than the original.","February 11, 2014","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would also like to say that the tutorial needs some work, for one it should show you where to go to test drive, and diagnostic path a car, because logically you go to the drivers seat of the car for these and niether of them are started from there.\nsome jobs are a little touchy as well wanting parts changed for new ones, so most of the time the used parts shop is usless.","February 2, 2014","true","69.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A shame there's no real option to alter the soundtrack beyond dubstep, quiet dubstep and off but I can live with that. The camera is pretty ♥♥♥♥-ish, but the sound effects are spot on and add to the atmosphere of being in a garage.\n\nIf you don't have much in the way of car knowledge, you might struggle for a while to diagnose the various issues on the car; but that's nothing that can't be sorted with a test drive, trial and error when stripping the car down and as a last resort, Google. Don't let not knowing the difference between a sump plug and a rubber bushing stop you from getting into what is a very pretty game with a solid idea behind it.\nI'd say the asking price is about right, don't expect this game to last you forever and don't expect too much of it. But for what it is, you get a decent amount of game :)","February 2, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A good idea that is well executed, with just enough detail to make a non-mechanic feel as though he's solving simplified real-world car issues, while avoiding making it un-approachable with cumbersome controls or means of interacting with the vehicles.\n\nA good game, I definitely recommend for anyone wanting, well, a Car Mechanic Simulator that's easy to approach.","February 15, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
