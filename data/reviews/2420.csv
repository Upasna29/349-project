Since this is a standalone campaign, if you want multi player, you'll need the Ship. You kick off this first person action, stealth, life simulator with a masked man telling you why he's brought you aboard his ship. Everyone aboard is to murder a specific someone, and look over their shoulder, because ultimately someone will trying to kill them. Its a beautiful premise that might be used better in the multiplayer version, because the single player version forgets about it after the first chapter or so and it falls into a standard game of do this for me and report back.\n\nOn these missions, you'll need to murder people all while keeping an eye out for security and cameras. Other passengers don't care if they see me shoot someone. Its cool. If you so much as have a weapon out in front of a camera, you're instantly arrested and thrown in the brig for less than a minute. Its all an easy to follow green eye and red eye. If there's a green icon, you won't get punished, if there's a red eye you will.\n\nLike in real life, you have needs. You have hunger and thirst which you can die from. If you're thirsty you can't just drink from a sink like a deer on holiday. That's why I'm pretty sure your character is an alcoholic. He needs to sit down at a table near the bar to have a martini. Water doesn't count as hydration. You'll need entertainment and to use the bathroom. Both number one and number two have different meters. Of course if you wait too long to use the facilities you'll just go on the spot increasing the need for hygiene. You can shower to get clean, or the more efficient way is just to use the sink twice. Even if you unload, all it takes is a sink. The last need is the one to sleep. Sleeping aboard a ship with people out to kill you is an interesting prospect, but since this is single player, you're the only killer on board.\n\nYou play as a silent protagonist named Charlie Panther. Your only motive is to get off the ship and there's a bellboy named Jimmy that will let you escape. It'll cost you though, one hundred large. How do you get the money? By doing missions of course. The first series are strict assassinations, murders of other passengers for the bartender. You collect the wallets and purses of your victims then return to the bartender to give him his cut. You can thank him with three different gratuities. Too little and he'll get angry with you. Then from there its stealing items for a wealthy lounge about. He's also got other people either searching for or guarding these treasures, so you'll need to take them out.\n\nAnyone in black is a criminal so its okay if you kill them. You can sneak up on them from behind. If they can't see you they forget about you, even if you just shot at them. Everyone in blue works for the ship itself. They're either security, clerks or nurses. Its a rule to not attack them. Everyone else is a civilian that if you kill them when you're not told to, you restart the chapter or the mission.\n\nSo how do you murder people in the game? With weapons of course. You can't just find weapons, you need to buy them. Even a fire axe on a wall or a pool cue next to a billiard table needs to get purchased for thousands of dollars. Its a way to keep the game interesting. Pool cues, fire axes and prison shivs will always be there. Other items found in dressers and cabinets will deplete. So if you take an umbrella out of a dresser and you die, that umbrella will never be there again. That's why there are weapon lockers. These rare lockers are always full of random weapons to buy. For every weapon you'll see its damage stats, but not range stats. I assume that a katana covers more distance than a scalpel.\n\nThere is more than just simple melee weapons. You've got a few different types of guns like pistols, tommy guns, rifles and even a musket from the 1800s. If those are too easy for you, there are sleeping syringes and poisons that kills a victim in a minute. Those feel more like story items than actual weapons. You can also find items to help you with your daily needs. Things like colostomy bags, energy drinks and food from vending machines if you can't make it to a restaurant.\n\nYou hold all these items in a limited inventory. Anything more and you'll need to store stuff in a closet. The inventory felt over sized at least for the single player game. You can only have four active weapons to equip even if you're carrying eight of them. You can even throw the weapon, which is helpful for taking out goons that have guns.\n\nWith all these weapons, the enemies have weapons too, both melee and guns. Their aim with guns is laughably bad, so just keep your distance if you're faced with someone that has a gun. Then just wait for them to run out of ammo. The enemies are too dumb to drop their weapons and fight. Instead they just keep trying to fire with nothing happening. Since you need to buy weapons, you can't just loot an enemy for their gun or ammunition.\n\nThere is a map that shows you where you are and where your objective is. You can even see icons where everything else is located. I'm happy there's a map, but to be honest my player location felt inaccurate. The game would say I'm in a room, when I was in a corridor.\n\nThe characters that give missions are all voice acted and it enhances the game. Talking with non essential characters results in silly gibberish like the Sims.\n\nThe Ship is set in a vintage era. There are wall cameras, old televisions with rabbit ears. The decor is beautiful and classic. Like a black and white movie come to life in full color. The ship is all one big four floor map with no load times. D deck has the sick bay, brig, museum and several low class quarters. The C deck has shopping and higher class quarters. The shopping felt useless at least in this stand alone single player version. The B deck has a lot of outdoor areas, restaurants and bars. As for an A deck, I can't remember anything about it.\n\nWith all that said, now its time for the negatives. I can recommend this game as a comedy of errors. I can murder someone in front of staff and no one cares. Just as long as I wasn't in the red. It didn't count. I was able to assassinate a person only to have their body fall at a guard's feet and he didn't mind. The masked Mr. X has everyone killing one another, yet you get busted for having a weapon equipped. It is his ship, this is his staff. Why should they care? The only condition is that I don't kill his staff. Rolling pins and claymore swords fit in dressers. People that I had killed were later seen up walking around. Video games use assets over and over again, but I felt a bond to the civilians I had killed, like I wouldn't see them again. The thugs and goons I knew I'd see again. People would go into pools with their clothes on. There were a few graphical issues, like a staircase with no railing when the rest had one. Certain outdoor railings didn't always connect to posts. These are all nit picks, but it all made me laugh when I would have overlooked the same things in other games.\n\nThe bellboy Jimmy said that I needed one hundred thousand before he'd let me escape the ship. Well I had the one hundred thousand and I still had to go through the final two out of ten chapters. Then when I had blown a lot of money on weapons and had less than one hundred thousand, he still let me off the ship when I had finished the game. Its just laughable inconsistencies like this that made the game more fun.\n\nIt was a funny four hours, even if I had to do several missions over and over. While I appreciate the developers making a Single Player campaign, I'm just not sure if I was laughing with the game or at the game.","February 14, 2015","true","4.3"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","35","38","7","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/2420/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","I got this game for $1 on bundlestars - it also came with the tutorial and multiplayer components (install separately). Considering the replayability, I think it is well-worth the price. I have played a game mode on Garry's Mod that was roughly similar to this game (one or two people are "killers," and have to kill their targets while avoiding capture from a "detective(s)." Clues are sometimes given on the identity of the killer). The Ship has SOME elements from that popular game mod, however, do not expect the same game.\n\nIf you like maintaining "needs" (like in The Sims series), Clue-style gameplay, hunting for your targets while avoiding witnesses, and (sometimes) random violence, then you should like The Ship.\n\nThe aesthetics are good - there is enough detail in the scenery and different rooms to make the game world appear crisp and polished. The character models are a bit dated, however, the numerous outfits (clothes, hats, eyewear) and weapons add enough variety to keep things interesting. There isn't any music, but the weapon and other in-game sounds are decent.\n\nThe controls are simple and typical of an FPS. The learning curve is minimal to moderate - the most challenging part of the game will probably be balancing the maintenance of your "needs" while also searching for your targets. It takes a bit of time to get used to the layout of the Ship, however, once you do this, orienting yourself and quickly locating your targets will become considerably easier.\n\nThe tutorial is pretty quick and very helpful in familiarizing yourself with the gameplay mechanics - recommend trying it out first.\n\nI was expecting the singleplayer component of The Ship to simply be any of the multiplayer game modes (deathmatch, hunt, survival, etc) with bots in place of real human opponents, however, I was pleasantly surprised to find an actual "story" mode instead. The story is basic - passengers on a cruise ship are tasked with killing their targets for money, with the "winner(s)" being allowed to leave when the competition is over (aka Hunger Games/Battle Royale on a ship). The missions have a fair amount of variety - it is not simply "kill x," "kill y," however, most of the missions will still require you to kill a target.\n\nThe elevators provide a much quicker route to the different decks of the ship. There are stores where you can purchase different outfits/hats/etc. Many of the rooms are lootable with random items (especially weapons).\n\nTo manage your "needs," you can do things like eat/drink consumables (which can be purchased from vending machines), use the bathroom, wash your hands/shower, sleep on beds/couches/chairs, talk to NPCs, and read books. The feedback is very good, the HUD will always show the needs that require the most immediate attention, and you can press "N" to view all of your needs. When you do relevant things, an up or down arrow will be shown next to the need(s) that your action is affecting.\n\nA green eye icon will let you know when there are no witnesses to your actions. Red icons or camera icons will indicate that witnesses are nearby or that you are in a camera's radius. Taking out a weapon and/or killing someone while you are visible will cause you to be arrested (and jailed). While in jail, you must wait for a certain amount of time before you can continue playing - you also lose a percentage of your money depending on your charges. During your jail time, this is a good time to attend to your needs (you can eat by interacting with the benches).\n\nScoring is based on the money you have in your bank account. It is recommended that you periodically depost your money in order to protect it, however, be sure to keep a few hundred dollars to pay for things like food/drinks in the vending machine (when you can't find any while looting) or even outfits at the stores.\n\nDuring my playthroughs, I noticed that you will sometimes see the AI killing their targets - you can kill non-targets, however, you will not be paid any money. You can also check the weapons list for bonus money rewards based on different weapons you use to kill your targets.\n\nThe singleplayer is fun, however, you should definitely take the time to try out the multiplayer component - if you can play with some friends, it will be especially fun.\n\nIf you like murdering victims while trying to remain anonymous, give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 31, 2014","true","1.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/getschwifty/recommended/2420/","getschwifty","richard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/getschwifty/","146 products in account","The Ship: Singleplayer Campaign! I like it. It's very different from other Source games. You start as someone on a ship where a man named Mr. X is controlling everyone. You have a quarry you have to kill, but you are also being hunted. Seems like a good game. The first part of the game shows you what to kill and how to kill your quarry. After that, you can meet a bellboy that tells you how to get off of the ship for $100,000.  Around the ship, you complete missions to collect money and get off the ship. The story is really nice. I don't think it needs polishing or anything. It's good enough. The story and game feel is nice, but the gameplay falls short. There's nothing wrong with the controls or the movement, but your character has basic human needs. Needs such as sleeping, using the restroom, personal hygiene, and talking to other people. These make the game more "realistic", but it really is impractical. Most of the time, you have to search the ship just to find a chair, or a shower, or a restroom, and it really isn't fun. It takes away from the mission! I'll mind my own business, trying to steal the Holy Grail, when all of a sudden I need to shower. There aren't many things to carry out your life processes on the ship unless you know where to look. I'm not saying these things are bad, I'm just saying that it takes away from the story.\n\nThe Ship is a good game.","June 5, 2013","true","1.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Reading a book is a life necesity. seriously, you need to go through about 10 books an hour to LIVE. I go through maybe 10 books a year and I am indeed alive.\n#2. In the game there's a security camera system called the "Eye of doom" (dumbest name ever by the way) and it makes so whenever you get caught wielding a weapon in public you get arrested (see #3 for my rant on being arrested). This sounds like a cool system and all to add some stealth and timing to the game but here are a few things that pass for "weapons" aboard the Ship: A sewing needle, a ball of yarn, a syringe, a mannequin arm, a pot, a fire extinguisher, a knife (my issue with this one is that it's a steak knife and you're on a rather fancy ship so these are distributed quite often whenever someone orders a dinner that requires a knife).\n#3. what is your grand punishment for getting caught with one of these deadly balls of yarn? THIRTY SECONDS IN JAIL! No joke, 30 seconds and a little fine. Also, the main premise of the game is that the ship is owned by a man who hired all these people on his private ship and then told the passengers to kill one another to escape the ship... if that's the case, then WHY THE HELL DO YOU GET ARRESTED IN THE FIRST PLACE?!?! If this game is about murdering others, and the man who's making you murder others controls this ship and all the crew aboard, then WHY DO YOU GET ARRESTED FOR DOING WHAT YOU'RE TOLD?!? This little logic loop here confuses me to this day.\n#4. when you get hungry, you eat, when you eat, you have to poop (near instantly by the way), when you have to poop you run to a bathroom and poop, when you run to a bathroom and poop you lower your hygiene, when you lower your hygiene you have to shower, when you have to shower, there is only ONE available shower and it's on the bottom floor of the ship way out of the way of any objectives meaning you have to run all the way down there and shower. And after you've done all that walking.... YOU'RE HUNGRY AGAIN!!! This makes progressing really hard.\n#5. If you don't shower every 10 minutes, you get a deadly disease and die. I can personaly tell you from going a week without a shower (I was camping, don't judge) that you can live.\n#6. The voice work is just.... bad....\n#7. When you kill someone, they ragdoll and fly 50 feet.\n#8. There is this song in the brig that annoys me so much. Whenever you go to jail you have to hear it. It's almost like that's the real punishment for being caught by the "Eye of Doom"\n#9. The game has a seperate game just for the tutorial.\n#10. It's just a bad game (that and I wanted to end my list on an even number.)\n\nPlease save yourself some money and never buy this game.\n","June 28, 2014","false","2.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It takes about 3 hours to complete if you don't get stuck anywhere.\n-The missions vary in difficulty. The hardest mission is in the middle of the game where you have to wheel the diplomat around in his wheelchair.\n-I believe the wheelchair mission is impossible on hard difficulty. If you can do it, tell me.\n-The plot makes no sense. Why are there random goons all over the ship working for Mr. X? Aren't they part of the hunt game too? How will collecting money buy your way off the ship when you can just jump on a lifeboat? Ah, whatever.\n\nAlso, the single-player portion is being deleted/consolidated in the near future with the other components (?). So everyone with the single-player should have the multiplayer too? In any event, go play online, not this.\n\nAlso, while I'm at it, the tutorial sucks. It teaches you nothing about combat or stealth, just how to manage your needs.

You will meet characters that do not appear in the MP.\nWhile it is worth playing once, it isn't worth coming back unless you really enjoyed the game. If you liked the MP, this will be at the least, an interesting insight into a more solo play of the Ship.\nThe game sets itself in 10 chapters. If you die or fail a mission, you will have to restart the whole chapter. Each chapter can take around 10-15 mins, so overall the game can be completed really quick. On the otherhand, some chapters can prove very hard and unfair, so expect to fail atleast once and have to redo a whole chapter.\n\nI would recommend this game but only for once, as there's not much to come back for.","August 30, 2014","true","1.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The player is given a series of tasks from an NPC which all involve killing one or multiple people in a variety of ways while avoiding detection. It's a good overview of the mechanics, but as an independent game, there's not a whole lot to it, so I can't really recommend it. Additionally, there's a few mechanical issues on a couple of the quests that can cause game-breaking bugs where you have to reload your save (for example, not getting into an elevator and going downstairs a different way in one circumstance).\n\nI can't speak for the multiplayer game's community at this point, and I suppose it might be worth it for people who intend to dive wholeheartedly into the game so they can have some extra experience when going in, but as a standalone game, there's not much there.","March 15, 2014","false","2.4"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

I am probably just really bad at playing it, but I thought the controls were ill-suited to the task of defending yourself against an AI that knows you're coming. The checkpoint system is a lesser gripe, but it always starts you at the very beginning of an objective, which I found it makes continuing after failure very discouraging.","October 6, 2014","false","1.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Basically, you are taken aboard a ship where you and others must kill each other for survival. Last person standing gets a ticket off the boat.\n\nThe real downside for me is the "Tomagotchi" element. You have to feed, sleep, poop, entertain etc.. all while hunting down your marks.\n\nI would love to play this with just the story and the murders. Lower marks for too much work.\n\nWorth $3.

It is not a particularly fun game to play in itself. The concept is so over the top ridiculous that it makes it a bit amusing though. The gameplay itself is no good at all, you mostly just walk around the ship searching for weapons and other items which can be absolutely anywhere and then do some shooting/slashing/hitting of targets with no AI, while keeping track of your needs and finding food, showers etc to satisfy them. None of this poses much of any challenge or is particularly fun.

The mission system is poorly defined, you can play through a mission and kill 10 or so people or complete a couple mini quest along the way, but if you go to jail or kill the wrong person its reverts as if you never did anything during that npc's mission.\n\nOnly redeeming quality the game has is the developer console and its online play(though about 50% of the commands don't work on a 7 year old game), fun for a pick up match with a buddy.","September 1, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I like it. It's very different from other Source games. You start as someone on a ship where a man named Mr. X is controlling everyone. You have a quarry you have to kill, but you are also being hunted. Seems like a good game. The first part of the game shows you what to kill and how to kill your quarry. After that, you can meet a bellboy that tells you how to get off of the ship for $100,000. Around the ship, you complete missions to collect money and get off the ship. The story is really nice. I don't think it needs polishing or anything. It's good enough. The story and game feel is nice, but the gameplay falls short. There's nothing wrong with the controls or the movement, but your character has basic human needs. Needs such as sleeping, using the restroom, personal hygiene, and talking to other people. These make the game more "realistic", but it really is impractical. Most of the time, you have to search the ship just to find a chair, or a shower, or a restroom, and it really isn't fun. It takes away from the mission! I'll mind my own business, trying to steal the Holy Grail, when all of a sudden I need to shower. There aren't many things to carry out your life processes on the ship unless you know where to look. I'm not saying these things are bad, I'm just saying that it takes away from the story.\n\nThe Ship is a good game.","July 5, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polina_lis/recommended/2420/","polina_lis","Google Chrome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polina_lis/","51 products in account","The Ship: Singleplayer Campaign! I like it. It's very different from other Source games. You start as someone on a ship where a man named Mr. X is controlling everyone. You have a quarry you have to kill, but you are also being hunted. Seems like a good game. The first part of the game shows you what to kill and how to kill your quarry. After that, you can meet a bellboy that tells you how to get off of the ship for $100,000. Around the ship, you complete missions to collect money and get off the ship. The story is really nice. I don't think it needs polishing or anything. It's good enough. The story and game feel is nice, but the gameplay falls short. There's nothing wrong with the controls or the movement, but your character has basic human needs. Needs such as sleeping, using the restroom, personal hygiene, and talking to other people. These make the game more "realistic", but it really is impractical. Most of the time, you have to search the ship just to find a chair, or a shower, or a restroom, and it really isn't fun.

If you're having lack of luck with servers, it might be worth getting this single-player version. The Ship really does have a fantastic story/gameplay setup. It's enjoyable enough just experiencing the rarity of exploring a big ship out in the empty ocean. Even better when random spawning of objects urges you to search carefully and plan your approach for objectives and merely surviving on this pretty but dangerous cruise. In no way can I fault the developer for their ideas and ambition in development.\n\nThe issue here in particular is that instead of being no more than an offline version, it tries to insert a 'campaign'. Despite never having much cleverness in the way of writing and design, it could still have been moderately enjoyable were it not so difficult. Around halfway through, the tasks become frustrating with ambushes that make it almost impossible to complete on the first playthrough of a mission. And that comes not only with low hit points, but also lack of manual/quick-save feature.\n\nWere it fixing most of these things, this single player mode could have been better and more fun by miles. Still can be enjoyable though, if you are willing to endure some frustrations.\n\n55/100","January 31, 2014","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/recommended/2420/","unpieced","Qt Alix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/","356 products in account","I thought the single player game would be as fun as the Multiplayer game (both of them install completely separating, including a 10 minute tutorial that takes up a third space in your Steam Library), but it doesn't even compare. It doesn't live up to arcade mode. It has a good idea that should have built onto the multiplayer mode by giving the player goals and objectives to complete as a way to escape off the Ship everyone is trapped on, but it adds nothing. With very simple shallow gameplay, there's not a whole lot to this game. All it is, is a long string of repetitive tedious fetch quests, running from to one place to get something and then running back to the exact same place you were at previously only to do this two more times. Getting from point A to B is such a chore even, often getting lost and needing to back track because your location on the map isn't accurate. Your pinpoint is constantly in an area beside your actual location, thus disorientating your sense of direction and making you double check and guess where to go. There are other glitches too that hinder your progress, such as elevators not working. There was a guy even who was completely frozen in front of the door I needed to go through, and it was the only door to that area. There were security cameras so I couldn't even hit him, and when I stood back and threw weapons at him, nothing happened. The game registered him as an object instead of a kill-able person. The voice acting is bad, and the animation is really stiff and bad. The mouths barely move when characters are talking, and in the case of the opening cutscene, the characters were reduced to bean poles. They stood there very lifeless, not even moving, and didn't even react verbally or with facial expressions when the antagonist, Mr. X, revealed that they were trapped on the ship and would be forcing the crew members to murder each other against their will. The opening itself was even very corny, as well as how the story line is executed. A good concept, but done poorly. The way the NPC's react to your character is very odd I thought, and not at all realistic. From the very beginning, a bellboy wants to help you get off the ship, and he chooses you instead of all the other passengers because he says he likes the way you kill, which I thought was very strange. The other NPC's, who offer to give you money in exchange for completing certain tasks (so you can afford the bellboy's 100,000$ ticket to somehow get off the boat) seem by no means distressed or even concerned about Mr. X destroying the boat after all the games are done. They just care about making money. Perhaps the NPC's aren't aware of what's going on, but from my understanding by the cutscene, Mr. X had locked all the crew members inside a room to tell them about what he was doing. It seems eerily and very creepy that none of the NPC's care about the disturbing things going on aboard of the ship or that they'll all be killed. Further more, what also doesn't make sense is that the guards will arrest you if you are seen holding a weapon or hurting someone. These guards are stated in the opening to be hired by Mr. X, who explains that he wants them left out of the killing because the uniforms are expensive. Why would you get taken to the jail cell for murdering when that's exactly what Mr. X is wanting the crew members to do? Yes, it adds to the challenge but plot wise, it makes no sense.\n\nThis game is so basic I couldn't wait to complete the first chapter. It was very long winded and filled with back tracking. In fact the entire gist of that chapter was backtracking, backtracking again and oh wait, more backtracking. At the end of it, you need to protect an Ambassador and are thrown three different enemies to kill, but it's unfair because they run to kill the Ambassador who you are behind because you need to push him in a wheel chair. You don't have enough time to get in front of him to kill the bad guys. They always come out of no where, and in the case of the final one, he jumps out with a gun and shoots immediately. It's very hard to react to fast enough, not because of bad reflexes but because the character's movements aren't quick enough. It's unfair cheap deaths, and you will be replaying that part again and again trying to succeed. Over all this game is simple, repetitive, and annoying and not worth playing. I was bored the entire time playing this and couldn't possibly endure another chapter. Skip this game and buy the multiplayer version instead, but even then I don't recommend that game for full price.","May 11, 2014","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That was a long time ago, and I thought why not try the single player out? It could be interesting right? Since the servers are down and this was my only option I tried it out and it is one of the most frustrating single player games i've played in a while. A few other reviews on this go in detail how unfair this game can be; randomly getting caught, killed out of nowhere and checkpoints that make you do a boring mission all over again. The game can be fun but, it has to be done with friends, so keep that in mind if you ever want to play this.","April 30, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RYNOMAN/recommended/2420/","RYNOMAN","RYNO MAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RYNOMAN/","93 products in account","To start off let me say the the The Ship: Singleplayer is an interesting idea, poorly executed...\n\nThe Singleplayer addon to the uniquely blended multiplayer game The Ship is a curious one...with many faults.\n\nThe Singleplayer part of the game (actually it is more of a mod actually) try's to act as a introduction and tutorial to The Ship.\n\nThe opening scene of the game starts with a bunch of captured idiots watching a television in which Mr. X is broadcasting himself. He then proceeds to tell them that he likes to play a game...a game where you shall receive a quarry, in which you must proceed to kill without you yourself getting killed. You receive money for killing your quarry without being killed by your hunter. You earn extra money by killing your quarry with "unusual" weapons (frying pans, syringe, hammer, croquet racket, flare gun etc.). Whoever is left standing at the end is the winner.\n\nOh, and another thing, you have to eat, sleep, entertain yourself, stay happy, stay clean, pee, poop...\n\nIf you don't take care of your "needs" consequences to make things more difficult for you will occur. So for instance if you don't sleep you'll be unable to sprint, and fall asleep at random moments. If you don't eat you will stave and die. If you don't entertain yourself and stay happy, you will commit suicide. If you don't stay clean you'll turn into a pile of dust. If you don't go to the bathroom, you'll either pee, or poop on yourself...or both.\n\nThe Singleplayer addition try's to teach you these basic things.\n\nMany parts of the game seems as if it was created by a third party modder, who wanted to make their own version of The Ship without slaughtering general concept.\n\nThe graphics are the same as the original game and have not improvements whatsoever. Nothing to complain about here, but nothing to be impressed with.\n\nThe sound remains the same, as the repetitive music plays itself over and over and over again...\n\nThe worst portion of the game is perhaps is a annoying voice acting. The characters voices are fake and totally unbelievable. They don't bring life to the characters, rather they bring stupidity and gullibility.\n\nThe gameplay is boring and very simple. The game will set you up in a situations like, where you have to stalk two unsuspecting women (yeah, REALLY unsuspecting) into the bathroom and slaughter them while they are in the restroom...like...duh! Don't freak out cuz there is a guy with an axe chasing you into the WOMENS' bathroom! They don't even fight back either they just let you hack away...\n\nSo the gameplay was a fail. As a game no. As a tutorial, yes.\n\nI must admit I learned a lot about how to play the game though this. Not that I couldn't have learned it myself, but hey, I got the game for free so I can't complain...\n\nOverall Rating: 5/10\n\nPresentation: 6/10\nGameplay: 5/10\nStory: 4/10\nGraphics: 6/10\nSound: 4/10\nLasting Appeal: 4/10\n\nOverall Rating: 5/10","May 5, 2014","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hopped in a server after the promising tutorial to find it was just a death match game. The need for eating/sleeping/peeing/showering didn't have anything to do with the game I played, and I was REALLY hoping for a game where you went on with your things you needed to do while having to watch your back for that guy looking to assassinate you.\n\nI didn't enjoy the game, and after I bought the game and talked to people I didn't find one person who had played it that liked it as well. I'm so frustrated that the game wasn't what seemed to be promised imo. I was hoping for things more in the direction of Hitman, where you can go in and kill someone using distractions. Poison their soup, rig their shower to scorch them, make the statue fall over on them while they slept.\n\nInstead, the weapons remain mostly bludgeoning type weapons.\n\nI'm sure one of the problems is that I joined after the buzz of the game, the servers are slim, the choices of what to play are even less. If you want to try it out I suggest wait until there is a sale. The $9.99 price tag is way to high for a gamble in my opinion.","January 14, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That was a long time ago, and I thought why not try the single player out? It could be interesting right? Since the servers are down and this was my only option I tried it out and it is one of the most frustrating single player games i've played in a while. A few other reviews on this go in detail how unfair this game can be; randomly getting caught, killed out of nowhere and checkpoints that make you do a boring mission all over again. The game can be fun but, it has to be done with friends, so keep that in mind if you ever want to play this.","April 30, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So what's wrong with it? The single player does nothing with all this, you just walk around and do quests in the ship enviroment and that's it. It's like being in an amusement park all alone except for the occasional employee in a mascott costume to point you around to the next attraction. The novelty of being able to explore and manipulate with a lot of objects will wear off quick and you're left with a game that's basically a series of fetch quests with occasional combat or assassination thrown in. And then the game ends, no real build up or conclusion.\nFor all this, the single player portion of the game isn't really interesting beyond the first few minutes.","January 5","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now then to the reveiw:\n\nWow... Just... Wow... XD I wasnt really expecting this one, Im kind of on the fence with this game, but i lean more towards reccomending. Um Its really fun to me, but the story is a bit lacking. So the catagories: Storyline, Weapon and Tool Originality, Fighting, Character customization and generation, And the Overall thought. Without further ado, i give you my reveiw: (heh i rhymed, ♥♥♥♥ing shoot me in the face if i do that again) :D\n\nStoryline: 3.7/10\nThe storyline, While on the boat is quite informative, is a bit lacking on both the backstory of the main protaganist and the other boat...members? The storyline is an important part of any singleplayer game and i was quite dissapointed in it, the gameplay on the other hand... This was the main problem with me reccomending this title but there are so many good things about this game i just couldnt go through with not doing so.\n\nWeapon and Tool Originality: 7/10\nThe Weapons in this game are a bit, How do you say? Well there arent many, but what there are, are so crazy and fun, you barely give a ♥♥♥♥, not even half a ♥♥♥♥, maybe 1/4, MAYBE. The weapon choice in this game blends beautifully with the environment of the time, sometimes (most of the time) oddly placed, but otherwise easy to come accross.\n\nFighting: 5.1/10\nYes i realize im being a bit harsh on this game, considering how much i love this game, but the fighting seems a bit, Stale, if you will, or fake. it looks like theyre acting, and badly, The A.I. in this game however, is wonderful, and i just love it, As well as the ragdolling.\n\nCharacter Generation and Customization: 6.7/10\nThere is NO character creation in this game, But... the generation of the characters is a healthy ammount, while there arent too many models, theres always clothing, accessories, names. I think it could use more, but i love this the way it is so im on the fence, I realize that this game is complete and will never get updates, But i like to dream you little sh- And now for the overall game.\n\nOverall Gameplay: 7.3/10\nWhile this game has missed a couple of marks, the gameplay is really fun and charasmatic, the challenge is great, and the quests are nice and different from eachother (sometimes) and i really do love this game, go and buy it if its on sale, people. DO IT NOW.\n\nThank you SO SO much for reading this reveiw!!\nPOWER TO THE PIGGLEZ <3\n\n(grenda voice activate)\nPIGGLEZ","September 4, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are 10 chapters, and of them, only 2 were challenging. The graphics were not the best, but it did make the game easy on your computer. I was able to run it perfectly fine, and I have a pretty bad computer overall. The game is fun if you can get a basic layout of the ship early enough so that you can collect firearms easily. Bombs, on the other hand, are somewhat hard to come by.\n\nOverall this game is pretty fun, But it's best bought with the multiplayer version as well. Its really only around 3-4 hours of gameplay if you take it somewhat slow-ish. 8/10 game, would recommend to friends","December 23, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since it uses Half-Life 2 client, the main menu will be very familiar for those who played Half-Life 2. The environment is kind of empty in this game, an addition of a lot of objects which can be interacted with will benefit it. You will get tired of this game very soon and the goals you complete there are boring...I would rate it a C-","January 4","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrmayge/recommended/2420/","mrmayge","Defib Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrmayge/","130 products in account","Now, I'm upvoting this game based entirely on how entertaining it is once you get into a game- be warned, dear potential purchaser, that the servers for The Ship are mostly dead and gone. I often boot the game to find one or two games running, with my only filter being a latency under 500. When it is on sale, I reccomend buying a dozen copies and giving them to your friends, because it is a brilliant and fun game when you can actually play it with others.\nYou are given a target and are made someone else's target. You must hunt for your prey while taking care of your character's Sims-esque needs, finding crude weapons, and while avoiding the eye of the security guards/cameras found on some maps.\nThe mechanics don't all work perfectly together, you'll occasionally lose a round due to a guard who shouldn't have been able to spot you or because you couldn't sort through your inventory in time to eliminate the enemy you'd been tracking.\nBut matches keep you on your toes, and completing your objective each round while avoiding your hunter is extremely rewarding, and will keep you coming back (or trying to) for more.","December 1, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am not exactly sure what this game would be considered. It has elements of stealth, action and fps.\n\nIn the game, you are a passenger of a cruise ship that has been taken over by Mr. X, a mysterious figure, that forces you and everyone else on board to kill others on the ship. You initially will think that your goal is to hunt and be hunted as you try and take down your target, but its basically just you taking down other targets, because of reasons explained in the story.\n\nThis game lacks any heavy plot and is instead, do this and kill him basically. If you are anything like me in this game and suck at the melee combat, then the NPCs that are trying to kill you, can make it frustrating. Especially due to the lack of saving during missions. It can sometimes feel very dragged out since you basically walk anywhere. You have meters that keep track of your needs, such as, eating, drinking, sleeping, reading, talking to others, etc.\n\nOverall the game is a decent casual game that only takes a few hours to complete. It has decent graphics, decent gameplay, and an ok story. It also comes with online multiplayer which I will not be reviewing, at least not here or now. I will, however recommend that if you buy this game, it should at least be on a 25% sale.\n\nWith all that being said, I rate this game a 6.5/10\n\n~rhillfake\n\nFor more reviews like this one, check out my game review blog here: www.gonemadgaming.com\n\n3DS Friend Code: 2595-3048-4554 || Steam\Origin\Other: rhillfake || Xbox Live: WasBottlehead99","November 12, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whitetailfox/recommended/2420/","Whitetailfox","Whitetailfox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whitetailfox/","120 products in account","This game (at least the single player portion of it) seems like something that could be good and interesting, all the fun components are in place: a ship with people who have been given motivation to hunt each other down, systems to manage your needs sims style which ensures that you can't just hunker down but have to keep yourself fed and equiped to fight off an attack. So what's wrong with it? The single player does nothing with all this, you just walk around and do quests in the ship enviroment and that's it. It's like being in an amusement park all alone except for the occasional employee in a mascott costume to point you around to the next attraction. The novelty of being able to explore and manipulate with a lot of objects will wear off quick and you're left with a game that's basically a series of fetch quests with occasional combat or assassination thrown in. And then the game ends, no real build up or conclusion.\nFor all this, the single player portion of the game isn't really interesting beyond the first few minutes.","January 5","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It really introduces you to the game concepts without making you feel like you're being crushed by other pro players, which is what a straight jump to multiplayer would have been like.  But anyway, the idea of actually having needs is novel, and actually pretty fun.  Although I do wish random dudes would stop opening my bathroom stall door!  I hit him with a fire axe though, so its all good.   Good game, definitely worth the price.","January 17","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
