I participated in the Pre-Alpha/Beta Testing and believe they need more time to get the basics down before they shipped if off to EA.\n\nI have a long history with playing shooters and started off with S1-S4(including CON) and I have to say that we are playing games in 2015 and I would like to see a tactical third person shooter where its realism is believable. Right now, they are not where they need to be.\n\nThis game is suppose to be a soul successor of the famous title Socom Us Navy Seals, but falls short with many many fundamental problems.\n\nI wouldnt recommend you to pick up this game till maybe about 3-4 months down the road, where I can see the Devs picking up their act and implementing a competitive side to the game.\n\nDetails:\n\nCharacter/movement - The Characters you control are very robotic, very little sway or any fluid movement, when controlling the gun you dont see or feel like your receiving any kick back from the gun. its like the gun was mounted on a rock that can have the ability to move around. Jumping around feels like your on the moon, being able to shoot as if you were standing still or your running through the air. lots of things that your character will get stuck on, like pivots in the ground, rubble that should be easily cleared, or inclined terrain that anyone can walk up on. Your Character doesnt seem to have any inertia, or body weight when moving around and can change direction(strafe or back pedal) on a drop of a dime with no transfer of weight being displayed. your back pedal is the same speed as if you run forward. you cant dive properly and with many bugs with Dolphin Pop Up Animation exploits(sliding off the ground being able to shoot accurately and still be mobile).\n\nCharacters dont feel like they receive damage from anything. Bullets, Pellets, Grenades, or Fall Damage. Character does not slow down when receiving damage untill dead.\n\nMovement Speed is way too fast and arcady to believe you are playing a human character with combat gear and weapons.\n\nThere is no Sprint button, You either Press a button to walk, or you move around at a run/jog speed in all directions. No Ability to put your gun down to sacrifice for top flight speed.\n\nGunplay - The Aiming system is One Dimensional which is point and shoot, There is no general aim or focused aim. There are scopes for the Snipers, but if you have to make a long range shot with a AR or SMG, you will have to scope in with your binocular zoom out and shoot in the regular point and click Classic View). There is no depth in the shooting mechanics, you are set in a battle stance that you are shooting as if you are looking down the sights of the gun all the time(and still are able to move around at jog-running speed in all directions)\n\n- Stances play no role in how you control your gun. Same bullet pattern, same spread.\n\n-All guns pretty much do the same damage, have the same kind of bullet spray, and dont have any feel.\n- Fire Rates and How many bullets the gun has really makes the difference in the game.\n\n-Holding down the trigger will only kick your spray pattern so much till it stops at the top of the cross-hair circle. And it will automaticly return to the original point where you started shooting.\n\nSub Machine Guns can out snipe any gun class. If you want a challenge use the Assault Rifles or Sniper and feel the struggle.\n\nPistols suffer from bullet delay and do very little damage.(Desert Eagle is the pistol of choice because of its different damage)\n\nShotguns are never used because its DMG is based off of how many pellets make contact, and there are no knock downs or staggering effects when hitting your enemy.\n\nGrenades/Throwables - You can only throw at Max Distance or Min Distance. You cannot control or gauge the throw. When changing directions from straight to left or right while throwing makes the item go 90 degrees to that direction.\n\nExcessive Bullet Travel - Long Range I think its fine, but the close range combat feels like if you shoot at a wall or target from 3 feet away from you, the bullet is lagging behind your character and will hit 1 foot behind while you mov at a constant speed in 1 direction.\n\nGame rewards spraying more than burst fire(due to fundamental problems^^^^).\n\nNo Mic Support\n\nIn game Text is displayed for everyone that is playing in your room(dead or alive).\n\nYou have to keep picking your gear at the start of every round.(does not remember your previous load out)\n\n2 maps only\n\n1 game mode set to each map.\n\nIncomplete Features for Demolition Game Mode.\n-Bomb Location in game\n-Which Team has the bomb\n-Which Team dropped the bomb\n-Many glitches in planting the bomb(locks up character, fail to plant bomb and cannot repick it up, cannot cancel a plant and more.)\n\nDoors are inconsistent\n\nSound in game is terrible, cannot figure out where shots are being fired from, where people are walking.\n\nSo.... probably way more problems but I do not see this game developing faster than what we have seen to Pre EA, if we do they still need more time to fix all the bugs that come with each patch.\n\nI see a lot of inconsistency and I believe its lack of true direction and a big division in the community.\n\nIf you want the nostalgia feeling and want to reconnect with a bunch of socom type of player go for it, but get ready for a rough ride with this game.","May 20, 2015","false","236.1"," 199 of 297 people (67%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","67","199","297","12","27"

I actually had a lot of fun playing Factory.\n\n- I have came to the conclusion that the original maps are just bad. In all honesty those two maps are so bad I think it took away from my playing experience when the game launched.\n\n- There is now three game modes..TDM, Demo, and Sabatage..IMO they need to tweak sabatage to play more like breach did in Socom (adding breach points, ect, to make the mode more unique) As of now its basically just demo but the SOF side spawns with the bomb and is the only team that can plant it.\n\n- The shooting mechanics are much better than what I played back at launch of EA. I mean night/day difference\n\n- Grenade throwing has been fixed, the nades no longer shoot off in a random direction. They also added smoke nades, which I do not think were in the game before.\n\n- The guns have a more unique feel now than they did before...meaning the shoot, feel, and handle differently from one to the next.\n\n- Sniper rifles still need work and they need to add the one hitter rifles\n\n- Movement animations are still rough, but they have made some improvements, the jumping looks a little better but still needs work.\n\n\nI will give credit where it is due and in this case they have made some solid improvements. The main reason I say this game is still not worth $25 is because there is only 1 map worth playing (the new factory map). The other two maps are still terrible. If they can get 3-4 solid maps in this game than it might have a chance.\n\nMy only other concern is the player count. This is an online only shooter and each time I have logged in I see less than 20 people online. There is usually only one active room. That is a major concern for an online only game and something to take into consideration prior to buying.","June 12, 2015","false","27.3"," 94 of 132 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","94","132","4","13"

I played them all until the end. So i literally can't even estimate as to how many hours of my life i played them. ALOT. I played Confrontation up until the servers shutdown. I gave SOCOM 4 a shot and was unimpressed. I even tried Mag and played it for a little while.\n\nSo, When i heard David Sears and company were attempting to get backing for a Spiritual Successor to SOCOM i about pooped my pants. Of course i donated and kept my eye on their updates just about daily. Then David left (without saying why.. red flag) and that's where things began to turn for the worst.\n\nAll that being said, in it's current state, i must say that this game feels NOTHING like SOCOM! The mere fact that it is on the PC takes away from a lot of the core values that made SOCOM great. The competive feel, the even battlefield, the teamwork and tactical feel all go immediately out the window when someone who knows much more about PC and possibly even how to decode the game is in the room. The basic stability and protection from all of that was provided by PlayStation and you can feel it's mising on PC. That's not even to mention that some people use special controllers and mouse/keyboards to gain a competitive edge where it used to be that camping in a building with some PMN mines was the way to gain that edge. (Oh yeah there are no PMN mines.)\n\n\nThe shooting mechanics are.... for lack of a better word... bad. Even strange. The bullets travel slower than a nerf gun and the hit detection is worse than I've ever seen of a shooter. And those who played the SOCOMs know bad hit detection when they see it.\n\nI could go on for days about this or that being missing but bottom line. This game is not even remotely close to being considered a "Spiritual successor" to SOCOM and honestly, at this point, I feel like I've been robbed by SoF Studios.\n\nEDIT (July 7th, 2015):\n\nThey recently made the guns work. Kind of. I still got shot yesterday and clearly saw the blood come off me and lost no health. This is an issue that had to do with Network prediction and Hitscan, and honestly, should have been addressed before they EVER released this game to the public. And although it is better than it was, it's still pretty damn broken.\nStill no content updates. Only 2 maps and 1 (and a half) modes. The weapons still have no unique characteristics and even with the new "Gun fix", you can still shoot across the map fully auto at the beginning and get kills.\nI see most of the positive reviews consist of little to no facts and are either asking people to buy just to "support" the cause or they grade from a nostalgia (I miss SOCOM.) perspective.\nStill no mics, PMN mines or claymores. The movement mechanics are still terrible. Jumping looks and feels like a gameboy game. Crouch walking for stealth purposes is useless. Team tactics are non existent at this point.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the new gun "fix" makes the game slightly less annoying to play but overall the game is still bare-bones and feels nothing like a spiritual successor to SOCOM. I know the Studio keeps walking back their promises and saying its early and its unfinished, blah, blah, blah but I've been playing since the Closed Alpha and i can see the progress is slowing to a near halt. Do not buy this game. Your 25$ WILL NOT, i repeat, WILL NOT make a difference at this point. This is not Kickstarter and no one wants to buy a game that has no content or features in the hopes maybe one day it will.","May 19, 2015","false","272.0"," 126 of 197 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","126","197","8","7"

I must ask, what are they smoking? Have that many people truly forgot what SOCOM 1 and 2 stood for and what they were? To say HHour is anything close to those masterpieces of a game is a insult to thefolks who worked on those original SOCOM games.\n\nLets get the facts out of the way on who I am writing this review.\n\nI am a:\nSOCOM Vet (1 and 2 my favs)\nA Kickstarter backer of this project\nSomeone who actually wants this game to succeed.\n\nNow that is out of the way. This game in no way even delivers to my needs and I am their target audience. I am one of the many original KS investors of this project.\n\nWhy should you buy this game?\n1) You have some spare money and are extremely desperate for a generic round based third person shooter.\n2) You have never played SOCOM 1 or 2 and thus do not know how far off this game is from being even in the same ballpark as those games.\n\nWhy you should not buy this game?\n\n1) There is no voice chat in the game at all. No way to be tactical at all with your teammates nor communicate with them.\n2) The grenade arc in the game is atrocious and half the time my grenades go 90 degrees to the right of me without any rhyme or reason.\n3) I constantly shoot at and get shot by my own teammates because the indicator on their head is not only terrible in distance/range but completely useless after a certain further range. Be prepared to get shot at constantly by your teammates. Friendly fire is not in this game and this is probably why.\n4) There is no indicator, icon, map or radar to show who has the bomb in demolition game mode. Have fun knowing trying to play tactically when you have no clue what is going on.\n5) WolfRun is one of the worst maps I have ever played in a shooter. It is Socom 4 levels of bad.\n6) All of the guns shoot exactly the same. The only difference is their names. The sprays are identical for every gun.\n7) The audio is broken and you are unable to tell where shots are coming from. Footsteps are somewhat manageable to hear but also suffer from similar issues. There are no red indicators like Socom had that show the direction of incoming enemy fire.\n8) Sloppy animations. I do not mind these too much but some people do.\n9) You have to pick your weapon each round even if you want to use the same weapon or if you did not die in the previous round? Anyone who played classic Socom games knows that you did not HAVE to pick the weapon you wanted to use every round, you kept the same gun each round unless you changed it.\n10) No PMN mines at all. They were in the Proof of concept yet are not in this paid version. Probably a good thing since there is no voice chat.\n11) Zero tactical gameplay at all. I feel like I am playing with bots who camp.\n12) The price. This is without a doubt the biggest flaw of this game. This game is in no way worthy of a 25 dollar price tag. I would not even pay 10 dollars for it in its current state and I am a person who backed this project.\n13) No stat tracking, no clan support etc. I honestly cannot see this game getting into a competitive gamers heart without these things.\n14) Sniping is not even in the same ballpark as Socom games. Just look up some videos to see the difference.\n15) 2 maps and 2 game modes.....thats all that is in the game. This is not a typo, your 25 dollars gets you 2 maps 2 game modes....\n\nThe game has potential yes, but you could seriously say that about every game on this planet. There are so many flaws in this game right now and it is not worthy of your time nor money as of todays date. Maybe in 6-8 months they will get the product in a state worthy of your time and money but it is not even close to that today. The Socom community deserves more than what this game currently has to offer.","May 19, 2015","false","5.0"," 107 of 170 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","107","170","7","14"

If you were not around for Socom, the marketing team chose to do this for a few reasons:\n\n1) The game was one of the first to utilize VoIP and it came packaged with a microphone.\n2) You played as Navy SEALs in the single-player version of the game and could control your squad with voice commands.\n3) It sounded cool.\n\nThis game is no more tactical than CS: GO or any of your other shooters. Do not go into this game expecting a realistic military simulator. It is not.\n\nThings that need to be added/fixed:\n\n- Round timers need to be cut by 1-2 minutes.\n- Inputs. The drop down list is dumb. You should be able to press a button on your keyboard/controller to override the current key. Also, alot of the input values you select do not save.\n- VoIP. It is hard to have a sense of community when people are constantly talking through static.\n- Grenades need to actually follow the "arch". I also feel like my character loses hold of the grenade mid-throw?\n- Footsteps should be removed. Right now you are put at a huge disadvantage if you choose not to camp a corner in 1v1s. I get it- listening takes skill, but it also promotes camping to an extreme.\n- Sniping needs a lot of work. If the crosshair is on someone when I pull the trigger, they should be dead (assuming I have my crosshairs on their head or chest). We do not need a game with bullet lag/drop or breathing mechanics. Sniping in Socom was a challenge, and it was fun. One of the biggest reasons for this is you could move in the scope and accurately fire a shot. Moving allowed you to balance out the sway as well as outplay enemy snipers in 1v1s. I encourage the developers to closely examine Socom 2 sniping mechanics.\n- Dragunov crosshairs need to be changed. Stick to a simple cross (+) in the scope.\n- Nameplate view distance should be "Infinite" by default.\n- If you can see an enemy through something  you should be able to shoot through it. I have noticed some metal railings with 2ft gaps between them that you cannot shoot through. I understand this game is in early access, but we need to fix the maps we already have before adding more.\n- Fall damage needs to be toned down by a lot. You should not lose half your HP when falling 10ft. Too much realism will ruin this game.\n- Climb option (also Jump to Climb) needs to be added for certain terrain\n- Headshot indicator needs to be added\n- I would like to see SOFs own version of SocomBattles. Maybe make a simple app to use on your phone that has everything you need to start a match vs another clan. For those of you that are not familar with SocomBattles/GameBattles, it was a website that was used to find clan vs clan matches.\n- This may be fixed by lowering my graphics setting, but the "sunshine rays" are extremely annoying in the new snowy Sismis. They make it hard to see.\n\nAdditional Comments:\n\n- Movement speed is spot on.\n- No kill cam is good.\n- Grenade aiming and gun crosshairs are like Socom 2\n- The "gun-up" feature is in this game. For new players, when your gun becomes "erect" that means an enemy (or enemy body) is nearby. Use this to your advantage.","August 29, 2015","true","44.0"," 51 of 74 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","51","74","3","3"

They're trying to cash in on the SOCOM fan base that has been fighting for a predecessor to SOCOM 2 for several years now.\n\nThe game as of right now has nothing good in it.

The problem is, for $25, it is hard to recommend this game to anyone.  Reading through the reviews, they all come from DIE HARD Socom 1/2 fans.  I feel you guys, I miss the old days of intense clan wards and the intensity of a tactical TPS.\n\nThe problem is, this games long term viability relies on SOME mass appeal, a few thousand(MAYBE) hardcore Socom fans are not going get this dev the bankroll they need to really make this game what it could be.  It's going to take new players and new players on STEAM are used to the relative polish of even early access Steam games.\n\nI WANT this game to be a hit, I just wish it went to early access market with a little more patience and polish.

Sure, the game can be fun at times, but there are too many negative aspects to it.\n\nFirst of all, the game is running on Unreal Engine 4. Don't get me wrong, graphics aren't the most important thing to me, but they look very dated. If I wouldn't know this runs on UE4, I would assume this runs on Unreal Engine 2.5  (Also the game crashed multiple times with an Unreal Engine 4 fatal error.)\n\nThe in game voice chat isn't really helpful. It sounds bad and sometimes it's choppy as well. It often happens that shots don't do any damage or get registered due to the bad hitboxes and hit detection.\n\n\nThe movement / controls feel very stiff as well as the animations. There are not many characters and almost no customisation. There is an okayish amount of weapons. Some more characters, weapons and more customisation would be a nice thing though.\n\nThe biggest issue with this game is it's playerbase, it is almost non existant. If you're lucky enough to find people, then only on US servers which isn't that great for european players. Also the small core group that's playing has hundreds of hours in this game, and will give you a hard time as a newbie.\n\n\nBottom line:\n\nIt's not worth the 15€ price tag. The game has potential, but lacks polish, a vital playerbase and content. If you decide to buy it, then get it while it's heavily discounted.\n\n\n\nPS: The devs don't seem to be very active on their own steam forum.\n\n\nEDIT: Seems like some players of the community are completely toxic and will personally attack you if you write a negative review. I also got told I shouldn't even write a negative one, if I don't have anything positive to say about the game.

They added a new map, adjusted the old ones. Weapons are still awful, you can barely figure out where you are getting shot from because the audio is awful, this is with loud guns. Oh and on a weekend during prime hours there was 16 people online. Haha. If you want socom go buy insurgency for $5 and subscribe to the socom mod. More players and a way more polished socom.\n\n\n\nOriginal : Unfortunately I backed this game enough to get the alpha/beta during Kickstarter and I am sorry but this is not a true successor to SOCOM. Shooting mechanics are bad, jumping is awful. Map set ups are bad, both are large and setup very similar. One of the maps the action is taking place on one side of the map because of the awful spawn set ups. There is bullet drop after 50ft. You have to lead your targets after 50ft. Its unrealistic. I played every SOCOM before this. I'd rather play SOCOM 4 over this.\n\nOnly positive is that its early access and the developers can fix it, but they are such a small company and have server issues and coding issues that this may never even happen. Oh and the community backing it, they want SOCOM so bad that they are blind to what this game really is, a pile of crap.\n\nYou want to play a real shooter, go play Counter Strike.\n\nEDIT: I went to my friends list, where there are some Admins/Mods from their studios and noticed that they havent even touched their own game in the past 2 weeks and have been playing Borderlands... just a joke, their own people dont even want to play it.","June 21, 2015","false","23.8"," 57 of 91 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","57","91","6","3"

If you are okay with a barebones 3rd-Person shooter, this may be for you. In its current state it is playable and can be fun at times with a few friends using a third party communication program. Currently there is no in game mic chat, only text. I want to review this based on what it is and not what it should be or will be down the road. I will update my review as I see fit when things become updated. The Dev team has done a good job tweaking and adding small things since the beta began in April. I was not part of the alpha so I do not know what progress was made then. If you plan on helping a great concept continue to strive towards what fellow Socomers want like I do, by all means, get the early access and help contribute. If you are expecting a polished game with many features found in other Full release games on steam, hold off for at least a few months. Check back regularly and eventually I could see this being a good game. With all issues aside with how the game got to this point, I would recommend it if you want to be in a community that wants to see this game succeed. I would overall not recommend it as I feel the price to value is not something I can support. Speaking to people whom were not fans of Socom I would not purchase this until it is more developed. I personally requested that this be delayed for 8-10 months but obviously it was not.\n\nPros:\n\n+Game functions as long as you have a decent PC I would say no older than 4 years old equipment.\n\n+It has glimpses of the Socom Feel if you were a fan. If you weren't a fan of socom, it has moments of intensity when you are outnumbered and/or outgunned\n\n+Round Based best of 11.\n\n+Has tie breakers.\n\n+A decent variety of firearms. Rifles, handguns, grenades, flash bangs, and smokes.\n\n+Can be played with a controller or M+K.\n\n+Patches are released on a pretty frequent basis ( 1 per week during the closed beta ) That may be subject to change.\n\nCons:\n\n-The biggest thing is Lack of Content. 2 maps, 2 game types (elimination and demolition)\n\n-No in game Mics. I use a site called Rabbit for open mic chat.\n\n-Various glitches, nothing that completely ruins the game but you will find them, often. That is the point of Early Access though.\n\n-Lack of overall polish to the gameplay, look and feel.\n\n-Can't switch teams once the game has started.\n\nI myself will play it as I have my Nostalgic Socom goggles on and do like playing it for a little at a time as well as I would like to support it. However I can't recommend this to anyone I know that isn't familiar with Socom. There is just not enough here to warrant $25.\n\nI will write a full review soon.....","May 19, 2015","false","18.7"," 68 of 111 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","68","111","3","5"

There isn't a ton of content and game modes at the current time however they seem to be pumping out updates based on our feedback and are highly motivated to be successful and get this game to PS4. The game looks good and has potential to end up on PS4 and bring back that Socom type game a lot of us have been waiting on for so long. Once the chat and clan support is in the game this thing could be very competitive and fun to play with friends. Admittedly its a little pricey for what you actually get right now as of 5/26/2015 but if you like that 3rd person tactical shooter and want to help bring this thing to its full potential with your feedback I'd say its worth it to get into it now.

It was hard for even Zipper to try and recapture the same formula with their sequels to previous titles, so a totally new developer coming in and trying to do that seemed to be ludicrous. But after playing a few games, I can see the amount of potential this title has. Don't get me wrong, this game needs A LOT of work.... A LOT. But as far as the gameplay right now, there is a solid foundation laid and with the proper fixes and polishes, I really believe that H-Hour can rekindle that addiction that most of us long time SOCOM players are so desperately looking for. SOF studios, you get a thumbs up for trying to appeal to this tight knit community (and sometimes stubborn). I just hope you stick to your word and improve this game the way I know you can.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apockyTawok/recommended/293220/","apockyTawok","a_drunk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apockyTawok/","268 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n====December 28, 2015 - Update====\n\nTL;DR right out the gates.  It's in relatively the same spot it was in 4 months ago, albeit with a new map, an overhauled map, broken mics and a few new weapons.  The "gun balancing" meant making everything but SMGs suck, so if you play, prepare for Mp5 vs. P90, because that's all you're going to see.  With that out of the way, let's dive in to it.\n\nI'm going to repeat what I've said before, if you have a nostalgic attachment to SOCOM, you'll find a few enjoyable moments in this game.  Regardless, as someone who bleeds SOCOM on a daily basis, I still find myself unable to recommend this over Insurgency, which I feel offers the estranged SOCOM fan more bang for their buck, and a more accessible experience.\n\nThe Good\n* Still getting those rare SOCOM moments.  Solid strafe fights occasionally break out between non-SMG users.\n\n* Still plays like SOCOM.  They haven't monkeyed with movement speeds that I've noticed, so this is tight.  Animations still suck.\n\n* Respawn is in, and it's fun, when active.\n\n* I've gotten used to the maps now, and I can say they're up there with SOCOM 1/2 quality.  Sismis has been redesigned, and it has been improved 10 fold.  Same with Wolf Run, big overhaul for the better.  Factory is unchanged, but still an excellent maps.  Temple, the first entry from Technicolor  is another solid map.\n\nThe Bad\n* Their "gun balance" update completely missed the mark, and they've yet to correct it.  Gone are the days of M4a1-SD vs AK, it's p90s and Mp5s all the way down, if you want to stay competitive.\n\n* The UI is still god awful.  I don't even understand how someone can consider little green and red buttons for confirm/reject commands.  Seriously, it just looks lazy and uninspired.\n\n* Server browser still lacks any rudimentary filtering.\n\n* Partial controller support is still partial.  I want a seamless experience, just integrate the damn menus already.\n\n* Still no options to edit your controller settings AT ALL.  Sensitivity, turn speed, accelartion, still not in game.  The default turn speed has the agility of my 90 year old grandmother, while mouse users (understandably) get full twitch speed.  Come on now.  This is a big deal to a game trying to cash in on a Console fanbase.\n\nThe Ugly\n* The community has grown to be bitter and beyond small.\n- There aren't enough players online to fill a single server for 75% of the playable hours in a day.  If you don't play from 8pm-11pm CST, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck for playing a full game.\n- Speaking of full servers, if you manage to see one, it'll be the only active server, so good luck getting in.  Good luck finding another server afterwards, since a second one never gets started, nobody stays logged in after seeing Server A full up.  Several times I've tried to "self-start" (aka play a lobby by yourself or with 1-2 other people hoping people show up), and 1 out of 10 tries will actually populate.  Every other attempt was 30-60 minutes of doing 1v1 and 2v2s at best.  Yawn.\n- The SteamCharts don't lie: http://steamcharts.com/app/293220#6m This game isn't gaining momentum, and it isn't retaining any new players.\n- Angry and volatile members will insult you, and follow you around with Large Machine Guns giving away your position, if you don't bend over to their every will.  For example: I didn't read chat before "Greening up" (accepting to enter the game), and a regular player who will remain nameless, followed me around shooting his large machine gun, screaming profanities at me, simply because I didn't switch teams before hitting the "ready" button.  Needless to say, I left to go play a game that has more than a single server active, since H-HOURs abysmal population doesn't allow for me to go to another server.  There were only 8 people online at the time.  Eight.\n\n====August 30, 2015 - Free Weekend Review====\n\nIf you have a nostalgic attachment to SOCOM, you'll find a few enjoyable moments in this game.\n\nThese are my thoughts as a nostalgic SOCOM fan, and I still wouldn't recommend this game.  Maybe after they get some much better maps and iron out all the little things, but not now.\n\nThe Good\n* I felt SoCrack a few times. There were moments where I was engaged in strafe battles, or defending a bomb plant where I felt it. That adrenaline rush of killing 4 dudes, of winning a strafe fight, or defending a successful bomb plants. Those are good feels.\n\n* It plays like SOCOM. Character speed seemed on point and strafe battles were a plenty. There were also early round grenade festivals, just like the old SOCOMs. Corner camping also makes its return.\n\n* The AKS-74 and M4a1/SD all felt decent. Though it seemed like the P90 (F90 you mah only friend) was the flavor of the month. I tried the MP5/SD for a bit, and it was OK. Though the bread and butter guns are in, we still don't have .50 cal snipers.\n\nThe Bad\n* The overall UI. Good god is it ♥♥♥-backwards and frustrating as all hell.\n- Little green and red boxes for confirmation? That would make sense if your little color coded boxes had some text to give context, or if they mapped to the buttons on my controller I assume they're supposed to resemble. I hate having to switch between my mouse and controller in a single experience. It's just lazy game design.\n- The UI completely ♥♥♥♥♥ the bed when you join a round in progress. Your sticks rotate the minimap (despite you being dead/non-existent), there's a fairy land gun in the bottom left with fairy land ammo counts, and in the bottom right, "Solider Name" with "%" hp left. % is a wildcard/placeholder in programming, and if it ever makes it through to your game/display, you know you screwed up. Also, where is a "you have joined a round in progress" message, letting me know what I'm doing? If you're new to SOCOM, you'd be confused. Not that this is the first or last time you'll be confused.\n- The opaque message pop ups are completely useless when not accompanied with an audio queue. Round over? How bout some music, or "Bossman" saying "Team Win"? When I'm still alive, or watching a team mate, my attention isn't towards the top of the screen, it's in the middle. So your translucent white text doesn't capture my attention enough. I lost count of how many games were "over" and I didn't even see it coming. I just got the BAM HHOUR loading screen, and I'm like "oh, I guess someone won". Where's the final scorecard, announcement of game winner, MVP, or my personal game stats?\n\n* The server browser. Why can't I sort or filter in any way possible? It's little things like this that add up. It should be a day one feature for us to be able to filter out empty/full games, sort by ping and/or map, or actually see "details"?\n\n* "Partial" controller support. I hate this ♥♥♥♥ in every game. I can control my character and make actions with my controller, and that's all fine and dandy, plays decently. But every other control from menus to selecting different weapons, is done with your mouse and keyboard. I hate that ♥♥♥♥. If I'm using a controller, I don't want to have to put it down to use the mouse. It would be just as ludicrous vice-versa.\n\n* Speaking of controller support, where are my sensitivity options? Where are ANY options for customizing my controller at all? Hint: There aren't any. You get one layout (you can customize button for button, but no southpaw/one stick presets), one sensitivity, and one ultra fast, crack addict sensitivity while scoped in. I like low sensitivity with fast acceleration. I didn't feel like I could line up a shot from a distance at all with the crazy ♥♥♥ sensitivity, nor did I feel like I could snap around when the situation called for it. For shame.\n\n* The maps feel awful, with very little thought to strategy, choke points, clash points, or hot zones. I give this a partial pass because I've only played 4 hours, and I guarantee you I didn't know the hot zones for every map in S1 in 4 hours.","August 30, 2015","false","19.0"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","31","47","0","1"

On top of that, now with the workshop they're bringing back all the old maps that you and I grew to love (i.e - Fish Hook!!!!!!!!) Another thing is that SOF is a very small studio (not quite sure how many, but no more than 15) and all the people who downvote this game are the ones who want a game that is identical to the SOCOM games we used to play. You have to give SOF studio ALOT of credit for even listening to their fans and taking the risk on creating a game like this. Yes, the game has some flaws but all of those will be fixed faster than most games that are in alpha stage. Games like DayZ and Arma 3 are still in alpha and they'll continue to be there because the Devs dont care about the community. SOF studios acutally cares about what us, the fans want. So all of the people who downvote this game shouldn't even be considered "Fans" of the SOCOM series or H-Hour game. This game has huge potential, we just have to give it time. Please tell your friends about this game so we can recreate the same joy that we had for SOCOM 1, SOCOM 2, SOCOM 3, and SOCOM Combined Assault!!!!\n\nHAVE HOPE GUYS, WE WILL GET A GAME LIKE SOCOM WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL LOVE!!!","April 19","true","1.1"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","2"

CLEARLY, at least to me, something must have ran off the rails, somewhere. The game is honestly decent, the only thing that it suffers from is people willing to try it, and you can get your money back through Stream. Even if you don't at least enjoy it, Better than chancing your arm on EA's new 'untitled' project, that will cost you $12.69 to see the ♥♥♥♥ing title... Give it a go. You might just thank me\n\nTo put another point forward, I think it does fantastic justice to what Socom was, and is only let down by one thing.

Unfortunately, no game has captured that true authentic classic Socom feel in over a decade... Until now. Yes this game is nowhere near perfect & has a lot to improve on before reaching optimization, hence the Early Access. But even in it's current state, this game does what the previous two Socom titles themselves couldn't do... Capture that feeling.\n\nI haven't stopped playing this game, despite purchasing The Witcher 3 the very same day. With only having 2 maps & 2 game modes, this game still manages to hold my attention like no modern shooter has in quite some time. Video games are simply not made with the "Classic Socom" feel anymore, and that's what makes H-Hour so special.\n\nI highly recommend to get in on the Early Access for $24.99, considering the fact that this game is only going to get better. Whether you're a die hard Socom fan like myself, or someone who is simply wondering... "What exactly is a Socom?" This game represents a specific genre of gaming that seems to have been forgotten, but has potential to do absolutely amazing things for the lost breed.","May 23, 2015","true","35.0"," 38 of 62 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","38","62","0","0"

I have been waiting ever since for a similar experiance. SOF did a great job with H-Hour. H-Hour is a lot of fun, it's responsive, is pretty good looking, and feels like the old games. This is what Socom 3 was suppose to be.\n\nIt's unfortunate that I'm just getting around to playing it after the Early Access was released (a year ago), but small budget projects can't afford advertising which leads me to the only concern I have. Socom fans got to get the word out and get their friends on this game. The community needs to grow a bit because having clans and tons of people to kill was 50% of the socom experiance. If there are ♥♥♥♥ing people who pay for Shower with dad simulator, Goat simulator, any of the Robert Yang games or hell even crappy ♥♥♥ battle field 3&4, or any other shovelware then why the hell wouldn't people play a decent and fun shooting game like H-hour? Don't buy Cod or BF just buy 4 copies of H-hour and hand them out for a good time it's still better then battlefront. If you want a real FPS then go play Insurgency or more realism then Arma 3. But H-Hour is all about mind games and intense fire fights in beautiful 3rd person.\n\nTo the negative reviewers I will dimiss them as either 1. Not understanding what "Early Access" means, 2, Just plain potato aim cry baby rage quiters blaming lag 3. Comparing this game to modern shooters when its a game trying to emulate a 14 year old game and is supported by this community and isn't developed by a major studio (no offence SOF).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KillScreenGaming/recommended/293220/","KillScreenGaming","KillScreen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KillScreenGaming/","54 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEdit: review updated to match the current patch\n\nLet me start by saying that i'm not an old school socom fan, i'm just a third person shooter lover with +50 third person games in the last 5 years on my list both on steam and consoles on my background. So this review is oriented to ppl who couldn't care less about the girls locker room dramas associated with this game and answer one thing: - are you about to buy a good game?\n\nIf you're looking for a finished product or you're just a first person shooter kind of guy, the answer is no. There's no competitive third person shooter that can implement first person perspective and done it right, and h-hour is no exception. Even if you enjoy third person games or third person co-op´s, i still don't believe this would be a game that you would enjoy enough to call your money worth as it is right now.\n\nBut if you dig games like competitive third person shooters this is definitely a game that you should get. What you're going to find here is really solid mechanics that you can easily pull out +100 hours out of it. If you wanna know why, keep reading.\n\nGameplay: - What makes the “sockrak” formula so addicting is how the mechanics of the gunfights work. Basically whoever knows how to strife and keep the aim on the opponent wins. Shooting is not easy though, just by having the cross hairs on the enemy isin’t enough to to register a shot as there’s no aim assist in this game or an aim button that would make your crosshairs any tighter. The first shot will always be to the center, the next ones will go up. You don’t have mid body cover (in third person view at least), making the camper to expose himself entirely and give the rusher a fair fight that never feels unfair. These mechanics are unique to socom, you won't find another third person shooter like this in the market.\n\nYou got bullet drop as well. The camera works like it should for most part, even though it still needs some tweaking. In some corners the camera goes into the model head instead of the top of the head, blocking the player vision. The lean feature seems useless at first, but its definitely a good implementation as it helps you with camera angles as well, but totally useless as a cover system. Getting from prone to standing is slow and sluggish, not always being the best option when in a gun fight.\n\nThe netcode is really good even on high pings. There’s some other bugs like you can’t crouch while reloading, but those are minor things already being taken care of and are not game breaking enough to be mentioned.\n\nGraphics: - Overall it’s a pretty looking game. Game is still not optimize and you can expect a 10 to 20 fps increase in the future. Some graphical glitches here and there but nothing game breaking. No SLI support for now and I don’t know if they ever will.\n\nMaps: - Only two for the moment. Close to perfect and feel updated to today’s standards. I really think the team made a right move here. You get everything you need when it comes too good map design. A good sense were the enemy is rushing, power points, hard to get spots, nade spots to every camping corner, and the usual “left right and mid” route is simple enough to new players. Not being able to use mid body cover just feels right. Whoever is doing these maps really knows what is doing. Thank god they did the right call in not getting this talent wasted in copy/paste work of the old maps (even if they could) and an actual evolution with new updated and tested techniques. Map editor is being consider so that everyone can enjoy despise their personal taste on this matter.\n\nGame modes: - Team death match and demolition. Its would be nice to see more team objective modes, as it makes some equipment being put to use like smoke grenades. Without voice chat and visuals on the objectives, everything’s casual for now. Since there’s no stats online, ppl are mature and friendly for the most part and will not stress you out for not playing properly. Most people pick their servers by number of players not by game type, you will find yourself playing whatever on low ping.\n\nSound: - Guns sound really good, but overall it still needs a ton of work yet. There’s sound whoring in this game. If a player is moving the sound whoring is generous enough for him to be heard across an entire building. The music is just ok, some piano tunes you will turn it off after an hour. There’s no voice chat and only way you have to communicate with your team is by text chat. Without voice chat the team play is not there yet.\n\nServers: - Fast dedicated servers, server list, ping values, recently played players list working.

I am able to use a controller to play this game, and I do just fine in the competitive matches against the best players on the servers. I have very fond memories of my time in the S2 universe. Floating from server to server, playing in breach medleys all night. The clans, the clutches, the people, the gun battles, and the tactics, all of which made SOCOM. Playing H-Hour is the closest I have felt to S2. Honestly folks, the name H-Hour might be on the front but please do not let that fool you.

The game lacks so many basic shooter fundamentals that I can't see myself giving it a thumbs up. I originally gave to the KS because like many others David Sears was the lead Dev and the game was promised to be the successor to Socom 2, but we all know how that went, didn't go as planned.\n\nSo far I have not seen progress that exceeds the proof of concept that was created by David Sears using UE3 which is kind of odd to me being UE3 is supposed to be last gen compared to the UE4 engine, so what happened ? The game is not up to my standards and I want what was promised to me from the KS. It may meet the standards to others here, but not mine, so understand that I'm not bashing, just disappointed in the progress.\n\nI think the over all look of the game may catch a Socomers eye watching the videos, but the game play itself is pretty bad and it's not what I expected considering the game has been in development for 2 years, so please don't start in on me that the game is in EA and that's why it's in the current state of lacking. No excuse in my opinion, should be way farther along.\n\nIn closing, I hope this game does succeed so we all get a Socomish game on the PS4, that was my only reason for donating to begin with. What worries me is the PC gamers will probably tear this game alive and ruin it for guys like me who want a Socom game on the PS4.  I don't want it to die on Steam, but I am not going to sugar coat this and thumbs up the game when I have always been known to tell it like is.\n\nSorry SOF can't do it, has to be a NO.

I love the tactical team-based gameplay which the developer has managed to bring back from the early Socom days on the PS2. These types of games have been far and few between for far too long, and I miss how the Socom series brought people together as a community. Most of the gaming friends that I have today, are from way back while I was playing Socom 2, 3 and Combined Assault on the PS2, and I feel that this game is already developing that same type of close-knit community.\n\nH-Hour is certainly a breath of fresh air from the over-saturated first person shooter market. If you were a fan of such games as Socom 1, 2, 3, & Combined Assault(PS2), Socom: Confrontation(PS3), Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter(Xbox 360 Version), Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2(PS3/Xbox 360 Versions) and Metal Gear Online(PS3), then you will most likely enjoy the heck out of this game. If you've never payed a Socom game before, or any of the other games that I've just listed, then you're in for a pleasant surprise.

I can definitely say this game has big potential. It's not polished to where it should be yet for a retail game obviously, but it's already been refined more than the classic SOCOM games were in a lot of ways. I think 25 dollars is a pretty good price to buy in and eventually get the full retail version of the game and all the content that comes along with that. Most of the people who have supported this game early on put up 4 to 10 times more money than that to see it succeed and didn't mind. It is clearly on the right track to bring an audience back to the tactical TPS.\n\nIn its current state, you might get a bit bored after a short period of playing with the limited map pool, but this will change with more official maps and game modes from the studio and likely also user-created workshop maps later down the road. The in-game menu is a little clunky right now but it gets the job done, just make sure you configure your settings how you'd like before you jump in a game, or you'll have to quit to the main menu to change them.

The movement, controls and maps are solid. It is very promising and, despite the rougher elements, is a lot of fun to play and is by no means frustrating.\n\nCons:\nHit detection, bullet velocity, damage, and grenade AOE are a little unpredictable.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are a SOCOM vet this will feel very familiar and somewhat satisfying. This has a lot of promise. I'll stick with it and provide suggestions. SOF Studios seems very engaged with the Twitch streamers and steam community in terms of feedback. Their Trello board is available to view for those wondering when refinements will be made and additional maps/guns/game modes will be released.

As of this date they are still in early stages, and havent released what i believe is the core of the game. All the complaints on this game are typical of early access games.\n\nThis is the silent socom successor, this is all there is thats left, and will probably be the only one ever made - so if you liked the; hiding in the shadows and waiting for the enemy to breach while using your headset to 'check' if your team is still alive and in position hiding- only for them not to respond - and you start to doubt your hiding spot is safe enough as they come blowing through the backdoor- then this is for you. Though headset support has not been developed, it is promised (though its not like there isnt other options for headset services, this is is pc after all).\n\nThe shooting mechanic is sort of arcadey, where you strafe and dodge while you try to outshoot the enemy in a dogfight- i believe this mechanic is what makes the game stand out, because... its simply fun to do. Maybe not realistic, but fun, and i feel as if we are really fighting it out. And i think this combined with the fact that people hiding have a certain advantage due to the third person perspective, they still give the player who gets "jumped" a chance to show off his skills and outshoot him. There is a certain awe of knowing a player can take out 2 to 3 people based on his skill to maneuver around and shoot it out.\n\nWhat made socom socom was its shootout mechanic, stealth-based approach where camping was expected, and its amazing level design. What is missing is the levels and the great level design, i hope they can emulate the socom 2 maps, draw from what made those maps popular and recreate a new version of it.","May 25, 2015","true","4.6"," 28 of 45 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","28","45","0","0"

If you don't mind that, then get it and enjoy what is already there, knowing you likely got the game at a discounted price and have the chance to play it at a FAR earlier time than those who will wait till the full release of the game.\n\nI've played a few Early Access games before and this game is definitely already VERY enjoyable. I can't say that for some other EA games I've bought, some of which seem to not make any development progress AT ALL. At least H-Hour is already fun, and are updating at a decent/fair pace.\n\nAs someone who was in the BETA program (got it some months before it came to Steam EA) I can say they usually release a patch every 1-2 weeks. They are already working on a 3rd map, and although the development pace hasn't been rapid, it is moving at a decent pace now and significant content should start rolling in over the next few months.\n\nI believe it's worth 25$. Not because I enjoy it already, but because anywhere from about 6-12 months from now there should be enough content to keep people happy, and by that time the price will have gone up.","May 19, 2015","true","17.4"," 28 of 45 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","28","45","0","0"

If you were a fan of SOCOM, then an actual real SOCOM game has been on your wishlist for quite some time. While this game is far from finished and a little rough around the edges, it has a solid SOCOM foundation and can only get better from here. Currently, the game only has two maps and two game modes with more maps/modes planned in the future. The guns work well enough but certainly need more tuning to make each gun unique.\n\nThis game does provide you with a SOCOM feel; more than any other game to come out over the past decade.

Thirteen years later, I am still playing with people I met during my first year playing SOCOM (If my wife gives me trouble, I joke and tell her I met these friends before I met you :)  SOCOM will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nWith the failure of recent SOCOM games and my utter dislike for most "popular" FPS out there, I have been casually playing games mostly for the social aspect with the friends I made along the way.   Until I started playing HHOUR...\n\nFor the first time in a very long time, I got what we like to call the shakes or heart pounding or heart flutters or that frog in your chest.  If you played S1 or S2, you know what I am talking about: your the last guy alive, you already killed one enemy and four more are now on the way to plant the bomb in your base.  You get a little anxiety building. You surprise one and now there's three left.  You double back and check your flank, there he is, got em.  Two left.  You Double back again and check the door in time to see one guy go inside and the other is close behind, you pop out and take him down.  One Left.  You work your way to the side of the door and peak in, looks empty, enemy must be behind something.  You risk it feeling cocky and as your heart is about to explode, you just need the round to end.  You enter, enemy pops out, gun fight ensure and you somehow are still standing while you watch your enemy fall.\n\nWhat I just described happened to me not in a SOCOM game but last Friday while Playing H-Hour: World's Elite.  (If Domtron1 saves his broadcasts on twitch or youtube, you can go check out what I just described, May 15th I believe was when it happened).\n\nThank you SOF Studios for reminding me why I fell in love with with online gaming in the first place and for demonstrating that sometimes, companies do listen to their fans.\n\nI highly recommend anyone and everyone to try this game, just know that it is still early in the development process and is not a fully polished game.\n\nG^","May 20, 2015","true","163.4"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","30","49","0","0"

I won't review based on bugs such as flopped grenades, or no VOIP, because those are staples that will be fixed.\n\nMy major concern is, and has been since I got into the beta (especially after the dev Q&A), is bullet velocity.  The game will not be truly competitive unless near instant bullet velocity (if not hit scan).  Having to lead people is not revolutionary, doesn't make it more realistic, creates too much guesswork, and speeds up the general gameplay which is no bueno from a tactical standpoint.  Strafing to dodge their aim isn't how you win in this game, aiming to the middle of someone's strafe pattern is.  If this issue were fixed the gameplay will improve 100%.

It sucks that the community is so small we all get on at a specific time of day, usually in the evenings after work which is great. I think US as a SOCOM community need to band together and spred the word out. We should all get together and talk to see what we can do to help keep this game alive. The Devs are doing well with updates even tho it does seem they like to take their time. Now all this being said, this game must allow some sort of clan ladder matchmaking system. a ranking system, and proper 4v4/8v8/16v16 classic servers, but that all depends on players... playing lol.

My personal opinion is that they need to do something with way the camera works on death. It leaves you feeling like "what was that??" every time.  Very awkward. Also BADLY needs a respawn mode for people warming up, learning the game, and/or simply to get some more people playing. I'd certainly play a lot more, but I get killed so easily by people who are more experienced and it just isn't fun jumping straight into that. It never was on SOCOM II either. I played a respawn room or two before getting into 1 life/round rooms every night back in the good old days. Some nights I would just want to respwan a bit and that was it. SOCOM II that is the game everyone wants this to be like, right? I think a respawn room would help that.

The map design and game design go hand in hand to provide you with a unique experience, as the maps are made for you to use third person peeking.\n\nThe only cons are a low player population, and some client bugs, but for the most part the play is very solid. The players that enjoy the game keep coming back, as there's nothing really like it out there.","April 24","true","12.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I loved the idea of some developers bringing the days of Socom back after 10+ years.  I pledged during the bake sale.  It was worth every penny.  Even though I now sit hunched over a desk looking at a 21 inch monitor.  It feels like I am playing Socom again and this is only the Early Release!  Its like playing a beta.\n\nThe Dev's keep updating the EA game.  There are a lot of great experienced PC players capturing issues and reporting them to the forums.  The game is Socom playable.\n\nYou got campers, you got runners, clans and even some Germans playing H-Hour.  Watch the feeds on Twitch and judge for yourself.  If you have a PC that can play this game, get your a$$ to the battlefield son, we have a job to do.

If youre into fast paced easy kill streaks/feeds then this game is NOT for you; this is a hardcore slow paced game that requires you to keep in contact with your team and move slowly through the map.  But it all comes down to the gun fights in H-Hour when its down to the last 2 players the 1v1 gun battles can be a rush, just like Socom -- people need to remember that this game is early access and is no where near ready to be released so please do not down vote H-Hour when you havent even given it a chance to succeed with the right support this game has great potential to take off where the Socom series left off, and I cant wait to see where it leads us.

The reason for this particular review is the potential that I see in this game. If any one Remembers SOCOM Confrontation from PS3, then this will bring back memories and hopefully this game will spark some new interest. As far as the gameplay goes YES it is Choppy at times and a little glitchy but playable, So far it is evenly matched and can be really fun. Yes it is early release so I can't be too judgmental on the problems I have experienced. Yes a lot of crashing at the community menu, standard graphic glitches like getting stuck in an area and not being able to move, Throwing Frags is a nightmare because sometimes you see those things fly off to the left or right when they should be going forward. and this one is the worst, NOT being able to see your teammates name over his head and you start shooting at them, it's not until you get close enough that you realize you were shooting at them. I don't want to get too detailed, However, but all I can say is there were a lot of people playing and they seemed to be having the same issues and still trying to enjoy the game. Surprisingly enough I did not get too frustrated from being shot or blown up, You just have to remember that it's in it's early stages and it will get better.\nUpdate 31 May. So I have a few hours logged so far and I can say that the game itself is getting better, perhaps not by much but just enough to make a slight difference, There does seem to be a serious amount of lag between players though, for instance unloading on someone and clearly not missing them but they turn around and within a second they cut you down and subsequently there after take out a few more players, this is to be expected though, but....there are a few players already accusing one another of cheating somehow, I am not quite sure myself but regardless the game is coming along. the character movement seems to be more fluid, smoother and they have fixed a few minor details with grenades.

Most notably missing is voice chat and certain animations. This is about what I expected the game to be at this point and I expect voice and more polish will be added sooner than later.\n\nIn the long run I expect the clan support, analytics, and analytic-based anti-cheat will be some of the last things added perhaps between more content.\n\nCurrently I would value this game near $10-$15. From what I have seen so far I think this game has a much better chance at delivering as close to the promised full experience than many other Early Access games I have seen.

Today’s First Person Shooters (FPS) games have catered to the individual.  Where teamwork is unnecessary and experience points has been allowed to set the tone of the game objective.\nH-Hour brings something not necessarily new, but fresh to the gaming scene.  SOF Studios revives the Sony Socom legacy from the ashes with this “no respawn” tactical shooter.  This game is not for the casual “Lone Wolf” gamer, but the experienced mature gamer.  You will find no respawn, a minimap showing only teammates, no kill cam; and all by design and demand from those who are hungry for the next challenge in their evolving game play.\nH-Hour World’s Elite takes your experience to a whole new level where the actions made by you or a team-member can quickly become the deciding factor of win or lose.  This game will train you through trial by fire to learn how to move more tactically, coordinate with team members to pull off objective goals and bring you a clutching experience that will have you almost as excited spectating your teammates as when your boots are on the ground.\nFight alongside up to 7 additional team mates across intimate maps that provide a “tactical” environment.  Play in one of two game modes (more to come) to accomplish your objective of eliminating the opposing radical force by any means necessary.  With only one life to live each round, you’ll be forced to abandon your solo “run and gun” ways.  You’ll find a complete new way to take the battlefield, and then you’ll find that success will only come from teamwork.  YOLO!\nTraverse arenas that have the look and feel like they were stolen right from Google Maps ™!  Use the terrain and structures to give yourself and edge in flanking, stalking and hunting your objective.   You can still take on your opponents in hair raising firefights, but you’ll find your round short lived most like.  Better to join the ranks of the smart players and dominate as a coordinated unit.\nThis game has been exhilarating from alpha, to beta, and now SOF Studios presents this Early Access edition for the general public.  It is important to note that the game is undergoing extreme development and is far from its final state.  Many might point to this as a down-side.  I beg to differ; I feel that for the game to be this enjoyable at this stage; with many more improvements and content to come…  This game is a solid investment now to get in on the action.\nYou don’t have to be a veteran of the Socom series (pre Socom 4) to become captured by the addiction.\nDisclaimer: In-game microphone communication have now been enabled, but still require more work due to UE VOIP limitations.  Game offers a text chat to work with players without mics, or when mics aren't sufficient.\nEarly Access is by no indication of the final game product.  This game is still under development, but is stable for game play.","May 19, 2015","true","034.5"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","22","37","0","0"

They're trying to reproduce the same feeling as SOCOM but not copy it exactly.\n\nIt's a third person shooter with medium-small sized maps with demolition (like CS:GO), one life per round, and will eventually have ranks, clan battles, more game modes and features of course, and SOF Studios actually read their forum and implement changes that the community asks for. You know how an entire community can get angry and rise up in the forums because something in the game is terrible or stupid? They read that, and generally they adjust it to what we want. That is, MOSTLY. Some subjects, like bullet velocity, remain untouched and are out of whack, yet the company won't address it.\n\nRemember that this game is not COD and it's not Battlefield, and if you come on to the forums wanting changes that resemble those games, you're going to get shut down. Only buy this game with intent on helping it get to full release. Do not make a review and thumbs down the game because you think it's bad because it only has 2 maps and 2 game modes. They'll be adding weapons, game modes, animations, tactical equipment, maps, etc as they grow with your help.

While the list of concerns and tweaks needed are long, DEVs are slowly getting their massive list of must "haves" and "does" accomplished and their pace is very acceptable considering the size of the DEV team.\n\nGame play (in its current state):\nThe game play is very barebones as it currently stands, but the current shell is closely following the SOCOM formula and progress as mentioned above is being made improving the game weekly.\n\nCommunity interaction:\nThe team currently does not have a fulltime community manager or PR representative, while this affects many members of the community because the studios project was crowd funded it is understandable on certain levels. While I would like to see more interaction with the community as a whole I also don't understand the whole scope of the DEV teams other obligations so I will avoid speculation and instead encourage the SOF president to address those concerns on a personal level in good faith.\n\nRecommendation:\nA great idea that I have seen one indie DEV studio do is have a linked twitter account that updates all the work on a hour to hour basis so those who truly want to track the progress real time can https://twitter.com/rustupdates\n\nPositives: (review will be updated as content is added)\n- Overall look is the closest thing to the originals\n- Current weapons are true to the originals\n-Maps resemble original early SOCOM maps (tweaking is still needed to better balance, but that is ongoing and developing overtime)\n-Demolition (while in a shell and first stage)\n-Third person view angles closely follow originals, to include first person view and crosshairs\n-Devs taking community feedback into consideration and making adjustment where needed\n- Progress is being made on a consistent and measureable basis\n-Weapon mechanics are on the right path (to include grenade and secondary weaponry)\n\nNegatives: (review will be updated as content is added)\n- UI needs to be reworked (kill feed, weapon icons, health icons, text chat in game, etc)\n- Animations need to be polished and added (lean left/right, dive to prone, etc)\n- Sound effects need to be tweaked (direction of fire and depth of sound, to include music and dialogue tuning)\n-Line of sight needs adjustment (crosshairs are not true to bullet trajectory path)\n-No (PTT) Push to talk is not in yet (this feature was truly a must need at EA release)\n-Shot indicators (red arrows showing rough direction of fire)\n-Lack of overall available feature set for current stage of the game (more features would of truly helped showcase the games direction)\n-No mini map\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nHHour has that SOCOM feel for what it currently is and with the current pace could be what we are all hoping it will be in about the next 7-12 months. I would love to see a full time PR/community manager added to the SOF team as we did in the past. I would only recommend picking up the game in its current state if you are truly looking to help shape the game or simply want to provide support for ongoing development.\n\nI will continue to ensure that my concerns are projected through constructive criticism so the DEVs have a realistic vision of where their game is potentially heading.\n\nUPDATE 12/19/2015\n\nProgress is still steadily being accomplished, the vision is still on track! Progress has been slower than expected, features that should have been in game are not. The Devs have been more open and transparent in relation towards the games current state, but at the same time key features that would attract an audience are not there still, more experience is needed on the team.\n\n+Maps have been redesigned (wolf run and Sisimus) greatly improving play along with a few more game modes added.\n-Slower than expected development and missing key features that would bring the community closer\n\nSo far HHour is still on track to fit the vision of a true successor to the early SOCOM titles, but the question at this point is will they actually have the resources and time to finish it?","May 19, 2015","true","90.7"," 29 of 51 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","29","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vice_President/recommended/293220/","Vice_President","(99%) Vice_President","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vice_President/","162 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n--UPDATE 5/20/2016--\n\nAs of yesterday mics now work in game and hit detection has been improved.\n\nTL:DR -\nFor $10 it is 100% worth a buy if you can cope with a game in development. Don't miss out on getting in  before this game blows up. Join the SOF Studio forums as well because your voice WILL be heard.\n\n\nOverview-\nAt its heart H-Hour: Worlds Elite's tries to capture that true competitive third person multiplayer experience that so many of us became so fond of back in the days of PlayStation 2. H-Hour does capture that experience more than any other game I have played over the past  years. This however does not come without its flaws. H-Hour is in Steam Early Access and for that reason one must look over some of these flaws as well... the game is in early access. So let's get into the good, the bad, and the ugly shall we.\n\n\nThe good -\nH-Hour captures those moments when you are the last person alive, your palms are sweating and you know your whole team is counting on you. More to this point is that you are severely punished for the mistakes you make. The game forces you to THINK, to outsmart you opponent, after all there is no respawn so when you are dead you have to sit out the entire round.\nH-Hour is VERY team oriented (this has come cons with it that I will get into later) and communication is the key. A few amazing players on your team will not win you the match. Rater a less skilled team that has good communication can win even the most one sided maps.\n\nThere are NO weapon unlocks! Yes that right you don't get rewarded for playing countless hours by unlocking more powerful guns and  crazy kill steaks. Rater you are rewarded by learning the correct way to play the game given the present circumstance. EVERYONE is on an equal playing field from day one... then again some people have been playing for some time and will mow you down. this just makes you want to play more and get better.\n\nSteam Workshop has been implemented! The community is full of talented individuals making maps for the community to download for free. Many of these maps are remakes of the classics that we all fell in love with over 10 years ago. More maps are coming put every week and make up for the few maps that are currently released with the base game.\n\nThe Studio, despite what many will say, is VERY transparent. Sure they keep tight lipped about a lot of stuff but at the end of the day I have never seen a studio so willing to divulge information. Not only that the LISTEN to the community. There have been countless times where the community concerns have completely shifted the dev process (moving to hit scan, workshop implementation, to name a few)\n\n\nThe Bad -\nCommunication in H-Hour is a MUST. Unfortunately at its current state in development the in-game voice chat is subpar. Currently the player base is using a program called discord to chat with each other and it makes up for the lack of in game voice chat but is still an extra step to take.\n\nUser Created rooms need work. We need to be able to set up our own playlists to facilitate with competitive play. I think that this would bring in and retain alot of players.\n\nThe learning curve is steep. Although all players have the same guns and stats the game is NOT easy to pick up and just be good at. This is a partial pro in my mind but many will see it as a con. You will have to lose a lot of rounds before getting you first kill but getting that kill is what gets you hooked. That is what gets you addicted. So stick with it if you get discouraged.\nBallistic models need some tuning. This is a very broad subject and it is safe to say that the studio knows that there needs to be more tuning done on guns and grenades.\n\nThere is also a low player base. The game is fun but EVERYONE likes to play in a full 8v8 room. this leads to people sitting in the main lobby waiting for a room to fill up. There have been countless occasions where I have just jumped into that empty room and it has filled up in minutes. People are wanting to play they are not willing to be a lone wolf. If this changes I think we would see numbers increase dramatically.\n\n\n\nThe UGLY-\nThe hate. plain and simple the hate that this game receives is the most ugly part of the game. People hate on it to just be the cool kid in high school. This impacts every facet of the game. It directly impacts the way the potential investors look at the game. Many of these "Haters" will say that they have no interest in the game but will troll on the forums just to cause a stir. When people start putting out positive videos on YouTube about how they are enjoying the game the haters will post negative information.\n\nIT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE that 90% of these people trying to destroy the game don't play the game.\n\nAll of this hate starts to tear at our close knit community from time to time and its sad.\n\n\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game is on its way to being the game that has been promised to us. It is not there yet and I will be the first to admit that it needs work. BUT the game IS fun! I have meet some amazing people along the way, people that I would consider friends and no game has given me that feeling since SOCOM II. If you want to join the fun the community will welcome you with open arms. We are all very passionate about making this game succeed. For $10 you can't go wrong!!","May 7","true","415.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

If there was ever a game that delivered on giving the player the same feeling of an old game they played (in this case SOCOM), this game is it. I have only played a short amount of time for now, but this is amazing. Its like playing SOCOM all over again. The visuals are better but still have that SOCOM vibe. The character movement is great. The only complaint I have is what everyone is saying which is that there is not enough love for this game and the servers lack players.

But that's why its in early access. For those looking to play Battlefield or CoD, this is not for you. However, for those seeking a SOCOM type game, which is starting to feel more and more like SOCOM with every update, this may be a diamond in the rough... Trust me its rough right now, and as you can see by my hours on record, I haven't spent a ton of time playing... But with every update the developers are getting closer and closer to the nostalgia feel that we are here for. I purposely waited for a few updates to write a review to see if they are dedicated to improving. Right now I believe they are. I give them an A+ for effort even though the game right now is more of a B-/C+\n\nHaving said all that, I recommend that anyone that actually wants a "spiritual successor to SOCOM" support these guys and their efforts because it seems that not only are they the closest so far, but they are working hard day in and day out to get closer and closer. Like I said A+ for effort. These guys deserve the community's support.","July 7, 2015","true","1.6"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","2"

First off just know that I've been playing since SOCOM 1 competitively on socombattles and gamebattles on SOCOM 2 & I consider myself a seasoned veteran who knows what hes talking about. H-Hour in its current state has that SOCOM feel you are probably looking for if you were a fan of the series. Not SOCOM 3/CA or CON but the original feel of a SOCOM 1-2. The game has very limited content and there are quite a few bugs that need to be worked. The content that it does have is all incomplete or not fully polished. It is fun to play once you get the hang of everything. I support this studio and the game because like many of you true SOCOM fans I want to see it succeed, HOWEVER $25 for this is not cool. I would have been fine with this price and had more respect for the studio if they would have made an announcement before EA release and told us the price and why it would be that way at LEAST out of courtesy. If you are looking for a new game to try and play unfortunately I cant recommend this because it is just too incomplete. Save your money and buy something else or maybe wait a while for several updates until this game fills the pants of the price tag attatched. If you are looking for an experience similar to SOCOM1-2 buy this now because there has never been anything closer since SOCOM2 and SOF can probably use all the support it can get(basically invest in a new SOCOM). If the studio doesn't abandon this project and continues to support and update this game the sky is the limit. So much potential but potential only gets you so far. We will have to wait and see what the developers do. Good luck SOF.","May 19, 2015","true","130.0"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

One very important thing thing it needs is an run/sprint button! for the run and gun type like myself its a necessity to not be an easy target for them snipers and beat the campers to there favorite spots. Plus theres more endorphons released when your going beast mode running through a whole team. Second is the hit indication. when hitting or being hit by bullets there needs to be a different sound from the bullet to add excitement and awareness. Mabye also controller vibration would help as well. Also from what i have experienced so for the guns may deliver a bit to much damage as i saw countless one shot leg kills which is just not as exciting as a one on one gun battle that could last 5 to 7 seconds with two players jumping back and forth trying to take the other guys head off! A toogle aim button would be great for quick scoping and let you take a little damage off of 50yrd shots with the 552 and force the player to aquire better accuracy. Alos I know this is a beta but hopefully you guys are gearing toward letting the player add his/her own attach,ents and customizations to their loadouts. Another really cool thing would be to add an optional overthe shoulder view with a left and right shoulder switch button like socom confrintation. (I know its not classic socom but its what i prefered to use in socom 3) I mean it only adds appeal to a wider veriaty audiance, can't hurt~!!!!!! Also dying in this game is a bit of a let down. It would be better to have a bit longer lag period with the camera angle pointing in the direction you were killed from. The human mind always needs closure..lol.. And when "dead" it would be nice to have toggle control in spectator mode. Just another way to keep a player more interested in all aspects of the game! Just to let you guys know the new map "Factory" is pretty cool. Maybe a litte more debri for cover in the middle of the maps would embrace more gun fitting intead of the boring camping players hipocrtitically cant stand! lol and there are a few sets of stairs you cannot run under that should be addressed. I cant wait to play the cool game modes you guys release next maybe breach or crazy new invention but honestly in demo and sabbotoge the bomb explosion need to be more agressive!!! we want crumbling buildings not a pewny pop you get from a black cat at the reservation... and last it looks like your working on it but i didnt have the ability to changer controller sensitivy (way socom should be played in my opinion) but just like any other pc shooter the mouse is just to quick... So thanks for all the years of fun and please keep it coming!!! PS PLEASE ADD THAT RUN BOTTUN SOON!!! oh yeaher and sorry for the misspellked wordes its late.. trying to get my fix on that socrack!","July 20, 2015","true","5.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","2"

I recommend anyone who loved the SOCOM series back on PS2 to buy into early access to support this game as SOCOM's spiritual successor. The price may seem steep but you get all the future content and the full game for this price.\n\nThe drawbacks are similar to any early access game: there isn't as much content. Theres only a couple of maps and gamemodes but what makes this fun is playing as a team or with friends. Don't expect a ton of features and content in this game's early stages but look forward to what's to come. If you aren't a fan of alphas, betas, or early access games you should probably shy away from this until more content is added, but you will most likely have to pay more then.\n\nSo far, after a month of testing I am liking the direction the game is going. They are updating every 1-2 weeks, sometimes more and will continue to with the more amount of players playing each week.","May 19, 2015","true","192.6"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"

I held true to my promise of revising my review. Hopefully the studio will hold true to their promise of making a game for the community.\n\nI don't support the studio or the way they have handled anything over the past 6-8 months. However the game itself is actually playable unlike before.\n\nA full revision of my review coming soon....\n\n\n*Edit*\n\n==Buyer Beware==\nJust so you guys know, the studio behind this project, SoF Studios. Has publicly told it's community (on a twitch stream under the official handle) to downvote the negative reviews. You should really think twice before you purchase this.\n\n==Back to the Review==\n\n\nI played each SOCOM with the exception of SOCOM 4, with 1000+ hours on a few of them. I have been waiting for the day we had a successor to SOCOM come to either the PC / PS4, and when I saw H-Hour I was so excited to see that David Sears was behind the project. However part way through the project David Sears bailed to go to another game development studio, and this game went from being developed on UE3 to UE4.\n\nThis is when the wheels fell off.\n\nThe major issue with this game is you have a gaming studio who isn't interactive / responsive at all to their community. You have a forum moderating team who censors / bans any users who don't have an extremely positive response to the game.\n\nSo here are my positives and negatives.\n\nPositives:\n-A community who has ATTEMPTED to guide the development team as to where we want the game.\n-A third person shooter.\n-User created rooms / lobbys.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\n-Guns need more tuning as this is a military shooter. **BIGGEST ISSUE** (SOCOM used hitscan with instant bullets where as this game factors in bullet ticks with velocity - They've been told for quite some time to change this to no avail)\n-Only 2 maps.\n-Only 2 game modes (one of which is VERY early in development)\n-No Push to Talk communication system yet\n-No minimap\n-No bullet indicators\n-Cross game text chat between teams (not very tactical)\n-Poor interaction between development staff / end users.\n-Extremely poor interaction between forum moderating team / end users.\n-Extreme censorship of feedback.\n\n\n\n3/10 Overall.","May 19, 2015","true","77.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Don't let the negative reviews fool you.\nPeople need to keep in mind this is an early access game that the community helps build.\nWithout the community this game will go no where fast, as it did when it first released.\nDue to a solid handful of players this game has came a long way I will admit.\nBut it still needs a lot of work and tweeks to the overall mechanics.\nWhat I personally feel this game needs is\n\n(Some of which may be in the process of being implemented)\n1. More characters with customization features to help you stand out from everyone else.\n2. Bigger arsenal or weapons with customization features to fine tune your playing style.\n3. The lean should represent what it did in the older SOCOM games, I shouldn't have to put half of my body outside of the wall to lean properly. That kind of defeats the whole purpose of the lean.\n4. The jumping in this game NEEDS to be fixed. It should mimic the older SOCOM games as well.\n5. Hit detection is a must, whether or not it's a hit marker or a thud sound when bullets connect.\n6. I feel as though the characters are not proportional with the maps. And when your in a gun fight it's almost like your trying to throw a needle at a blade of grass. You have to be VERY accurate in this game or you will suck.\n7. CONTROLLER SETTINGS!!! one of my biggest complaints thus yet. A company that is re-building the foundation of a console game yet catering towards PC players. That has yet to make any sort of sense to me.\n\nI could go on but I'm cutting my list short here. I will give this game a thumbs up in my support for it's future development.

There also needs to be Optimizations on the lower end detailed specs. This game definately has a SOCOM look, and the Map designs are good. however there just seems to be  issues currently that stand out, First thing i Noticed was the UGLY yellow writting, Secondly was the UGLY User Interface or UI/ the weapons are White on the UI and the menus Lack. the sound when clicking for servers is bland and ugly as well.  This at a first glance was unnattractive in comparison to todays standards. Animations need more Improvements but once again this game is in early access state. with a year behind this title from its current state, we might be Looking at something that could do decent numbers If the game is optimized propertly and the animations seem to get better. currently jumping feels sluggish and floaty.... as well as prone. i really feel like the character should jump into prone or slide into prone. I also noticed the lean camera seems like it should shift more out as the character leans left or right. The options menu was very Simple which is great for new comers but it also just lacked too much as far a custimization goes. map slows down on factory in the lower tunnels. i notice gunfire decreases but when im out of the area my gun fires at its normal rate when using the SSD. The music repeats over and over as if The music score never was FInished,  the female voice overs are decent but it seems that there is not enough content to be delivered. certain guns make me wish i was able to scope in 50m but nothing more such as the ak or m16a1. but i cant. dissapointing but maybe it will change. overall the game modes allow for some serious addicting gameplay but there is alot of work that needs to be done overall to the base foundation of this title to get players to play.\ni think 6 maps would do this title well with maybe a future map builder for the community/ I think animations are rough especially when switching between prone and stance. camera angle through dores need to be fixed. crosshairs tend to aim at the back of the characters head while running through doors or tight hallway spaces. this could be fixed by having the charact auto switch to firstperson through tight spaces and auto switching to thirdperson once out of a tight space.\nor by having the character become transparent during these scenarios. voice chat needs work and there needs to be clan functionality as well. a jump to climb and jump over rail animation would be nice as well, would i recommend this title. Yes because im pretty sure this company will continue to update this game over time. yes it has more weak points currently than strong points but there is a core foundation here and its addictive gameplay reminds me of my ps2 days of playing socom2 .  buy it and support it. if your a Call of duty fan H hour is not for you. if your a die hard socom fan h hour  is not for you. H hour is kind of its own game with roots from other shooters. i can see this title being on console only if the studio and dev team truly listen to its BACKERS. if the studio intends to make h hour the next big thing then they need to pull out the old socom games and completely use that formula as reference to mimic it the best they can. then only will they pull in new comers and the old die hard vets. was it worth 15 dollars, as of now NO. but im sure it will be worth 30 bucks by the time its finished.","September 16, 2015","true","23.6"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","2"

Last few patches has made this the only game i play. The competitiveness of the game keeps me coming back. If you want a game that will hold your hand this is not it. The game does need more content but the content that is there works pretty well for a EA game. There are a few bugs but nothing like dayz or h1z1. The community is one of the best around. They can be a little tough on the game at times but for the most part they make valid points and the devs listen. If your on the fence about buying the game wait a month and come back.

Early Access so not finished but things get fixed or added often enough to keep me happy. Solid gameplay even if not done. Lots of good maps from the community to play. Just be patient as it is indie and will take time to get finished just like other Early Access titles have. Good part is if you find a bug you know it will get worked on.

The numbers are getting lower and lower each day. The content they add to the game is getting less and less as each patch gets released.\n\nThere is still no in game comunication, and the bullet velocity is still the worst i've ever seen in any shooter. You have to lead targets at any distance, yes any distance. 5 meters away? Still have to lead targets.\n\nThere is no original SOCOM features in the game yet, considering this game is supposed to be the spiritual successor to SOCOM 2, i find this completely unacceptable.\n\nAnd as a side note, if you have concerns about this game and bring your concerns up on the official website you should expect to be flamed and attacked by members of the community who think this game is already perfect. And after the pleasure of this you will be banned by over zelous moderators. It's happened a lot and will happen again.\n\nOn the other hand if you say everything is rosey on compliment them on the terrible job they have done so far, you will be a welcome addition to the forum.\n\nAlso the game is $25. For this you get 2 maps and 2 game modes. Demo mode doesn't work properly either so you actually have 2 game modes of surpression (most kills wins).\n\nThey have no justification of charging $25 for this game when the sound is broke, mics aren't implemented, maps are badly designed, hit detection is horrible, bullet velocity is really bad, numbers are extremely low.\n\nI am currently making some videos showing the true state of this game. Please have a little look before you decide to buy this game. Maybe in a year it will be worth buying but as of now i wish i hadn't payed $45 for this game. Yes i payed $45 for the beta, which is odd as they currently describe the game as being in Alpha? More lies from SOF to try and justify the bad state this game is in.\n\nI will take request of things you want to see in the game so don't hesitate to ask me to record some footage.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXE26KyM29A&feature=youtu.be\n\nEdit - 11/03/2016\n\nGame is still as bad as ever, very poor gun mechanics, still no working ingame mic system, no jump to climb, terrible animations. Technicolour were apparently penciled in to do it but now it's technicolour or some one of that kind hahaha continued lies from the games hierachy, pretty much exactly the same as it was a year ago.

A tactical shooter that relies on teamwork and communication. This game has come a long way and SOF studios is committed to making the best game possible. I have seen that in the process that they have put in place. I can vouch for that this game has recreated that  Socom feeling on more than one occasion. 3 guys left, they have the bomb and it's up to me to stop them. I took out the first two and threw a nade through a window taking out the last one hiding upstairs in the bomb plant site. That was a rush, with palms sweaty and a great sigh of relief when I got the job done.\n\nThat Socom feeling isn't something you will get every round for there are so many variables. It's like a big game of chess. Where do I spawn start? What Loadout? Do I rush and possibly give my life to stop their rush tossing grenades? Or do I take a slower approach and try to pick off the enemy and then try to get around them somehow? This game has all of that.. even in it's early state.\n\nIf you are a fan of the old games and you want this game to succeed, be a part of the Early Access and make H-Hour, a game that isn't like every other shooter out there.\n\n1 lifers unite and g^!","May 19, 2015","true","21.2"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","0"

Still fun to play.  Just shut up and buy it.  What else are you gonna buy for $25.00... a haircut.  Shoot, skip the haircut and buy the game.  Everyone thinks your ugly anyways.\n\n(Update, and I tried to give them time to do anything... I mean anything)  So when I intially reviewed this I may have been in that moment of "yeah this is going to be great. SOCOM!!!."  I think its been about a year, maybe more, and yeah... it's not going to be great.  If this releases on PS4 we're all screwed.  Sony we'll probably take this is a great example of why they should not make another SOCOM cause everyone will hate ii and it will die faster than it did on PC.  SOF will try to tell you they are a small team trying to do it right.  They will try to fill you with lies about how they care about SOCOM and are trying to perserve the essence.  They don't actually care.  It's a big money grab working to capitalize on the void that SOCOM has left.  Don't buy it, don't entertain them.  I feel bad for the people that work for the company (not the ones that took the money and ran but the ones that got hired thinking they were in a truely viable company and will be out a job shortly).  If anyone read my initial review I'm sorry.  I wish I could get your money back.\n\nPoor Points:\n\n*Just about everything\n*The guns suck\n*The player movement sucks\n*Stuiped bullet spray\n*Horrible hud\n*Crappy sound effects\n*Graphics optimization... uhhh no\n*Poor, lackluster try at making SOCOM gamemodes\n*(For all who have played it)  The Captain Morgan stance jump\n*Lies that this is in anyway SOCOM's spirtual succesor\n*Freedom of speech in the forum's is not allowed (the moderators are probably the worst I have ever seen out there of any company and SOF really should be disgraced)\n*I suppose I could go one but whats the point as I'm hoping you got the point\n\nGood Points:\n\nSismis feels like a well designed map.  I think the map maker had the right idea.  If everything else about the game wasn't so dookie I'd like that map.  I think the guy who made the map already left the company and if he didn't... here are my words to you.   Run my friend.

It's been HALF A YEAR since my initial review and pretty much nothing has changed aside from a new map and map tools given to the community. The progress on this title is just way, WAY too slow. I'm fairly certain the game will be dead soon and the devs will move on to something else chalking this up as a first attempt at making games that failed.\n\nI wanted to give this a fair shake, and you can see my original review below but i just can't tell people this is worth taking a chance on when i no longer believe this game is going anywhere but up in flames. It's over. It started off as a great idea with a great lead who jumped ship and left the title to rot. Nothing more to see here.\n\n\n\nThis is a tough one for me. I was one of those guys who backed H-Hour from the start. I've poured dozens and dozens of hours into making videos on youtube to both spread awareness and keep the community connected. I feel this game was released on EA too soon. I've voiced that opinion several times and it got me nowhere fast. But the real question is do i feel like this game is worth your money?\n\nIt depends on several factors.\n\n1. Are you a Socom fan from back in the day?\n2. Are you willing to risk $15 on a potential failure?\n3. Do you care about the personal politics a studio sets forth or community relations?\n4. Are you willing to accept that early access is a rough, ugly, and often long process on steam?\n\nFor me personally, at this point i think it's worth the buy in price. Personal feelings aside for SOF studios... and trust me i have a long history with them and it's mostly bad. But i have to give them credit from dropping the price down to a decent rate, I still believe it should have been that price to begin with and would have saved them A LOT of frustration but i digress...\n\nI have some faith in Kevin and Russ to pull this off, i really think we need to see more maps and a map editing tool for the community so we can recreate our favorite Socom maps and build new ones. I think this is DIRE, and NEEDS to happen soon. I fear for the future of H-Hour, some bad decisions have been made. But i have had some fun with it over the free weekend and i do plan on making a purchase. I recommend the game to those of you willing to risk it, and i recommend it for those of you who view Socom 1-3 as the greatest online era ever created. For the every day casual steam user? Wait and see how it goes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IWAAPL4QyQ&feature=youtu.be","August 28, 2015","false","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game feels like old Socom and is pretty addicting.\n\nI highly recommend the game but if you cannot enjoy the EA development process than I would say wait and see when it is done. It is frustrating waiting for content and updates but that is what EA is, they're still building the game.\n\nThe studio has made changes based off of the community feedback and if they continue to do so I feel it will be a great game.\n\nThe core of the game is there. They still need to add a lot of features and more maps but it's coming along. From the progress they've made since EA release I feel this game is going to turn out very nicely.\n\nIf you ever enjoyed Socom than you should definitely pick the game up.\n\nIf you have never played Socom I'd say to get the game but be patient and take the time to learn the game. It is very rewarding.\n\nIt's not like most shooters today. There is no auto aim, no perks, all the guns are even across the board and it takes some skill to learn and get good. The guns feel nice and you can have some great gun fights that last longer than .0003 seconds. At the same time you can pick someone off with a headshot.\n\nCan be played however you like. Planning and teamwork is key. You can be stealth and camp or Rambo the other team. Depends on the map, the objective and your skills. It is a fast paced arcade shooter when you're up close but if you hold back can be slower paced and stealthy.\n\nReally awesome game play and looking forward to more content.","May 19, 2015","true","889.3"," 26 of 51 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","26","51","4","0"

Which I unfortunately followed for a short time. Those who have been chasing this dream-of-a-game for a couple years now need to understand ONE major factor. This is NOT Socom nor a "spiritual successor" as it was originally pushed for on the campaign. The community has more drama then one can comprehend. I for one am very, very disappointed. Following it from the KickStarter campaign until the release, it seems to me it has been a massive blunder. Sure its ALPHA or BETA. Either way, the game itself is very dull...

This game isn't viable in any way in a competitive scene.NO in game VOICE COMMUNICATION. No stats, terrible UI and HUD, poor menu system, and lack of in game options. Many improved designs have been offered by the community and we haven't seen anything near that caliber implemented by the Studio. They brush off suggested improvements as being to difficult or timely to implement.\n\nFeatures that were highlighted in the Proof of Concept a year ago are still missing from the game. Every community partner that has had an influence from the start of the project has been subsequently dropped by the Studio. They don't know how to build partnerships or leverage the assets they have to improve the experience. Clearly the sign of a mismanaged studio.\n\nMany in the community have been asking for them to address bullet delay since the Beta and nothing has been done in over a month besides removing spray from the guns.

This game is nowhere close to being complete and it is not worth the price tag in it's current state. The mechanics feel very clunky and broken, even for a game that's EA. If you're familiar with the series this game is supposed to success the only noticeable thing is the voice actor who did HQ. The key bindings barely work if at all, the controller support or lack there of is an absolute joke, the sensitivity doesn't work, weapon selection doesn't work (needs to be done every round or it resets, this is a glitch that was prominent on a title this game that was said to success the developers should have known better). In it's current state I do not suggest buying this game, the only people that might get some enjoyment out of it are the ones that want the spiritual successor to SOCOM a casual player that just enjoys shooters will likely fund pure frustration with this games mechanics, and bare bones features. This game is a good 12-18 months away from resembling anything that most people would want to pay full retail price for. That being said, it does have promise and it might develop into something good.

The goal from the kickstarter (originally proposed by David Sears(S1/S2 creator) who is NOT on the team anymore) was to create a true Socom 2 spiritual successor. In many ways they are on track, but in many ways they aren’t. They are still pondering stupid ideas like “Lets put a 50cal in the middle of the map for players to pick up.” Anyone that plays ANY form of competitive game, understands this is a death sentence for eSports. Anything that will create any form of balance issue at any point in the map is game breaking.\n\n******My big gripes. (in no particular order)\n--The gun mechanics are ♥♥♥♥. They literally copy/pasted every gun recoil, stats, damage, to every other gun.\n--There is no form of voice chat in the game.\n--There is no way to tell where your getting shot from. Yes there are sounds, but the game NEEDS the red arrows that SOCOM had.\n--Bullet delay ruins any form of gun fighting in the game.\n--No animations like, at all. The characters run default UE4, they jump by just floating up in the air.\n--The game just feels like it has crap physics. There is no sense of inertia and there is no sense of control over your character.\n--Many others, however they will be addressed as this is EA and I will give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIf you loved SOCOM, keep an eye on this game and revisit it in 2-3 months. If you did not play SOCOM and/or never heard of it because maybe I’m just getting old, then revisit this in 5 months.\n\nBut as of right now, 25 dollars is just out of the question for me to even come close to recommending this. I was a supporter of the game in beta, and I still am. But I care more about the people. And I would be screwing the people to say “Hey go buy this game” when there are so many other things you could buy for 25 bucks. This game is an Alpha stage shooter that deserves NO MORE than 10$ of your money in its current state.\n\nI want this game to succeed. And if they get their crap together, I will revise my review as things get patched and corrected. If the game makes it there, I will even rewrite a recommended review. But untill them I bid you all farewell.","May 23, 2015","false","9.7"," 23 of 51 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","23","51","0","0"

H-Hour was promised to be a game that revived the third person tactical shooter formula that I loved and at the start it was on course to do just that. Unfortunately it has been a downward spiral of lies and deception that leaves me today feeling betrayed, untrusting and scammed by SOF Studios. This is a company that censors its community on the most extreme levels, doesn't hesitate to hide key information from its customers and sadly that's not even scratching the surface. Overall SOFs is the most unprofessional game studio I have ever witnessed. It is no wonder why funding was never secured from any investors in two years and we are left with the empty shell you see today.\n\nGameplay is extremely barebones and lacks heavily in features. Do not expect anything more than a third person perspective that allows you to run, crouch, jump and fire your weapon in the games two maps (yes two), one of which is a poorly designed open linear level. While advertising itself as a tactical shooter the game plays nothing like the series it is trying to imitate. Gun mechanics are horrible and teamwork is impossible due to the game not including voice chat among other basic and simple features. Overall this is as basic as a shooter gets and gives you no reason to play again after your first game is completed. While the one life round based structure is there, each round turns into a boring and bland team deathmatch. Technically the game offers horrible animations, awful sound quality, muddy visuals, numerous bugs and lacks heavily in content. Call it early access but I have been a day one public alpha tester and the progress made has been abysmal.\n\nI do not trust SOFs to ever improve upon the game that is for sale today. Avoid a purchase at all costs until the developer proves they have the intentions and capabilities of delivering the product that was originally promised and begins to treat its paying customers like a professional studio would. As of today there is hardly any game here and what it does is beyond unimpressive. This has been such a massive letdown as a SOCOM fan to write this review. I am also disappointed there are delusional members of the community who are shilling themselves falsely hyping this up just in hopes of the project being saved by mass sales. As a steam user I am disgusted that another game and studio in such poor condition was let into the "early access" program. How a two map multiplayer only shooter with zero features was approved is beyond me.","May 19, 2015","false","8.5"," 31 of 68 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","31","68","0","4"

They recently brought out a 3rd map which is amazing (props to the map maker) but only having 3 maps for an online only game will not cut it. The guns have no realism built into them. The primary assualt rifles sound and imitate sci-fy genre. This game advertises a tactical team based shooter, but with VOIP being added, it is apparent no one cares about it. (I gave early warnings to not put all time and energy into VOIP as well.)\n\nThe cheating/hacking/exploiting has overtaken the game as of Sept. 2015. With a dev on their team openly admitting to the public that this isn't a primary concern of the game, I have lost all interest.\n\nWith the game only able to maintain 16 players at peak playing times on a Friday/Saturday night, the players have become stale and over abusive. Speculation has occured that anyone who dislikes the game and makes negative conditation towards it will recieve harsh punishment from the creators by going to lengths to tarnish your reputation. I found this out first hand when my options to dev test another game became obsolete based on this exact occurance.\n\nThe animations are lacking as well. They are either half broken, or do not work at all. This becomes frustrating in the heat of the battle moments were you die because of these issues.\n\nIf you are a streamer, there is little to no support as well when running into issues. If you are streaming this game you will run into countless issues and problems that seem so easy to be fixed on the dev's side. If you are brave enough and consistent enough, you might bear thru the growing pains to show this game to your viewers.\n\nOverall this game went from full potential, to waste of time and energy. The way the company and development team handles the community and general public is disgusting to say the least.\n\nThis does not earn "The Dudes" seal of approval.","May 19, 2015","false","218.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

At this point I am changing my recommendation to NO. Even at its new price point which should of been the price from the beginning, it is not worth buying. Give this game at least another year, you may see some improvements hopefully.\n\n\nPAST REVIEW:\n______________\nReview from a Development Tester, Closed Alpha and Closed Beta Tester:\n\nI have been playing SOCOM 2 now for 12 years and this game is doing a miracle of a project for the SOCOM community. Being a small indie team is hard and moving assets from Unreal 3 to Unreal 4 is even a greater challenge. The amount of time that has been put into this game before hitting early access has been quite a journey. The future content to this game will make it outstanding and bring back old memories of playing socom 2 with my boys everyday in clan wars and pub stomps. Cannot wait to see what the future holds.\n\nPositives:\n-A third person tactical game on PC?!?! that is not a simulator. OMFG amazing.\n-Unique Game Modes for each map coming in the future\n-User Created Rooms\n-Ranking system coming in the future\n-MLG / eSports support\n-A game driven by it's community\n-Solid constructive feedback from its community\n-Dedicated players willing to put the time in to make this game great.\n-Skill based gun fights.\n-Need to have an understanding of the weapons to kill people efficiently\n-Successor to SOCOM\n-All maps/guns and some characters will be free DLC because they do not wish to split their community. The only paid DLC will be aesthetics like characters, weapon skins and clothing for your character when the character customization is put into the game.\n\nNegatives:\n-Not enough content yet.\n-Movement bugs are a pain to Keyboard and Controller users (they will be fixed of course!)\n-Strafe speed is not enough yet lol (pet peeve of mine)\n-You can move your crosshairs while jumping and falling (another pet peeve of mine)\n-No Push to Talk communication system yet\n-No minimap yet\n-No red indicators of where bullets or grenades are coming from yet\n-You can talk to the opposing team in text chat at the moment (pet peeve of mine)\n-Guns need more tuning","May 19, 2015","false","118.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","12"

It falls under the category of tactical shooters. I thought the game was mediocre. You play as One of Two different teams, either the SOP or Terrorists, you do get to choose a loadout prior to starting a map, but there are only half a dozen maps to play on, and finally, when you do queue up for a random game sometimes you are thrown into a map where you are outnumbered 5 to 1, sometimes you are all by yourself for the entire time. Visually speaking the game doesn't look new, it looks pre-2008, which is weird considering the developers were talking about wanting to release it on the PS4.\n\nI really did try to give this game a fair shake, even though it falls under the PVP litterbox category. Some games that are strictly PVP aren't entirely bad, I mean if a game has a lot of content, variety, some kind of a story to it, then it can rise above it's limitations as a PVP litterbox game and be something interesting or fun. This game is all about body count with little content, so if that is your thing you will probably be thrilled. For the rest of us out there, you would be better off getting Black Ops or Black Ops 2 and playing the multiplayer, at least it will look like you expect a 2014 - 2015 released game to look, and it will have some variety. My opinion save your money, wait until it goes free-to-play, then avoid it and save your precious time for something better.

But sadly ever since they released on Early Accesss all I've heard about the game negative reactions from most of the players who put out money for it on release, causing me to avoid purchasing the game at all.

The ambience track is literally that of an interview on Fox. I'm not sure if that was from the actual server or the game's preference. I shut down all my internet browsers to make sure some video wasn't playing, but I still heard some lady talking about the economic impacts China has on the United States. Seriously. That was weird.\n\nAlso, don't get this game. The designers were inconsiderate to all systems that can't run optimized-for-military-grade-Alienware.

It needs a lot and i mean a lot of work. IT HAS POTENTIAL. However, if they don't fix their game soon it will surely go to ♥♥♥♥.\n\nTo list the problems i found during my playtime (which made me quit as it ruined the experience):\n\n1. this game is 3rd person based and first person, but it shows no gun in first person only the crosshair. Terrible. In addition the zooming in of the "gun" is very weird.\n\n2. Switching teams is almost impossible. You can try, but it has a 3 second timer and then you still dont get in for some reason. This is very frustrating as it doesnt allow you to switch team when the enemy is getting rekt by one player. You cant switch team to help that team. In addition rejoining the same game hoping for a spot in terrorist doesnt work either (game was not full). I tried 30 times.\n\n3. There are maybe 3 gun sounds. It basically has the same gun sounds for every weapon which really ruines the ingame experience.\n\n4.“The original vision of H-Hour: World’s Elite evolved out of the frustrations expressed by gamers and gaming communities with the loss of military shooters that were team based and required tactical skills to be successful. Another of their concerns was the move away from supporting clans in how multiplayer games were delivered. By working closely with the community since our successful Kickstarter in 2013, we have been able to design a game vision that we believe will put control of the play environment back in hands of the community when the full game is released."\n\nThis is bs as far as i can see, because it lacks the very requirements for an average gamer to enjoy it, it lacks so much that i wonder if they even looked any improvements suggested by players.\n\nI hope the devs really improve this game, because even when free it is a waste of time to say it in a harsh way. I hope they work harder on this game in the future and make something of it.\n\n\n\n","August 29, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

I simply tried to take a sniper rifle to ease my way in. Held back at the spawn and tried to zoom in. I couldn't. And then i got killed by some random guy with an MP5.\nSecond time i tried, i checked around all my controls for the zoom key. Apprently for some reason the mousewheel was the way to zoom in. Killed a guy, then i got killed by a person that apprently was also using an MP5(these are two different servers)\nThird time, i zoomed down my sight and held position at spawn. I saw two guys sprinting towards me with silenced pistols. They killed me by simply spamming their left mouse button, their team won afterwards.\nFourth time, I went on a different map, sniper again. Round ended in a tie. I didn't respawn and couldn't. I had no ammo whatsoever(since the game took the ammo from me) and all i could do is run around the map from where i was last round untill i got to the spawn area and i crashed.\n\nThis game is amazingly stupid.

The aiming is horrible, the movement is the same, beta testers are using both mouse and KB and controller, how can you get the aiming right when using both? Plus it`s a PC game, mouse should be their main priority, but it`s not.\n\nSeriously, if you`re sick of poor ports and rubbish PC games because of console dev teams, stay away from this, it`ll have NO support once it gets released on PS4.

David Sear's proof of concept showed that potential, but somewhere between switching over to UE4 and David's departure from the studio, the game lost all momentum.\n\nSOCOM nostalgia aside, this game feels like a basic third person shooter game made by an inexperience development team that is still in a pre-alpha stage of development; at least I hope  it is still in pre-alpha.

But this, for 25 dollars, is a complete joke. 2 crappy maps, horrible gun mechanics, options menu is garbage and key rebinding is a joke. A HUGE dropdown menu listing ALL keys to choose from. I know UE4 keybinding is not that bad.\nThe devs, or apparently Steam moderators (because Valve is lazy) are censoring people that have done nothing wrong, yet they are breaking the actual TOS and have sexually explicit profile pics themselves.\n\nFor a good tactical game, look at something like Insurgency on Steam, which is cheaper. Or look at the Ground Branch Tech Preview (Google Ground Branch) and look at that. It's free, yet it has more potential, has the basic framework for nearly all it's features laid out, has supportive devs who will keep working whether people support it or not, and they realize they need CONTENT, BEFORE going on Early Access. All of this in a free Tech Preview, versus the 25 dollars for this.\n\nHeck, Rainbow Six 3 is still good. SWAT4 if you can get it running, use Evolve or something. Ghost Recon Online if you get in a good group, all more tactical than this, probably more tactical than this will ever be, judging by the horrible lack of content and features/properly implemented mechanics ingame at the moment.\nIn this day and age, you cannot use the "Early Access" excuse. You are charging money for a product, and it has less content than some other EA games even. Look at Killing Floor 2. Look at Insurgency when it was in EA, or Kerbal Space Program when it was in EA.\nEarly Access is a poor excuse. This is not a place to upload babby's first pre-alpha, and charge people 25 dollars for it.\n\nIf the Steam community hub would have loaded for me, I wouldn't have bought this, and could have got another game.\nAs it was, Steam was being stupid and not loading so I took the risk, and am regretting it.\nNow if things completely turn around, I will update this. But looking at the road the devs are taking community wise, and the current state of the "game", I'm just not seeing that happening honestly.\n\nEDIT: The community is also incredibly hostile and apparently hates every other tactical game out there for no legitimate reason.\nSo much for being mature SOCOM "vets".\nAs you may be able to see by my reviews ratings, people hate hearing the truth about things, just like what happened with my Alien Isolation review, getting hate and even death threats.\nI'm trying to protect the consumer here, not cater to peoples fanboyism or biasedness.","May 23, 2015","false","0.7"," 19 of 46 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","19","46","0","0"

The only two things this game has that kinda reminises SOCOM is the sounds, weapons sound almost the same as they did in the old games, and the look, its 3rd person, modern tactical, and has the big ole yellow crosshair. The rest is a big fat miss. Plus I'm willing to bet SOF will not be around to see this through to offical release with all the controversy around them.

I am aware that it is Early Acess but there are too many things that shouldnt be this bad. I played for literally 2 mins and knew this wasa beyond terrible\n\nFor example:\n\nPlayer Views:\n*Here are your views - 3rd person, 1st person with no ADS (and gun is absent, just giant crosshairs), and then a zoom level/scope. But the catch, by default you change the views by scrolling mouse wheel. Scope view is way too restrictive, their "1st person" (quotes because it isnt really a 1st person view) is all around terrible. You lose certain things you should be seeing and then you have a crosshair in front of you (just in case its the first time you played an FPS). How do you screw this up? This is one of the most basic parts of a shooter. You cant even build your levels until these mechanics are at least roughly put together.\n\nCS:GO Ripoff:\nYou go it. Terrorists plant the bomb and the  security forces have to either defuse it or eliminate the terrorists. Sound familiar?\n\nKillcam: In a game like this some kind of killcam would help new players (make it a feature that the player can turn off if they want to). But considering I went prone on a building top, backed into a corner, nowhere near any edge (so far back that I could barely even see a rooftop across from me). and the person who kept shooting me had to shoot through the concrete floor, it wouldve been nice to see who did the shot and where it actually came from. Id like to understand the ballistics in any game but it doesnt seem like this game has any sort of defined ballistics.\n\nCrybabies and "cheaters": Within 3 seconds of asking my first question 4-5 people in the game started telling me to watch out for a few players that they said were "cheating". This usually isnt the case. Its usually crybabies getting rekt and trying to convince others that the person that killed them was cheating. But there are plenty of games I can play where there is absolutely no question about cheating and there are no crybabies. Later!!\n\nBTW, thanks for letting me try it for free. I almost bought this piece of junk when it forst came out!!!","August 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","8","23","0","0"

It needs COUNTLESS tweaks to be compared to the mighty Socom 2 (Or even the lesser game socom 3 / CA). It is still in alpha so these tweaks are to be expected.\n\nShould you buy it ?\n\nYES AND NO: This will depends on what you want and your level of patience.\n\n-No because its not actually fun playing a game that is supposed to be a close resemblance of another game but currently FARRR form it. While playing this work in progress you will be consiantly comparing it to the great game its trying to be that already exists. That really ruins the experience.\n\n-YES because you will be supporting the possibility of this game being GREAT and a true subsistute to Socom 2.\n\nIn short; Its a gamble.\n\nEither spend the money and have 1/10 of the fun you thought you would have playing it...\nOR\nSpend the money and play a little but KNOW in the back of your mind you are investing in the future possibility of the developers achieveing what they say rather than the current gameplay of the game.\n\nPersonal note:\n\nPlaying this game for the 8+ hours on steam made be miss the old game to the point where I acrually broke out my Playstation 2, Socom 2 and download Xlink Kai using the very simple tutorials they offer to get myself up and running.\n\nPlaying Socom 2 over xlink kai is the ultimate experience. (And free if you still have your system/game) If you are using a HDTV you can purchase better component cables to make the game look that much better.\n\nSocom2 has a 720 x 480 option so it looks good on a HDTV.\n\nAlso , if you are using a monitor you can buy a hdmi adapter for your PS2.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nIf you are looking for that Socom 2 fix, just play the actual game like the true die hard fans.\n\n"Simplicity is the key to brilliance"\n","June 14, 2015","false","11.7"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","0"

It gives the players an idea of what the graphics will roughly look like in the final product and allows you to shoot some people along the way.\n\nFrom what I understand, they had this game nearly completed with many more features and animations to the point of being a fairly finished game, but it was using the Unreal 3 Engine.  Now they are in the process of taking what they had on the Unreal 3 Engine and converting it to the Unreal 4 Engine, which isn't as simple as copy pasting.  So this is the current state of the game we are able to play, the beginning of this conversion.  So there are currently a lot of features not yet in the game that were in the Unreal 3 Engine version of the game, they took a slight step back to take a bigger step forward.  But it will take more time, clearly.\n\nThe game may not currently be worth the money for the gameplay in the current state, but I would argue that if you are a socom fan, it's worth the money for the support and funding so they can get the job done, because you can easily see and feel that even in this shell of a game, socom is in there, it has huge potential if it reaches its final state.","May 20, 2015","false","3.5"," 14 of 36 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","14","36","0","0"

I am sorely disappointed with the progress, the censorship of the community, and most of all, I am disappointed in the gameplay.\n\nThe gun mechanics are all messed up, the characters seem out of place in their surroundings, the hit detection is off, server setup is odd, animations are missing, no ability to climb, no jump to climb, player count is non-existent and most importantly, it doesn’t look or play like the game it tries to associate itself with. And worst yet, it’s on PC and doesn’t have any clear road to PS4 anytime soon as development has been frozen and the Studio is out of money.\n\nThe foundation is broken and cannot be repaired.

Worst maps I have ever seen.\n\n\nWeapons: weapons are all shoot and pray, the only gun that shoots straight is the M16, pistols can kill you from across the map, weapons on H Hour shoud be best desrcibed as "pure randomness"  med to long range gun fights you could close your eyes and have as good a shot at killing someone, then someone gets a random headshot and both are wondering what just happened, that's H Hour, all the guns have no spray patterns at all, all the weapons are garbage, dont use a controller or you will be forced to deal with pushing the trigger button more then once( yes you read that right how do you expect anyone to play a game where you have to push the trigger button 2-3 times before a bullet comes out , what a joke,Spawn and spray across the map and you'll probably get a lucky random kill or at least take half of someone's life away, heck use a pistol and shoot someone across the map, tactical i know right lol, bottom line weapons suck. Grade F-\n\n\n\n\nAnimations: looks like a stiff robot, bottom legs kinda move , upper body doesn't move, jump and it looks like Mario Bro. you float and slowly come down all the while your legs keep a moving, get hit in the face with a grenade, do you die, nope you slide 10 feet in one direction and keeping going worst game Ihave ever played in my lfe.\n\nMy closing remarks are this if I was Sony i would sue you for slandering Socom's name, this game is not Socom , and is a disgrace to the Socom name, the end.","June 1, 2015","false","279.7"," 17 of 45 people (38%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","38","17","45","5","2"

I hope that SOF can overcome the many problems this game has. I'm not a PC gamer, but I did purchase this game because I'm a huge socom fan. So far, the only thing similar between this game and socom is the fact that it's a 3rd person shooter. My pc struggled to run this game, so I haven't played much, but instead I watch a lot of other people play on Twitch hoping to see improvements, but I haven't seen enough. This game was advertised as the game that would bring back the old tactical socom feel, but from what I've been seeing and experienced, it plays much more like a run n' gun call of duty, only in 3rd person. A lot needs to be done, the character needs to move more smoothly, which includes better jumping, climbing, and diving animations, and there needs to be some breach and extraction added. I also think the guns feel too similar, I remember back in the socom days, there was a huge difference between an STG77 and an F90, and you could feel it, but you just can't feel the difference as much in this game. I think this game has a chance, but needs a whole lot more work before I would consider buying it on PS4.

I do not know what is their -problem exactly, but it is clear their heads are shoved up each others asses because they are not making any usefull updates, they just act like 12 year olds and add what ever sounds cool.\n\nClassic shooter ruined by dolphin divers, grenade spam, imbalance, and people sniping literally from entirly oppisite sides of the maps with pistols and sub machine guns.  The grenade spam is so bad you can play an entire game and the only thing you will see is the explosions from grenades.   It is horrible, they have a huge AOE and do a ton of damage.  Also there is literally no reason to have lethal grenades in the game in the first place.  The developers are not trying to create a competive game they are just doing what ever they think sounds cool so unless your developing this game, its not for you.","July 10, 2015","false","1.1"," 11 of 33 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","11","33","0","0"

Suffice to say I was excited for the release of a socom tribute game.\n\nFort Five Dollars later of support, a management shift, and then being permitted access to the beta later, I'm hardly inclined to say it was worth it. This game shouldn't be anywhere near early access release in its current, laughable state of a game release. I was willing to be patient when communication between the community and player base was as crystal clear as it was some time ago. Now? I can certainly say the mask of controversy, lack of complete 'hook' in the current state of the game, and the overall lack of a community I feel as attached to in comparison to when H-Hour was still in the making and the website forums were rife with activity, life, and excitement, I can say that I've uninstalled the game. I'm not looking to reinstall the game.\n\nMy experience with this game is a regretful one.\n\nEDIT*\nSince my aforementioned review was, upon actual personal review, was lacking in true commentary on why the game is actually so lackluster, I'll divulge a little more into it for people to understand.\n\nGame Mechanics:\n1) The in game Menu is a total joke. You'd think that's one of the first things you get right when making a multiplayer game, but, I'm not a game dev.\n2) Hit Detection and Gunplay: Obviously this is a beta and all of what you see is still in development. However in the state that the means of actually shooting people to accomplish the goals in the game, it's in a state that at the open beta's initial beginning, was a laughing joke of an unplayable state. When I played the day prior to writing this review? I had a feeling of that it hadn't really improved. This to me is evidence the game should have remained in a private Alpha stage a lot longer.\n3) Character Animation: Still feels clunky. But, again, Beta. This is in an acceptable state for the time being.\n4) Server Balance: There hasn't been a single instance of where I've found a means of the game balancing players on teams. It's all been done with the players. Of whom I've found to really not to enjoy the concept of fair play, and in some cases, I've found servers running where one side simply is stacked with players and they just play the objective and absolutely wreck anyone who pops on the opposing team. This escapes my understanding, but, I'm sure someone can inform me/you the reader.\n5) The Player Base: I must say that I'm not too terribly impressed with what I have experienced. Besides the real fallout of the community, I don't really have many positive and memorable experiences with a good portion of people that play the beta currently. Nor, on the forums, do I feel the same sense of community, eagerness, and tenacity as it was pre-management shift. All in all, after really thinking on it, it's not something I wanted to be a part of.\n\nIn conclusion: This game really should have stayed in the closed Alpha stage a lot longer. There should have been considerably more development time. I really felt that there was a lack of clarency between the Developers and Playerbase on multiple occasions. All in all, at this stage in the game' development and the state the community is in, I simply cannot recommend it.","August 9, 2015","false","1.3"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","8","27","0","0"

The game is not worth buying in it's current state though regardless how much I originally backed it for, it's not presently worth $25. It should be $5, MAYBE $10 at this stage due to the truly incomplete status of the game. It contains 2 maps, 1 weapon and a handful of incomplete animations. Despite being on Unreal 4 engine the maps are very small and contain very low resolution textures. Also what's up with the crosshair? It's so large you can't even make out the target you're aiming at. The entire HUD is unfinished and the shooting mechanics have lots of network lag due to unfinished netcode.

Player movement, balistics, sound, modes, maps, etc...  It falls short in every category.  Now yes this is an "Early Access" review, but it's been out long enough to earn a fair opinion.  The game is missing the basics, the essentials, it doesn't have that "Socom Feel".  I don't want to sit here and bash it to death, let it die with honor.  Gracefully bow out.  No sense in kicking a mule.\n\nIf it had the classic gameplay or just that feeling of a Socom game I would rate it much higher, but honestly it plays very stiff.  The animations are sub Playstation 2 era.  If you can't even get the animations, or player movement to feel like a Playstation 2 game then something is wrong.  I don't want to hear about costs, and time consuming crapola.  If you can't make a game, don't promise to make a game.\n\nThe tactical 3rd person shooter genre is not an easy field to enter into.  Not that there's serious competition, just that it's so hard for developers to seemingly get it right.  Even Zipper Interactive(creators of Socom series) failed miserably with Socom 5.\n\nI give SOF an A for effort, but an F for execution.  The game is a drag to play, and with the player count at 22 at the time of this review, that's enough evidence to support my claim.  If it was at least decent people would be playing it.  Unfortunately practically no one is playing it.  I tried my best to enjoy it, but it's just not there.  This early access imo is just an attempt to grab some cash, and put out a PS4 version.  Honestly I don't see it being worthy of a console release at all.

Even maxed out in native resolution.","August 10, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","6","24","0","0"

But instead I was handed this game, and I promptly shut it down, The game has a weird control scheme, It relys heavily on "Lone wolf tactics" When I would prefer it having an actual TEAM Based effort. Then comes the server issues, The game has the majority of it's servers hosted in places were the ping is DREADFULL. I couldn't even play the game without having constant stuttering from server lag. In its current state, I recommend the devs add a First person/Third Person option to it. As this game is more  FPS than an TPS.\n\nMy verdict is: Do not get untill fully finished, In this current state it lacks a feel to it. Just feels like an average TPS that has horrible settings and Server issues. Please wait untill they finish it. Untill then, Do not buy.","August 28, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","3","18","0","0"

This game belongs on console / PS4 not this BS.
