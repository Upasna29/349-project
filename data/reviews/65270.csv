"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jianhouzi/recommended/65270/","jianhouzi","Jian Hou Zi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jianhouzi/","1026 products in account","At first glance this game looks kind of boring, and when I first looked up game play videos I found a 20-minute video of pounding concrete blocks with a sledge hammer, which made this game look almost as exciting as Duke Nukem Forever.  But then I found out about the explosives missions and decided to give it a try.\n\nI had hours and hours of fun playing missions over agin just blowing things up in different ways!  I think my favorite mission was the clock tower; if you pack the explosives just right, most of the structure goes skyward and then it rains bricks for a while afterward.\n\nThere is some strategy to the explosives, however.  In some missions you have to avoid destroying the wrong structures while others require you to avoid making a big mess.  (Or, just for the fun of it, you can go ahead and blow everything up and fail the mission.)\n\nThere is a variety of missions with different structures and different tool sets and objectives.  I found the frontloader and dumptrucks difficult to use because when you're trying to scoop up the debris it doesn't clump up nicely into the scoop, and then when you're hauling the debris, it's feather light and can slosh out of the container like water if you stop too quickly.\n\nAfter completing all the missions you can replay the older missions with any tools or vehicles you like (including the explosives) and unlock special tools like the repulsor gun.\n\nThis game also supports user content, and you can download some add-ons from the developer website, including a rocket launcher.\n\nAnother fun thing you can do is edit the tool properties files and increase the explosive power of the explosives!\n\nOne problem I had with this game is that the mouse cannot be inverted, but I eventually got around that by using SakasaMouse so that I can properly pitch foward when I move the mouse forward and pitch backward when I move the mouse backward.","December 3, 2013","true","16.9"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","27","28","5","0"

But I wouldn't have thought it would be legal to not recomment a game that gave me the strange satisfaction of driving an excavator (digger) into a Chimney stack and having to sledge hammer your way out of the rubble.\n\nPros: Rather good physics. Simplicity - only having to point and click at an object to damage and destroy it. C4... 'nuff said. Final mission is pretty cool to watch the result of your labours... Basic damage (i.e: large chunks, not detailed wall damage)\nmight seem bad, but man is it time saving. Very strangely satisfying.\n\nCons: Slightly boring at first and the airport missions can be tedious. Too short. Maybe to repetative for some.\n\nRating: 9/10 - Highly recommended. Please make a sequal with more missions and more diversity.","July 19, 2015","true","18.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You make the choice on what you want to use some missions (some missions are limited like no explosives), but trust me its NOT your typical go place it here then make sure you run to this spot, you place it where you want and if you want to go crazy with every explosive you have then your free to.

I've come back to it to give it a propper review. It seemed like my first review was a little harsh and didn't give much information on the actual gameplay so here goes:\n\nOh wait, I can't play the game. It doesn't support Eyefinity, Surround, and even when trying to play at 1080p, the game stretches because it seems to think it still needs to render the FOV that three screens would require. Games should NEVER look to the OS to see what resolution the game is running in. They should only use the user defined resolution as a reference point.\n\nOkay, so if you're planning to buy this game and you have more than one monitor connected and they're set up in a display group, this game is not going to work. If you've ever tried to play Metro 2033 with more than one monitor, you'll know what I mean.

There's 2.49 euros worth of fun in it, so thumbs up.\n\nThere isn't a whole lot of content - a couple hours and you'll be done. Some of the missions are boring, especially the ones where you have to transport rubble. The missions where you get to use explosives make up for that though. And killing buildings with a pickaxe and jackhammer is quite satisfying.\n\nA lot of the missions can be cheesed in some way. For example, there's one where you have to take the top floor off of a building and make sure as little rubble as possible falls on the sidewalk. You're supposed to carefully destroy it with the long-arm jackhammer machine.\n\nInstead, I used the machine's arm as a ladder, went up there myself, dropped as many explosives as I could, and blew up. This won the mission as the floor was gone and all of the rubble was in a fast expanding cloud of debris up in the air, and therefore not on the sidewalk. Still, how can you *not* like that?\n\nA strange negative is that there's no way to set your mouse sensitivity, and by default it's SLOW.

On many levels, it's really well-made. The equipment and vehicles are detailed and some of the controls are complex and will take a bit to get used to. The missions are straightforward, don't require anything overly complicated and the tutorials are adequate enough to give you a good understanding of how to use all the machines. I have only one main complaint and that's that the physics need a tweaking when it comes to hauling debris in either your loader or the dump truck. 2/3rds of your hauled materials will bounce, unnaturally, out of your loader's bucket while moving. The same thing applies to your dump truck. Acceleration and deceleration is very herky-jerky and the materials you're hauling will violently shift around and spill out on all sides. I also stumbled upon  another physics bug where, using your jackhammer, you can turn oil drums into projectiles, causing them to instantly break apart solid walls.\n\nOverall, the game's worth the 10 bucks. Who doesn't like breaking or blowing stuff up? It doesn't appear the developers have done anything with it in a couple of years, so it seems unlikely they'll address the physics problems mentioned above. They're aren't game breakers... they just cause some frustration and eye rolling.","May 28","true","44.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes it\'s fun just doing it by cutting out the weakpoints with a jackhammer and watching it crumble, plus moving around debris with the loader and bulldozer reminds me of playing in the sandbox with Tonka toys (I live close to Minnetonka so maybe that\'s not a surprise). It starts becoming a little bit mindless and can be repetitive but the feel of it is just fun. It\'s a shame GIANTS and Focus haven\'t made some revamped version of this like they have with Farming Simulator.","May 31","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
