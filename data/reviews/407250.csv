"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReZzz88/recommended/407250/","ReZzz88","Boaty McBoatface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReZzz88/","88 products in account","This ♥♥♥♥ing game...\n\nWhilst the idea of pes online is really good, and can be fun, at times, the whole way the management/team building side of game has been executed, is terrible.\n\nPros -\n\n-Football game and in my opinion better than Fifa 16\n-Fun when it works\n-The players everyone knows and love really do feel like your playing with the real life version, as opposed to fifa.\n-Building your team and using certain players really has meaning\n-Tackling is better than fifa\n-Controls seem better than fifa.\n\nCons-\n\n-1 single track in the game - ONE.\n-Establishing connections\n-The free agents randomly give you one player, that is generally really bad.\n-Agents you can buy for 10000 coins randomly give you a player, so building your dream team is a bit of pot luck...\n-Saving up coins is REALLY REALLY slow... if you can even save.\n-Player contracts only last for 10 games and god forbid if you have a team of decent players, as the renewal cost is crippling and far outweights what you make from playing matches. 1 match will make you around 1000-1500 coins (but you'll probably have to renew one of your contracts, so you actually lose money)\n- Your formation and playing style is dictated by the manager you have. If you have one manager with x formation, you cannot tinker it to how you like. You cannot make your own custom formations that you enjoy playing with. You are locked in the formation of the manager you have (although you can buy new managers...if you can save up the money LOLOLOLOL)\n-Terrible goal keepers, who cannot save.\n-Terrible AI\n-Cheating AI\n-Cheap losses\n-Players who will lag you out to win\n-Players who will quit the match forcing it to be void meaning you wasted a match contract for every player on your team.\n-Being offside about a million times in a game.\n-Being blatantly fouled and play not being stopped.\n-Players never getting sent off. I've played 28 hours of this game now and i've not seen a single player be sent off.\n\nThe list goes on. This game is a bit of a p1ss take and the rewards you gain from playing are so low. I'd assume they set them low to force you into paying for the premium currency.\nYou'll find you get stuck in a loop of playing a game, making a minimal amount of money, usually renewing a contract of a player - losing you more money. This makes making any coins to build your team (which is completely random) a MUCH slower process - REVISED its seriously slow.\nAlso, it is entirely possible to not be able to play if you have released your terrible players and you have contracts up for renewal, but cannot afford to renew, and you dont have players to replace in your main squad....\n\nEDIT: I played most of the night tonight. I started with 4000 coins and won about 70% of my matches. I have finished the night up now with just over 5000 coins. All the money I made was spent on contracts - My team has 8 black ball players. The cheapest renewal I have is 2300 - for 10 games. My R. Carlos renewal is at 3000 coins. I've not been able to buy any decent agents because all of my money goes on these damn contract renewals.\nThe money you earn and the coin sink for renewals is completely out of sync. It is 100% geared to pay to play/pay to win. The system really needs to be looked at, as the constant contract renewal really hinders the experience of trying to build your own team (Which you can't really do as the ball rewards are completely random)\n\nThe core game play is fun, if not frustrating - with players sometimes staring at the ball, running straight into the opposition, not passing in the direction you wish, but I personally prefer it to Fifa 2016.\n\nI will still grind away at it though. If you want to go away with 1 word describing this game it is GRINDY. Really, really grindy.\n\nThe cons outweigh the pros for me. Im close to finishing playing this. I've always played more pes than fifa, but am a fan boy of neither. After more though I will probably be playing more fifa 16. Whilst the gameplay isn't quite that of pes, its team building, menu refinement and the fact that is isn't a terrible port, make it a better choice. It also isn't a terrible port, like the full version of pes2016 (which i wont be buying)","April 16","false","29.1"," 66 of 90 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","66","90","8","1"

I wouldn't\nThe Goalkeepers are incapable of doing ANYTHING at all.\nCongratulations to Konami who succeeded in making the most frustrating, awkward football game in existence.\n\nTo be fair, occasionally it's a fun game until someone shoots from 40 metres and your goalkeeper ♥♥♥♥♥ himself. He is literally unable to catch anything. If you are lucky the goalkeeper ends up fisting the ball away to your opponents striker, who then scores easily. Sure, most of the goals in this game look hilarious, but you aren't amused if you lose 6:8 because of two hilarious goals in overtime.\nSoo you get the ball from the striker and want to pass back to your goalkeeper? Playing it safe and stuff?\nWell TOUGH ♥♥♥♥: I happened to score 6 own goals like that.\nMost of the time the game feels like giving you a little more control than your standard football manager. But just a little. Every game I had a feeling I could just control when I pass, shoot and tackle. But not where the pass ends up etc.\n\nSooo, basically fix basically everything then you got a good game here. Or another idea, instead of PRO Evolution Soccer, call the game Sunday League Evolution Soccer, this would add a lot of realism to the game, without doing much work.\n\nThere are a lot of other problems, but the negative reviews tell you pretty much everything you need to know, go read them. Everyone who wrote a positive review was bought by Konami, I am sure of that.\n\nI wish I had rather played 8 hours of Shower with your dad simulator, than playing this excuse for a football game.\n\nNow excuse me, I'll destroy every Konami game I have ever bought.\n","May 8","false","8.3"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","17","25","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0Bennyman/recommended/407250/","0Bennyman","0Bennyman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0Bennyman/","718 products in account","PES...Oh PES. A game with so much damn potential but with some issues here and there that cause quite a few problems from the collision detection to the goalkeepers. But the game does SO well in so many other parts such as the commentators, here's how fifa reacts to a goal. 'And he shoots...Oh and he scores!' Here's how PES reacts to a goal. 'AND IT'S MANDUSVIC'(However you spell his name) '...AND HE SCORES! ONLY 1 GOAL BETWEEN THEM, GAME ON!' So much energy it makes conceeding feel pressuring and scoring even more rewarding.\n\nThe Animations are also something of a key difference between PES and Fifa, Fifa lacks so much that PES offers, from the beautiful little touches to the lunging in, but of course this comes at a price due to the goalkeepers reacting to slow most of the time and conceeding easy goals.\n\nHow well does the game run? Well my laptop cannot run BF4 yet this game runs almost perfectly on lowest settings and it doesn't even look bad yet so if you have a poor machine then still give the game a try since it's free.\n\nSo is this like Fifa World? No, this actually is PES 2016 just with only My Club.\n\nThis or Ultimate Team? Well I've played UT for the past 5 or so years and the only 85+ player I've had is Suarez, after just starting the game and opening 1 special ball of my own and 1 FREE special Ball I got John Terry and Carlos (95 Pace, 95 Kicking Power)\n\nConnection? Well I played an online game and the game lagged constantly, eventually, though I was winning, the game realised how bad the connection was and called the game off voiding everything instead of waiting for one our connections to give out and give the other person the win for having the better connection. This was probably down to me using WIFI or it was just our connection but I am glad I don't have to spend 20 more minutes hoping for the game to end.\n\nAlso the game gave me free Gold, EA doesn't know that word.\n\nThe MyClub feature also has training which improves your players and means you don't have to buy better players nessesarily.\n\nThe matchmaking also actually pairs you against players or your team level, so no Wayne Rooney and Sturridge up against Pele, Messi and Ronaldo with Bale and Neymar on Wings.\n\n--Conclusion--\nPES My Club is a brilliant free to play game that you should definitely try out. I can see PES becoming something great if Konami keep trying. Definitely try this out as it is a great game! I may actually buy PES 2016. Though I reccommend offline play against the computer unless you have luck playing online.\n\nP.S. I hope for this to be on consoles and be a regular thing and not just a 1 time thing since this is what these games should be not £40 games with Microtransactions though unlike Fifa you can actually get good players...","February 4","true","3.6"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","33","57","2","2"

Now you can.\nThe base idea is good. Let everyone play myclub so more people will get into it and pay for coins. I have no problem with this, since the game can be played without actually paying for it, however the progression is extremely slow. The main problem I have is the game itself. It is bad, just like the full version. Playing against the cpu is ridiculous, playing against other players is frustrating due to the random nature of the game, lag, and unfair playing methods. It seems that there is not a single server near Hungary as I always have serious lag issues. My players react like they are on weed or something. This game is fun until there are harder cpu teams to beat in a cup where you are not allowed to lose, or got beaten by other players via luck or other stuff in an important competitive fixture. Goalkeepers and defence personell are all re-tar-ds. They are making obvious mistakes even when they are rated 80 and above. This year pes gone full fifa in terms of railed goals delivered by the cpu. It can easily score 2 or 3 goals in the last 10 minutes from basically nowhere while doing nothing the whole match. If you play with others then there are the cheaters and the buggy useless defense.\nGetting players, managers, renewing contracts and stuff are strictly designed so if you do not pay you will just get along. Basically one time contract extension gives 10 matches. This is around 500-700 gp for a lesser player (below 70). That means that I pay him 50-70 gp per match. I get around 1600-1800 after a victory, and only 600-800 after a defeat which means that if I do not win with this weak team then I would not be able to renew even their contracts, let alone the bigger players who need more than 2000 for a new contract. If I play with better players there are better rewards after matches, but only slightly, with about 10-25% bonuses which is not enough to pay the players. I basically need to grind with a bad team and using up the poor free players' contracts.\nAlso, load and connection times are really bad. Every time there is a menu change the game exchanges data with the server which is taking too long and occuring too often. And of course there are occasional disconnections and lag problems too.\nYou can always say that when a game is free, there is no place for such harsh criticism, but when something is so grindy and has terribly bad connection like this one then it is not worth neither your money or time.","February 23","false","25.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

FIFA World sucked on tech. level but it was what I was looking for. It's not available anymore so Konami has a chance. But it looks like it's not going to be as good as FIFA.\n\nGameplay is absolutelly the same as the one you can find in "big" PES 2016, but here you get multiplayer mode based on making your own team (and prob. some singleplayer stuff too). Sounds like a dream, doesn't it? It does, but it's not a dream. As far as gameplay is okay, rest is bad. Making your team really sucks. You can't buy players you want to buy. You can buy "balls" which contain random player. It means you can't really make your dream-team because you can't choose players.\nEven worse is tech. level of this game. Interface is terrible. It takes hours to find simple things. Another thing is connecting. Everytime you click something game needs to "check network enviroment" and connect with PES servers. Okay, it can't take long... but it does! I spent most of almost 10 hours just on waiting for connection with Konami servers.\n\nTL;DR If you want Fifa UT, don't expect much.

For the most part, the game is well thought out; despite having minor issues with graphical resolution sizes which can cause a lot of heart ache. As of exact, further complications on the games end haven't been revealed (yet) because of my diminutive hours played. The pros that I have collected are of a slightly higher quantity compared to the negatives. Firstly, it must be made clear that the personal reward and satisfaction gained is reasonably substantial, primarily due to the difficulty of the game. Scoring goals on your personal computer will never be as pleasant as PES 2016 myClub. Something else worthy of note is the game has a decent size player base. One could quickly search for a match in the multi-player feature, enter that lobby, then once it ends restart the process until bored. A straightforward endeavour, indeed. All in all, I would recommend this game for those interested in semi-competitive video games and soccer fanatics who want their casual (or so-so casual) recreational fix.\n\nFINAL SCORE:  6.5/10","May 5","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On the other hand that bankrupting FIFA titles. That was the time I was very disappointed that I could not experience the dream of playing an online football match.\nSome weeks before I was browsing the STeam's free-to-play section (only section for me) and found this one o the list.. WhoooHooo!!!! Thank you KONAMI. You're one of the best guys who care for ur fans!\nNow, there is no chance to say excuses in playing this game as this has gone free.. Critiques must shut up their mouth blaming KONAMI..\nComing to the gameplay, this has been the same fun from my plays on PlayStation 2 upto this latest one.. I bite my nails, hit my head, and wide my eyes when the ball comes into the penalty box! Those moments of tension! This is one the best experiences that a free-to-play or a sports game could ever give you.\nU need a critique? Well I have one. This free-to-play version has only 1 offical Konami's soundtrack which is pretty boring. Donno whether they'll hav licensing issues since the version is free..\nYou have to wait like on average 5 to 8 minutes to get connected to a player and I can't find a way to chat with him though there are many chat prestets that can be set in-game (I googled the issue but still no solutions cos of less popularity)\n\nNow the sad thing is, I've missed playing this a week, and when I logged on, I've missed many free offers that KONAMI has given..\n\nThis is so far the longest review I ever typed in my life,, So don't let those annoying bad reviewers who have 10 hrs playtime ruin ur mind!

Get this on mobile and deal with the constant crashes or get a console.","April 30","false","2.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I have to say something though and that is that this game is an absolute joke. Its actually freaking hilarious how bad it is. Im not sure if the full proper game is any better although i dont see why it would be as they probably use the same programming and match formulas. Here is why:\n\nPROS:\nNone (it is now clear to me that any good features of a football game can be found in FIFA)\n\nCONS:\nplayer touches will make lose sleep they're so awful\noverall gameplay is hilariously unrealistic\nmatch making is dreadful; on my first online game i got matched with a team that was ten times better than mine\ngraphics make me cry\nshots are far too OP\ni could sit on the toilet pan and stare at the wall and still find it more interesting than this games interface\nits menu layout is utter rubbish\n\nAnyway, rant over. Long story short, save yourslef a lot of frustration and dont get this game.\n","March 25","false","2.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Basically you can't defend, the tackling is just so awful. Nothing works and the ball is glued to the opponent feet. All he has to do is press RB, and BOOM - you are doomed. The shooting in this game is also meh.. cr*p.

It is IMPOSSIBLE to defend, defenders are reacting very slow, so lower rated defenders don't stand a chance. Everything in this game is just so slow it makes me puke.\nThe goalkeepers I don't want to comment. They are ret*rded.\n\nThe servers are a catastrophe, I tried to launch myClub mode and it needed so many time to connect I lost my nerves.\nEstablishing Communications, Establishing Communications everywhere. You try to launch myClub, Establishing Communications, you try to play a division match, it's gonna be Establishing Communications, you try to play cup match WELL GUESS WHAT Establishing Communications.\n\nThe menus are acceptable, but the music. OH MY GOD! It is only one soundtrack in the entire game and it repeats itself. It is one of the worst music I have ever heard in my life. I personally think it is not good for health. Please do yourself a favor and mute it!\n\nGraphics are bad, but I don't mind it since I don't have really much powerful computer.\n\nOverall, it is obvious Konami attempt to create a mode similar to much more successful FIFA FUT mode which is much better IMO. And it is free, just to attract more players and try to "compete" with FUT. This game surely has potential, but all of these problems make it AN ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!\n\n3/10","February 11","false","14.5"," 23 of 50 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","23","50","2","0"

I had no idea this had been made and i was looking for a replacement for FIFA after i got bored of that. This game however gives me no pleasure at all.\nA promising start, easy to pick up a couple of early good players to mix in with the bad and the opportunity to improve the players over time seemed good. However it only took a few games to realise that these wouldn't particularly help.\n\nPros\n- Nice Graphics for a small game\n- Body movements look realistic\n\nCons\n- 0.5 second delay for EVERYTHING (Menus Included) want to pass? tough, it takes ages\n- Slow loading menus\n- Stupid Goalkeepers\n- No defense at all\n- Hard to find a game and when i did find games it was with people with the "same" team rating but they had teams full of ronaldos, ibarbos, salahs, matuidis, walcotts that it becomes a pace race.\n- Poor Commentary takes away the feeling of the match\n- Tackles take so long to register the button press that you end up fouling, in one match, 2 wellish time button presses resulted in 0.5/1 second delay resulting in red cards.\n- So very easy to score and be scored against\n- Way too much pace\n- Pay to Win\n\nAll in all a very dissapointing night on a game i was excited about. I really don't recommend this game if you like to play football, pace rules the roost on this one, through balls from your own half split your defense in half almost every time.\n\nWith the right Patches this game has great potential, the idea is there, the base is there but pay to win seems to be in effect here, playing in the bottom division against ronaldo and losing 7-0 after 25 mins is just too much for me.","February 15","false","3.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It is very easy to get scored on or to score, and you will go nuts at some of the goals that get scored on you. Try to make sure you have to use your keeper as little as possible, and make sure that getting a quality keeper is the first thing you do, because the keeper you start with will save NOTHING.\nDefending is extremely difficult. Unless you double tap A, your defender may sometimes just walk PAST the ball instead of stealing it from the offense.\nWaltzing. Players will sometimes dance around a ball instead of taking possession of it.\nOnly shoot from within the 18. You WILL score EVERY time. Otherwise, you always miss by a couple inches (unless you have Ronaldo or something).\nThe Team Strength brackets are somewhat broken. My team with an 88, 85, two 83s, and the rest mid 70s and some 60s was paired with a team full of 82+ players.\nThe best players are stupidly good. Oliver Kahn (Goalkeeper) will save everything, so once you score, just time waste. Ronaldo scores everything and always shoots at the right place.\nThere are a lot of people that are otherwise crap at the game but they have a better team than you (in Team Strength 3 and on) so prepare for that.\nTIPS FOR NOOBS:\nDon't hold down sprint. Also, when nearing an opponent on a 1v1 and he doesn't have anyone near him, double tap and hold the sprint button to his left or right. This will send the ball and your player past him.\nLearn to use RT. It controls the ball so you have less stupid mistakes and other things happening.\nTry not to hold down sprint when you're a defender trying to clear the ball. Sometimes this results in taking a BIG touch before clearing, which may result in the opposing team stealing it from you.\nUse the secondary currency, the gold coins, to buy a good manager when you think you are ready. They are locked so you can only use that currency to buy them, and you get at most 700 of it from achievements (which gets you a really good manager).\n~~~~~~~~~~~\nIt's not perfect, but it's definitely better than FIFA. I personally also believe that the MyClub feature is better than Ultimate Team in FIFA. Players level up like an RPG. Contracts are super simple: you just pay a certain amount to renew the contracts. It's easy to get really good players right off the start; there are so many achievements and there's usually a special promotion where you can spend 10000GP (not a lot) or 250 of the other currency (which you buy OR get through achievements) to get a guaranteed platinum player, and 70% chance platinum after that.\nFinally, keep your cool. You will get seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.","February 6","true","13.3"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"

Been playing PES since PS1 days , always been a big PES fan. Actually traded my Xbox One PES 2016 in 3 months ago as the online was utter garbage ( not a surprise ). I see this FTP effort pop up and think . . . well maybe they have sorted things and are taking this serious. Oh how wrong I was lol.\n\nIt's an exact copy of the full game just the Myclub portion , plays ok offline , pretty fun. Online though which is what this is , my oh my what a shambles still lol. Still the same PS2 servers they are using on the xbox one also. That's right guys PS2 servers in 2016. If you dont beleive me on that delve a little deeper and find out. I am well known in the community and I know everyhting that goes on in the PES team. Adam Bhatti constantly claims this and that regarding the game yet still it fails repeatedly , the guy is th biggest potato I have ever met , no manners , not a clue abaout PES and talks utter sh*t 24/7.\n\nSo onto the problems anyways , Latency Latency and more Latency. Because of the latency button delay galore , then on top of that you have lag cheaters anyways so it just tops it off with a cheery on top. How you can honestly use PS2 servers in 2016 over p2p knowing that it is badly coded p2p then stille expect customers to enjoy it is beyond words.\n\nThe PC sales of PES 2016 failed miserably so now they have the cheek to release this garbage to try and get some more money from gullable people. Konami you , Adam Bhatti and the rest of the clowns doing the networking on pes want not only hung out to dry by the media but you deserve to lose every loyal pes customer you have ever had.","February 4","false","1.5"," 20 of 45 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","20","45","0","0"

Forget about it. By the time your player slides, your opponent will have already scored.\n- The FPS drops\nSeriously, why? There has not been a single game where I didn't have these. It doesn't make it unplayable, but it certainly makes it unenjoyable.\n- The random chances\nSo the players have classes (other than levels), black being the highest, gold second, etc... It has a chest-like system where you get a sweet suspense. Well, it's not much of a suspense because if you have a chest (!) with 70% of black ball and 30% of golden ball, chances are you'll get golden. There are a lot of people complaining about this.\n\nSo these were the cons. I wanted to write them beforehand because some of them might be big turn-offs for you. The pros;\n\n- The players you get at the start of the game are absolutely terrible but it's easy to climb the ladder. Has a lot of features that makes you want to play even more in a way of MMORPG's did.\n\n- The player base (at least at the start of the game) isn't terrible. You get a maximum 1,5 minute of waiting before it finds a match.\n\n- Last but not least: It's freaking free. When I first saw this on Store, I couldn't believe my eyes. I was sure there was a catch. Other than micro-transactions (which you can buy with in-game currency as well) there's no catch!\n\nIf you got no problem with 5.5 GBs of data download and a 30-minute training, give it a shot.","February 12","false","4.3"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

So, in terms of graphics PES surely wins, but this is their the first and the last point.\n\nOnly negative beyond this line:\n\n- Most of the teams and player are not licensed, so your starting team will be made out of some made-up Uzbekistanian players. No fun. / FIFA has everything licensed\n- Starting team is the same for every player, so you will be having a lot of mirror matches at the start. No fun. / FIFA offers 2nd - 4th division real players for starter.\n- No Russian, Japanese (I wonder why Konami still couldn't get a licence for their national league) and North American leagues, only South American (Argentina, Chile, Brazil) which is also boring.\n- Terrible contract/salary system which is the worst problem of the game: your players have contracts for limited number of matches, when contract expires you have to pay in-game money to renew the contract. Cost of contract renewal for 85+ rating player is ~2000 points, while you'll earn 2k points for 1 match won or 2-3 matches lost. Basically, you are limited to have weak team since you would be able to support small number of players and most likely won't be able to recruit more players. Your gameplay would be limited only to struggle to maintain all your existing players' contracts even if you're winning 100% of your games OR you may pay some real money. No fun.\nIn FIFA, there are booster packs which contain players, contracts, stadiums and other in-game stuff by a reasonable price. You never have problem of maintaining contracts, especially if you're winning most of the time.\n- SIM matches are very slow for some reason and cannot be accelerated. Booooooring.\n- You can't customize your team, only chose logo and stripe from already existing teams.\n\nOverall: play PES2016 with mods or FIFA. This game is just boring.","February 18","false","5.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

If you're one of the people writing every game has input lag because of sucky servers, it's not the game, it's you. Please upgrade your internet. It's basically PES version of Fifa Ultimate Team and it does everything it does decently. Graphics are fine looking and don't get in the way of gameplay whatsoever. Feels good not having to have i5 to run a football sim. Out of those 20 games, I only dc-ed once, when I was ahead by few goals, and the game counted towards me losing 0-3 for whatever reason. Cheater or my internet being a ♥♥♥♥♥, I don't really know nor do I care, it's 1 game out of 20 and I can live with that. It could have been a problem on my part so I won't rant about it too much. All in all, if you love playing online football you owe it to yourself to try out the game because it's Free to Play and the worst thing you can lose are an hour or two out of your life.

And will be considered invalid.\n- Will run on nearly any potato machine as it is a xbox 360/ps3 port. (however this is just as much a con)\n- Defending / attacking are rewarding, if you make sure you run between a the passer and target the intercepts are 9/10 times happening regardless of player level (I think) on the contrary, if your through ball does succeed it is a big opener and hard to get back in defence. When you close gaps in the back it pays off.\n- Goalkeepers are not gods that safe everything they are actually pretty poor making a big chance to score most of the time a goal.  So if you defeat a defence you do not have to worry about the GK rng as much.\n- You can block players after each match, so if you play someone that is cheating/lagging/harassing. You can simply block them and do not have to worry of being matched up against them again. This encourages fair play, I really like this feature!\n\n\nCons:\n- Input lag, when you play online there is input lag though in some matches it is slim to none. The majority of them however do have this.\n- Game needs more players matchmaking can take a while.\n- Outdated graphics due to reasons mentioned above, if you port something to PC it should in my opinion at least be up to par with the latest generation of consoles.\n- Commentary in-game although it can be good from time to time most of the time it is fairly slow on responding to what happens on the pitch.\n- Long "connecting to server" / "testing your network" times\n\nAll and all it is a great game and I definitely suggest downloading it and giving it a shot. It leaves a lot to be desired, but it is free. I will just hope that they will continue this free to play scheme in PES 2017 and work towards a better PC port. I really enjoy this and when I feel like playing a football game now instead of loading up FIFA 16 I find myself playing PES f2p.\n\nIf they decide to give PC users a proper port next year I will most likely skip fifa all together and just buy PES however at the moment I can not recommend buying the full game.","February 17","true","26.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

This is probably the worst I have seen. Goalkeepers, even the legendary Oliver Kahn, cannot defend their goal for ♥♥♥♥ and they do better as fifth defender rather than a goalie. There is definitely input lag (both online and offline), especially apparent with slide tackling. Own team AI is still ♥♥♥♥ after all those years. PES 2011's players slide tackling while meaning to send away the ball is still there. I don't even want to begin with the amazing grind to keep 11 70 rated players. So what's good? It's free.

Plus, that first game; opponents first eleven: messi, roben, neuer, roberto carlos, sergio ramos... WTF? i have to wait five minutes for the game to find an opponent, and when it does, it's always some world class squad.\nOn top of that, players move slow as hell. I'm not talking about lag, players movement is just terrible, passing stupid as always: want to pass to the player left from you? Ok, lets pass to the player in front.\nDefense is almost non existant, it relies on defenders taking the ball away insted of stoping the opponents from getting too close. Shooting, as far as i have experianced, can not be called shooting.\n\nOne extra: goalkeepers be like: "Oh look the ball is getting close to the goal, lets see if it will get in. Yep, it got in, better dive so it looks like i tried." also when the goal is open, they will just take their time to get to the goal.\n\nSo... unfinished, terrible servers, anything else but football gameplay, just konami being konami.

This, coupled with the fact that at every single transition, like going through the menu, or when the ball goes out of bounds and there's a throw-in or a corner kick, you have to wait a few seconds for the game to actually load (or establish connection with the server), makes this game a joke.\n\nSure, it's free-to-play, but Konami hasn't improved the game even in the slightest since the launch of PES 2016. The same input lag that we have right now was present at launch. And don't even get me started with the menus, oh god, the menus of this game seem to be taken out of a game launched in the '90s.\n\nYou should definitely try it out, just because it’s free, but leave your expectations at the door, otherwise you’ll be in for a great disappointment.\n","February 6","false","4.1"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

Not as fluid as Fifa the game play feels sluggish, very arcade like and it feels like a football game from 5 or more years ago. Gameplay feel very hit and hope, too many random elements or exploits and player control is very static and lumpy. Attacking players never seem to move forward with any real sense even if you adjust to OFFENSIVE mode. The AI defending is horrible and you MUST play defensive formations against anyone who has a striker with pace. In Fifa you have tactical defending to have a deeper back line to counter. Pro Evo doesn't seem to have this! You never seem to be able to fine tune shots or passing so you under hit or go end up in row Z. I mean I can score but shots don't go where you aim, passing or crossing seem random too. Set pieces like freekicks or corners feel like Fifa Road to World Cup 98!\n\n2. The game menus are bad to navigate they take ages to load and moving between screens is long winded because it's always "Checking Connection or Checking Network". I'm on 72mb Fibre Optic I mean WTF. None of the Fifa free2plays ever had this issue! The other annoying menu thing is Fifa uses  things like "Formations" ""Set Plays" or "Transfers" to label menus in Pro Evo Pro Club the names don't really explain what menu area your going or make sense into it's hard to find what you want. The menu speed isn't a spec thing either I have a Six Core CPU, R9 290x gpu and 16gb of RAM and an SSD drive!\n\n3. Graphics and Gamepad options cannot be set in game and it wasn't until someone on Steam told me I had to use the "settings.exe" before I could get my gamepad working. I half an hour trying to get my two models of Gamepad working with no luck and keyboard controls are not an option. I know it's the same in Fifa, but at least Fifa detects a gamepad and works from install. I had to get into a game of Pro Evo before I find out I have no control method.\n\n4. Very limited team customization - So far I've not found anyway to change my formation I think it's fixed to the manager I have, this is the same for tactics and player roles. In Fifa you can tweak player positions, let players roam and have a certain attacking or defensive mentality. In Fifa you can tell them a style of play or tell them what you can and can't do off the ball. Pro Evo is about 5 years behind Fifa in terms of team tactics and this reflects and shows in the poor AI and defending full of holes. Literally anyone with pacey players will undo your team quite easily. There's no skill in keeping possession or creating spaces. Multiplayer can be won at low level by having a fast striker! In Fifa and real football a slow defender like John Terry for example can still win against a pacey player by tactics or positioning in Pro Evo defending cannot account for fast players even with 5 defenders or 4 defenders and 2 holding players.\n\n5. Could not find anyway to buy players refresh stamina or renew contracts... again this is because the menu names and navigating the menu is infuriating because it's slow and seems to want to check my connection all the time. The early game instructions and tutorial don't explain this like in Fifa Ultimate Team.\n\n6.GOALKEEPER AI IS BAD - This is the worst part of this game I could write 5 paragraphs on this random unneeded punching, they fluff the ball into the path of the other team everytime they stop a shot and your defenders never have a chance to clear. The keepers cannot seem to ever save a low shot from the edge of the box or come out for a cross. One game I was leading 3-0 and the other guy had no shots in the first half, 2nd half he has 6 shots low and wide from the edge of the box with Aguero everyone went in with my goalkeeper nowhere near. He had no other efforts all game literally all 6 goals were the same position, power and range. I guess better keepers might be better but I've not got the patience to go through 500 games to earn enough coins to find out. This breaks the multiplayer mode when there's no way to stop certain goal scoring tactics. Keepers are coded badly there's too many exploits to score.\n\n7. No cool menu music like Fifa!\n\n8. The fact most of the clubs aren't licenced and don't have badges! Liverpool and Everton for example are Merseyside Reds & Merseyside Blues. So this means everyone plays Barcelona or AC Milan!\n\n9. EVERY TIME THE BALL GOES OUT FOR A THROW OR GOAL KICK THERE'S TRANSITION PAUSE!!!! Literally you wait 3-5 seconds every time it's annoying as hell. Sometimes you get a black screen too for those few seconds, I did try updating my GPU drivers made no difference.\n\nPlease don't say a lot of the above things in terms of gameplay are a skill issue they are not I've played football games since Fifa 95 on the Sega Megadrive and I've been in the top 5 divisions in Fifa Ultimate Team many times over the years. I have a decent skill when it comes to football games and online generally!\n\n\nPros:\n\n1. Good graphics I'll give them that Konami can make players and pitches look nice this is a very pretty football game! Some of the players look better than their Fifa counterparts. FPS wise it's smooth!\n\n2. Jim Beglin the commentator is pretty cool and some of his one liners are quite funny!\n\n3. It never once crashes to desktop or stopped working like some free games it's stable.\n\n4. Decent multiplayer match finder and lobbies meaning you find players of equal skill point rating most games.\n\n5. I like the fact it has a level up and training system for players, in Fifa players never improve but at least a ♥♥♥♥ team can become slightly better in Pro Evo unfortunately I don't want to play anymore to see how players progress but I'll admit that was a nice thing to see.\n\n\nLook I know this is a free game but it's disappointing because there's currently no decent Fifa free2play since FifaOnline and FifaWorld were taken down and Fifa Online 3 is ASIA based only.\n\nKonami had a really good idea here and I'd have plunged hours and months maybe years into this with it being on Steam. However this game has really missed a trick and I've deleted it from my library.\n\nI had high hopes for this game I played Pro Evo and it's original namesake ISS years ago on the Playstation and N64 they were good back then. However football games have developed and come a long way and there's a certain expectation beyond button bashing and arcade play these days. This game is what I'd expect to play on a seaside town pier arcade or download on a tablet or smart phone store.\n\nI always kept out of the Fifa vs Pro Evo argument as I hadn't played a recent Pro Evo game however Fifa is much better even the free ones. I'm disappointed! I know this is a free game but it feels shody, arcade like and the game play does not feel fluid enough. There are tooo many random elements you cannot judge or control that ruin the online play this is a football game from 5-10 years ago with modern graphics that is all. I know I'm comparing to Fifa and not just judging this as any other free to play.... BUT even the Fifa free to plays that closed down were better than this.\n\nThe most annoying  thing that if they had fixed I'd have stuck with this game is the passing and shooting are no where near Fifa standards and player control just doesn't even come close with the AI keepers ruining most of my matches. I hate the fact I can dominate games but lose because the other guys knows how to exploit bugs or expose the shoddy engine. Fifa did away with this a few years ago meaning matches up were more skill dependent. Maybe in a few months when it's patched I might try it again but I cannot see it changing and agree with the many MIXED Steam reviews. Do yourself a favour either download this with VERY LOW expectations and enjoy a low standard free game or wait for a european release of Fifa Online 3 without lag! I'm just going to keep playing my shop bought Fifa games that cost money because they are so much better. SHAME ON KOMANI....

Every time if  want to enter a menu or go back  menu it takes min 3 seconds(It gets f*cking long after couple of times)\n\nThe stupid "controller" app outside of the actual game for setting up the keyboard and controller, plus u can't even see what button does what on the keyboard except if you don't take a picture with your phone in game and then see what key/button does what.\n\nTHE GOD DAMN CONNECTION. I have tried to play vs.. Online, but nope, u aint doing that. First off when you put the limit to players of your rank it wont even find a game after 5 mins of waiting. It will just say "connection error" or some BS like that.\nAnd if you put your limit so that you can play with any player rank or whatever it will actually connect but then randomly disconnect and say that u lost the game.\n\nLike WTF is with this game. How god damn hard can it be to integrate the controls changer into the game and just make a little image so that you know what you are actually changing on the keyboard.\n\nAt this stage I don't recommend this game AT ALL.

The free2play factor is really ok so far. So in this point it gets a thump up but at all it gets thump down because the game itself is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥. When the full version of the game is same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ then its a massive waste of money.\nPlayers dont react to balls, you cant control them, switching players is slow and a random pain, the game creates so many bad situations wich shouldt not happen. It feels like superstar soccer 2006 and not like a 2016 game. Most of the games are decided by random actions you dont have any impact on. Many games are unbalanced from the first minute, you never ever have a chance to win this, you will loose 9:0 or win with the same amount. Thats not fun.\nOnline is 90% lag. Its normal to play every game with massive lags. I dont have lags in any other online games, its not my connection.\n\nThe point to win this game is to farm the same first match vs CPU over and over again and earning that GP. You have to farm this points, there is a easy way to but its just to boring and i dont wanna waste my time into it.\n\nas a free2play its really ok but not worth any money.

You will win most of the games so ones that you lose won't bother you. After that, everything WILL annoy you. It isn't just me, couple of my friends got the game and they have the same experience. In every game, you know if you will win or if you will lose, the game just sets it that way. Some games you will win every tackle, allmost every pass will be corect and all shots will be dangerous/goals, except for those from distance. Some games you will score with shots that even you didn't think you will score and some games you won't score ten 1 on 1s with best players in the world. Not to mention when defending it just won't chose the best player for you to defend with even with 2-3 player changes, and other defenders don't do ♥♥♥♥. Besides that you have scouts that will only give you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ players and if you want better ones, you have to pay 10000GP whitch is pain in the ♥♥♥ to get after 3-4 seasons when you will spend most of GP on sallaries. You don't even have freedom to chose your own tactics because you have to buy coach that only knows how to play with ONE tactic and when you have an injured player in the game and don't have a suitable change or when you get a red card with defender when playing 3-5-2, you are doomed. To top it all, game has THE WORST soundtrack ever.\n\nOh and if you come from a country that doesn't have good internet connection, you will hate establishing connection whitch pes needs for EVERY SINGLE OPTION YOU WISH TO CHOSE. Plus, every pass will happen much later than you press the bottun, every shot, every tackle... EVERYTHING. Oh, and the plus sides: it's free and you can run it with potato.","March 15","false","39.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also the defending is terrible, it is so hard to tackle the players with the ball, the games usually end like 6-5. Also the goalkeepers need to be improved, some 57 rated players are scoring screamers outside of the box. Another thing is I should be abe to change my keyboard buttons after the setup, but I can't seem to find the configuration for the controls. And PLEASE add more songs to this game!

This game would be quite nice if it was a beta version or an early acces, but not the final version.\nOptimalization isn't so good as it should be, although the game runs smoothly on 30 FPS (it's enough for a football game), +/- 18 FPS on cut-scenes is a joke... The game doesn't find GPU (Nvidia GTX 950M), only Intel's embedded graphics.\nKey binding is horrible... Konami, is it so hard to make direct keyboard key to action binding instead of binding keyboard keys to pad keys and  then learning what each key does? And the steering is horrible, totally unfeelable...\nReasuming, PES2016 myClub looks like a poor/average quality port from a console game, not the game created for PC, optimalization sucks a little bit, key binding is horrible and the steering makes me totally outrageus...

Anyway it's free but the online is pretty unstable,making you swear every fuc*king time because there is a 0.5 seconds delay at everything you do,even shooting , which makes this game completely retar*ded online... but still, the best football game on steam.

I had to come give PES 16 a thumbs and counter all the negativereviews.\n\nThis is an free and complete football game. Can be played with up to 4 people local or online. I think that's worth supporting. Especially since i was recently contemplating buying fifa 16 for casual play when i am having friends over.\n\nAs ingame purchases are a part of this game it hasnt changed the casual experience for me i don't know it changes it for the hardcore gamers but from what i can see if you want you can make in game purchases to get bigger name players in your team, somethings i dont really care about,\n\nTHEY'RE JUST PLAYERS IN A GAME DANM!!! YOU  AINT MESSI CAUSE YOU PLAYING HIM SON!\n\nAlso playing local exhimbition matches you can pick the PES offical licesnesd teams anyway.\nFifa is a more complete package but this game still has many cool features and cool gameplay.\n\nThe worst thing about this game is the Theme song and i feel like it spends too much time connecting to the network just to browse through different menus.\n\nAlso the goal keepers are pretty bad at saving goals, so i feel like there is not so much suspense when you are one on one with the keeper. This goes for both team so it's not like either person gets and unfair advantage.\n\nI am not a seasoned sports game player, and have only played fifa casually.

If facing an average striker, he will suddenly remember how to be a defender.\nThis game is not based on human player skill.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levan7/recommended/407250/","Levan7","Levan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levan7/","38 products in account","Well I haven't played PES games since the golden era, but i think it is a good game.\n\nFirst when I started playing this game I was really mad, because I was loosing to players that I would wax in classic pes games, and the game speed is much slower then what I was used to in good old pes games.\nHowever I cousin (that is PES guru) pointed one thing out, he told me. remember when we would play Master league and we had Castolo, Ruskin, El Moubarki, Lothar, remember how horrible it was to play with this players you would change directions and the players would take half an hour to respond. Well this is the same situation you are playing with week players so don't expect anything from them.\nHe was right, after i got decent squad pes started to feel more like the old pes games (still not as good) but i started to have fun and started win games.\nThe good about this game is that, it doesn't force you to pay money to but good player, yes having good players is a plus but yesterday I played against a team that had all the good players my team is level 2 and his was level 5 but I still won because he was rubbish, but I played with the weaker team and he wan because he was more skilled then I were.\n\nHowever i have huge problem with GK in this game, and I should point out that if you play against a good GK they aren't as terrible as you first think, but still GK are awful in this game, it is like they aren't even there every shoot towards Soccer Net is a goal. Don't count that GK will ever do anything.\n\nThe second problem i have with this game is, auto defense just doesn't work, so if you want any defense out of your time you should do everything yourself. So no more pressing button help the defense somehow manages to form huge halls in the middle. In old PES games you could use smart tackling to strengthen your defense but in this game tackling is almost useless you press, you press tackle button and half year later player decides to do what you told him to do, but the play is already over everyone has moved on three goals have been scored and now he got a useless foul and a yellow card.\n\nOne part of the defense is that players just can't do things you tell them to do, for example the ball is in the air and it is time to play with a head, ok no one is near your player and you tell the game to give a pass to a player left of him. So what happens the players manages to miss his head and now you have one on one with the keeper. Or the ball is in the air and falling in the box, you tell the GK to rush out to grab the ball, so What happens the GK runs to a totally different side, and because you haw slow defender the FC scarred a goal.\n\nThird the connection works like s!it, I played PES games online on PS2 and i think they are using the same code, ok it's not that bad but it's close. The game is always connecting to something, checking and testing connection. You've entered settings menu: well time to test, retest connection, establish connection, re establish connection, drop connection, test connection again and then finally show you the menu.\n\nFour there is nosing social about this game, you cant add a friend, see any ones team. hell you can't even send a massage to anyone. I really want to compere my stats/team to my friends stats/teams but I can't.\n\nSo the this are the pros and cons in this game\nPros:\nWinning feels nice.\nNicely balanced team building, you don't need to buy your way through to build a good team.\nLow system requirements\nFree\nDecent graphics.\n\nCons:\nDefenders can't even guard a graveyard\nGK are worse then a log.\nPlayer's can't execute your commands.\nBad net cod.\nNo social features.\n\n\n\nReview by Classic Pes Guru\nI got introduced to Konami football  when PS1 was hot and I played that game non stop, the whole post soviet union want nuts for that game, and we even had modded games that had different variations of football clubs. So as you might have guessed I was very good at Winning eleven games.\nThen came Classic PES games, I played them non stop and I was one of the best players in my count and in the world I was pretty good player as well.\nThen came changes and in 2010 I completely stopped playing pes games, now I gave this a try.","March 2","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had to come give PES 16 a thumbs and counter all the negativereviews.\n\nThis is an free and complete football game. Can be played with up to 4 people local or online. I think that's worth supporting. Especially since i was recently contemplating buying fifa 16 for casual play when i am having friends over.\n\nAs ingame purchases are a part of this game it hasnt changed the casual experience for me i don't know it changes it for the hardcore gamers but from what i can see if you want you can make in game purchases to get bigger name players in your team, somethings i dont really care about,\n\nTHEY'RE JUST PLAYERS IN A GAME DANM!!! YOU  AINT MESSI CAUSE YOU PLAYING HIM SON!\n\nAlso playing local exhimbition matches you can pick the PES offical licesnesd teams anyway.\nFifa is a more complete package but this game still has many cool features and cool gameplay.\n\nThe worst thing about this game is the Theme song and i feel like it spends too much time connecting to the network just to browse through different menus.\n\nAlso the goal keepers are pretty bad at saving goals, so i feel like there is not so much suspense when you are one on one with the keeper. This goes for both team so it's not like either person gets and unfair advantage.\n\nI am not a seasoned sports game player, and have only played fifa casually. But this game comes pretty danm close to the fifa experience some things done better and some worse.\n\n","March 2","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My hopes were for a good replacement for the killed FIFA World, but it's even worse.\n\nWhen you open the game, the first thing it shows you is a config menu where you have the chance to set up your controls, graphics, audio, etc.\nLet's start with graphics. The maximum possible resolution here is 1280x (I think 720, I can't check it because i can't change it in-game and the config menu is not showing up). Also, it says that it requires high-end graphic card even for the low graphics and it keeps saying that the computer is under the minimum specs though the game runs at 60 FPS.\nNow for the controls. There are no already set up controls for keyboard, only for an Xbox controller, and you have to adjust your keyboard buttons to meet those of the Xbox controller, not the actual controls, which are not presented in the config menu. After you start the game, you get to see which Xbox controller button does what in-game.\nAudio is the only thing that is OK.\n\nMoving on onto the in-game part. The first-time loading continues for as long as it would take on a console (really freaking long). And the whole thing isn't even rewarding. You get to play with 6 teams only and nothing else. Good thing that the balls are 23.\n\nWhatever you do, do not, I repeat, DO NOT install this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Xbox port of a game.

My hopes were for a good replacement for the killed FIFA World, but it's even worse.\n\nWhen you open the game, the first thing it shows you is a config menu where you have the chance to set up your controls, graphics, audio, etc.\nLet's start with graphics. The maximum possible resolution here is 1280x (I think 720, I can't check it because i can't change it in-game and the config menu is not showing up). Also, it says that it requires high-end graphic card even for the low graphics and it keeps saying that the computer is under the minimum specs though the game runs at 60 FPS.\nNow for the controls. There are no already set up controls for keyboard, only for an Xbox controller, and you have to adjust your keyboard buttons to meet those of the Xbox controller, not the actual controls, which are not presented in the config menu. After you start the game, you get to see which Xbox controller button does what in-game.\nAudio is the only thing that is OK.\n\nMoving on onto the in-game part. The first-time loading continues for as long as it would take on a console (really freaking long). And the whole thing isn't even rewarding. You get to play with 6 teams only and nothing else. Good thing that the balls are 23.\n\nWhatever you do, do not, I repeat, DO NOT install this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Xbox port of a game. Also there is premium currency used for god knows what.","April 4","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had played PES 2014, and wasn't really impressed with it, but I had heard great things about PES 16. I opened it up. The graphics were AMAZING! I actually thought the stadium in the starting menu was real! So far, so good.\n\nFirst problem - Servers. Straight away I had problems connecting to the PES servers. I left it for now and went into an offline match. The stadium, the players and everything looked spectacular! (Keeping in mind I was on lowest graphics, 50 FPS). I was loving it so far.\n\nFor my liking, the gameplay felt a bit too slow, and I felt I wasn't able to turn a player quick enough to escape a challenge. Still, I enjoyed it. First game: 0-0. I was dissapointed that there wasn't an extra time/penalties option, but hey, at least I didn't lose my first game, right?\n\nAfter about an hour, I finally connected to the servers. The tutorials took a while, but definitely helped. It is quite an easy game to navigate. Anyway, decided to open a ball? (Definitely not gay!). First ball: Oliver Kahn. Not too Xabi Alonso. Too bad Goalkeepers save ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Seriously, anywhere around the box, if it isn't blocked and it's on target, it's going in. Hence why my first onling game ended 1-5 (although I do suck at the game as well).\n\nMy opinion? Get it. Definitely worth it. I've played the recent FIFAs and I think that this tops it. Props to Konami for making such a great gamemode free to play. Although I do prefer "Become A Legend", (I play a lot of Career mode on FIFA over UT), I don't mind. The gameplay of myClub makes out for it. This game is definitely worth getting.\n\n9/10\n\nThanks for taking the time to read if you did!","April 20","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do not recomend you to play this game for too long because it will get boring, unless you willing to spend real money on those balls opening ( pack oppening ). Servers are not that good compare to FIFA, but hey again ITS FREE. Compared to older version, this version has been improved alot, trust me it's a free game and definately worth your time playing it as casual game.","April 23","true","98.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had played PES 2014, and wasn't really impressed with it, but I had heard great things about PES 16. I opened it up. The graphics were AMAZING! I actually thought the stadium in the starting menu was real! So far, so good.\n\nFirst problem - Servers. Straight away I had problems connecting to the PES servers. I left it for now and went into an offline match. The stadium, the players and everything looked spectacular! (Keeping in mind I was on lowest graphics, 50 FPS). I was loving it so far.\n\nFor my liking, the gameplay felt a bit too slow, and I felt I wasn't able to turn a player quick enough to escape a challenge. Still, I enjoyed it. First game: 0-0. I was dissapointed that there wasn't an extra time/penalties option, but hey, at least I didn't lose my first game, right?\n\nAfter about an hour, I finally connected to the servers. The tutorials took a while, but definitely helped. It is quite an easy game to navigate. Anyway, decided to open a ball? (Definitely not gay!). First ball: Oliver Kahn. Not too Xabi Alonso. Too bad Goalkeepers save ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Seriously, anywhere around the box, if it isn't blocked and it's on target, it's going in. Hence why my first onling game ended 1-5 (although I do suck at the game as well).\n\nMy opinion? Get it. Definitely worth it. I've played the recent FIFAs and I think that this tops it. Props to Konami for making such a great gamemode free to play. Although I do prefer "Become A Legend", (I play a lot of Career mode on FIFA over UT), I don't mind. The gameplay of myClub makes out for it. This game is definitely worth getting.\n\n9/10\n\nThanks for taking the time to read if you did!","April 20","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Intricate passing moves tend to break down due to latency/glitches/unwanted extra touches/misdirected passes, whereas winning the ball back in the opponents half often lets you straight in on goal.\n* myClub game design gives you a lot of tedious work to do to maintain your squad,\nconstantly having to re-sign players, sub players, recharge their stamina.
