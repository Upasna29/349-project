When it came to games however, there haven't been too many memorable ones except maybe Operation Genesis. I have to say, from what I played so far Lego and Traveler's Tales did a great job with the game and the use of the film license. Since there is free roam, I'm excited to be able to fully explore the park again even after watching the movies thousands of times. I don't need to beat the game to know this is truly a must have for any JP fan. For 30 bucks, the amount of content, replay value and collectibles will keep you hooked for hours and hours no matter your age!\n\nWelcome... to Jurassic Park.","June 11, 2015","true","35.8"," 217 of 254 people (85%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","85","217","254","32","20"

This strategy has proven to be incredibly successful for both Traveler's Tales and publisher Warner Bros. with LEGO games consistently outselling numerous other big name properties and franchises on the consoles and now to coincide with the release of Jurassic World we get the LEGO version which also happens to contain condensed LEGO versions of the first three movies including, of course, the biggest blockbuster of 2015 so far (until the new Star Wars movie arrives) - Jurassic World\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480260659\nIf you are not a fan of this kid-friendly branding exercise, the humor or the simplistic puzzles then I suggest you stop reading now and move along. However, if you happen to enjoy a bit of LEGO mayhem in-between playing your other games, enjoy the sly parodies on display or just happen to be a massive fan of the film franchise then LEGO Jurassic World pays just enough lip service to the originals that should have fans chomping at the bit.\n\nOnce again you will find yourself exploring various film scenes from all four of the movies smashing everything in sight to bits while piles of unbuilt LEGO will bounce up and down around you indicating that you can build some sort of device or structure that will enable story progression. While LEGO Jurassic World does incredibly little to tinker with what makes these games so addictive and well loved amongst many, the game mechanics have been slightly overhauled indicating that Traveler's Tales seems to be getting a better handle on the LEGO engine than its previous iterations but like any film licensed product LEGO Jurassic World has the air about it of something that was rushed to the market in order to meet the deadlines determined by the release of the film. Characters repeatedly get stuck in the environment causing the player to have to reboot out of the level and restart it. This can sometimes get incredibly frustrating especially when you are near the end of a level only for this to occur forcing you right back to the beginning. Traveler's Tales have implemented a save feature at certain mid-points in the levels but they very sporadic with some not having any save feature mid-way at all.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482038193\nWhile I did not experience many bugs throughout my first playthrough, perusing the forums reveals a host of issues that are preventing people from completing the game. While from a production stand point LEGO Jurassic World looks fantastic and is a very strikingly good looking LEGO game; the game does tend to feel a bit more rushed than its predecessors but I suppose that boils down to the fact that most of the scenes in LEGO Jurassic Park mimic the fight and flight scenes from the original movies which does require the action to fly thick and fast. With that being said there is hardly a lull in any of the games 20 chapters (5 across each film) as they move at a breakneck pace. As a huge fan of the franchise I really enjoyed the LEGO treatment given to the films so much so that LEGO Jurassic Park has emerged as my favorite LEGO game to come from TT Games thus far.\n\nWhere the game does tend to falter is in the use of its voice overs. Certain scenes are mixed in with the original dialogue from the movies but the movie dialogue sounds tinny and it becomes quite jarring to hear famous lines from the movie sound like they being beamed in from the inside of a soda can compared to the clarity of voice work composed specifically for the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=479304489\nLEGO Jurassic World is not going to win over any new fans but for those who enjoy these kinds of games it's a fun and wild romp through all four films and is the perfect game for families playing some couch co-op over the weekend. The humor is as sharp as ever and should have most adults that play it giggling away like children. LEGO Jurassic World gets the all clear in my books. You are free to enter the park.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 18, 2015","true","23.6"," 131 of 149 people (88%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","88","131","149","14","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/352400/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","LEGO Jurassic WorldDeveloper: Traveller's Tales\nPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nLEGO Jurassic World is the newest installment in the acclaimed LEGO series of games. It covers all 3 Jurassic Park films and the new Jurassic World film, recreating iconic moments from each film in LEGO style. It's been released on nearly every currently available console and PC. Let's dive right into it, shall we?\n\nGameplay\n==========\nBeing a LEGO game, there are a number of things to do and collect in each level. You play as one of many feature characters from each film, each complete with their own unique special abilities. Some characters are equipped with certain tools, and others have weapons and other miscellaneous abilities. For example, Dr. Grant has a spade which he can use to dig up things, and also a raptor claw, which can be used to cut through obstacles. Nearly everything you see is breakable and rewards you with studs. You can then use these studs to unlock new characters, vehicles, and dinosaurs. There are also Minikits, Gold Bricks, and Amber to collect. Some of these are very cleverly hidden as well, as each stage encourages repeat playthroughs with different unlocked characters to find every secret. All of the fun is playing through each stage and trying to collect as many studs as you can while reliving all the epic moments from the Jurassic Park/World films.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nAs with all LEGO games, the films were recreated nearly entirely out of LEGO blocks and shapes. The characters and dinosaurs are all LEGO built, as well as the environments, vehicles, and other items. Some of the background sets are more realistic pieces, such as landscape views and large clusters of trees and foliage, but for the most part nearly everything is built from LEGOs. This is by no means the most graphically intense or impressive game out there, but it has it's "Wow!" moments, which is impressive considering the blocky and oftentimes clunky nature of LEGOs.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nJohn Williams' familiar groundbreaking compositions abound in LEGO Jurassic World, including the iconic Jurassic Park main theme. When the doors of Jurassic Parks swing open and that theme plays, you will undoubtedly remember your first time experiencing the film and the awe-inspiring feeling the music gave you. All of that is here in the game, and more! If you aren't familiar with John Williams, he has composed some of the most popular and recognizable themes in cinematic history, including Star Wars, Jaws, Indiana Jones, and of course Jurassic Park. For the Jurassic World segments of the game, the music is instead done by Michael Giacchino, using the tracks from the film.\n\nAlmost every character is fully voiced, and has lines taken directly from the films. However, some of them sound like they were directly ripped from the films and jammed into the game instead of using new, clean recordings. For those with a keen sense of these things, it's VERY noticeable, but it should not bother most players whatsoever.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nMy current PC specs are an AMD FX-8320 8 Core processor, with 16 GB of RAM, and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti. With this system I experienced no problems with framerate and no stuttering at all. Everything ran very smoothly, even while recording my gameplay demo video, which I will post at the end of this review. I personally did not experience any bugs or glitches, but I have read about a very few people who experienced a few game-breaking glitches and were unable to progress because of them, one of them as early as the second level.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nLEGO Jurassic World is a great installment for the LEGO series of games, which perfectly captures and recreates the wonder and majesty of Jurassic Park/Jurassic World even while being completely made of LEGOs. Traveller's Tales has once again taken a beloved franchise and done it great justice transforming it into a veritable playground for people of all ages to enjoy. It deserves a spot in your library, alongside other LEGO titles such as LEGO Batman, LEGO Star Wars, and LEGO Harry Potter.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/BOwtUdSeyKI\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","June 16, 2015","true","16.5"," 139 of 167 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","139","167","9","15"

If you've experienced Lego games before, the gameplay will be familiar. You get to play as dinosaurs and explore the islands of Isla Nublar and Isla Sorna as the hub worlds which is awesome. If this is your first Lego game (which would be rare and odd if it is) you basically play condensed, family oriented versions of the Jurassic Park movies with each movie being five levels, spread across the two large hub worlds. The voice acting seems to be mixed with soundbites from the movies and also some original voice acting which can be disorienting if you're very familiar with the movies like I am.

The gameplay is your standard fair when it comes to LEGO- destroy bricks, build stuff, activate various switches etc. with tools specific to certain characters. The story seems to be following that of the 4 movies, which was to be expected. The biggest thing is that it's fun. I'm not bored of this formula yet, and will happily play these games for a long time to come. There's a ton of stuff to collect, making this the perfect game for a collectionist. Additionally, the game looks better than any LEGO game to date. The graphics are definitely a step up from previous games and it shows.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/352400/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","LEGOs and dinosaurs: somehow it's taken well over three decades for those two great childhood pastimes to join together in an interactive on-screen adventure. Life finds a way, however, and the two elements are together in a package that may not be the best LEGO-branded adventure, but one that still brings enough to entertain over the course of four fast-but-fun campaigns. The format of this puzzle-focused adventure is as old as dinosaurs -- developer TT Games has used this formula more than 20 times since 2005’s LEGO Star Wars -- but like the pre-historic creatures themselves, there's still a ton of charm.\n\nAnything in the world that's made out of LEGO bricks that isn't one of the 100-plus playable characters can be broken into studs to be spent on bonuses or rebuilt within the environment to progress further in the world. Anyone who's uttered a line in a Jurassic Park movie can be unlocked eventually, from Ian Malcolm and that annoying kid at the raptor dig site to the dino-wrangling, motorbike-riding Owen Grady and, awesomely, Mr. DNA himself. Unlike most LEGO adventures where characters have distinct weapons or superpowers, LEGO Jurassic World's suite of skills are a little more subdued; paleontologists can dig, zoologists aren't afraid to dive into piles of dino-dung, and hunters can set off targets from afar. It's mostly well balanced, though it's weird to see the meek husband-and-wife couple who funded Jurassic Park III's expedition using a grappling hook and gymnastic moves. Also, why are the only characters with scream-based powers women? There’s been plenty of screaming men in Jurassic Park films.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature is that LEGO Jurassic World leans far less on combat than most of the previous LEGO-licensed adventures, which makes sense: the movies are mostly about humans trying to avoid dinosaurs. That makes the few fights actually meaningful -- whether it's a throwdown between rival camps in Lost World or the brutal T-rex vs spinosaurus battle in Jurassic Park III, almost every fight has some dramatic flair... unless there are compys involved. Even though the diminutive dinos only appear in the third Jurassic Park film (Edit: oops, the second one too), the species is in every chapter of LEGO Jurassic World, and they never get any less frustrating. They'll swarm in packs, immediately requiring your full attention due to their overpowered health-sapping skills, and their size and speed make them tough to hit. Sometimes there's just one pack nearby, sometimes there's two, and sometimes there's an infinite supply that won't stop attacking you until you cover up the source of the stream. Frankly, I would have just rather had a compy-free experience, since the species makes any stage it infects just a bit less enjoyable than the puzzle-solving, block-breaking norm.\n\nLEGO Jurassic World is an all-inclusive series package, and each of the four movies is broken up into five lightning-fast stages that run two to three segments each. In the space of 30 minutes, I went from saving Lex and Tim to traversing a tree to reach a crashed jeep, to throwing flares in a T-rex's mouth during a tense car chase. Any time I started to get antsy or annoyed about a certain story or set of characters, I knew something I enjoyed would be around the corner. Sure, the gymnastic escape scene at the end of Lost World might have been a bit disappointing, but I was just one level away from seeing Academy Award nominee William H. Macy in LEGO form!\n\nIronically, the enjoyment I had with the people and creatures of LEGO Jurassic World didn't quite extend to the actual parks. Sure, the levels were mostly a joy, but the overworld is a bit of a mess, especially when I had to explore the islands to find the entrance to a new level. Another weird quirk; while you can play the original Jurassic Park and the newly released Jurassic World right from the start, The Lost World and Jurassic Park III can only be played after completion of the preceding movie's adaption. Fast travel is also iffy, as most of the icons on the map automatically load objectives. Since I wanted to explore the area to find new stages, I'd have to scan each icon until I found the one connected to each section's kiosk, which became so tedious that I'd usually just walk through the interconnected movie hubs to get to my destination. Much like a real theme park, you'll have fun on the attractions but dread getting there.\nJurassic World Video Review\n\nWhat keeps the compy troubles and overworld woes from becoming too unbearable? That patented LEGO charm. For the first three movies, voice clips are used sparingly and sight gags help add some spice to what should be a line-by-line retellings. Instead of the cowardly investor getting eaten alive on a porta-potty, he stays in the T-Rex's mouth for a few scenes, cleaning the creature's chompers with a toilet brush. When dinosaurs need medical attention they require candy bars and ice pops instead of a tense scene of humans operating on puppets. Also, there's a bit more story being told directly in Jurassic World, so be forewarned that many of the movie's twists will be revealed along the way.\nThe Verdict\n\nIf you have an affinity for any of the four films recapped within, LEGO Jurassic World will be a worthwhile visit. Seeing the series' iconic moments recreated with cute figurines is a treat, and each of the four campaigns is fast-paced enough that completing the entire franchise in its brick-based form will only take roughly seven to eight hours, which is not much longer than the combined film running times (and amounts to brisk mini-campaigns of two hours or less each). Plus, you can tackle this one with a friend and run around as a raptor or Jeff Goldblum. Just beware that there are a few pests inhabiting the island and the line to the best parts of the park may be a bit tough to navigate.\n\nGood\nLEGO Jurassic World's puzzles and combat keep up a great pace that get you past annoyances and back to the fun quickly. Annoyances like it doesn't take to long to go through any of the films. In my first 5 hours of play i managed to go through 2 out of the 4 movies.\n\nFun puzzles\nNicely paced\nLEGO William H. Macy\n\nBland abilities\nUgh, compys\nLEGO Jeff Goldblum and Vince Vaughn\n\n7.6\n\nThe game had me saying goddammit Vince Vaughn more then once.","January 3","true","13.9"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","33","45","5","5"

LEGO: Jurassic World brings the marvel and comedy of Lego, with the Story of Jurassic Park and its sequals.\n\nPROS AND CONS FIRST. THEN AN IN DEPTH REVIEW.\n\nPROS:\n-Contains the story of all 4 Jurassic Park movies, basing the story of the films plot\n-Original voice audio (taken from the movies too)\n-Game looks great with graphics turned up\n-Supports Most gamepads which really helps\n-LEGO! NUFF SAID\n-THE THEME MUSIC AHHH SO MUCH FEELS\n-From what I see, quite a lengthy game with multiple playthrough with different characters required to complete a level.\n\nCons:\n-Not really any freedom to explore, game is set on a path to stick to the plot\n-A few bugs and glitches\n-Game audio sounds like it was pulled directly from movies, with background sounds still included\n-UI is sometimes confusing about who can do what/when\n-The price is sooooo good it should be illegal (this is a con because on steam its $40NZD but Console $110)\n\nREVIEW: I was so excited when Steam notified me the game had finished downloading. I booted it up and sat at the menu screen for a while taking in the funny antics in Jurassic World playing behind the Menu Screen (and listening to the amazing music and Dr. Malcoms laugh from the first movie. Harr huh huh harrrr harrr. Eventually I adjusted the games settings to max (get a good 87fps with VSYNC OFF (see profile for specs) and began a new game. It starts off at the dig site from the first film where we first meet Dr. Grant and then a helicopter takes you to choose between Jurassic Park and Jurassic World. Jurassic Park's two sequels will be unlocked after the first games story is complete. Playing through the story follows the movies plot and looks beautiful while doing it. Various characters and dinosaurs YES DINOSAURS can be unlocked for you to take control of, each with their various uses. A few minor glitches and texture pop ins here and there but this is a strong game that actually released without being broken. I will continue this review as I finish each movie. I am up to the 2nd one now.\n","June 30, 2015","true","6.7"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","22","26","3","0"

But this one has blew me away! You can play this game not already watching the franchise, and everything is picture perfect for when you do eventually watch the movies.\n\nThis is the first LEGO game where they have actually taken vocal samples from the original movie, and yes, at times it isn't perfect, as it is very difficult to vocal sample for a movie 20 years ago, but they did a good job overall.\n\nOnce you start the game, you a free to roam around the park freely, visiting the different sights before you have to play through them, for example, before going straight to the visitor centre like the game told me to, I went to the velociraptor pen, where I was greeting with many different achievements and side quests, like rescuing the park staff from different scenarios.\n\nI have just finished my first play through of the first movie, and every essence of the movie is captured, I knew what was coming next in the game without playing it previously. So hopefully the other 3 movies will be the same, hopefully will watch Jurassic World before I actually end up playing through the game, as I want the element of surprise when I do watch it for the first time, so I need to go and see it very soon.\n\nTo conclude, it is a great game so far, and look forward to finishing it. After completing 1 movie, and got a few  True Survivor  gold bricks etc. I am only 9.2% through the game, so I have no doubt that this game will bring many surprises in its vast open world.","June 12, 2015","true","25.6"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","5"

It's the same LEGO game you expect from Tt Games. If you've played any franchised LEGO game in the past (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Batman, etc) then you already know what kind of game this is.\n\nPros:\n-It's freaking Jurassic Park! All four movies (don't play the fourth until you've seen the movie, the plot is in here)\n-Great graphics\n-Soundrack straight from the movies\n-The real dinosaur sounds and most of the cast members use their own voices for even animation grunts\n-Fun for the whole family or a lonely 30-year-old\n-Lots of replayability, more-so than your previous LEGO games. Lots of side activities to do\n-Customize your own dinos!\n\nCons:\n-Each movie set of levels are rather short. Was able to complete Jurassic Park 1 in just over an hour or two, not counting all the Freeroam stuff I did.\n-They use dialogue from the movies. Why is this a con? Well especially for Jurassic Park 1, it's a 20 year old movie, the sound quality doesn't match the rest of the game. This is VERY obvious for some reason with Dr. Alan Grant's lines. They sound lo-fi and almost static-y.\n-Compys. You will -hate- the Compys in any level they appear. Just go play the first level of The Lost World and you'll see what I mean\n\nOverall I'd say this: Are you a fan of previous LEGO games? Then you'll want this one for sure. Are you a Jurassic Park fan? This game delivers, how they change each movie scene to be LEGO friendly is rather creative and funny. If you don't like the style of LEGO games, well... what do you expect here?

A couple of years ago, any new super hero flick was accompanied with an eponymous game with dreadful playability. I guess publishers learned a thing or two. I also think that Travelers Tales pretty much takes on any job it gets to fill in the void because they're making games of literally everything as long as it is in Lego.\n\nSo the trade is simple. No more bad movie games in exchange for Lego? Seems like a dead giveaway. The Lego games are known for their simple and addictive, but family friendly gameplay and presentation. And since they're basically all running on the same engine; easy to churn out like they're Five Nights at Freddy's. For Jurassic World TT quickly assembled a cast from the entire Jurassic Park series, built overworlds and stages and also made a few lego dinosaurs. Everything fits the mold perfectly and it works. In fact, the formula has been perfected to such a degree it becomes hard to really blame it for being completely unoriginal.\n\nThe thing that really sells lego games for me is the character roster. Sometimes over 200 characters can be collected; and the batman series and marvel entry did a good job at making it worthwhile to collect these figurines. However, Jurassic World fails to build on this because you want to play with dinosaurs, yet, you're stuck with people. It's a bit of miss. But if you're looking to play the island adventure from 1993 or 2015, you can't really go wrong with the Lego formula.","July 16, 2015","true","25.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Levels closely resembles all four jurassic films, with slight modifications in scenes to make it more funny (like most other lego games). What makes it unique from older LEGO games is that in every scene characters are given dialogues (makes it less boring) – actors from films provided new dialouges to their characters for this game.\n\nAs always, custom characters can be made, but this time, hybrid dinosaurs can be created too. Wide variety of vehicles can be used in free mode. Also tones of bonus levels\n\nPlaying on a MacBook Air with 1.3GHz processor (below minimum requirements), It runs well with no bugs at all, no glitches . The only 'bug' i found is when pausing the game instantly after a cutscene, freezing the whole game (easily avoidable)\n\nUser friendly.\n\nYES i would reccommend this game. TO people who say this game keeps breaking: Have you met your minimum requirements? DO you have the supported video cards? Really do check before making any purchase.","July 29, 2015","true","27.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I recommend it, but you have to know that its the same old Lego formula with no innovation whatsoever.\n\nPros:\n\n+ runs super smooth\n+ great controller layout\n+ pretty lenghty game (a little bit too stretched out at times)\n+ easy to understand even for younger kids\n+ beautiful graphics\n+ love for detail, the world is filled with easter eggs and little nods to the Jurassic Park universe\n+ local coop\n+ all Jurassic Park movies were recreated\n+ various characters that have different abilities, even the smallest staff member is in here\n+ they didnt just recreate scenes from the movies, they actually thought out clever new levels, sceneres and additional paths for the heroes to go through, along with a faithful Lego recreation of the beloved movies\n+ in the german dub, many voice actors from the original movie reprised their roles, which is fantastic\n+ Nvidia 3D TV Play looks awesome. Like its meant to be played in stereoscopic 3D (even cutscenes are 3D)\n+ create-your-own-dinosaur\n+ replayability if you want all the characters and collectibles\n\nCons:\n\n- unfortunatley its the same old formula that is being used for EVERY Lego game, destroy everything, pick up coins, build something to unlock new path and repeat, it gets old pretty fast. I was disappointed to see that they didnt even try something new\n- picking up coins is a chore, its not particulary neccessary but you still kinda want to see what you can unlock, picking coins up stretches the games lenght by a lot and is just tedious\n- breaking all the stuff breaks immersion a little bit, a character is in danger and you gotta hurry, but instead you search slowly through the level what to break to get all the coins.....it slows down the games action scenes by a lot\n- coop partners still can hurt each other.....why? there is no reason why you could hit each other in these type of games. Especially when you are playing with a younger kid that smashes the punch button to break all the blocks in the level, comboing the partner to death....its not really coop friendly\n- they approached a new open world feel, but ultimatley I whished they would have gone back to a simple level select screen, its tedious to get to the next location and its not clear where you can buy or unlock new things\n- the DLCs are terrible! Absolutley cosmetic, but the text makes you belive you get to be a tourist in Jurassic World, but its just a usless skin, the same goes for vehicles, every car feels the same\n\nOverall its a Lego game. Can be fun in coop and looks beautiful. Personally I get tired of the same game with different license, but if you like that definitley get this one too. Its faithful to the movies and universe. A fun ride to enjoy.\n","August 30, 2015","true","15.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The movies have been portrayed quite accurately, kid friendly and humorous and the characters voices are well done, with some being pulled straight from the film, such as Ian Malcolm and his famous quotes. The levels with a lot of action are superb which includes escaping the T rex in the classic jeep. The addition of being able to play as the dinosaurs makes this game a 10/10 LEGO game experience.  This is Best Jurassic park game ever , İts very fun to play , i like all characters all character sound same in the film , film musics , decorations , graphics ,atmospehere dinosaurs VERY VERY Beautiful game %100 must play , Me i love jurassic films i watch all movies 10 times and i watch jurassic world 6 times and i happy for this game for sme as the films  looks like i gona waste sooo much time on this game , VERY VERY BEST STORY LİNE SAME İS MOVİES LEGO Jurassic World strikes an excellent balance between delivering a nostalgic take on a beloved series of movies, whilst incorporating the brand new Jurassic World storyline.  AND LEGO Jurassic World is probably one of the best Lego games I've ever played! I really love the 4 movies, 5 levels thing. I also am happy that some of the levels are not ridiculously LONG like they were in Lego batman 3. The Graphics look VERY smooth, polished and better than ever before!

I'll go over what I liked first:\n\n- The gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from Lego games. Run around, break things, collect studs, solve puzzles, collect bricks, grind your way towards 100% completion. If you've been liking past Lego games, you'll feel right at home with the gameplay here.\n\n- Like all Lego games of this type, it's a very faithful and humorous re-telling of the four movies it covers. There are a lot of humorous moments, and a lot of the cracks it makes at the movies had me laughing a fair bit.\n\n- The graphics are gorgeous. It's colorful and detailed, as you'd expect from Lego games.\n\n- The free roam areas are pretty awesome. Though they are a bit linear, they are full of things to do, and the amount of detail put into them is incredible. There's a free roam map for each movie, allowing for a good amount of variety.\n\nAll-in-all, the game itself is great. However, it's held back by an awful amount of bugs. Here's just a few of what I've encountered:\n\n- In one level, a couple of the NPCs simply floated off into the sky for no particular reason.\n\n- A few chase levels have the dinosaur chasing you glitch out, so it disappears, and you're left with nothing chasing you.\n\n- One red brick wouldn't appear until I restarted my game.\n\n- One red brick DID appear before I even attempted to do a puzzle because my AI partner somehow squeezed himself into the final part of the puzzle.\n\n- In a couple of levels, I randomly fell through the floor, falling forever.\n\n- Several times, I got stuck in some of the background, making progress impossible without restarting the level.\n\n- There have been some invisible walls in various areas, particuarly in the green tubes that the small dinos use. Some have literally been impossible to exit because of random invisible walls.\n\n- Some of the raptor jump levers literally will not let you all the way up onto the platforms you're trying to reach, so you have to fight the controls and the background a bit to finally push yourself up.\n\n- In one bonus level where you play as the Indominous Rex, it literally does not appear, so you can't do anything.\n\n- I rescued a Worker In Peril, but it didn't count towards the peril count for some reason, and now the game is acting like she's there when she's not, rendering 100% completion impossible.\n\n- The game has crashed on me several times.\n\nThat's just what comes off the top of my head. There may be more I'm forgetting. One or two glitches, I can understand, but this game is literally plain unfinished. The developers rushed this through the gates without even so much as doing a simple bug-test. A lot of these bugs are things you'll find just through doing a normal playthrough of the game.\n\nI've nearly completed the game, but I can't get 100% because of the missing worker. This playthrough has had its moments of fun, but it's also been nothing short of irritating and mind-boggingly tedious.\n\nIf and when a patch comes out, I'd say get this game, but until then, save your money.","June 17, 2015","false","33.3"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","19","33","0","0"

The game "sort of" has open world free roam, but not to the extent of what people hope for. But then again this is a mindless game which is why I bought it.\n\nOne thing that kind of  struck me odd was that they actually used real voices in this from the movie; tradtionally these Lego games don't have dialogue and is a bunch of "hmm?" "hmmm." "hummmph?" lego jibberish, but this one has clips taken from the films. So it's a bit weird coming from some of the older lego games to all of a sudden have voices. They don't take away from the gameplay (which is great) but its still initially struck odd.\n\nSurprisngly, I feel like my money was worth spent regardless of the change that they made. Which is hard to say about a lot of steam games. It brought me back to nostalgia from nearly 20 years ago and I'm thankful for that. The humor in Lego games is still there, so nothing lost in that department either.\n\nI can't really play through all the way until I see the movie since I don't want spoilers.

Best thing is to play as every dinosaur in the game (about 30 dinos), but only dinos that are about the size of a baby triceratops (small) are available in free play. The medium and large dinos are playable only if there is a dino spawner in an area, and only in the free roam world. You cannot leave those areas as a medium/large dino. Using the miniturize red brick while playing as a huge dinosaur is pretty funny. They put alot of detail into objects made of legos and the vehicles look amazing. Still fun to watch the cutscenes. Same old boring stuff from past games.\n\nGold bricks are still useless. You smash mini lego buildings and rocks as a t-rex in a flat map as a reward for 275 gold bricks. Bull. ♥♥♥♥. Half of all the characters are random generic people or workers. There is almost no point in the character creator. Minikits are dino skeletons which are playable. Dino customizer is neat, because you can make dinos have different abilities they normally dont. Lego needs to stop making chase levels. You have to play them multiple times to get the collectibles that you cannot see since you can only see behind. The button pressing to do an action is getting old.\n\n","October 24, 2015","true","37.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Jurassic Park and Lego how epic can this be?\n\nWell let's just say, that it's brilliant, it's easily become my 2nd  favourite Lego game of all time (JUST behind Lego Worlds) and my 2nd favourite Jurassic Park game of all time (Which is Jurassic Park Operation Genesis) *WARNING* This review contains spoilers for all 4 movies and the game!\n\nPros:\n\nVERY faithful to the movies, I mean every scene is recreated (except for one but I'll go after that later) and it's so much fun to run around the islands and story mode.\n\nThe Hub worlds are brilliant, they are massive compared to all the other Lego games, and they are so big that they added teleports so you can get around faster! Plus there's a lot to do in the Hub worlds like solve puzzles with characters that you unlock in the story!\n\nNearly all the characters have a purpose! One of my main complaints in previous Lego games is that some characters feel like they have no use at all, I mean for an example in Lego Star Wars 2 you get R2-D2 and C-3PO who unlock special doors for certain areas, C-3PO cannot attack while R2-D2 can attack enemies and hover for a short while, HOWEVER as soon as you get either 2 characters called IG-88 and 4-LOM, they can access BOTH doors that R2 and C-3 can both use, plus attack and throw bombs, thus making R2 and C-3 useless. Here in Lego Jurassic World however, everyone has a purpose and nobody becomes useless as the game progresses. However Mr DNA and Pachycephalosaurus are kinda OP since Mr DNA makes some characters useless like John Hammond, and Pachycephalosaurus makes Triceratops useless since you can play her anytime you want and jump, while you can play as a baby Triceratops whenever, she can’t jump.\n\nThe Dinosaurs are fun to control and finding the ambers which they hide in are fantastic, Minikits also make a return and are fun to collect! Red Bricks make a return and so do Gold Bricks and trust me when I say, all are very addicting to collect.\n\nMaking your own Hybrid Dinosaurs is a lot of fun, easy and fun to control, however it’s required to get 100% in the game, so I suggest you make a Raptor with a T-Rex head, because in the game there are areas the T-Rex need to destroy some items with her roar, however she cannot fit into those areas, so if you make a custom Raptor with the T-Rex head, you can go in and destroy those objects.\n\nThis game tries to fix all the bad 2 and 3 caused! For an example in Jurassic Park 3 the T-Rex was killed by the Spinosaurus, however this time you can change it! The T-Rex now beats the s*** out of Spinosaurus and lives at the end! Another example is in Jurassic Park 2 they made the story interesting! (Seriously 2 in my eyes was just a bad movie, the ending with the T-Rex attacking the city was the only good thing) Plus they make fun of some of the movie's logic, like in Jurassic Park 2 a guy runs away from a snake while in a waterfall... while a T-Rex is waiting for him outside, and when he runs, the T-Rex comes in and looks at the other characters and give that look to say "Did he real do that?" while the others nod.\n\nThe biggest pro of this game is it's humour, since this game is more childish then serious, a lot of scary and gory scenes are replaced with very funny scenes, for an example the guy who says "Clever Girl" gets a Banana in his gun and a Raptor wear's a fruit hat! There are so many moments that made me laugh and there's so many of them! I mean I easily took 50 screenshots in my first playthrough, there are too many brilliant moments.\n\nCons:\n\nControls are very strange, I mean you don't use the mouse ONCE in your adventure, HJK are all used for Quicktime events, some vehicles use WASD while others use ADJY to drive! WHAT?\n\nVery easy compared to most Lego games, the puzzles were easy and the bosses are easy too.\n\nBuggy in some areas, however these aren't gamebreaking bugs, the worst ones were when you were being chased by Spinosaurus, it's supposed to disappear off-screen chasing a Parasaurolophus, however both get stuck and you end up being chased by nothing, THEN SPINOSAURUS APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE! The only gamebreaking glitch was with Paul Kirby where he didn't use his hook for some reason, however I fixed it by restarting the level.\n\nRemember when Rambo The Videogame used a crappy DvD to do the voiceacting? Well this game did the same, some scenes sound AWFUL while others aren't as bad, I mean the first line Ellie Sattler says in the first Jurassic Park SOUNDS SO OUT OF PLACE! Jurassic World has new lines in it (I think) however the rest of the flims/chapters use all voiceacting from the actual movies, again some sound decent, some sound good, MOST SOUND BAD!\n\nMinikit rewards could have been better, it's just a skeleton version of the dinosaurs you can already play as, it would be cool if we got some new dinosaurs when we collect them.\n\nSome Dinosaurs are missing, the most noticeable one is Ceratosaurus, however the scene he's in Jurassic Park 3 is gone from this game so that's possibly why. Some other missing dinosaurs are Dryosaurus, Maiasaura and Segisaurus, but even then, nearly all of them that are missing are only mentioned in the movies or hidden in brochures, except for Ceratosaurus of course.\n\nVery weak DLC, no new areas or cool content, most of the content are just reskinned characters and cars that should have been in the game to begin with.\n\n\n\nOverall Lego Jurassic World is a brilliant game, and any Jurassic Park fans OR Lego fans must have this game in their collections.\n\nAlso I’m gonna post a little mini review on all the movies.\nWhy? Cause I want to.\n\nJurassic Park 1: Brilliant movie, CGI and Models for the dinosaurs still hold up and the acting is brilliant, the story keeps you engaged and so many memorable moments, a must have to see, it’s tied for my favourite Jurassic Park movie.\n\nJurassic Park 2 The Lost World: Stiff acting and the story is just uninteresting, the best part I mentioned is the last few scenes and that’s about it. However similar to the original, the CGI still holds up and so do the Models. Plus the movie is full of dumb moments… like… *sighs* the “kick” Ian’s daughter does to a Raptor.\n\nJurassic Park 3: The shortest of all the films and my 2nd favourite, the acting is not as bad as Jurassic Park 2, but the moments the movie tries to make falls flat on its face since the acting is mediocre. Dr Jones is easily the best actor out of this, the Spinosaurus is scary and I’m happy to see my 2nd favourite dinosaur of all time be the star of a movie. Also the scene in the “giant bird cage” is quite good actually. Underrated movie in my opinon and I suggest you check it out sometime, it's no where as good as the orignal Jurassic Park, but it's a fun movie.\n\nJurassic World: Tied as my favourite Jurassic Park movie, it’s the opposite to the original, rather about the people and how they are surviving the situation, it’s more on the Dinosaurs and the action, the acting in this movie is decent and is definitely better then 2 and 3’s acting. Indominus Rex is a brilliant idea, but a bit over the top, I mean it can change the colour of its skin to camouflage better? That’s a bit silly, also giving it more intelligence then a Raptor is again very silly. Overall Jurassic World is the sequel the orignal deserved.","January 3","true","22.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've played almost all the lego games on multiple platforms but Lego Jurassic World, Pirates of the Caribbean and Batman 2 & 3 were played on my computer with my wired xbox controller.  My review is based on 100% completion of the game and achievements.  I have previously 100% all three Lego Batmans, Pirates of the Carribbean, Lego Movie, and the first Lego Indiana Jones.  With all that said let's get into the meat of this.\nThe length it took me to finish this game reminds me of some of the earlier Lego games.  Forty hours compared to how long it took me to do Lego Batman 3 and Lego Marvel really isn't much.  I didn't run into some of the same game stopping glitches that others have but that doesn't mean that my game experience was entirely glitch free unfortunately.  There were two very prevalent glitches I ran into.  The first was when a character went to jump a fence quite a few times the character would instead fall through the island and into the abyss never to be seen again.  This usually lead to me having to restart the level, checkpoint or free play depending on what I was doing.  The second one was in one of the bonus levels in Jurassic World.  For whatever reason the dinosaur would just not appear on screen and you couldn't see what you were doing. Sometimes it would magically appear but most of time it wouldn't.  If anyone else is having this problem I waited to do the level until I got the attract studs brick and one of the stud multipliers.  Doesn't really matter if you can see the dinosaur when you have those.  I also had a problem with characters and dinosaurs disappearing and reappearing or just magically ending up in the abyss.  In Gyroscope Valley my character in the gyroscope suddenly disappeared and ended up in the abyss.  I had to start the level over again from the last checkpoint only to be surprised to find that the game hadn't saved my last checkpoint and I had to start over again.  For once it would be nice if Lego would put out a game that didn't have so many glitches.\nSo why do I still recommend this game?  Well despite some annoying aspects (above named glitches and a very repetitive storyline gameplay) I still had fun with the game mostly for two reasons... the dinosaurs and Mr. DNA.  Yes Mr. DNA is your guide in this game and is also a playable character later on.  He's one you'll want to buy right away because he can hack, acess igen terminals, dig in dino poop (yes characters dig in dino poop), hit targets, track and do the genius equations.  Very valuable especially in free play.  Most dinosaurs are fun to control and can all be customized.  The only one I wasn't fond of was the brachio.  It was big and hard to manuver.  The apo can do what the brachio can and is much smaller.  There are certain things you can't do in free roam/play without the proper dinosaur.   You either need to find the dinosaur's corresponding amber in the levels or customize a dinosaur, only you can't customize a dinosaur with that ability unless you find the dinosaur that has it in the levels first. The biggies are the poison shooting dinosaur and the t. rex from Jurassic Park, the compy from Lost World, either the brachio or the apo, there are a lot of dinos for cracked objects but the one I found worked best was the pachy and the indominous and the swimming dinosaur for parts in Jurassic World.  Some of the other dinosaurs are unnecessary for anything but fun to play around with.\nNow as I said above the gameplay is rather repetitive.  Each movie is pretty much set up the same way with quite a few chase sequences.  It was cool at first but got kinda annoying by Jurassic World.  The one kinda cool thing is they actually use dialogue from the movies in the cut scenes.  I'll admit I couldn't always understand what was being said, the movies were shot twenty years ago, but it was still kinda cool hearing Jeff Goldblum's voice coming out of this little lego character.  While the gameplay wasn't always to my liking the story was a fun lego twist on the original.\nA few things to note: There are terminals with a blue circle and an I inside spread all over each of the four hubs.  Make sure you stop at each one of these because not all the gold bricks, red bricks, workers in peril will show up on your map unless you do and you'll be flying blind until you get detectors.  Also there is an area in Jurassic Park III where you have to cross in order to get a collectible.  Make sure you have the destroy all objects brick shut off if it's on becuase when you go to jump on the barrels to get across it'll destroy the barrels and you'll end up in the water.  If you forget there is a way to get the barrels back should you make this mistake.  Go to one of the terminals I told you about and use the map to go to another location.  Once there go back to the map and pick to go back to the location.  It will ask if you want to go back at night or day.  Pick the opposite of what it was when you destroyed the barrels.  When you go back the barrels will magically reappear.  Finding the terminals are really important cause it allows to move from place to place and park to park easier so make sure you stop at them all.\nThe only other comment that I can make on the game are these:\n- The graphics are gorgeous.  Best out of all the Lego games.\n- The vechicles are slowly becoming easier to control with each game.  Some of the races weren't as bad in this game if you found the right vechicle (Note: buy the gyroscope as soon as it becomes available.  You will need it for some of the hub stuff.)\n- While the vechicles are easier to control there was a boat that was absolutely awful.  I had to do that race like twenty times before I got it.  The race with the swimming dinosaur was also a bit tedious.  Lego still needs to work on controlling things in water a bit.\n- The little bit of flying was better than previous games but still needs some work\n- There was one red brick called compy mode that you can't get without the swimming dinosaur.  It was the last red brick I got when I was already done with the game.  I wish I'd gotten it earlier because it shrunk people to compy size and they started moving really fast.  It was kinda cute.  There was another brick that made everyone talk like they were on helium.  That was kinda cute for awhile too.\nWhile I do recommend the game I also recommend waiting for an update and the price drop as well.  Paying $30 on steam instead of $60 on my PS4 made some of the glitches a little more bearable.  Hopefully there'll be an update soon.  Unto Lego Avengers.","June 25, 2015","true","46.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Basing a Lego game off of a great movie and three cash ins. Well its been done since 93, but not this well.\nLet me say this is my third or forth Lego I played, and the second one I owned. Yet this is the first one I really am getting into. I accually can not tell you 100% why I like this one much more then the Hobbit. But I will try. As for Jurassic Park games. Well I think I have played and own all of them. Or almost. Starting in 93 with the SNES and Genesis. Even Tresspasser and the Game Com Lost World. Lets forget about them. God knows I try. This game is good thankfully and easily the best JP game so far to me.\nThe puzzles seem simpler as there are not as many characters to shift through to find one with the ability you need. The setting seems better designed. For the most part everywhere you are seems interesting, and I was concerned that it would fail on this. Seeing how the other settings have more fantasy. Like Middle Earth or Gothem. No so. Everything feels like it is from the movie, and natural. Well as natural as LEGOs can do. The combat is... Well there is not much. So that should hurt it right? Nope. They have integrated the movies and level design so well it is not a thing at all. It's like Posi-track and duct tape. It just works.\nSo then to graphics. Top notch. Seriously this is a good looking game. I play all high visual games and yet this one really does look good. I thought the lego dinos would ruin this game, I was wronge. They seem kiddie, but they accually seem more fun this way.\nThe LEGO Silliness.(Since you know the story of this) The Humor is done very well. Much more polished then the other titles I have played. They handle death well.(It is kid frienldly and how I would imagine a kid would handle it) There were even a few moments where I started laughing. (My wife heard me one time and said,"What are you laughing at?" "Jurassic Park" "The orginal?" "Yes" "Do I need to call someone?" "No." "Are you sure? Cause thats messed up.") Really done surprisingly well. If you like slap stick this is for you. I never laughed at their other games, but here it is just funny at times.\nAudio is good. But as everyone has said the older movies voice over don't sound good at times. One is so bad I was just thinking. Yeah this is how you don't do it. Any game now. How bad is the voice sound. Oh its LEGO Jurassic World Hammond in the trailer bad? Wow! Yeah a new low. The rest is good and at time stellar. The music is awesome ofcourse.\nOverall the game play is a Lego game, but this is exceptional Lego game. It is also a Jurassic Park game, and possibly the best Jurassic Park game. So I look at games dollar per hour played. $13 and this has easily 20 hours of good content. This is a buy, and on sale it is a deal.","December 28, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Complete with sound clips from the actual movies for voice overs, you can not only play as Dr. Grant and Dr. Malcom, you hear the actual character voices from the movies. They aren't people immitating the voices, its the actual voices from the movies themselves, so you hear Sam Neil as Dr. Grant and Chris Pratt as Owen Grady. Nice touch.\n\nThere are actually 4 hubs in the game, one for each of the Jurassic Park movies. While navigating between the hubs can be tedious at times, I can't really find any fault in the game because of the humor, voice clips, music, and faithful recreations of iconic scenes in LEGO fashion.\n\nWho doesn't love to see Rexy win against the I-Rex or Kelly Malcom owning a Raptor with Gymnastics?\n\nJust like my review of LEGO Marvel Superheroes, I would recommend playing with an XBox controller, as the keyboard controls can feel clunky with it emulating a controller setup.","February 29","true","26.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Plain and simple. It's the best Jurassic Park game since Operation Genesis (not that there was much competition). There are characters abound! You can be Alan Grant, Ian Malcom, Robert Muldoon. Hell if you want you can be John Hammond and beat down dinosaurs with your amber cane!\nOh yeah you can be dinosaurs too. Including the awesome wonderous sauropods and terrible T-rex!\n\nThough unless you're a major fan or have a good amount of cash I'd say wait for a sale. Then again I bought it for the full price since I had been excited for this game for months before hand.\nThough if you're a fan of Muldoon I especially recommend you buy this game, as his fate is similar to within the book (a far better product than the film).\n\nI've encountered only one extremely minor glitch which was fixed by simply reloading the level, this is coming from someone with allow end PC and long long long loading screens in this game. It was the one in the shed with the lever if anyone cares. That is very good for a game of this price these days, far less glitches than recent Lego games I've played by a long shot.\n\nAnyway enough review writing! I'm going back to shooting dinosaurs as Muldoon!","July 31, 2015","true","37.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Yep, 3D casual platformer based on license. Released in 2015, based on all 4 Jurassic Park movies. It also was released for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and WiiU. Yes, PC wasn't cut in any way, so everything is good. It also had handheld release for 3DS and Vita, which is your usual lesser, yet different enough that fans might check those out. Maybe.\n\nBut first thing you must do before playing this game is to go to options and switch DirectX from 11 to 9. There are too many reports of glitches exclusive to DirectX 11. Even more, it seems that game's saves are tied to DirectX. As in, I seen reports that people were not able to load their old save which they switched from 11 to 9. So yea, do that immeditly.\nThose who still have various progress-halting bugs are also recommended to activate V-Sync. It actually fixed some things in old Lego games too.\n\nAnd yea, like other recent Lego games, it's still is full of various bugs, from crashes to getting stuck in geometry. Personally, it glitched on me on the first launch, where it got stuck in background process and I couldn't end it, so I had to reboot PC. And the final scenes in final level seemed showed me some wonky collision glitches that I was worried that the game is about to just break down like a card construction. Made of lego.\n\nI also recommend using gamepad. Was designed for that. At least it would make circular cranes less annoying, as on gamepad you are supposed to circle analog around.\n\nAnyway, it's yet another Lego game. You know what I mean. Casual. Can't die. Punch things. Hold button to build out of some things you punched. Collect studs. Feel yourself having OCD.\nIt's good. It's stale.\n\nNothing much new there. Dinos. Bringing minigames and such from previous Lego titles. I don't think that this one has any new one. Well, maybe "repeat input" one for various terminals or such.\n\nIt also keeps the usual Lego charm. In this one no one technically dies. No one important and in cutscene, that is. Which is fancy. Waiting for Rampage Edition though.\n\nGameplay is also isn't focused on combat which is pretty much always a good thing in Lego games from Travellers Tales. Albeit when it does, it's probably a flock of those annoying tiny dinos that swarm you and each takes two hits to takedown. Which isn't exactly fun. But at least the game is fast paced. In a sense that it keeps moving on at about time it's about to get really boring.\n\nAnyway, it's kinda good. Brings nothing new. I liked music at least. But I am never buying a new Lego game ever again. Because it's stale in no end.\nToo bad that these licensed Lego games inflood will never stop.","March 2","true","19.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

We're up to three crashes and a BSoD so far, and keep in mind, this is the supposdely MORE stable version (DX9), with D3D11 completely unsupported on 32-bit systems.  If you're still on 32-bit OS's, steer clear.  As for 64-bit?  Moving on!\n\nI felt like Malcolm was sitting in the room repeating "chaos theory" every minute with the launch of this game.  For such a simple game, a new engine and rushed deadline led to a rather unstable and broken PC launch.  However, the issues have been smoothed out, so we can look past it.  The stories of the four Jurassic Park movies are told very well in the LEGO format, altering the script for more humorous situations and making the most of every situation.  It feels like a real improvement over previous games, and you still have to give Traveller's Tales credit for making one of the only E rated AAA releases this year.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is that at times, it felt a little too childish.  Namely, I'm talking about flat-out censoring a lot of scenes, or rewriting them with cop-out happy endings.  The original LEGO games were at least a general audience, but what kills a lot of the humor in this game is how they suddenly cut back to ruin the punchline with "but see!  He's actually perfectly fine and not in any danger whatsoever!  Nobody died!"  Moments like these really kill it.  It feels like that ending scene to the Muppets reboot, where they showed a rather interesting plot-twist just to ruin it after the credits.\n\nAlso, the puzzles are a bit too simplistic, making this more of a beach-read than a game... though I can overlook that bit, given the audience.  Still, "Simon Says" is about the most challenge you'll ever get from it, and it's more of an interactive movie than anything.\n\nUnlike other LEGO games, 70% of the combat has been replaced with chase scenes... which makes sense, since y'know, they're dinos and not 5-foot robots, but it still tarnishes a large part of the game by leaving almost no unscripted events.\n\nMy biggest complaint, by far, has to be the voices.  I've had this problem with all of the recent Lego games; I don't like the fact that they're using actual movie lines.  In the older titles, they were speechless, and got along with gibberish and grunts.  Tt used this to their advantage, to take a humorous spin on many scenes.  For example, in the original Lego Star Wars, there was a scene where battledroids blew up a ship, and the pilots sat there in mid-air before looking at each other, then the ground, and yelled at the same time before falling and exploding into legos.  Here, they're cutting audio directly from the movie.  If you've watched it, you already know it, and they don't do anything special with it.  They don't even have actual files, they just cut the audio directly out of the films, and the audio quality suffers for it.  I really wish Tt would go back to the old ways with this.\n\nOther than that, I still recommend the game.  As one of the last franchises to bear a kid-friendly rating, Tt still delivers a rather entertaining spin on the movies, and let's face it, I've always wanted them to take a stab at the original three Jurassic Park movies.

I've not ran into any of the bugs/lvl stopping things that have prevented me from continuing that others have reported.  I was a bit disappointed at first at the game length (I finished the first main story in less than 5hrs, The Hobbit took me 12hrs not including free play) but then saw the Lost Worlds sign near the Helicopter to continue on with the next main story.  The game is $44 (Although, I got it on sale) so I'd definitely expect more than 5hrs of game play for that price tag, nice to see it was just me not be observant and not a lack of game play time to be had.","June 17, 2015","true","59.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elliottmarcjones/recommended/352400/","elliottmarcjones","Elliott Marc Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elliottmarcjones/","50 products in account","LEGO Jurassic World is an amazing game, and probably one of the most thought out and well executed LEGO games to date. Unlike some other LEGO games, Jurassic World really does manage to give every main character a completely unique ability which actually makes sense and is enjoyable to use. LEGO Jurrasic World also manages to sucesfully tackle one of the biggest problems LEGO The Movie Video Game had, which was a lack of important characters. Instead of just having all of the levels be played by the same characters over and over again like in LEGO The Movie Video Game, LEGO Jurassic World not only allows the player to control dinosaurs but forces the player to if they want to complete and finish the game, this adds a whole new level of depth to the game and feels very refreshing from the established LEGO video game formula. As with all LEGO video games for the PC, the controls aren't very good and the game plays better if you use a controller. Saying that, the keyboard controlls are noticebly better than the ones in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes. The levels are quite interesting and don't feel too repetitive however the levels for the first and fourth movie are the best and seem to have had the most work put into them. After completing the story, there are many things you can still do, such as complete races, heal dinosaurs and save workers in peril. If you have ever liked a LEGO game before, then LEGO Jurrasic World will be a welcomed and refreshing addition to your Steam game library.","May 23","true","13.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It doesn't change the formula in the slightest.  This has its upsides and its downsides because of it.\n\nPros:\nClassic Lego gameplay.  You break stuff, you collect studs, you build things, you solve rudementary puzzles, it's all the classic lego games, just with a jurassic park skin.\n\nStories are handled rather well.  They (mostly) keep true to the stories, they're presented in a fun way, it's well done.\n\nClassic Lego humor is back.  Lego Marvel was lacking a lot of the classic lego slapstick, this has brought it back.  Characters do silly things, there are plenty of visual gags to laugh at.\n\nYou get to play as dinosaurs (some of them, see cons for an explaination)\n\n\nCons:\nLet's get the big one out of the way, it's glitchy.  This is the glitchiest Lego game I've ever played.  There are puzzles that require raptors to jump on certain things.  I believe there are 5 times you have to do this in the story.  Of the 5 times I tried it, 4 had the raptors getting stuck in midair.  Waiting about 30 seconds finished the animation and I thankfully didn't have to restart any of the levels, but I was dreading each time I'd have to do the raptor jump to progress the game.  I've also had issues with characters getting stuck on objects, compies not being able to get out of tubes, animations glitching out.  It's a glitchy game.  I personally didn't have any gamebreaking glitches, but the ones I experienced certainly had the potential to be gamebreaking.\n\nThe voice acting.  This is a problem I've had with every lego game since they started with it in Lego Lord of the Rings.  I don't like the voice acting in lego games to begin with, it works much better in games like Lego Star Wars where the stories are told purely visually.  Lego Jurassic World is the worst of the worst when it comes to voice acting.  Like in the lord of the rings, they decided to use clips of audio taken directly from the movies.  I'm not sure if they were aware of this while making hte game, but sound quality in movies from the 1990s wasn't exactly very good.  It's even more apparent when there are background npcs that have freshly recorded lines form the 2010s.  The difference is instantly noticable, and it's really really badly done.\n\nStrangly anti-death.  In a video game series full of comedic violence and cartoonish death scenes, it's strange to see the lego games go so anti-death with Jurassic Park.  No one dies in the game.  All the people that get eaten don't actually die.  They either get tickled by raptors, or if they do get eaten by a T-Rex, they are vomited out by the end, totally unharmed.  It's very unusually that they'd be this anti-death with such a death filled movie in a series of games that has never been shy about death.  Very strange.\n\nHonestly, it's kind of boring.  The other lego games typically had action based characters, Jedi, Super heroes, Indiana Jones, Magic.  Characters that get into combat based situations, that have special powers, interesting things like this.  Jurassic Park consists of people running away and screaming.  Aside from the main characters, no one is really memorable.  There are a ton of characters to unlock, and only about 15 that you'll actually know.  The unique and cool "powers" these characters have consist of screaming to break glass, but only sometimes, and that's really about it.  All of the other powers have already been explored in other lego games, girls jump higher (which makes no sense but whatever), kids can climb in ducts, people with guns can shoot things, ect.\n\n\n\nLego Jurassic World may well be the first lego game that I have no interest in 100%ing.  I've beaten the story and it's honestly too boring to bother getting the minikits, gold bricks, red bricks and unlocking the other characters.  The level structure, not to mention the hub world, are so either dull or poorly made that I just don't want to bother.","June 28, 2015","false","13.2"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","14","30","0","0"

First level ( Prolouge) was fairly good ( I'm guessing LEGO bothered un glitching that as it's probably the game's demo level ) but it lagged a bit and you could easily tell the original audio from the new. After reaching Isla Nublar for the first time, I went and tried to explore a bit of Jurassic World as a little break from the first movie's story. As soon as I entered the monorail, the audio started and I heard dialoge from the movie plus the new music - but what I didn't get was any video, instead I had to watch 3 minutes of the DNA loading icon spinning slowly while Zach and Grady were talking about the island after seeing for the first time. When the image finally appeared, I was already in a level and had not even seen what any of the Jurassic World characters looked like.\n\nAfter that terrible start to Jurassic World, I went back to the first story and spent 10 minutes riding around in the cars as you enter the park. When I reached the visitor's centre however, the same no image bug happened AGAIN! After 2 minutes or so the image appeared, but no audio came out so I watched a LEGO conversation with no audio for 30 seconds. I was back in the level after that and all was well...for a few minutes. When the story went back to Alan and Ellie's view, once again, no image with audio playing. Worked my way through most of the remaining parts of the level, but when I tried to charge as the Triceritops to get to some wood, my game crashed. Tried again, got past that bug and found another game crashing one a few minutes later.\n\nAnd so here I am, quite disappointed as I have never experienced a single bug like this in my 1 year on Steam, with 18 pounds less than I started with when I wanted to play this game a few hours ago. Fix these bugs LEGO. Make an update and listen to the people complaining here!\n\nThank you for your time, if you hold dear to your money, wait until this game gets updated.\n\n-Dayvis","June 21, 2015","false","0.0"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","0"

This game had a lot of promise, but it's overshadowed by its low quality and poor design. Multple times, I've run into bugs that have made it nearly impossible to progress. The biggest one (the one that caused me to un-install this game) is a glitch where the raptor pouces to grab a switch and gets stuck. Every time that happens, I have to quit out of the game completely (Quit to Desktop) and open the game to try it again. At one point, I thought I could quit back to the main menu to restart that segment, but no. I had to do the Owen part all over again. I closed the game out and uninstalled it.\n\nThis was not the only bug I've encountered. While playing throught the first Jurassic Park game, I've had characters get stuck on terrain, one bug that put the character under the map (had to restart that entire section), one where an objective kept disappearing whenever I got close to it, lego bits that would fly out of bounds, etc. I honestly regret buying this game and I wish I stopped playing sooner.

It isn't funny. Aside from a chuckle or two I got from the raptors and their shenanigans, none of the humour appealed to me. This is partially to blame on the inclusion of voice acting, since the strength of previous LEGO titles was the physical comedy, it was probably one of the main reasons I loved the LEGO series, but it's been diminished significantly in favour of mediocre verbal comedy, which takes away quite a bit of enjoyment from the game.\n\nThe game is strangely anti-death aswell, but I won't dwell too much on that, just know that nodoby dies in LEGO jurassic world, including one character who survived being eaten by being thrown back up a short while later.\n\nHowever, there is fun to be had in LEGO Jurassic World, the gameplay is as strong as ever, it's still the standard LEGO game affair, smash everything and anything breakable in sight, and attentively searching the levels for the minikits (Most of which are well placed) still manages to be both fun and challenging. A lot of detail has also been put into the open world aspect of it. There's also the option to play as dinosaurs, which is as epic as it sounds!\n\nOn the whole though, it's a bit of a mediocre experience for me, but would I recommend the game? Short answer: Probably not. If you love the other LEGO games, you'll probably like this one (If it works for you), however, if your new to the LEGO games, don't buy this one. Get 'LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga' Instead, It's not as buggy, cheaper, funnier and is based on a better film franchise.\n\nTL;DR: Dissappointing. Weak humour, but still has good lego collectathon style gameplay. Not even Jeff Goldblum and playing as a T-Rex could save this one.\n\nFinal Score: 6/10","September 7, 2015","false","31.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

After i purchase this for my daughter we couldnt play for at least 6 months after release because when i started first mission up everything was black, last product i buy from lego.\nOn top of what's current though we had to restart missions twice in beginning because when u do an activity the other lego characters get stuck behind the objects that movied. Also it's buggy where when you hop into a vehicle the others don't do it also always.  I just crashed and i'm updating my review, god forbid i alt tab, when i came back somehow the game was in default resolution not 1920x1080 then it crashed.. the game needs alot of TLC...

And the design of the characters, their mimik and abilitys are great.\n\nBut it's really buggy. You need to fix everything in this game.\nStuds will glitch through the floor, also the female characters then you need them to go further to the next level.\nAnimations will not start or the sound gets weird (or you have no sound).\nI was so happy to play the game, but the bugs started in the FIRST level to make me hate it, 'cause I needed to play with the grafics, read maaaaaaany help posts on steam and invest many hours of turn on and off my computer und restarting the game so oft I can't count anymore.\n\nTo play the game gets really stressful, because I need to otherthink every action I want to make, so I don't accidently break the game.\n\nFor me as a fan I can live with the bugs, but I'm waiting for a patch so that you can play the game without break it.\n\nFor the ones you want to buy it, wait 2-3 months , maybe the game will be pached in this time so you can enjoy the game without problems.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nGERMAN:\nIch liebe dieses Spiel. Es hat den typischen lego Humor, das Design der Levels Charaktere usw. ist sehr stimmungsvoll. Du hast witzige Szenen aber auch "gruselige" Szenen wo hier und da auch mal ein Jumpscare kommt. Trotz Lego Design kann man gut durch die Lichtverhältnisse und der Musik ins Spielgeschehen eintauchen.\n\nDas Problem an dem Spiel sind eindeutig die Bugs! Ich hatte eigentlich in jedem Level einen Bug oder Glitch den ich reparieren musste.\nMan kann das Spiel nicht auf den höchsten Grafiken spielen, weil die Charaktere und Studs sonst durch den Boden glitchen. Wenn man eigentlich schon eine Auflösung eines Fernsehrs hat (als PC Bildschirm) und dann auf 800x600 spielen muss könnt ihr Euch sicher vorstellen ,dass es ziemlich nervt. Ich musste allein sehr viele Stunden investieren um Hilfeposts zu finden da ich es am Tag der Veröffentlichung gekauft hatte und somit noch kaum Hilfeposts existierten.\n\nEs ist nur noch stressig das zu spielen, da ich immer Angst haben muss das das Spiel einfriert oder mir ein Charakter den ich brauche durch die Map fällt. Dies ist sehr Schade da die Musik und die Designs der Level und Welten sehr atmosphärisch sind. Man kommt aber durch die Bugs kaum dazu dies zu genießen.\n\nFazit: Es wäre soo ein tolles Spiel besonders für die Fans der Jurassic Reihe mit Charakteren die wir seit unserer Kindheit lieben, wenn Tt sich etwas mehr Mühe beim Programmieren und Bug-fixing gegeben hätte.\n\nMal ehrlich haben sie ihr eigenes Spiel überhaupt getestet?????\nEine Folge das Lizenz-Film Hypes. Man nimmt sich nicht mehr die Zeit für ein ordentliches Spiel sondern produziert in Eiltempo mit der Filmbranche, sehr Schade!","July 12, 2015","false","31.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The first issue came when I couldn't even enter the main menu due to the game not registering any keys or mouse clicks to enter. After ctrl-alt-deleting to exit and then restarting the game, it allowed me to enter. From this point on EVERY one of the dozen or so times I tried to start the game required a failed attempt into a restart to be able to play.\n\nOnce I got into the game it was fun, though simplistic. I paused it for a moment, and when I tried to unpause it was frozen again. Restart, play, freeze, restart, play, freeze. I did it on purpose a few times just to see if what I thought was happening was happening: you've got about a 50% chance of the game freezing up on you whenever you pause it. Then it takes two more restarts to get back in. And the cutscenes weren't skipabble either, though this may've been because the game was counting this as my 'first time through' because it didn't autosave. I finally made it to a save point (do games even still have these?) and, just like on the pause menu, it crashed.\n\nNot only this, but nowhere does the game state that it has absolutely NO mouse support. It's a simplistic enough game, but not being able to implement such an easily accessible and vital feature reeks of either laziness or incompetence. It's prety much a direct console port with little to no care put into it.\n\nIt was a mistake buying this on release, I really should've waited for a sale a couple months from now, but my excitement really got the better of me. I'm going to be refunding Jurassic World immediately.","June 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","44","11","25","5","0"

The different challenges that the crew meets and the things they have to do to get to the next step make it fun and interesting. We bought this game for the PC and have had unfortunately nothing but problems. Trying to use the keys on the key pad to get characters to jump and move is very difficult. We have gotten stuck in certain areas where we could not move the characters and had to start over. It has been very frustrating for my ten year old son who really just wanted the free play mode and the ability to do stuff with the dinosaurs. The fact that you have to solve the whole game to do that is too daunting for him as there are basically no tips or clues for how to get unstuck in PC mode. Yes we have seen walk throughs for each part (mostly with the Xbox) and there aren't really any tips specific to the PC and how to really get the charcters to get through each area. If there were no cheats this would virtually take forever to figure stuff out. Maybe some gamers want that but it was just too frustraing for us. I do not recommend getting this on the PC but I do recommend the game.","July 15, 2015","false","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

They have also just released a patch so hopefully that will clear up the issues. Keyboard play is okay most of the time, except when you have to jump at a angle.\n\nOriginal Review: I really want to like this game. And I do like the script--JP (I haven't gotten to JW side yet) follows the original movie using (mostly) the voices from the original movie. As with other Lego games, there's a lot of humor included--any violent scenes are re-made as humorous. Different characters have different skills so you can't always reach some things the first time around. What's really cool is when a dinosaur becomes part of your group (temporarily) and you can control them. It also comes with replay ability as you unlock areas for free play.\n\nHowever, it comes with A LOT of bugs and crashes. Being that you can't just save as you go, you can end up replaying the entire scene again. Characters get stuck or there's a runtime error that just crashes the whole thing. Lego needs to patch this game NOW! My other complaint is using a keyboard (no mouse) makes it harder to use. Have not tried using a controller, which may be recommended.\n\nI recommend the game, but with reservations; some may want to wait until the bugs are patched before purchasing.","July 11, 2015","true","34.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The hub world is much more easily navigated than some of the previous games and seems very approachable because it is split up. In lego marvel superheroes the hub world felt overwhelming at times because it was saturated with content, but the multiple jurassic park hubs are well balanced and have purposeful side tasks that make sense for that part of the park. The game's interpretation of the story is still in the fun style of lego and is light hearted, never as violent as the films were. There are quite a few goals that the game presents but the one I found most fun was to collect the amber brick in each level, unlocking dinosaurs to customize and play as in certain park areas. There is a nice variety of dinosaurs to be unlocked and the movie star dinos are almost all in the lineup of twenty. Each unlockable dinosaur has different abilities or aspects that make it different and worth collecting all of them. Lego Jurassic World is now definitely in my top three lego games, alongside the original star wars and indiana jones lego games. It brings some new ideas to the table and displays jurassic park in a creative fun way.

Oh yes and there are dinosauruses mixed in. For a jurassic park fan this'll be a blast, but sometimes the story skips a bit and might feel a tad confusing if the movies are not fresh in your mind.\n\nSome improvements have been made since Marvel. (I haven't played Batman and refuse to play Hobbit since it is unfinished, so I can't really comment on any improvements regarding those titles.) Many stages allow loads of backtracking and in Free Play you can start from any checkpoint, which is HUGE when trying to find those last pesky minikits. Also The Hub is interesting and well thought.\n\nIn the end it is basically the same concept as any other lego game. But that is not a bad thing in my book.\n\nJust be aware that people are reporting bugs.

I like the feature that you can go to Jurassic Park or Jurassic World, (I have only done the Jurassic park missions so far). I like that you can play as dinosaurs  and cooperate with humans. Overall it is a really fun game with the cheesy hummor you come to love playing Lego games.\n\nCons\n\nVERY glitchy multiple times on the level where you feed the cow to the raptors it has glitched. When the alarm sounds the person is supposed to fall off and then you go up after shooting the target. Only for me that never happened. After the alarm rang the person never fell off... so i couldn't complete the level. I restarted it and when i got to that to that part it happened again on my FOURTH try that dumb guy finally fell off and i beat the level. Another example is when the raptors attack after you restore power. When you through the rocks at the bush there should be a target. For me that didn't happen. The worst part is that this is the end of the level so i have to play for about 20 minutes before I can get to that part again. And multiple times when I charge with the triceratops it doesn't break through the highlited orange bricks. (Which it's supposed to do)","June 24, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZeDemonPyro/recommended/352400/","ZeDemonPyro","Senpai Cannon Fodder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZeDemonPyro/","34 products in account","This game is a very, fun game. However, There are a couple of major problems with it.\n\n1) The audio. The voices are god awful, they, quite literally, sould like someone was in a rush and put a mic in front of a T.V. with the movie playing. In one instance, Malcom started speaking, and you could hear water running in the background. When he stopped speaking, the water noises stopped. This was at a point during LW while looking for Sarah. You can hear the mic buzzing, or the T.V. buzzing, when certain characters talk, expecially Malcom and Hammond.\n\n2) The game has a couple of major bugs. Now, I have only experienced one of them, and upon searching it up I found that other players have the same problem. The game would crash in Jurassic Park, during the T-Rex car chase, seconds after the car does a jump under the branch, and the T-Rex has to go around it.\n\nAs for small issues that I can deal with:\n\n1) No mouse support. At all. Period. You can't even use your mouse in the menus.\n\n2) Only local Co-Op. I get it, that's what Lego games do, but it's such a pain for me, since I have this on PC, not a console.\n\n3) The massive menu maps. It's fun exploring and all, but having to run all the way around places to get to the 1 place you're looking for is a huge pain.\n\n4) No real explination on what you're doing, with the exception of Mr. DNA, except you have to figure out how to get his hint to pop up. (You have to hit a button, with no button clues, rather than just walking up to him. I had no idea that he was even a hint when I first got into the game.)\n\nHowever, I'm sure some of these thigns will be fixed, expecially the crashing bugs, which is why I'm recommending this game. It's very fun, but needs some work.","June 14, 2015","false","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat takes a back seat to simple problem solving as you find ways to clear environmental obstacles, which often takes the form of building new things out of loose bricks that are lying around. Cooperation is also encouraged thanks to hop-in multiplayer and a cavalcade of characters to take control of, each of which has special abilities you need to use to progress through the game. Tying everything together are hub worlds that you can wander around in and collect red bricks (which unlock the ability to buy certain perks) and gold ones (which unlock certain optional sections once you have enough of them), so you get a little bit of structural variety as you progress, which is a nice counterpoint to the very linear levels proper.The different abilities are simply keys to unlock progress or secrets. You never get the chance to noodle around with the mechanics or improvise since there's always just one solution to every obstacle the game puts in your way. Another unfortunate side effect of this approach is the fact that the things you're doing in-game aren't nearly as interesting as the things your in-game avatar is doing. She might be performing a high-pitched scream to break some glass in your way or building a giant replica of a hot dog to distract a rampaging dino. In reality, you're moving from one spot in a level to another, where you activate a thing that lets you move on to the next thing, and so on. Granted, this is the baseline for how game levels are built at their core, but Traveller's Tales does nothing to hide this pattern, nor does it add any complexity to how scenarios play out. It's all focused on throwing exactly one obstacle at you at a time with very little stopping you in between. Lego Jurassic World absolutely has its heart in the right place. Every scene is injected with the now-trademark Lego sense of humor. Events like seeing Chris Pratt gleefully play with toy dinosaurs during a tense scene or seeing someone's hair fall off and land on a raptor's head always produce a chuckle at worst. It helps that you have the very serious lines from the original movies juxtaposed with your silly Lego people doing ridiculous things. Unfortunately, the audio from the movies wasn't mixed very well with the game audio, which sounds jarring next to the pristine, polished sounds and voices recorded for the game. Luckily, the funniest aspect of the game requires no voice acting at all: the dinosaurs. They don't talk, so all their humor is relayed in pantomime, a trick not seen in Traveller's Tales Lego games since their earliest efforts. Since so much of the Lego multimedia experience relies on visual humor, the dinosaurs make up the lion's share of funny moments, like raptors chasing a tiny ice cream truck or the hybrid T-Rex from Jurassic World forming emoticons with bones from its pen. It really speaks to the strength of the game's charm and humor that the non-speaking dinosaurs steal the show, but then again, they are the stars of the Jurassic Park franchise, so it's appropriate.The Lego games set out to create an accessible, joy-filled romp through our favorite pieces of popular media with as few barriers stopping the fun as possible. They are part of one of the few franchises that can get by on charm alone. But Traveller's Tales take this approach to extremes, focusing on the visual and thematic experience almost entirely while letting the actual gameplay languish. Jurassic Park in particular doesn't suit this design because flattening the mechanics removes all notions of tension from the game, an essential part of the film series. Lego Jurassic Park is a nice, pleasant nostalgia trip, but it won't be long before you're asking to leave.♥","November 14, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is another good addition to the series. Why only good? Well here are the few problems I had.\n\n1. The raptor pounce ability is by far the most frustrating bug. It literally can halt your progress on a mission and prevent you from continuing.\n\n2. Playing a dinosaur = AWESOME. Being limited to only a few of the smaller dinosaurs for the majority of the game = not awesome. Seriously you aren't going to roam around as a T-Rex or fly over the landscape as a Pteradon. Those are only usable in specific areas that are designed for them (And there aren't many of those areas)\n\n3. STOP PUTTING COLLECTIBLES IN CHASE SCENES. Sorry that is a pet peave of mine, nothing I hate more than playing the same chase scene 5 times in a row just to try and get a collectible (Especially since you can only see behind you and not where you are going most of the time. And even when it is a sideview chase you have no control over camera to determine depth so aiming for the object is just as difficult sometimes.\n\n4. Bring back the 1,000,000 stud challenges. (Never mind. After 100% the game there is a bonus level on Isla Nublar.)\n\nThat is essentially the drawbacks to the game. So then why do I give it a positive review? Well let me tell you.\n\n1. Hybrid dinosaurs\n2. Just as much fun in Open Roam as there is in the story line.\n3. Advancement on the buddy up system from LOTR Lego (No buddy up attacks, but buddy up puzzles)\n4. collectibles weren't nearly as frustrating as some of the earlier titles.\n5. Even with the above drawbacks it provided me over 30 hours of game play and I was able to 100% the game.\n6. The usual LEGO humor is still rampant.\n\nAll in all it was worth the money if you are a fan of the LEGO games.","June 14, 2015","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each one has it's own unique skill that opens options to get mini-kits and open other areas of the park.

The LEGO games always seem to take some of the bad eggs of franchises and make them incredibly fun, and that's more than true here. Some of the most fun moments of the game were from the Jurassic Park III sections. Truly impressive and somehow told the story way better than the actual film did. The original, TLW, and Jurassic World's episodes are very fun and are great representations of the movie, and it's fun to actually play in the iconic scenes, and it's cool to see parts such as the kitchen scene turned into a level format.\n\nDespite a few day-one bugs that I'm sure will be fixed within a few weeks, and the sometimes bad audio that's ripped straight from the movie which doesn't fit the new voices, this game is a solid 9/10. Definitely recommend. Tons of fun, and if you're a fan of Jurassic Park, you can finally explore the islands like you've always wanted.\n\nEdit: I have completed the game at 100% and have unlocked all achievements. This game is so addicting. That was tons of fun. I encounted a few bugs on the way there, but none that were game-breaking like others are reporting.

There's so much to do! There are probably close to a hundred different characters, a dozen dinosaurs, and two dozen vehicles to unlock. Spanning all four Jurassic Park films, this game offers hours upon hours of replay value. It's a steal for $30. Lego games are typically a phenomenal value.\n\nThe game blends the rich lore of the Jurassic Park films, with the humor and style of the Lego sets. This game is kid friendly, but plenty of great fun for adults, too. If adult fans of the series are looking for a game to play with their children, this is a wise choice. There are a lot of pop culture references scattered about the game, including ET and Jaws, two of Universal's other successful licenses.\n\nGameplay is what you'd expect from Lego, drop in/drop out co-op with intuitive level design and a multitude of ways to achieve goals. Side goals will earn you extra mini-kits.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty solid, in some parts it sounds as though the original VHS tapes were used for the sound bites, but most of the time it's great. Some of the characters sound as though the actors who originally portrayed them returned to re-read their lines (Like in Alien: Isolation) but I'm not sure. As far as I know, however, Jurassic World's cast lent their voice talents to this.\n\nWhile this game is pretty standard fare for a Lego-fied IP (Hobbit, Star Wars, Batman) it is notably improved in its graphics, and some of the game mechanics are smoother as well. The improved character selection and open world gameplay are a big step up from Lego Star Wars 3, the last Lego game I played.  The game runs smoothly at 1080p, well into the 90+FPS range.\n\nThe levels are well-made, and while some gamers report a plethora of glitches, I can gladly say I have yet to experience any. As with any Lego game, an Xbox controller is a MUST. This game is an incredible value, filled with tons of fun for the entire family. If you like Jurassic Park, you won't want to pass this up.\n\n9/10","June 14, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It runs fine on less advanced systems, it looks pretty good graphically and it recreates multiple scenes from each of the Jurassic Park films rather well with an additional sprinkle of TT brand humour that we've all come to be familiar with in these games. Also you can make your own dinosaurs by collecting amber in each of the levels, which is cool.\nI just wish there was a little more content than just 5 levels per movie and more open-ended hub worlds. Don't get me wrong, 20 levels is plenty for a LEGO game, heck most of the other games settle with 15! But I just don't think 5 levels was enough to draw out around 2 hours worth of film footage. A lot of the dialogue and scenes are often slightly cut or scrambled. Add 1 or 2 more levels per film segment, then maybe it could've been a little better, I'm not too sure.\nAs for the hub worlds, the only one I really like is the Jurassic Park hub. There's enough space to walk and drive around. By comparison, the other hubs feel too restrictive with where you can drive and where you can't, assuming you don't wanna run everywhere, same applies with dinosaurs.\nOverall, it's good for the most part but absolutely not among the best LEGO games out there. I wouldn't advise against buying this game, it's still enjoyable to see the world of Jurassic Park in LEGO form (plus LEGO Jeff Goldblum, how can you go wrong?), but for a more enjoyable LEGO game, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes or any of the LEGO Batman games are right up there.\n6/10","September 7, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Side goals will earn you extra mini-kits.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty solid, in some parts it sounds as though the original VHS tapes were used for the sound bites, but most of the time it's great. Some of the characters sound as though the actors who originally portrayed them returned to re-read their lines (Like in Alien: Isolation) but I'm not sure. As far as I know, however, Jurassic World's cast lent their voice talents to this.\n\nWhile this game is pretty standard fare for a Lego-fied IP (Hobbit, Star Wars, Batman) it is notably improved in its graphics, and some of the game mechanics are smoother as well. The improved character selection and open world gameplay are a big step up from Lego Star Wars 3, the last Lego game I played.  The game runs smoothly at 1080p, well into the 90+FPS range.\n\nThe levels are well-made, and while some gamers report a plethora of glitches, I can gladly say I have yet to experience any. As with any Lego game, an Xbox controller is a MUST. This game is an incredible value, filled with tons of fun for the entire family. If you like Jurassic Park, you won't want to pass this up.\n\n9/10","June 14, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quick to pick up on, and easily suitable for both casual and more devoted gamers. The team behind the environment design as well graphics certainly push it a step further than previous titles in the Lego Games lineup.\n\nThe humor is spot on and had myself, a man in the quarter of his life so far, giggling like an idiot. The game content and replayability proves out with many collectables, unlockables, characters and hidden easter eggs even the most hard core of completionists will find satisfying. It is also a fresh step back onto the film series some of us have grown up on, and others not even aware of. ( Lord help the fools who watch the Lost World. )\n\nThere are minor complaints to be made. The original dialogue is taken from the film, and unfortunately that translate to a poor audio recording that seems so low in quality that it can seem a little distracting once in awhile. It is especially noticable when fresh voice actors and actresses have made new lines for this game which by all means sound fresh and crisp. There are minor glitches with AI or the environment and not every puzzle or path is intuitively developed for a straightforward experience. Lastly, there are minor slow downs and hang ups now and again but on rare account.\n\nAll in all the pros certainly outweigh the cons  and I could not recommend this game enough. If not for the fact it is riding on the back of a great gaming legacy, but also that they made Jeff Goldblum a scary man you would not want to sit next to on a helicopter ride. You know, like real life.","June 14, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It got really bad, so I started buying red bricks in the visitor centre in the Jurassic Park hub.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hunter-r/recommended/352400/","hunter-r","HunteR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hunter-r/","69 products in account","OVERALL\nLEGO Jurassic World an amazing and casual game that should appeal to kids and adults alike. If you've ever played a LEGO game before, then you know what you're in for; destroying every rock and bush to get studs (the in-game currency), classic and corny LEGO humor, and simple yet fun puzzles and platforming. While it reuses the same LEGO formula that almost all LEGO video games use, it is still a fresh experience following all three Jurassic Park films and Jurassic World.\n\nSOUND\nThe soundtrack really does take you back, using music and voice acting directly from the films. The voice acting doesn't get too annoying for the most part, but you can clearly tell that they ripped lines directly from the films and can oftentimes hear static and background noise throughout the dialogue.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAs mentioned previously, the game follows the classic LEGO video game formula; simple platforming and puzzles, as well as the standard LEGO humor in the mix. The game, like many other classic LEGO titles, offers a lot of unlockables and replayability options. There are tons of things to discover within this game, including 100% Stud Bars, Gold Bricks, Minikits, and a host of characters, vehicles, and dinosaurs to unlock. Yes, you can play as the dinosaurs within the game, which is what impressed me the most throughout my playtime and it was a blast to play as them.\n\nNEGATIVES\n• Some people have claimed to have encountered game-breaking or game-stalling glitches, but I have yet to encounter any of these glitches during my playthrough, and I'm assuming they've been patched.\n• The voice acting is directly ripped from the Jurassic films and is extremely noticable with static and background noise during the dialogue between characters.\n• If you are playing with a mouse and keyboard rather than a controller... then the controls can take some getting used to. The mouse is never touched in this game and the default controls are rather confusing. By default, JUMP was bound to the 'J' key rather than the standard 'SPACE BAR'. You'll probably have to customize the controls when playing with a keyboard, but you should be fine once you get used to it.\n\nCONCLUSION\nLEGO Jurassic World is a fun and enjoyable experience that reuses the classic LEGO formula in the Jurassic Park/World environments. With simple, yet fun puzzles/platforming, as well as tons of replayability value, I'd say LEGO Jurassic World deserves a solid 7.5/10","June 19, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Some handles wanted veeeery slow circles, others you could do normally, that was very annoying.\n\nAnd like any other LEGO game you have your lil glitches, which can be frustrating, but not game ruining.\nFor example, one worker and some gold bricks were not shown on the map area to collect, in the first HUB (1st Jurassic Park).\nI thought the game glitched (like in LEGO LotR) and I had to restart everything to get 100%... which I did and then I came accross that worker in my 2nd playthrough and saw it wasn't displayed on the map. Went back to my old save and look there... he was there, including 2 gold bricks. Got 100% then -.-\n\nBut like any other LEGO game from TT Games, you can expect that it will never get a patch and you just gotta live with with. (thanks TT for taking good care of your games after release... maybe something to invest money it from all the DLCs? hmmm)\n\nAnyways, the game is still good and fun and the price okay.\nI just wish they'd add an online Co-op at one point, cause none of my friends play these games... they even flatout refuse to play them with me, lol","June 17, 2015","true","65.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The LEGO games always seem to take some of the bad eggs of franchises and make them incredibly fun, and that's more than true here. Some of the most fun moments of the game were from the Jurassic Park III sections. Truly impressive and somehow told the story way better than the actual film did. The original, TLW, and Jurassic World's episodes are very fun and are great representations of the movie, and it's fun to actually play in the iconic scenes, and it's cool to see parts such as the kitchen scene turned into a level format.\n\nDespite a few day-one bugs that I'm sure will be fixed within a few weeks, and the sometimes bad audio that's ripped straight from the movie which doesn't fit the new voices, this game is a solid 9/10. Definitely recommend. Tons of fun, and if you're a fan of Jurassic Park, you can finally explore the islands like you've always wanted.\n\nEdit: I have completed the game at 100% and have unlocked all achievements.

I havent had so much fun with a lego videogame since The Lego Movie game and the original Star Wars lego games. When i bought this game i didnt expect as much content as there is in the story. This game is great for me because i love the JP franchise and even though it doesnt follow the movies plots to the letter, doing so allows a fun gaming experience. I love this game even with its little quirks such as cut scene freezes and some physics glitches, and i dont mind the dlc.

Let me tell you this game has re-sparked my passion for lego as it has done a great job at creating such a large, humerous game. I known ni havent played it much (14/06/15) but i can tell this game is going to be a great adventure, not only from my personal experience but also from the few youtube videos ive watched. Great work Tt! I couldnt possibly give this game a rating out of 10 as i havent completed it!\n\n- Hope this helps!\nBTW: If you're not at all interested in lego but your interested in lego but you're interrested in jurassic park this game is still great for you!","June 14, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does not save the game at checkpoints. You have to complete entire levels. This has resulted in a lot of frustration for my kids. The save game system is ATROCIOUS. It should always always always save the last checkpoint.\n\nSo far thanks to the mysterious system my daughter lost her entire game and my son always seems to have to go one step back for every two steps forward.\n\nMy kids are losing interest because they know they may end up having to repeat stuff over and over for no greater sin than bed time, homework, or Daddy needing to do work on his computer. If this is a pressure point in your family then avoid this game and seek out a product which is has a family friendly save mechanism.\n\nShame on you Tt.\n\n------\n\nWe have gone a few days now without there being any more crashing issues. I have changed to mirroring the display on the TV rather than making the TV the prime display. I am not sure if it is related.\n\nWe bought a second controller so the kids can have more reasons to bicker beyond just whose turn it is. There is nothing like the sound of a six year old who feels they should have been the one to lower the cow into the raptor pen (in true lego fashion, it ends up with a dude in his underwear, much to their delight, rather than a dead cow).\n\nThe split screen is disconcerting to me but they seem fine with it.\n\nWe have hit a bit of a wall where the party gets broken up into two sections of the park and the kids get confused but we will figure it out.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis is great fun and will be a great game. My 6 and 7 year old love it. However, crash bugs ruin the experience. Since we play this on the TV and it uses checkpoint save the issue is even more aggregious. Wait on this one.","June 14, 2015","false","69.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The hub world is much more easily navigated than some of the previous games and seems very approachable because it is split up. In lego marvel superheroes the hub world felt overwhelming at times because it was saturated with content, but the multiple jurassic park hubs are well balanced and have purposeful side tasks that make sense for that part of the park. The game's interpretation of the story is still in the fun style of lego and is light hearted, never as violent as the films were. There are quite a few goals that the game presents but the one I found most fun was to collect the amber brick in each level, unlocking dinosaurs to customize and play as in certain park areas. There is a nice variety of dinosaurs to be unlocked and the movie star dinos are almost all in the lineup of twenty. Each unlockable dinosaur has different abilities or aspects that make it different and worth collecting all of them. Lego Jurassic World is now definitely in my top three lego games, alongside the original star wars and indiana jones lego games. It brings some new ideas to the table and displays jurassic park in a creative fun way. If you are a fan of lego games, be sure to play this game.","June 24, 2015","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh yes and there are dinosauruses mixed in. For a jurassic park fan this'll be a blast, but sometimes the story skips a bit and might feel a tad confusing if the movies are not fresh in your mind.\n\nSome improvements have been made since Marvel. (I haven't played Batman and refuse to play Hobbit since it is unfinished, so I can't really comment on any improvements regarding those titles.) Many stages allow loads of backtracking and in Free Play you can start from any checkpoint, which is HUGE when trying to find those last pesky minikits. Also The Hub is interesting and well thought.\n\nIn the end it is basically the same concept as any other lego game. But that is not a bad thing in my book.\n\nJust be aware that people are reporting bugs. In my 100% playthrough I once fell through the world (but respawned quickly after that) and once a character just kept running to a wall and did not respond to the controls.

Gameplay mechanics are smooth, being able to control dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures is an amazing feature, and fighting classic dinosaur and human villains provides nostalgia to those people who have faithfully hung on to every moment of the movies. The game stays true to its source with character quotes and famous scenes from the movies done up Lego style. The ability to easily switch characters using the character wheel feature is very convenient. The dinosaurs and prehistoric creatures are very fluid in their movements and the sounds they make.\n\nThe vehicles are a little bit slow speedwise, but I don't know if that's just me or a gameplay bug. The Compsognathus that you fight in some parts of certain levels seem a bit overpowered as far as individuals go. I mean, I can see them being extremely nasty and devastating in a pack, but individually they seem far too powerful for such tiny dinosaurs. Also, I think that players should be able to fight creatures like Velociraptors (actually Achillobators, but that's another issue) and Pteranodons in hand-to-hand combat. I mean, I know it was a case of the raptors were supposed to be so smart and vicious that no one could take them on in ordinary circumstances in the movies, but this is Lego we're talking about. They're not that big and tough, so why can't we fight raptors outside of those scenarios where they pounce on your character or as another raptor, and why can't we fight Pteranodons and such things when they're on the ground? Granted, I'm not saying we should be able to take T. rexes on in a fistfight anytime soon. That would be physically impossible in a variety of ways. All I'm saying is that the human characters should be able to take on things bigger than Compsognathus, Dimorphodon, and Dilophosaurus in a fistfight like the Velociraptors and the Pteranodons. Just a suggestion if the Steam version of this game has occasional content or gameplay updates. Also, the T. rex from the first and fourth films, Rexy, is not named as such in the game. They refer to her only as a generic Tyrannosaurus rex when she is one of the most iconic dinosaurs in the franchise. I realize that it is a bit cosmetic of a complaint or issue, but I just think that since everyone calls her that, it would be appropriate to name her in-game as such.\n\nOverall, this game is great. It really harkens back to the movies we all love so much and I would recommend this title to any Jurassic Park fan or anyone who is a fan of dinosaur-based games in general. You will not be disappointed. The $39.99 that this game costs plus the about $5 in DLC added to that if you opt for it is well worth every penny of Steam wallet credit.","July 3, 2015","true","50.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the savings, picked up all 3 DLCs that were out at the time.\n\nGame is decent, only 2 hours in and gameplay is fairly fluid.  Standard LEGO abilities and breakables.  Gold bricks, red bricks and mini kits are here too.\n\nMy only complaint is tried to run this on 2 different computers with 3D monitors.  The scenes look amazing with the very high detailed textures.  Almost all LEGO games work very well in 3D.  This one is questionable as I've tried several video options in the clunky menus and cannot get the game to run without screen turning blank for 1 second, followed by 3 seconds normal play, then blank for 1 second, 3 seconds normal play.  I can forgive this if it occured on 1 pc not being hi-spec'd enough to handle DX11.  Nearly unforgiveable on 2 different machines with 2 different monitors.  I can only play it in non-3D on one machine as I am unable to turn off 3D on the other.  Frustrating.  Switching from DX11 to DX9 requires a full exit of program, which I can understand.  But this error occurs on either version at high end and low end settings.  Have never experienced this on any other LEGO game ever.  Hopefully will get patched, but not holding my breath.\n\nOne cool new feature is you are able to play as the dinosaurs in certain areas.  That's neat.\n\nThere's a lot, and I mean a lot, of cutscenes with dialog from the films.  A few standard LEGO humor animations thrown in.  First high priced LEGO game I've bought.  Normally, I never pay more than $20 for a $30 game.  Since this covers all 4 films, I think I can forgive.  More play time...we'll see.

The different challenges that the crew meets and the things they have to do to get to the next step make it fun and interesting. We bought this game for the PC and have had unfortunately nothing but problems. Trying to use the keys on the key pad to get characters to jump and move is very difficult. We have gotten stuck in certain areas where we could not move the characters and had to start over. It has been very frustrating for my ten year old son who really just wanted the free play mode and the ability to do stuff with the dinosaurs. The fact that you have to solve the whole game to do that is too daunting for him as there are basically no tips or clues for how to get unstuck in PC mode. Yes we have seen walk throughs for each part (mostly with the Xbox) and there aren't really any tips specific to the PC and how to really get the charcters to get through each area. If there were no cheats this would virtually take forever to figure stuff out. Maybe some gamers want that but it was just too frustraing for us. I do not recommend getting this on the PC but I do recommend the game.","July 15, 2015","false","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auldwolf/recommended/352400/","auldwolf","AuldWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auldwolf/","423 products in account","I have to say that this is TT Games bet yet.\n\nDisclosure: I hated Jurassic World, its science was on par with Creationism and that irritated me. It even featured a stegosaurus which was less correct than the one in Lost World, even. How does that happen? So, ultimately, I think of Jurassic World as being a dumb monster flick. However! TT Games had the forethought to include the other three Jurassic Park films, which are all far, far less terrible, and one of which is really good.\n\nThankfully, the Jurassic World section is fairly small and skips over some of the more painfully unintelligent parts of the film. So you can just get it out of the way and forget it exists, and then concentrate on the parts of it which are actually enjoyable.\n\nAnd the Jurassic Park sections are very enjoyable!\n\nI felt for a while that the LEGO games were losing their way. They were focusing on huge hubs and tiresome fetch quests. LEGO Batman 2 had a bit of that, but it also still had hundreds of environment puzzles. The environment puzzles stopped sharp with that game, however. LEGO Marvel Superheroes, LEGO Lord of the Rings, and LEGO The Hobbit were having none of that. So I really didn't enjoy those games. I was coming to the conclusion that I'd simply lost my love for the LEGO franchise.\n\nIt turns out those games were just really soulless cash-ins. When the LEGO Movie video game came along, I saw hints of the TT Games I loved from back around the time of LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean, and LEGO Harry Potter Years 1-4. It was representative of the golden years of the LEGO games, it opted for a number of small hubs, rather than one big one, andit had a lot of fun little puzzles and secrets.\n\nLEGO Jurassic World follows this trend. Except it takes another step back toward when the LEGO games were actually good. I think that there are two teams working at TT Games (not including TT Fusion). One of the teams is making cheap cash-ins with giant world hubs and soulless grind quests; The other is making proper LEGO games which have none of that and are more similar to the halcyon days of TT Games LEGO efforts.\n\nNot only that, but they allow you to play as dinosaurs so often! They've made some mistakes with the dinos, but it's still not as galling as in the awful Idiocracy-fuelled affair that is Jurassic World.\n\nSo... it's good. It's not that it's good because it's Jurassic Whatever, either. It's good because it's more of a return to form after one too many really bad LEGO games. If you thought that the LEGO games were at their height around the time of LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter Years 1-4, then this one is for you. It'll make you smile.","July 1, 2015","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I still nostalgicly hold those first two as my favorites, Lego Jurassic World has been my favorite once since. I had previously given up on the series after the first harry potter and batman games fell flat for me, but I am glad I came back. I can't say for certain how many of the mechanics are new to the series since this is the forst I've played to have a hub world. However I can affirm that there is a good deal of variety to the gameplay with each movie introducing different character powers along the way. The game does a good job parodying the source material, but I find myself torn between missing the charm of the mimed cutscenes the previous titles had and understanding that dialogue is what made many of the scenes in Jurassic Park so iconic. Overall, if you like the Lego games and the Jurassic Park series this is a solid purchase. If you have never played a Lego game I highly recommend starting with Star Wars because it has so many iconic characters and the most effective humor of the title I've played in the series. Also it won't seem as clunky versus going back to it after playing the more recent titles.","January 3","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, we've got controllable dinos now, but after that what really is there?\n-Buggy at points. I had three crashes out of the blue, several points of lagging, and one memorable part where a character essential to finishing a level couldn't figure out how to jump over a 1 brick-high object. Still not as buggy as DC Super Heroes though...\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game is playable, and I have no doubt that this game will drive some kids out of their minds.

Star Wars, I wanted to complete every single level.  I couldn't wait for the next one.  Lego Indiana Jones was okay, too.  Lego Lord of the Rings and Lego the Hobbit were pushing it, I started getting annoyed at the minikits and gold bricks.  Lego Movie, I just want to complete it to see how the story ends.  This game?  I'm pushing myself for every inch of ground, every level that goes past, just trying to get to the end so I can do free play and explore as whoever I want.  It's so aggravating!  QTEs that punish you for even a millisecond's hesitation, but mix the buttons up so to pass them you have to pause the game repeatedly - which ruins the animation.  Wandering around aimlessly for level after level trying to figure out what it wants you to do, only to find it was that one little thing tucked in a corner.  Running and driving away from dinosaurs without the slightest hint of how to avoid getting hit - turns out you have to shoot chickens into their mouths when they roar.  Which means you have to switch the second it looks like they're about to roar.  I can honestly say I hate lego games right now.  I hope the endgame is worth it, because I'm seven hours in, two and a quarter movies down and I don't want to finish the last two.  Half an hour in the last week gives you a hint at how much I really don't want to play the poorly designed story missions.  And if the end of this is one massive open world where you just constantly run around looking for secrets and amber I'm going to quit Lego games forever.","October 14, 2015","false","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story has only a few similarities to the actual movies. You skipped the Jurassic World Mosasaurus scene, replacing it with a boring collectible picture. You skipped out of most of the good things of the movies. The open world sucks, the layout isn't the same as in the movies. Also the open world is small, and you cant really explore. The collectibles suck and took me literally 1 hour to get them all without the help of a guide or video. The playable dinosaurs have horrible controlling and a bad character changing system. Your humor has stupid dialogue, and actions making the story suck even more. I know this is a Lego game, and its supposed to be family friendly, but no death in the game sucks. Its a Jurassic game it needs death or it would be boring to play the story again, and you clearly didn't care about death in Lego Star Wars Saga, when in multiple episodes you had death.

For me personally it sits as a nutral game, neither really good nor really bad. This is a great game however there are some Pros and Cons to it...\n\nPros:\n\nMassive Open World- The Open World is literally FOUR Maps and Two ISLANDS. Jurassic Park and Jurassic World especially.\n\nAmazing Graphics- Best Graphics in a LEGO Game so far.\n\nPlay Through All Four Movies- No duh\n\nPlay and Create Your Own Dinosaurs- I created a Zebra stripped Spinorapter and a Cheetah pattern Brachiosaurus. Creativity is strong.\n\nOriginal Voice Clips Are Used- With Jurassic World actors actually reprising their roles.\n\nLevels Can Have Thrilling Moments From Time to Time- In a couple levels the Raptors gave me a scare... This is a LEGO GAME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT!!!!!\n\nCons:\n\nSome Levels Are Incredibly Weak/Boring- Jurassic Park III is my favorite movie (Yeah, don't judge), but I regret to say that it is best to just skip the whole section. Unless you want to play through terribly designed levels/the over world, listen to music that ISN'T the Original Score, and listen to voice actors who weren't in the film (Besides Sam Neil and William H Macy). Some of the other movies have weak spots as well.\n\nSome Voice Clips Can Be Very Choppy- Not completely LEGOs fault, because alot of them were filmed with ambiant sound, but many of them must have been so bad that they just had to replace them (Like I said earlier).\n\nThere Is NO Such Thing As Violence In This Game- Call me what you want, but this is coming from the same company that brought us scenes such as Anakin getting his legs chopped off, The opening of the lost ark, or heck Harry Potter Years 5-7. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! Nobody dies in this game... They found ways... Life... finds a way... At least in this game.\n\nCharacters Can Be Seen as Repetative- Many of the Human characters are either employees or INGEN workers. And don't even get me started on the inflation prices for them. Once again, not completely LEGOs fault though.","December 31, 2015","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, we've got controllable dinos now, but after that what really is there?\n-Buggy at points. I had three crashes out of the blue, several points of lagging, and one memorable part where a character essential to finishing a level couldn't figure out how to jump over a 1 brick-high object. Still not as buggy as DC Super Heroes though...\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game is playable, and I have no doubt that this game will drive some kids out of their minds.

Star Wars, I wanted to complete every single level.  I couldn't wait for the next one.  Lego Indiana Jones was okay, too.  Lego Lord of the Rings and Lego the Hobbit were pushing it, I started getting annoyed at the minikits and gold bricks.  Lego Movie, I just want to complete it to see how the story ends.  This game?  I'm pushing myself for every inch of ground, every level that goes past, just trying to get to the end so I can do free play and explore as whoever I want.  It's so aggravating!  QTEs that punish you for even a millisecond's hesitation, but mix the buttons up so to pass them you have to pause the game repeatedly - which ruins the animation.  Wandering around aimlessly for level after level trying to figure out what it wants you to do, only to find it was that one little thing tucked in a corner.  Running and driving away from dinosaurs without the slightest hint of how to avoid getting hit - turns out you have to shoot chickens into their mouths when they roar.  Which means you have to switch the second it looks like they're about to roar.  I can honestly say I hate lego games right now.  I hope the endgame is worth it, because I'm seven hours in, two and a quarter movies down and I don't want to finish the last two.  Half an hour in the last week gives you a hint at how much I really don't want to play the poorly designed story missions.  And if the end of this is one massive open world where you just constantly run around looking for secrets and amber I'm going to quit Lego games forever.","October 14, 2015","false","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story has only a few similarities to the actual movies. You skipped the Jurassic World Mosasaurus scene, replacing it with a boring collectible picture. You skipped out of most of the good things of the movies. The open world sucks, the layout isn't the same as in the movies. Also the open world is small, and you cant really explore. The collectibles suck and took me literally 1 hour to get them all without the help of a guide or video. The playable dinosaurs have horrible controlling and a bad character changing system. Your humor has stupid dialogue, and actions making the story suck even more. I know this is a Lego game, and its supposed to be family friendly, but no death in the game sucks. Its a Jurassic game it needs death or it would be boring to play the story again, and you clearly didn't care about death in Lego Star Wars Saga, when in multiple episodes you had death. Overall this game sucks and is very disappointing to a huge Jurassic Park and Jurassic World fan like me.\n\n10/10 Would Refund Again","October 17, 2015","false","118.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention that since it is a Lego game there's a lot of replayability for most of the levels. The one thing I found neat was the fact tons of side charcter's are playable aswell, They even let you play as Mr. DNA which is a cool touch. In all it's a fun little game with those infamous Lego quirks that make it an overall entertaining experience.","October 6, 2015","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My slow internet connection meant I had to wait a least a week from purchase to play the game and by the time it was downloaded, I could barely contain my excitement.\nBut from the start the game was slow and glitchy. I managed to reach level 2 of Jurassic Park but couldn't progress because a bug meant that the man on the crane never jumps down. I have started the level over and over, deleted my save and started the game again, but nothing works.\nI hoped that I could at least play the Jurassic World levels, but even then on the first level the pig either never leaves the dumpster, or when I ride it it glitches back into the dumpster.\nSo essentially I have been able to play one level of the game. The only thing I can think of doing is reinstalling the game, but with no guarantee of it fixing the game and my terrible internet, I don't think its worth it.\nI wouldn't recommend getting this game until they patch out all the glitches and, in the mean time, restore your faith in the lego games by playing the ones that actually work.\n\nEDIT: So I finally managed to get past the crane man! But then five minutes later my game crashes when I try to charge with the triceratops.

I grew up playing a lot of the Lego games with my brother such as both Lego Harry Potter games, Lego Pirates of the Caribbean, Lego Star Wars, etc. But as an adult, I wasn't sure if the gameplay would hold up. Since I spent 35 hours over one single three day weekend playing I'd say that the gameplay did hold up. I feel like the license of Jurassic Park contributed to my obsessive objective to complete the game 100% since it is one of my favorite films and books of all time. The first three films are told well enough in the game using dialogue from the movies, but if you haven't seen the movies a thousand times, some details might not make sense simply by playing the game. That changes however with the Jurassic World part of the story. Since the game came out right around the same time as the movie, they had the actors from the film record more dialogue specifically for the game, allowing the story to be told a little more clearly using the classic Lego style of comedy and story telling. You could easily have never seen the film, and still understood the story clearly just by playing this game.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game if you're a fan of the Lego games we've grown to love, and I highly recommend this one if you're a fan of the Jurassic Park series as there's a bunch of neat references to small things from the films, as well as some unique gameplay mechanics specifically for the types of characters from the films.\n\n10/10 Lego Jeff Goldblum laughs","March 13","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has nice controls but if you want split sceen you should use 2 keyboards so your hands don't bump. I think it has nice graphics (for a lego game). I like the feature that you can go to Jurassic Park or Jurassic World, (I have only done the Jurassic park missions so far). I like that you can play as dinosaurs  and cooperate with humans. Overall it is a really fun game with the cheesy hummor you come to love playing Lego games.\n\nCons\n\nVERY glitchy multiple times on the level where you feed the cow to the raptors it has glitched. When the alarm sounds the person is supposed to fall off and then you go up after shooting the target. Only for me that never happened. After the alarm rang the person never fell off... so i couldn't complete the level. I restarted it and when i got to that to that part it happened again on my FOURTH try that dumb guy finally fell off and i beat the level. Another example is when the raptors attack after you restore power. When you through the rocks at the bush there should be a target. For me that didn't happen. The worst part is that this is the end of the level so i have to play for about 20 minutes before I can get to that part again. And multiple times when I charge with the triceratops it doesn't break through the highlited orange bricks. (Which it's supposed to do)","June 24, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The hub world is much more easily navigated than some of the previous games and seems very approachable because it is split up. In lego marvel superheroes the hub world felt overwhelming at times because it was saturated with content, but the multiple jurassic park hubs are well balanced and have purposeful side tasks that make sense for that part of the park. The game's interpretation of the story is still in the fun style of lego and is light hearted, never as violent as the films were. There are quite a few goals that the game presents but the one I found most fun was to collect the amber brick in each level, unlocking dinosaurs to customize and play as in certain park areas. There is a nice variety of dinosaurs to be unlocked and the movie star dinos are almost all in the lineup of twenty. Each unlockable dinosaur has different abilities or aspects that make it different and worth collecting all of them. Lego Jurassic World is now definitely in my top three lego games, alongside the original star wars and indiana jones lego games. It brings some new ideas to the table and displays jurassic park in a creative fun way. If you are a fan of lego games, be sure to play this game.","June 24, 2015","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh yes and there are dinosauruses mixed in. For a jurassic park fan this'll be a blast, but sometimes the story skips a bit and might feel a tad confusing if the movies are not fresh in your mind.\n\nSome improvements have been made since Marvel. (I haven't played Batman and refuse to play Hobbit since it is unfinished, so I can't really comment on any improvements regarding those titles.) Many stages allow loads of backtracking and in Free Play you can start from any checkpoint, which is HUGE when trying to find those last pesky minikits. Also The Hub is interesting and well thought.\n\nIn the end it is basically the same concept as any other lego game. But that is not a bad thing in my book.\n\nJust be aware that people are reporting bugs. In my 100% playthrough I once fell through the world (but respawned quickly after that) and once a character just kept running to a wall and did not respond to the controls. Other than that I had no big problems.","June 24, 2015","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have yet to do anything even slightly interesting with them in the series and they always look uglier than the story levels and are devoid of life. Lego Jurassic World continues this fine tradition unfortunately. The story levels don't fare much better. While I think the effort made to include all of the movies in one game is commendable, they took it too far here and the gameplay loop is really tired by the time you reach the final set of levels. I think the sweet spot for these games is in the 15-level range and this game has 20. The devs devs are a bit too content to drag areas out that aren't cool from the movie perspective and are on the dry side from the gameplay perspective. I don't think the game offers much for fans of the movies other than a sort of cute re-telling and there are better Lego games out there for Lego game fans. The port is solid and the visuals look great at times. The sound is a little weird as they didn't put much effort into isolating the movie lines from the other sounds in those scenes of the film.\n\nVerdict: Pass.","February 12","false","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Us older people that may play this game will be pleased to know that they actually have Jurassic Park with this game! You get to relive scenes from the first movie! Besides hitting us in the nostalgia though, I get irked by how the map in this game works. They don't make it clear, in my opinion, where your goal actually is. Compared to the Jurassic World portions of the game, the Jurassic Park portion definitely feels slapped together when your eyes aren't blinded with nostalgia. 3/5 for me.","December 24, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Check\nFun Co-Op? Check\nActually play thru'able unlike some other Lego games? Check\n\nThis game doesn't take itself too seriously, but feels absolutely massive. I have no comments on the DLC portion, as my purchase was made with all DLC included, however nothing feels tacked on at the end. The achievements are relatively easy to obtain in this Lego edition, and the gameplay is at the very minimum entertaining and interested. The game seems to follow the movies relatively well and ultimately is a must-have for any Lego enthusiast.","January 8","true","30.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game play mechanics are fairly shallow compared to other lego games like LEGO  marvel avengers and LEGO batman 3.  The characters are forgetable (except for the movie characters).  The saving grace is that it has dinosaur combination but the way to access fun dinosaurs is locked until much later then they should be.  Also for some reason the second level after the prolouge simply crashes the game.  So I cant advance which has killed this game  for me.  In my opinion there are better lego games than this to buy that are more fun and have more content.","January 30","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have yet to do anything even slightly interesting with them in the series and they always look uglier than the story levels and are devoid of life. Lego Jurassic World continues this fine tradition unfortunately. The story levels don't fare much better. While I think the effort made to include all of the movies in one game is commendable, they took it too far here and the gameplay loop is really tired by the time you reach the final set of levels. I think the sweet spot for these games is in the 15-level range and this game has 20. The devs devs are a bit too content to drag areas out that aren't cool from the movie perspective and are on the dry side from the gameplay perspective. I don't think the game offers much for fans of the movies other than a sort of cute re-telling and there are better Lego games out there for Lego game fans. The port is solid and the visuals look great at times. The sound is a little weird as they didn't put much effort into isolating the movie lines from the other sounds in those scenes of the film.\n\nVerdict: Pass.","February 12","false","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For an open world sort of thing its pretty big and full of content, granted its a LOT easier than in the old games. It seems the more games lego pumps out the easier they get, less puzzles more cutscenes. Still got the lego game humor albeit a little TOO much at times. This may be just because I am not a kid anymore but it would be nice to see it a little more serious. Even lego star wars was more serious than this and the jurassic series has giant lizard birds eating people but they censor it too death for kids even though lego star wars had implied decapitations and people getting blown apart or shot to death.","April 10","true","39.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the glitches have been: Characters getting stuck and Cut scene animations not finishing are the two worst that require you to restart. Another glitch, I recenty discovered, dealt with the controller support. Lego games are the one and only game that just dont work and are no fun without a controller. Half the time the controller does not register in the game and other times it controls both characters through a split screen. Controlling both characters at once wasn't so bad but it did make it a little difficult to do the animations (throwing/shooting targets, pushing items, etc.) Apart from rather regular glitches, the game is really fun and you get to control the dinosaurs in some instances. If you don't mind the occasional glitches that require you to restart, it's definetly worth it.

Though I personally feel this is a little lack luster in comparison, it isn't a bad game at all. A nice, casual collectathon with some funny puzzles and nods to the classic franchise.\n\nThe obnoxious girl from the first movie's special move is literally "Press B to scream the world away" which breaks obsticals and people, and the characters of Jurassic Park 2 actually have more character development and utility than their in-movie incarnations. I suppose this just solidifies how ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic the second movie was.... All in all this is definetly worth a buy for like 20 bucks or so. Just don't expect a long or engaging storyline, as each movie's story is very rushed so they could fit them all in a single game. Some would call this lazy, but personally I feel one shouldn't take something too seriously when the thing in question isn't taking itself seriously. This game is essentially just something to screw around in after binge-watching the movies.\n\nA few things you'll have to prepare yourself for though - this game's surprising semi-open world element makes for a much slower paced lego game in comparison to the traditional Star Wars lego game format, which takes the interactive main menu/ level select hubs to the next level. Little kids might find this boring, or they might really like this, it depends on how ADHD you are. Also, a controller is a MUST here because unlike other releases, things basically fall appart when you're in a vehicle. It's impossible to explain how hard it is to constantly having to hold a button down to propell forward or reverse otherwise.\n\nSome people experience crashing issues past the final Jurassic World section but I have yet to have any trouble.","May 30","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
