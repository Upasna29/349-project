This game creates a sense of nostalgia and it has over 20 different retro graphic flavors to choose from. This is an old school love letter and every shmup fun should try it.\n\nPros: old school flavor, fast paced, nice modern 2.5d visuals, various graphic options ranging from Amiga to C64, survival mode is addicting and fun, 3 space ships to choose from which feel different and unique, music tracks are excellent, No bugs or glitches experienced after 9 hrs of gameplay. Difficulty is just right and challenging (not very easy but also not very hard like some Japanese shmups). You can also choose between 4 difficulty settings.\n\nCons: very short with only 6 levels. You will need approx 2 hrs to complete the game It could have use more enemy variation, more bosses and more environments.\n\nPS:Developers support and show love for their game, they talk in (steam) forums with users and they also promised more free content in the future.\n\nFinal score: 08/10 (if you have any interest in shmups you should definitely try it) Demo is also available for download at the developers webpage","November 25, 2013","true","13.0"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","57","63","0","2"

It ditches the standard vertical or hori scrolling in favor of a Defender-style approach (or Fantasy Zone, Uridium, or whatever similar classic you can think of). Also the visuals can be really nice and detailed, and there are tons of explosions, especially with all the mines floating in the very first stage.\nThen, however, it quickly begins to fall apart.\nThe game is riddled with tons of bugs and other nuisances. The third survival stage doesn't end after defeating the last enemy. The second survival stage doesn't end after the timer hits zero. Some gamepads aren't recognized. Enemies sometimes jump across the screen for no reason, occasionally flying straight into you for a quick and cheap death. Enemies don't appear on the radar. Items float above or below the playing field. At two times my spacecraft would constantly fly either upwards or leftwards for no apparent reason. The four ships are extremely unbalanced.\nI could go on and on, but I guess you get the gist.\n\nThere is a decent at best shmup buried under tons of bugs and other shortcomings.\nToo bad Steam isn't exactly brimming with great shooters, but if you're looking for an alternative, I'd recommend Jamestown.\n\nSyder Arcade has its moments. Moments where everything falls together, works properly and where you can sense some creativity, so it's not necessarily a terrible game, but when having to choose between a thumb up or down, I'd go for the thumb down.","July 17, 2014","false","6.2"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","37","49","0","6"

Enemies appear on map, so you can plan your moves accordingly. There is no ship upgrading, just four completely different ships from the start offering several tactics. Graphic and effects look great and better than in most indie games, also backrounds of various planets and vast spaces are gorgeous, I even made a few desktop wallpapers. Sound is generally good and won`t dissapoint. Controls work great and responsive with gamepad.\nSyder Arcade is short, however few survival levels and four difficulty levels add some length. Problems mostly come from technical side: it takes too long to restart a level, also too many easy ways to overcome challenges. Leaderboards are a mess too. For a shmup Syder Arcade definitely lacks interesting bosses, there are few, but they are similar to normal enemies and nowhere as interesting as the ones in R-Type.\n\nOverall, It`s a good shmup, gorgeous graphical side, good controls and enough diversity for both: shmup veteran and newbie.\n\nReDiR's rating: 8.4","July 7, 2014","true","7.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/252310/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","Syder Arcade is probably the best indie sidescrolling shooter out there or even the best one to come out in recente years considering not many have. Syder Arcade lets you choose from various ships and each one differs from the others by having more or less armour and more or less speed along with each one having a different attack and special attack. This game has also one really cool thing, which is, it lets you pick a different shader or filter (I don't know what to call it) which makes the game look modern with really good looking graphics or with graphics from the Commodore and Amiga era, I found this to be a really neat plus since you can play the game with various different "eyes" if you can call it that. Syder Arcade features a campaign of around 6 missions (can't exactly remember) and a survival mode which puts you against endless waves of enemies competing for the highest score. Syder Arcade has also one really special gameplay mechanic, which I believe is the first time used in a game like this, that is the ability to flip or ship to face the opposite side which lets you avoid projectiles and flee from enemies more easily and even getting better lines of "sight" to shoot the enemies. The gameplay relies on your basic attack which can be upgraded with different pickups and a special attack which takes time to charge or charges faster by picking up certain pickups and you also start each level with 3 lives. The campaign is easily beatable taking about 3 to four hours but I think that the incentive to keep people playing this title is the online leaderboard system which makes you compete for the highest place on the leaderboards according to your final score, this is probably more "intense" on the survival mode. Overall, Syder Arcade is an amazing sidescrolling shooter made by a small indie dev team from Italy and they totally deserve your time and money because they've made such an amazing game.

Easing right into the hands of arcade connoisseurs, the game's layout resembles something akin to the classic, Defender, but with the pulse-pounding reflexes and challenge you would expect from a Treasure or Cave shmup such as Ikaruga or Progear.\nThe difficulty keeps you on the edge at all times, inviting arcade cabinet veterans to feel right at home while still managing the accessibility to always be just within reach of the newest, most curious shmup fan. In the end, the biggest challenge is stopping yourself from going for that "one last highscore!" again and again.","October 25, 2013","true","22.2"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","31","42","0","0"

For those who are unaware, the MSX keyboards had huge arrow keys, specially designed for games. I loved it!\n\nHowever, there are some flaws.\n1) It is not possible to leave the game in between phases, because the ESC key won't work until the game has started. So you are forced to go through the cut scenes between levels and wait until the game has started.\n\n2) Unlike the games from the 80's, there are too many visual elements in the game and sometimes it is hard to tell between something that is "shootable" and something that isn't.\n\n3) there are no hints or clues to what the difficulty levels are, since its names aren't very intuitive. Actually, there isn't a single hint in the menus!\n\n4) There is too much story in the cut scenes. Sometimes I just want to get to business and start shooting. I don't care about the plot or the background story! I didn't care when I was 14, I won't care now!\n\nOther than that and a few other minor flaws, it is a very nice game and I am very glad I got it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/recommended/252310/","arleas","arleas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/","1379 products in account","This game is a throwback to all the R-Type wannabe games from the 80's and 90's.  The music had that perfect "Amiga 500" feel to it, and the game's style in general made me think of some of the old shooters from that era as well.\n\nYou get 4 different types of ships to choose from with different movement, fire, armor, and special weapon capabilities.  Each one gives the levels its own particular flavor of challenge to it.  Instead of being a straight up "Fly to the right infinitely while destroying bad guys who attack in predictable patterns" style of shooter, they offer you the chance to flip between left and right so you can turn around and shoot those ♥♥♥ holes that come at you from behind.\n\nMuch like R-Type there's a multitude of in-game powerups you can pick up which you find after destroying enemies or waves of enemies, and there's also a plain looking white box style powerup that apparently adds to your special weapon charge. (though I'm not sure how that works exactly because it seemed like I was able to fire my special pretty often).\n\nAlso if that's not enough nostalgia for you, there's a variety of in-game graphic filters so you can pretend you're playing it on a 4 bit greyscale screen, 8 bit greyscale, Vic-20, C-64, ZX Spectrum, Amiga HAM (Hold And Modify mode), EGA, CGA, and modern graphics (I may have left something out though).\n\nIt's challenging without being too frustrating, it's got just enough bullet hell without forcing you to become the zen master at dodging everything, and the graphics and music complete the experience.","July 16, 2014","true","3.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/252310/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","This is a free-scrolling 2D shooter. Unlike most shmups, you're free to turn around to destroy your enemies behind you as well as terminate anything that would dare attempt a frontal assault. It's kinda like Defender, except levels don't wrap-around. In fact if you hit either end of the level you'll bounce away like you were hit by a galactic tennis racquet.\n\nThe story is about aliens or pirates or hot babes or I can't remember. Basically it's an excuse to have six stages of blastemup action. You're given a choice between four ships, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Each ships has its own special weapon that does great damage while putting up a temporary shield. Unlike most other shooters, the federation gave you an actual armored ship. In short, you don't die in a single hit, unless you crash into something, or play on the "pure" difficulty which all but removes armor.\n\nThe campaign has a decent amount of variety to it. First stage is the bog-standard destroy everything, second is an escort mission (ewww), third you're expected to survive for several minutes. By the 4th stage you're fighting off a pirate armada, 5th has you taking on alien battleships, and finally the last stage you're trying to outrun a storm to destroy a...thing. I think this thing is dangerous to the human race so yeah, definitely blow it up.\n\nThere are three survival stages as well. First one can get pretty difficult, you're most likely going to die in 6 to 10 minutes. The second one you have to race through a passage of ice to destroy another thing. I don't get along well with 3D walls in shmups, I tend to do a lot of crashing. I don't know what the deal is with the third survival stage. It's wave-based, but nothing happens after I blow up the juggernaut, no more enemies appear or anything.\n\nThe score is mostly influenced by the difficulty. The harder the setting, the better the score. There are a bunch of medals that are awarded for performing certain tasks (dodging a lot of bullets, getting combos, etc) so look out for those as well.\n\nThere's not much else to say about this game really. It's not bad, though I think the player weapons are a little underpowered. This is especially apparent in survival stage 1, where it can get overwhelming simply because it takes too long to destroy the boss ships. Also when you lose a life, your ship doesn't really explode and disappear or anything. Perhaps the next ship could fly in from the foreground. Half the time it looks like I just took damage, but now I'm down a life. It's an odd feeling. I'd rather have a brief moment to realize "Yup...I died. I better not suck as much next time." like every other shooter. Also in the third stage, enemy bullets can get lost in the sunny background. This has never caused me to die, but I'll wager it happened to somebody.\n\nAnd uh...that's it. No really, I've stretched myself thin as it is. Syder Arcade is a decent enough game. It's nothing fantastic, but it checks all my boxes.","November 18, 2014","true","4.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

This game is sort of cheap 2.5D version of Defender, there is no doubt about that. 2.5D feels a little like unnecessary memory allocation and doesn't offer much gameplay-wise, other than giving you false impression of things you can touch and cannot, such as landscapes. Retro filters are nice idea, but in the end they are just video filters that make it harder to see what's going on, making some of the small enemy projectiles rather sneaky. I have seen games that do the same thing with changing whole tilesets and sprites while still giving the same feel to the game but offering fresh look at the game. Syder Arcade fails to impress here but I like the idea it is going for. There is no excuse. Just not fair enough.\n\nYou have four initial ships to choose from, but other than having different kind of weapons they don't make gameplay feel much different from each other. Variety is always a good thing tho, even when minimal. I like the way ships look. Enemy variety on the other hand is quite low profile and you'll be shooting through same masses over and over again. Luckily game has just handful of levels. There was a story mode too, but as an arcade man I couldn't care about anything that takes more than 2 lines. Tried reading it too, but it wasn't interesting or cheesy enough. But that could be just me. It is there though if you want it.\n\nControls are kinda stiff. Sometimes its very hard to dodge projectiles or enemies even with fastest ship. Hard to spot projectiles don't help much. I tried using arcade stick for maximum potential but it still felt kind of slow. Scoring system has nice idea to it with badges and such, but very often you get exactly the same ones. I chuckled at the easiest difficulty describing the player growing up with modern consoles because that is exactly what comes to my mind with this game.\n\nIn conclusion I don't know who Syder is and I don't feel much of arcade about it. It is kind of okay, but at the same time a stub of a shooter to say at least. If you are in for old school shooters or modern bullet hell/shmups you're not going to enjoy Syder Arcade as much as the game wants to suggest. For one it has nice music, but the game could evolve a lot.","May 13, 2014","false","5.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

This is definitely one of those games.  I can't really speak too much on the gameplay because, well, it's a shooter.  It's pretty much what you'd expect.  Also I'm no where near the leading authority on shooters as the closest game I can compare this too is Sexy Parodius and I don't know if that's a far comparison.  It's just fun.\n\nThe only downsides are that it takes a little too long to get back into the action once you've died on survival mode (it takes you back to the main menu).  It really only takes a few seconds to get back in, but it'd be nice if there was an option to just start the level again right away.  I also wish there were more levels and ships to choose from.

Developed by Studio Evil, you are a singular ship thrown against innumerable amounts of enemy crafts to accomplish different missions, ranging from protecting a friendly but immense warship through an asteroid field, to simply destroying every ship that you aren’t piloting. These six missions are delivered to you in sequence in the form of a simple yet endearing storyline, and after a good ten minutes of flying around space with a level of skill that you can look back and be proud of, you can compare your scores to all the other pilots out there.\n\nImmediately upon launching the game, you will notice the graphics, which can only be described as stunning. Even the menu screen is pleasing to look at and simple to navigate. The game also offers a “GFX” setting on this menu where you can select from between 20 different graphics filters. These filters are great fun to play around with, and some will certainly bring back memories of days gone by for older gamers while the more modern filters are very impressive for gamers who are perhaps not old enough for the nostalgia to extend to them. The graphics really shine through during the fighting; if you can manage to tear your eyes off of the seemingly unavoidable shots being fired at you for even a second, you will be able to appreciate the asteroid belts in the background and even the amount of effort and detail that has gone into the mines – which will only be on your screen for a few seconds before they violently explode.","February 28, 2015","true","3.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The music, sound effects and graphics are amazing. It plays a lot like Gradius with automatic upgrades and without you dying in one hit. You can also turn your your plane around, which makes levels feel a lot bigger.\n\nFor the current price, just try it.

First of all i have to say that i love SHMUP's (Eastern style and Western style) and boy this one suprised me. There are six campaign level's and four difficulty level's and i have to admit that i got trough them all maybe too easy though on lowest setting. You have three ships to choose from which differ at speed/armor and normal weaponry and special attack.\n\nIn this gorgeous, yes gorgeous because graphics are amazing for SHMUP, there are all the things happening in the background. The game is 3D though you can move only in 2D which is great and the ship effect's, explosions and bosses look fantastastic. I could not ask for more.\n\nThe gameplay itself is not just simply go to one direction because you can flip your ship and you will have to do it alot, yeah have an radar of the whole screen and every single mission has different objectives. One time you may have to just kill the boss, next time you must protect you battleship etc. So it shows variancy which is usually rare in these kind of games. Addition to campaign there is Survival which is exactly as it sounds.\n\nSo all the SHMUP fans and even not an SHMUP fan. You want to try this out!

But Studio Evil, an independent developer from Italy, proved the opposite. Syder Arcade has awesome high definition graphics and nice sounds as a shmup. The gameplay is very fluid and gives the player the option shooting in two different directions (left to right; right to left). The stages are very different to each other and the difficulty varies from very easy (tourist mode) to hard (pure mode) in five difficulties. Too bad, it has some exploiting mechanics on some stages in the campaign mode. But I feel certain they work hard on getting this game more and more polished. In my opinion that makes Syder Acade surely to one of the best shmup gems out there.

There are also various retro filters you can play with, so that you can see how the game would have looked if you still had a c64, amiga or spectrum. The game is fairly fast paced, the story was script up by crayon, it basically consists of here's the enemy go blow things up. Relatively bug free, though I have myself experienced some comical glitches in the game, like the storm on the last level sometimes has a mind of its own and can even go through the warp gate with you.\n\nMusic decent and groovy, the weapons and ships are cool and versatile, my personal favorite is the wasp with machine gun and special weapon activated. Basically it says 'get out of my way i'm coming through!'\n\nThe game was actually suppose to be a prequel to a upcoming game called 'Syder Universe' which the developers never really got off the ground. Even though this is their first game they have kind of lost interest for some reason and are trying to make a name for themselves with other projects. But by shifting their attention so quickly and not giving the customers things that they desire, they inadverty do make a name for themselves, but maybe one that is not so flattering. Because this is a really decent product, but short with content, throngs of gamers have expressed a desire for more levels both in campaign and survival and I myself would love to see that.\n\nAchievement hunters may be somewhat perplexed with this game as several achievements require high score leaderboard requirements. Leaderboards more often than not showcase the results of numerous cheaters who often have scores demonstrating 100 million above everyone else. Biggest problem is that the developers every blue moon reset the leaderboard tallies. So gaining these achievements maybe taxing on serious achievment hunters. While some of these achievements seem more to be governed by the submitting of your score to the global score than the actual score itself being that important, it must be noted that this is only an expressed view of a handful gamers and no one really knows for sure how these achievements work as developers seem to largely ignore the fan base and ignore many queeries in the Steam forums.\n\nFinal thoughts is that the developers have used this game to showcase their talents and have also sadly at the same time displayed a barrage of false promises, inconsistencies with feedback and a lack of overall dedication to their first product. Still enjoyed it, but sad that the developers carelessness left many frustrated with the lack of content and with infuriating unrealistic leaderboards.\n\n","September 13, 2015","true","18.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I've only ever played a few shmups. I can't even remember titles, really. It was a couple decades ago. I just liked them because they gave me that little something extra that my yet-undiagnosed ADHD craved. All I really remember is I really liked the ones that were in space where I could upgrade my main weapon to discharge more energy than my little ship could possibly muster. Great Fun!\n\nThis game is... something else. The very first thing I noticed was the array of different visual modes. I don't remember what they all are, specifically, but there is one for every personal computer display I've ever known, a few I forgot about, and a couple I've never heard of. So, if you're craving the eye-strain of yesteryear gaming, Syder's got you covered.\n\nHave you ever been barreling through space, roasting everything in your path, and missed that one weapon upgrade that would make your main gun take up 20% of the screen? Well, in Syder, there is a "flip" control (space bar, by default). At first, I thought it was like in 1943, where the craft would do a somersault, and let fly some screen clearing superweapon. Turns out, "flip" means turn your ship around and GO THE OTHER WAY!!! On top of that, there's RADAR!\n\nGet this game. I got it in the Meridian4 decade sale, for 2.49. It's easily worth the standard 9.99. Get it. Don't ask questions. If you've dug deep enough into the reviews to located and read mine, then you want to game. You know you do.

However, the genre is not entirely forgotten, with the occasional title like Syder Arcade coming along.\n\nThe best that I can describe it for old-school gamers is to take an R-Type or Thunderforce IV, and give it controls akin to Defender where you can turn around and have a long range radar.\n\nFor those not familiar with the genre, you're a lone spaceship that has to kill lots and lots of enemies. You can move at any angle, but generally enemy attacks come from the left and right of you. There are lots of items to collect to power up your guns. There are several stages to complete, most of which are the get-to-the-end variety, but also an escort mission, and there are a few bosses to defeat as well.\n\nFirst the good part - the graphics are bright and colorful, and even when the bullets come heavily you can usually tell where you are and what's going on. The controls are tight, and there are several types of ships that change gameplay quite significantly.  There are a variety of skill levels to insure that novices and experts alike can enjoy the game without too much frustration. The music is good, and it's a generally fun game.\n\nIt's not perfect, however. There are not a ton of stages to play, and they lack variety. The bosses are rather similar and unimaginative. The tacked on story is skip-worthy.\n\nOverall, however, this is a fun little indie time-waster, and I am glad that I bought it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWisdomEye/recommended/252310/","TheWisdomEye","Egen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWisdomEye/","306 products in account","So this is one of the best shoot 'em ups I've ever played. Seriously. I'll give you my credentials, I've been playing since Gradius, Raiden, etc, I import Japanese shoot 'em ups like Ibara/Espgaluda/other Cave game, blah blah. I'm a huge fan of the genre. But this one is simply one of the best, because even after all these years, Syder Arcade took a classic genre and breathed new life into it.\n\nSeriously, if you've ever played Gradius and wanted to just turn around and shoot that guy that just made it by you... do it! In Syder Arcade, you can literally turn your ship around in the other direction at will. Better yet, you can actually travel backwards through a level by doing this, in case you... missed a powerup, or an enemy, or whatever. There's even a defense level where you have to survive for a certain amount of time protecting a huge allied battleship (which doesn't need an egregious amount of protecting), and you will travel back and forth through the area quite a few times gunning down all the ships that appear. You can also stop moving altogether; the screen doesn't scroll without your permission. It's like... you're actually flying your own spacecraft. It's crazy.\n\nSyder Arcade also does something else I haven't ever seen a shoot 'em up focus on: melee combat. I know, the idea is ridiculous. You're in a spacecraft, for crying out loud! But in Syder Arcade (like in many good shoot 'em ups), you have your primary weapon, and your secondary weapon (the latter of which needs to be charged in various ways). Though each of the four selectable ships have different secondary weapons, all of them put a shield around your ship for 2 or 3 seconds. During this time, you can literally just ram the hell out of enemy spacecraft. There are even bonuses for doing it! It is GREAT! You can also absorb bullets this way, for which there are also bonuses. And one of the best parts: you have a health bar. One mistake isn't necessarily the whole game!\n\nSeriously, this game is worth playing, even for shoot 'em up fans that think they have seen it all. What I really like, too, is that it's not exactly a "bullet hell" game. I know those are really popular, like Cave games, Touhou, etc... and I like them, but every once in a while it's nice to focus more on blowing stuff up than memorizing bullet patterns and stuff. There are still plenty of bullets to dodge in Syder Arcade though, and the game won't go down without a fight on "Pure" difficulty.\n\nThe one thing I have to warn about: currently, Survival is quite buggy. None of the achievements for Survival unlock (at least, they didn't for me after 3 hours of trying and some top-80 scores). Also, the ice level is totally bugged and will freeze the game, and the juggernaut level also won't end and will just sit until you quit out. This kind of hurts Syder Arcade's replayability, because if it's anything I love about a shoot 'em up, it's a good Survival mode to improve my scores on. But even aside from this, it is so worth playing through this game and seeing what fun things you can do in the genre even after all this time.\n\nHighly, highly recommended, a favorite of mine on all of Steam!","May 21, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I work from home and sometimes need a break, I don't always have time to play a game for hours, an Syder allows for just that; an hour of shooting and dodging stuff while upgrading your weapons. To tell you the truth I was a little disappointed at first, the game semed relatively easy, but then I triied a differnt ship and that is where this game has a hgh replay value. Each ship is different enough that you must incorporate a different strategy for each. The enemies and drops are well balanced. The difference in the weapons on the ships also lend to multiple play styles.\nThe only negaitve I would have is I was left wanting more, but that could probably be said about most anything enjoyable.

This is a UI design problem.\n\nAs expected, the survival modes have online leaderboards.\n\nThere are a number of ships to choose from with different weapons and speed/armor values. There are also several difficulty levels to choose from.\n\nI have encountered two things I'd call bugs. First, in the last campaign level, dying can result in the ship respawning inside rock. Cue an instant death. And the next respawn can also result in the very same thing. Second, again in the last campaign level, I must've missed something since I couldn't get the final enemy's first lock to revolve. Maybe the storm hadn't progressed far enough, but it wasn't moving anywhere either.","January 5, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

If you grew up with games like R-Type, you're going to love Syder Arcade. It's the classic gameplay, simple yet challenging fast-forward shoot'em up action. Switchable add-ons, mega weapons that you need to charge before using them (and keeping you on the edge of your seat while loading - will the ship withstand the enemies' fire? Will - hell, yeah - take that -> whoosh!), it's all in here.\n\nGraphics\nSide scrollers have always been titles that caught their audiences with great graphics. "Syder Arcade" is in no ways inferior to the classics. It really shines (not only) in this category. Be it the explosions, the 2.5 backgrounds, weapons, beams - this one really shines!\nFantastic extra: Of course you can play with contemporary graphics, but you can also choose from several old school modes like pixelated, greyscale, C64ish, Amiga style, CGA, EGA, VGA (320, 640) and many more.\n\nSounds & Music\nThe combination of old school- and modern styles continues. While the sound effects are rich and deep in sound itself, they're also classic for this genre. As for the music: I *LOVE* the score. Instead of using modern synths only, you'll get those awesome (and imho way more "organic") analog synthesizer sounds, too, which are genre defining not only in games, but movies as well.\n@Evil Studio: Is there any possibility of getting the soundtrack? Would be a great addition to my 80ies Synth Collection).\n\n\nGreat Controls\nWell, ok - what's to say about controls? You've got a classic 2D side scroller here featuring classic gameplay, so don't expect exczessive controller overkill. Studio Evil has done a very nice and also classic job on the controls here, so don't worry about getting entangeled in complicated keyboard layouts, just fire away. Just like the graphics: Thumbs up, guys!\n\nBottom line\nOne thing is for sure: The developers don't just *know* the genre, they obviously seem to *love* it. "Syder Arcade" is one of those rare titles nowadays, that really live up to the expecations of old school gamers (like myself) on the one hand, but can also bring good results in keeping things fresh and ready for a whole new generation of gamers.\nFantastic graphics combined with controls that are easily accessible with no troubles at all and a special treat for old school gamers, "Syder Arcade" grants a fantastic blast from the past done right, with either contemporary or classic graphis and a darn high replayability.","December 31, 2013","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You have a pretty decent selection of ships and campaigns. Every ship has its flaws and benefits. Another characteristic of this game is that you can turn your ship and attack enemies backwards. Not every mission is "k', kill enemies, go forward, kill boss, win", sometimes you have to defend larger ships from enemies spawning everywhere and their bullet hell, adding more variety to the gameplay. BTW, it has catchy OST and awesome graphics. If you had any kind of computer back in 80-90 like amiga, C64 or IBM pc there's an option that let you change the visuals like if you were playing in one of these computers (it was interesting to play a game in 3D in a CGA pallette). And last but not least, you have global ranking.\n\nDo you like R-type or Gradius, love dodging 3149134790 bullets like in Touhou/Ikaruga?, then you should give this game a try!","February 20, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you are a fan of shoot-em-ups, horizontal scrolling or not, you will find nothing unique or exceptional here.\nThe controls do their job alright, the ability to change directions will come as a unique selling point to anyone who hasn't played G-Darius in the last 18 or Defender in the last 35 years since they were released. The retro throw-back music does its job well, not interesting enough to be listenable on its own, but not bad enough to be a distraction. The same cannot be said for the visuals, that look appealing and crisp for the most part but seriously lack variety. The backgrounds also quite often get in the way of the gameplay when bloom hides enemy bullets. There's a wide selection of pseudo-retro Computer graphic filters you can add, that exacerbate this problem. It's a fun little gag for a short while but renders the game almost unplayable in parts. Enemy designs are dull and you've seen them in basically every shmup ever created. Whether that is an intentional nod to the greats or not is irrelevant. Being ironically uncreative is still being uncreative.\n\nAs a whole Syder Arcade has no substance and lacks anything unique. It's short, generic and wholly unremarkable, especially for the price. I understand that the developers may have a genuine love for the genre but they obviously did not have a single thing to add to the mix. Indie developers can do so much better and so much more creative, especially in 2013.\nDon't waste your money on this one.

I admit that even on sale I was reluctant to buy this one as it seems every indie developer is doing some form of old skewl gaming and the same old thing is regurgitated or they just screwed it up trying to be innovative. I'm seriously glad I coughed up my milk money for a day because if I knew that this game was this good, I would have coughed up my lunch money! To put it lightly, it is evidant that Studio Evil knows how to do old skewl gaming, they keep it real, make it fun and then slap you up side your head with the hardness factor. This game is your basic Defender remake but with 1,000 times the enemies, 10,000 times the power ups and bonuses, 100,000 times the replayability, and 1,000,000 times the enemy fire coming at you. Graphics are great (just wish that it would work on my laptop as it has Intel graphics but I'm installing it anyways just because I've been told many times before that a program won't run on my laptop and they end up working fine anyways, I'll update my review after some testing, but I digress.), the controls took but a minute to get used to (this game makes me wanna go out and buy an arcade stick), the sounds are okay, but the replayability is what makes this game so awesome.

If you are a fan of shoot-em-ups, horizontal scrolling or not, you will find nothing unique or exceptional here.\nThe controls do their job alright, the ability to change directions will come as a unique selling point to anyone who hasn't played G-Darius in the last 18 or Defender in the last 35 years since they were released. The retro throw-back music does its job well, not interesting enough to be listenable on its own, but not bad enough to be a distraction. The same cannot be said for the visuals, that look appealing and crisp for the most part but seriously lack variety. The backgrounds also quite often get in the way of the gameplay when bloom hides enemy bullets. There's a wide selection of pseudo-retro Computer graphic filters you can add, that exacerbate this problem. It's a fun little gag for a short while but renders the game almost unplayable in parts. Enemy designs are dull and you've seen them in basically every shmup ever created. Whether that is an intentional nod to the greats or not is irrelevant. Being ironically uncreative is still being uncreative.\n\nAs a whole Syder Arcade has no substance and lacks anything unique. It's short, generic and wholly unremarkable, especially for the price. I understand that the developers may have a genuine love for the genre but they obviously did not have a single thing to add to the mix. Indie developers can do so much better and so much more creative, especially in 2013.\nDon't waste your money on this one.

There were certainly aspects of the game I enjoyed, but boy oh boy are there bugs. This game clearly needed 1 or 2 more pollishing passes to balance out things and fix annoying issues with it.\n\nIt was also VERY short. I've played 1.7 hours of the game, and I've already completed it. One sitting. I even sat through a few plays of the gauntlet forever mode, but alas, I've lost interest.\n\nHere's my pros/cons list.\n\nNeeds work:\n- Some textures were great. Others were very pixelated. Set a standard for your textures.\n- Zero character development. I realize that character development in these types of games may be difficult to do. But I think it would help get the player connected and involved in the story.\n- Level descriptions were too busy. Couldn't tell if I was supposed to read them, or just click go.\n- Sound system problems. From too many sounds overlapping and overdriving, to the music cutting out in an obvious loop restart\n- SFX were fairly generic\n- Dialog is a bit childish. It tries to be funny, but just.. isn't.\n- Campaign was too short\n- Level difficulty went from omg easy mode to omg impossihard. Level progression needs to be steady, not in your face.\n\nWas good:\n- Defender style gameplay was refreshing. I liked keeping an eye on my tail to be sure its clear\n- Responsive controls. I'm using an xbox controller on my pc\n- Addons and upgrades accumulate through the game. I liked that\n- Music was GREAT. I really dig it, and thought it was the best part of the game\n- Retro filters. You could play the game as if it was using an Amiga video card. Neat\n\nI am in the middle of developing my own shmup, so I'm 'researching' by other games out there. It's really a lot of work to finish a game, polish it, remove what doesn't work, etc. But in the end, you absolutely must do all of that because it sucks to go 90% through the development only to fall flat because the last 10% of the work wasn't done.\n\nPay more attention to the details, and people will flock to your game.","December 25, 2015","false","1.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

This completely negates any "just one more go" factor the game could have had and would have gone some way to compensating for the steep difficulty curve.\n\nIf you're looking for a shooter that you can dip into and play quickly, don't waste your time with this, however pretty it may look or sound.","November 4, 2014","false","0.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","3"

You can simply change direction whenever you feel the need.\n\nGood:\n+ Backround is alive and much more than empty space\n+ 4 ships (but i only used the first one, because I need dmg at one spot and not spray and hope)\n\nBad:\n- only 6 lvl\n- game is over within 1 h\n- stupid bosses, just stay out of sight and shoot him down pressing one button. No movement required\n- on lvl 3, enemy fire and backround have the same color making it impossible to evade sometimes\n\nConclusion:\nI payed like 2,50 €, and that is barely ok for this game.\nFor a game released at this time, I am disappointed, One hour and game over.\nSure you can get high score and compare to others. But this is not what i like.\n\nDo I recommand this to my friends? No.\nShould you buy it? Only if you liked R-Type and now want to have a poor mans version with improved grafics for a price well below 5$.","August 6, 2014","false","1.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoGalaxy/recommended/252310/","NeoGalaxy","[EDF] Shadow Dragon™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoGalaxy/","444 products in account","One the most boring arcade game played by me. There's 4 ships one can choose but except the 1st, the rest were not even remotely interesting to me. It has a campaign, too much to say campaign since the progress is never saved. You can play every mission alone or all after each other (if you survive each and not die), it's the same. There's no story, who cares about it anyway. Just some random missions in which you kill some ships and that's it. It has no co-op, or antyhing like it, not continue if you die, it's nothing of what old arcade games were. The last mission is boring like hell, the last boss is by far the most non interesting boss that a game can have.\n\nSadly my interest for this game was below average, seems mediocre at best, while the interest decreases with every mission played.  5/10, a game to throw in the bin. Maybe they should have never remake the old version, probably a better idea.","January 21","false","5.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hideo_suzuki/recommended/252310/","hideo_suzuki","Hideo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hideo_suzuki/","448 products in account","Sadly, this game is plagued with bugs and questionable decisions regarding the achievement conditions. Regarding achievements in arcade games in general: They give you (or at least me) a purpose to push yourself further, that's why it's really unfortunate if there's a problem with them and that's why I adress issues with them specifically.\n\n\nOne of the very distressing bugs can occur in the last of the six campaign levels and prevents you from finishing the level/campaign (there are moving rings you have to fly through which sometimes simply don't move). Another one affects one of the three Survival levels, Ice Canyon, which prevents you from finishing it as well.\n\nMany achievements aren't doing the game any good as well. For example, you have four achievements for completing the campaign on various difficulty settings. You might think it would be logical to unlock achievements of the lower difficulty levels automatically when you beat the campaign, but that's not the case here. Even if you beat the campaign the first time directly on Hard (“Arcade”), you still have to play the campaign again on Young Gun (“Normal”) and Tourist (“Easy”). Combine this with level-stopping bug and you're in for a time of frustration, and that's why I didn't even bother trying Pure (“Very Hard”).\n\nAlso, there are four leaderboard achievements which are simply dreadful. You have to be in the top 15% in the corresponding leaderboard (campaign and each of the three survival levels). Did I also mention that the achievements are bugged and sometimes get shown way later? One of the survival level leaderboard achievements is genuinely bugged and you can't get it, but you won't immediately know except if you look it up.\n\nOther annoying things\nbarebones gamepad support: you have to use the Select button to go back and can't use the D-Pad to navigate in menus\nyou quickly lose overview in an area in the third level, because of a very bright sun in the background\nthe four ships to choose from aren't really balanced\n\nConclusionIt is a shame. If there were less bugs, no leaderboard achievements and if it simply were more polished, it could have been really, really good. I actually even had some fun while playing it, but with the campaign-stopping bug present I simply cannot recommend it.","February 15, 2015","false","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is great, enemies are fun to shoot.  Your ship works like a Viper in Battlestar Galactica in that you can flip directions on a dime meaning that in many levels you will be going both left-to-right and right-to-left.  This basically doubles the size of each map and forces you to focus on stuff coming from all directions not just in front of you.\n\nIf you enjoy shmups or bullet hell games I highly recommend this game.

On the surface that's true, but it is missing the best part of either.\n\nDefender is a game of strategy, the player has lots of options (go left or go right, should I attempt to save a humanoid or take down those enemy's one screen over, when things get bad should I use a bomb or do I risk a warp). This game has none of that strategy: in the campaign you are either on offense and you go from left to right killing everything, or your on defense and you keep on ping-ponging between left and right killing everything. In survival you cannot just kill everything, but the enemy density is so uniform that whether you move left or right hardly matters, the entire playspace is equally full of enemies.\n\nIf you are looking for choices beyond what to kill next there is the decision or what power-ups to risk getting or not. Except it doesn't matter, all of the power-ups are incredibly weak and boring; for example: the side shot ability shots 2 bullets perpendicular to your ship's in-built machine gun. This gun could be incredibly powerful to keep enemies on your flanks from destroying you, except the gun is so weak it takes at minimum 3 seconds to kill the weakest enemy in the game with it, and this is a game where the screen is flooded with enemies. Why should I bother picking up a power-up that is so uselessly weak?\n\nClearly this game doesn't measure up to Defender, but it doesn't measure up to bullet hell shooters either. The best bullet hell shooters are about making the player incredibly powerful while simultaneously being incredibly weak, a hose of damage that can be destroyed at a moment. That isn't the choice the designers of this game went with; instead it is a battle of attrition where both you and your enemies have large health bars and take quite a bit of time to kill. And while you do need to constantly dodge dozens of bullets at a time, the game moves at a fairly slow pace for the genre so twitch skills are not required.\n\nThe game doesn't have strategy, its not very twitchy, its just a mediocre shooter. I suggest if you are looking for a game that has strategy like Defender and twitchy bullet hell just wait for Ikaruga to be released on Steam.\n\n(note: I only played the game for an hour, but that was enough time to beat the campaign and play survival several times. There do not appear to be any additional unlocks so I have tried all of the content this game has on offer within that hour.)","December 16, 2013","false","1.1"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","1"

A very simple concept made visually beautiful by artistic minds that knew what they wanted to do when they started making it.\n\nThis type of game has been made and remade hundreds of times, so I'm not going to spend much time talking about the gameplay. You fly around the space shooting enemies and completing little missions. That's pretty much it, what makes this game special is the extremely appealing visuals and great soundtrack that goes along with it.\n\nI don't know what kind of budget went in to this game, but I sure hope they've earned it back in spades. Buy this game, fly around, kill some ships, and have fun for a few hours. You have exactly nothing to lose (other than the cost of the game, of course.)\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of the feature to change the graphical quality to match those of vintage video game systems and PC's is one of the nicest things I've ever seen. I can't be the only one on earth who waxes nostalgic about how things looked on an original gameboy, an Apple II, or a friggin' AMIGA!\n\nVery good job. 7/10.","March 22, 2014","true","3.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Most of the levels play a bit like the classic "Defender" where you have to clear all the enemies and can fly left or right. Other levels allow you to rush through without even caring about shooting enemies.\n\nThe game feels very generic. The enemies look boring. Same can be said about the levels. Your ships are sluggish and the difficulty is very low. Especially the final level is just tedious and slow. It took me less than two hours to finish the game. I would only recommend this game if you are really into the genre and can get it for less than 3€. I enjoy shmups and it's great that there are indy studios bringing fresh shmups to the market, but in this case I have to give the game a thumbs down. There are just too many better alternatives out there.","September 30, 2014","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think Defender in terms of movement.  You have a selection of ships to choose from, each with their own varying armor/mobility statistics and their own primary/special weapons.  The graphics are beautiful, although you can alter the color palette and quality quite a bit.  Playing with the style is a lot of fun, as you can apply effects that make the graphics appear like various older home computer systems or generic grayscale effects at varying bit quality.  Story is ok so far, but there are a fair number of typos and grammatical errors.  I played on the Young Gun difficulty using a keyboard, and I'm not fantastic at it.  One thing that bugged me a little bit is the inability to continue when you run out of lives.  Even if it's arcade-style, you should still be able to continue.  In an arcade, an inability to continue a stage or campaign-based game would mean less money.\n\nI think this game is better suited for a controller, ex. X360 or gamepad controller.  The music is also pretty darn good.  Worth a look, although get it on sale or with a coupon.","September 23, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its pick-m-up/put-m-down.  6 well thought out levels, beautifully done in HD.  But when you think about it, it has 4 ships to play + survival, so 6 levels is relative.  Each ship really is a whole new level.  Controls are basic, easy to learn.  Only gripe, it feels like the response is slow through the dialog windows (press fire to skip).  Even on the easy levels, the game is a real ball buster.  And the different graphics modes are kind of cool.\n\nso here it is:\nthe good:\nside scrolling shooter\nretro\neasy to play with a controller\neasy to start, and stop as needed\ncheck out the graphics options, its fun\n\nthe bad:\n6 levels (x4 ships x4 difficulties x3 survival modes, so its not that short)\ncontrols feel slow to respond (more noticable in dialog boxes)\n\nBottom line:  Fun, retro game that feels retro, not just a glossy retro coating.  I paid like 5 bucks for the HB bundle, so its well worth the bundle price, but 10 bucks may be a little much for some.  7 bucks is almost perfect.

This is the free-scrolling shooter that plays much like the old Williams Arcade game Defender. The Shoot and Flip buttons will have you realize that real quick, as well as the radar, so if you have played Defender, you will feel right at home with the controls.\nThis game is also Bullet Hell for those of you who think you can dodge colored dots for days, you will enjoy trying your luck in this.\nSo what is Syder Arcade? It's a Shoot 'Em Up game that plays like the days of old-school shooters, where there is no grinding, no upgrades, no unlockable, ...none of that. You start the game, and you start shooting and trying to survive. You will hopefully be doing both equally as much. It will take all of your skills to reach the top-ranks of the leaderboard because the points do matter, and killing and surviving is just not enough. You will need to earn in-game score achievements like Chain Combos to get the bonus points needed to move up on the leaderboards, and there are enough of them to keep you occupied with improving your skills.\nCampaign is your basic story mode and each stage will have it's own high score as well as a campaign highscore if you manage to finish it entirely. When you are done there (or want to take a break from it), jump into Survival mode. This is the true arcade feeling and a test of your skills to truly see if you are worthy of the SHMUP genre.\nAlso, if you've been playing games since the Amiga or Commodore days, listen the to music. You can tell this was an idea pulled from the mid-to-late 80's, and it was a good idea that is worth every penny.","January 18, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The good things about it are elements of every shmup ever, but the things that aren't so good are its own additions.\n\nThere are multiple ships, none of which can possibly hope to match the power of the forward-shooting laser gun ship. Each ship has its own special weapon, none of which can possibly hope to match the power of the same ship's big-♥♥♥ laser. Level 3 has some very questionable design where part of the background is the exact same color as most enemy bullets, effectively making their shots invisible if they pass over it. The dialogue is so short, uninformative, cliched and referential that it actually detracts from the gameplay and would be better off being removed. There's a "hyperspeed" mechanic where if you keep going forward for a few seconds you get a speed boost, but it's not used very often - mostly on the last level, where you risk instant death from collision damage as a result. You can also turn around, unlike most shmups, but like the hyperspeed it's very under-utilized as 2/3rds of the levels go in one direction only and on the others you mostly just flip back and forth to face different waves.\n\nIt's not BAD, but it's not good either.

I just love the design: beautiful, fluent controlss, visibility of the elements on the field was worked out very well - even if it's cluttered with enemies, explosions and power-ups, you still can clearly see what's happening. That's a huge plus. And nostalgia factor is through the roof - just like the old times with Amiga, but... better :) After a while I can say that it's on par with titles like r-type or turrican. Just buy it and start shooting, why are you even still reading this. Go.","May 14","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
