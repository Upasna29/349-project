"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/264480/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Let me get this out of the way: I wouldn't define BlackSoul: Extended Edition as a good game. It's got too many problems with it for me to say that. And honestly, the only people who are going to enjoy it are those that liked B-Tier horror games in the late 90s and early 2000s, games like Deep Fear or Blue Stinger or Kuon. However, despite all of its problems, I did end up enjoying the game, and it does get better as it goes along.\n\nBlackSoul: Extended Edition is an old-school styled survival-horror game, where you utilize limited supplies, puzzles, and clunky tank controls to make your way through several locations. The story is that you're a brother going to a nearby forest to rescue your sister... You play as both through the course of the game. However, honestly speaking, the story hardly has any presence, and the ending is disappointing. But I did enjoy the notes that you occasionally pick up in the game. They were interesting enough, and honestly most of the game's story is told through them.\n\nAudio-wise, it's mostly good. The music deserves particular mention, as it's all quite good and very horror-sounding, and adds a lot to the game experience. Audio isn't bad, and some of the ambiance is legitimately creepy, but some sounds, like the sounds the zombies make, get way too familiar and aren't particularly fantastic. And the voicing is god awful, but thankfully there's only like four spoken lines of dialogue in the whole game.\n\nGraphics actually aren't too shabby for a small budget indie effort. Some good lighting effects, interesting designed rooms, and good art direction. A few places managed to visually strike with me. However, some areas look far better than others, the animations in the game are wonky, and some textures (especially outside) are notably very low quality.\n\nThe gameplay is rather simple. Your character moves like a tank, find key items, solve puzzles, and make progress to the next location. Enemies blockade your way, and should either be taken out or avoided. You have limited ammo and healing items, so making decisions about your inventory is crucial. One feature here to note is that if an enemy manages to grab and gnaw on you, you get poisoned, which slowly drains your health. You have to find and use antidotes to heal poison, but they're limited, so sometimes its better to stick with being poisoned as you may very well quickly run into and get poisoned again by another enemy.\n\nOn that note, there's only three types of enemies in this game; Slow-stumbling zombies, speed-walking Zombies, and sprinting zombies. So basically, there's only zombies in this game. The speed of the zombie is random from zombie to zombie, but notably different zombie models take a different number of hits, which is always the same with that particular zombie model no matter what speed they move at. This limited enemy variety leaves definitely things to be desired, but also ultimately doesn't take too much from the game, as there's a larger focus on puzzles and exploration, which thankfully there is some good variety on.\n\nThe game is not short actually, it should take someone 10-16 hours to complete it the first time. The game has eight main locations, and it should be noted that they get better as the game progresses (the later areas I found a lot more enjoyable and interesting than the first few). The ultimate trial in the game comes from the second main location, The Graveyard. This location drags on, has a lot of backtracking, and honestly is probably the worst location in the game. But it's after this point the game also starts to get a lot better after the fact.\n\nThe puzzles are varied and fun, ranging from astronomical puzzles, riddle puzzles, slide tile puzzles, visual puzzles, memory puzzles, and more. The harder puzzles also have a 'solve it' option if you get stuck on them. However, a few puzzles were lifted directly out of old horror games and just altered around a bit, the most notable one being a clone of the Piano Puzzle from Silent Hill 1.\n\nThere's a few clone elements here actually. The game has a few scares and a few of them are effective, but a few were carbon-copied from Resident Evil and Silent Hill.\n\nAnd this is all ignoring the game's biggest problem; it's performance. The developers chose a very old engine to make the game, and it has a lot of problems. You have to manually resize the window. The game crashes every so often. While I had no issues running it, some people have to overcome hurdles just to make it work. A lot of this is on the engine the developers chose, which pre-dates even the Source Engine, but why the developers chose this engine and rolled with it when it has so many problems especially on modern machines is beyond me.\n\nAnd generally speaking I wouldn't call this a good game, or a game for everyone to experience. Honestly, if you do not have severe love for the genre, you should probably pass. There are far better horror games, and this game's problems can wear thin if you're not patient. The game gets better as it goes along, but it's nowhere near the quality of, say, Resident Evil or Silent Hill.\n\nBut as a genre enthusiast I actually did enjoy my time with it. I'm a gamer that has played a lot of horror games from all different eras of the genre. The good atmosphere and scares in places, music, puzzles, and interesting environments later in was enough for me. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't really love the genre or lack patience, but there are some interesting ideas and moments here for fans of the genre, and while it lacks elements it really shouldn't (this game would of honestly been so much better with a better story and enemy selection), it did keep enough going for me to want to keep going.\n\nDifficult, flawed, and only really for genre enthusiasts with patience and acceptance for flaws, the game isn't a hidden gem, but rather a mixed bag of good and bad which managed to keep me interested during its 10-16 hour campaign. It's really not for everyone, and it's not what I would call a good game, but it was interesting to see a raw low-budget modern indie take on the genre with clearly bigger ambitions and heart from people who loved the genre, but missed a few notes of what makes it what it is, but tackle other areas fairly well.","May 29, 2014","true","16.7"," 102 of 118 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","102","118","0","8"

"Blacksoul.exe has stopped working" everytime I attempt to load the game, suggested fixes found so far have failed to work.)\n\nEDIT: To test to see if downgrading my drivers would resolve the issue, I have rolled back my drivers and the game has finally loaded without error, the driver issue is currently being looked in to by the developer and I would like to extend a thank you to the developer for the feedback towards my initial response.\n\nIn saying that, I have mixed opinions on my first impressions, the overall atmosphere of the game so far is at least on the right track to what I came to expect and I do like the soundtrack to accompany this, however the immersion is soon broken by the frequent mass of loading screens between each small segment (by that I mean room by room). I currently found the best way to play the game is in cinematic view in the traditional fixed camera Resident Evil style and am more than pleased to see this in another horror game rather than the over the shoulder action cam. so that's a gold star there ! well done !\n\nOn a further sidenote, the scenery and settings for the game have been rendered beautifully and really lend to the atmosphere !\n\nHowever the cons still out weigh the pros but not by the largest stretch I originally thought when the game wouldn't work. With some performance tweaks to reduce the frequency of loading screens, re-designing of the Inventory UI to a better standard, control scheme to possibly allow controller support and finally some extended hardware supprt to prevent further problems that I originally faced, the game has alot of potential, but at present I would say it feels more like an early access game with its issues rather than a finished product (no offense intended by saying that) and would benefit from further developement.\n\nAs stated before, it does have potential and I hope the developer will have continued support and updates for this title, I am more than hopeful for further updates and will look forward to changing my opinion to "recommended" in the near future.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nSound: 8/10\nGameplay: 6/10\nControl: 7/10\n\nOverall 67%","February 26, 2014","false","16.6"," 91 of 134 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","91","134","0","13"

Between the puzzles within puzzles within puzzles, labyrinthine levels, repeating textures and zombie models, backtracking, bleakness and punishing difficulty, it creates one of the most hostile environments I've ever played.\n\nThere are also no achievements, no multiplayer, no bosses and no trading cards.

Loading screens are a pain the backside too because they're everywhere, even you're about to enter a small room. However, the developers will be removing most of them in a future update (if that will ever happen).\n\nOne of the main problems that I had with BlackSoul: Extended Edition is that I was defenseless. The first weapon that I picked up instantly vanished from my inventory, so I had no choice but to run from one room to another while avoiding zombies who just so happen to be standing on paths that I need to take. As soon as I died, I quit the game and uninstalled it.\n\nRight now, I can't recommend this game to anyone, not even those who enjoy the classic survivial horror games of the 90s. If the main issues that I mentioned in this review are solved in a future patch, then I will consider playing this game again and hopefully give it a positive review.","November 13, 2014","false","0.5"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","30","40","0","3"

Gaffney","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141733817/","127 products in account","One of the most enjoyable games I've played in recent memory.  It is absolutely riddled with flaws but it manages to be a great game regardless of them.  If you can get used to them and treat them as 'rules' the flaws don't overcome all the love with which this game was designed, and the more work they do on the game, the more easily recommended it becomes.  The awful load times are *gone* now.  I imagine they contributed hugely to the low score on this one, but they've been fixed.\n\nNo official controller support.  That's mandatory in a game like this.  I played with Xpadder but there should be integrated support already.  Xpadder needs to be run as administrator and it can still be a bit wonky.\n\nNow, who's the game meant for is people that are fans of the original Resident Evil games.  I see some Silent Hill in here as well but mainly Resident Evil.  If you're familiar with them you can tell by my Steam avatar that I'm fond of Resident Evil.  My favourites in fact.  What that means for thi game is something similar to fixed cameras, and it operates with tank controls.  Many people have criticised the controls of Resident Evil for being poor, but they're very finely tuned (besides the very first game in 1996) and carefully designed; they just take a whole lot of getting used to.  Unfortunately, Black Soul's are not a good.  The truth is it's the camera.  People are mainly thrown by the camera in Resident Evil and that's the case here.  The trouble is Resident Evil's cameras are perfectly designed (from Resident Evil 2 on; the 1996 game had abysmal cameras), so it's really a matter of getting used to them.  Black Soul's camera is not well designed.  But I got used to it.  There's an over-the-shoulder camera as well but don't play it that way, please.  Makes it boring.  Live a little and get acclimated to the regular camera.\n\nThe mystery is compelling, both in gameplay and story.  Unfortunately, though the story is generally well done (despite being done nigh entirely in documents) the finale doesn't quite deliver.  Worth playing to the end, though.\n\nA huge difference between this and Resident Evil is the lack of auto-aim.  *Usually* it's not a problem, per se, but I'd have preferred a different sort of combat.  This takes far more getting used to for people not accustomed to fixed cameras, although I wish there were a lot more properly fixed camera angles, supplemented by the auto-aim of Resident Evil.  The way it's done now is a 'cinematographic' camera that follows you from a sort of weird (but workable) angle for nearly all areas where there's combat, and the fixed angles are largely reserved for non-combat areas.\n\nCombat system is lacking but combat is clearly not the focus of the game.  It works well enough, but I prefer classic Resident Evil.  A chief problem I do have with it is that if you run past a bunch of enemies, so long as they're aware of you you can't interact with any thing but doors (actually, I think you can pick up health and ammo).  This makes combat essentially necessary in many cases where I'd have just called the lift and left.\n\nMy other main problem is I wish saving were a bit less exploitable.  Game's a bit too easy this way.\n\nAnd last is the map.  I appreciate what they were trying to do, and if you follow the map from the beginning of an area it's grand, but if you try to pick up in the middle of one of these maze-like sections you'll have some trouble.  I'm conflicted on this.\n\nIf you like classic Resident Evil, get this game.  Really.","June 9, 2015","true","43.7"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","30","40","2","2"

Unfortunately, Blacksoul resurrects many of the flaws from that era, while leaving most of the enjoyable elements of those classics dead and buried.\n\nThe negatives? Loading screens between each... and... every... single... room... transition. Any amount of horror atmosphere BlackSoul might have otherwise had is completely ruined by the immersion-breaking load screens. The only dread I experienced while playing this game resulted from the knowledge that I'd have to stare at that loading screen again when I moved to the next room.\n\nThen we have the clunky character/camera control. The ridiculously simplistic and boring combat. The inability to 'Esc' out of various menus. The terrible sound effects, animations, lighting, and textures. The awful character models.\n\nNow, I'm generally of the opinion that good art design is more important than the latest whiz-bang graphical effects - but even in that sense, BlackSoul looks dull, flat, cheap, and uninspired.\n\nAs for positives, BlackSoul does have a decently suspenseful soundtrack; music is very important in maintaining proper atmosphere in these sorts of games, and they did manage to get that right. Puzzle design, while not brilliant or innovative, is at least logical (mostly), and the game generally provides all the clues necessary to solves its puzzles without resorting to pure guesswork.\n\nSadly, it takes much more than 'decent' music and 'okay' puzzles to make a good survival horror game. I wouldn't recommend BlackSoul to even the most die-hard fan of classic survival horror.\n\n\n******** EDIT: 5/12/2016 ********\n\nOkay, I gave it another shot.\n\nAt some point during the past year the devs patched out most of those infuriating loading screens. After giving Blacksoul another try, however, I still cannot recommend this game. While the super annoying load screens are mostly gone, Blacksoul's actual gameplay simply is not fun. At all.\n\nNow, of course, many games revolve around key collecting as a way to advance from one area to the next. But Blacksoul doesn't even try to put your key collecting activities into any sort of context. You are collecting keys and opening doors for no reason other than to find more keys and open more doors. No attempt is made to give the player any sense of urgency or purpose in any of this, and the few diaries you find here and there do very little to help in that regard.\n\nAside from all the pointless key collecting, you'll also spend a great amount of time backtracking...and backtracking...and backtracking. Did I mention backtracking?\n\nHonestly, I kinda wish the devs had left the loading screens in. It would have kept me from delving deeper into the game and discovering just how terrible and tedious it really is.","February 15, 2015","false","13.5"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","26","37","2","0"

My main hate with this is there's no gamepad support (which can be fixed using xpadder). secondly, but ill forgive them the character animation is b-class.\n\nIts kinda scary how the female character you play as looks like a creepy goth guy.","January 8, 2015","true","3.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

The music is beautiful and the gameplay, while not as polished as some games, gets the job done. I find it annoying that getting a headshot on an enemy does nothing, but I assume that's a holdover from when the game only had the RE1 style camera system.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CsJmsQiNvo","March 3, 2014","true","24.8"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

Here is what I have found.\n\nGameplay/playability: After the last update most of the annoying loading screens have been fixed, which is a good thing since it appeared to be the most annoying topic. Launcher acts weirdly at startup but then the game runs smooth. Also I had minor troubles capturing the screen when I tried streaming this game. Remapping keys is tricky, since I have found options to remap forward\backward movement, but not left\right, but as long as you don't hate WSAD you'll feel comfortable. Cinematic screen has been said to be a pain, but tracking mode makes it close to RE 4\5\6 games. Fights don't seem difficult on the highest available on first walkthrough level to me, but I think I'm just playing fine-ish. Puzzles are very appealing, require imagination but not designed to keep you at one place for ages.\n\nVisuals\style gets very high grade from me. If you price high-res textures and modern visual effects, this definitely won't work for you since technically the graphics is somewhere at resident evil 2 level. On the other hand, if you can bear that, I think overall level design is catchy and stylish, pretty well made (you don't expect to see things like lens flares in a game like this, but they are there).\n\nSound\atmosphere is overall haunting and much better than were my expectations for it. Probably the hardest thing to compare to other games, but I think it is done pretty good.\n\nStory: I'm sorry, I haven't gone too far to make a judgment on that.\n\nSummary: This game is what it claims to be--an old-style survival horror. Those always had few issues so unless you're really willing to trash this game down for some reason I don't see any point in bringing it up, 'cause it is still more playable than most of games coming out lately. Closest game on all aspects that comes to mind is Alone in the dark 3, from recent games--Resident Evil Remastered (which loses to BlackSoul on almost every aspect in my opinion). Complete steal for it's price and one of the nicest games I've played recently.","May 18, 2015","true","17.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY FIX THIS (I own a fast SSD drive and the game  still has unbelievably long and frequent loading screens, every 10 steps you must wait for another 30 second loading screen, i even went as far as installing the game onto my systems ram-disk which is much faster than even an SSD and it still takes forever)\n\nThe graphics are what makes this game. They are so unique and gritty i can't even begin to describe them. If they had used any other game engine for this game than i don't think it would be nearly as scary. The interior graphics are some of the best i have ever seen, they are extremely detailed and invoke a sort of terror that i've never experienced before, its almost as if you can feel the dry paint on the wall. This is one of the best horror games i've played in the last 15 years. The jumpscares are the best out of any horror game hands down. The only ugly part's visually are the cemetary which have no grass covering the countours on the ground. But the interiors more than make up for it. Once you get to the delacroix' house thats where the game really starts to pick up. The puzzles are enjoyable to if not for the loading screens.\n\nBut where did this little gem of a game come from? Games like this are what make me love being a pc gamer. It's unique, it uses its own game engine, it is not trying to appeal to the masses. And its just an all around experience that puts me in a surreal  creeped out mindset. I like finding special games like this deep within steams library that i had no idea existed, its kind of like that special moment when you find a unique old wooden object at a yardsale that you could never even imagine finding at a big name brand store.\n\nIn other words its just a nice refreshing feeling when i play a game that is uniquely its own own game from the ground up.. I like playing games on new engines because its like a new feeling you havent experienced yet.. Just subtle differences like the way the mouse moves, the way the lighting looks, the way the characters move around, the way the textures look, the way your computer handles the performance all just come together to give each and every game its own unique fingerprint that are unlike any other game.. No two games feel exactly alike unless they use the same game engine. This is why i am just getting kind of sick of every game i boot up lately saying "POWERED BY UNREAL ENGINE". Playing games that all use the same engine is like hanging out with the same person everyday except they are wearing a new outfit.\n\nThis games awesome, its gritty, its creepy and has puzzles that require some serious intelligence.\n\nCons\n-The loading screens are wayy too frequent.\n-The pistol i finally found sounds very unsatisfying, there is no difference between a headshot and a body shot in terms of damage on a zombie. And the pistol does not fire as fast as you can click. There is also no blood or head popping effects from the pistols. Combat is just extremely unsatisfying and leaves a lot to be desired. But this game leaves its mark in atmosphere and its definately worth it in my opinion\n-You cant strafe left/right You can only run forward and turn your body with the mouse.\n\nTo make this game perfect all they would have to do is\n-Eliminate all of the redundant loading screens\n-Add a new louder/more satisftying gunshot sound to the pistol\n-Make headshots do increased damage with satisfying skull pops/blood splatters. (Not just with the mangum/shotgun)\n-One or two more zombie models, and maybe a nice automatic weapon like an AK after a while","April 2, 2014","true","19.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Wtf is this. I've got some things to say here and they're not great. Or good. Or even mediocre.\n\n1. Game can't be configured to run on screen sizes bigger than ipad resolutions. Seriously. Like 1200x960 or the equivalent of. You can stretch the screen out to force a fullscreen but it's obviously just that - stretched. Unless this game was produced in 1995, there's not much reason for this.\n\n2. Loading screens. Like...a lot of loading screens. Is the engine incapable of loading more than one room's content at any given time? Call me impatient, but it ruins whatever sense of atmosphere you've managed to build (if any) and feels choppy/poorly constructed.\n\n3. Everything else, pretty much. I only played the beginning and that was enough to tell me that the atmosphere was lacking, the music was dismal, graphics were sub-par (like...PS1 quality. I'm pretty sure Spyro the Dragon had a higher framerate.) and the plot was stereotypical, cliche, and otherwise unimaginative. Again, only played the beginning, so if you want to tell me it gets better, go ahead - I simply shouldn't have to force myself to reach a point where I agree. Finally, gameplay left much to be desired. The only thing that really struck me was the ability to change the camera angle from cinematic to over the shoulder. Had resident evil vibes that worked for it honestly, albeit, not to a degree that spared it the criticism its other aspects earned it.\n\nTL;DR - Bad. Just bad.","April 6, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This is the reason you have to be careful when funding a game that isn't complete. The coding is clearly as abysmal as every other aspect of the game, as many higher - end rigs will struggle a lot more than they should trying to play this game smoothly. The game is hardly playable, let alone good or bad.","April 24, 2015","false","3.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
