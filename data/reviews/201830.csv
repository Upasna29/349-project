The actual gameplay is composed of Quick-Time-Events (QTEs) during action sequences and mild puzzles during the plot development sequences.  You won’t find wild, face-paced, dinosaur-fighting action, but I think any fan of story-driven experiences and/or of the Jurassic Park movie will find this game intriguing.\n\nThe heart and soul of the game lies in the story and the characters.  I found the story to be absorbing and the characters to be interesting.  I will admit that I am a little biased because the original movie came out when I was a kid and at the time it was one of the best movies around for my generation.  I really liked how Jurassic Park: The Game was set as a sidequel to original movie and expanded on the events that occurred.\n\nThe QTEs are a frequent topic of discussion when people consider this game.  I personally enjoyed it, because there are plenty of other games out there where I run around in with an assault rifle and a bandoleer full of grenades— so it was refreshing to experience action sequences in an alternate fashion.  I also thought it was pretty cool that there were different cut-scenes depicting the various ways you could die throughout the narrative; this helps make it less annoying and more interesting when you do mess up a QTE.\n\nThe game is not without faults, of course.  In fact there are many faults.  They ranged from truly game-faltering, (for example: I experienced UI trouble where my mouse cursor disappeared and was forced to restart), to just annoying, (for example: I had to change the resolution one level at a time, each time waiting for the screen to readjust).  Then there were some things that didn’t really matter gameplay-wise, but still were a little ridiculous: for example, I found it jarring that the character of the aboriginal Costa Rican girl who supposedly grew up on an island was voiced with an accent you would find on a second-generation American Latina from Brooklyn.\n\nNevertheless, I didn’t find any of the faults to be so egregious that they soured my experience.  I actually rather enjoyed the experience, despite the minor annoyances, and I legitimately remember feeling a little sad when I beat it because it was over.  In fact, I would say the thing that disappointed me the most about this game was just that it was a little shorter than I would have liked, because I was really enjoying it.\n\nI posit that Jurassic Park: The Game is an enjoyable, story-driven experience that will especially appeal to anyone who is a fan of the original movie.  You also should be comfortable with idea of playing a game that relies heavily on QTEs for action scenes.  If you want intense firefights with dinosaurs then you probably will want to look at other games.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","July 16, 2015","true","8.1"," 124 of 144 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","124","144","10","3"

Jurassic Park is the farthest back I've gone (excluding the first Poker Night) and wow, things done changed.\n\nThe concept is the same as any of their other point and click adventures. What changed is the interaction system. And it's much worse. They clearly improved things a lot for the first Walking Dead.\n\nThe problem comes from the quick time events. The amount of time you have to press them - especially when there are multiple in a row - is a small fraction of a second. This means that to get through some of the harder sequences you have to memorize the order of buttons to press. There's really no other way to move forward. It's super frustrating when there are long sequences with dozens of buttons you have to try to remember. This is just bad game design, as it makes it literally impossible to succeed on your first attempt.\n\nAdd to this the fact that you can't skip cutscenes and having to repeat sections quickly becomes a chore. Having to stare at the same low-resolution textures for minutes at a time while you re-hear the same conversations you can't affect is not fun.\n\nThe characters also make some really strange decisions that don't seem to fit with how they're established. It's like the writers didn't plan out the ending when they started. In the end, I didn't really care about any of them or what happened to them. And it was quite clear that my choices didn't matter or affect anything.\n\nSo Jurassic Park has convinced me to stop going back with Telltale. I won't be trying out Back to the Future. But everything forward of this point is gold.","June 22, 2015","false","12.4"," 63 of 76 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","63","76","5","7"

So I might be a bit biased.\n\nJurassic Park: The Game is a game that if you enjoyed the film you would enjoy the story of the game. Telltale did a wonderful job recreating the iconic locations of the first Jurassic Park film. It introduced old and new dinosaurs, old and new characters. It continued the plot in regards to the Barbasol can of dinosaur embryos that was stolen the night of heavy storm that led the the dinosaurs going wild from the first film. The game tries to connect the gap of what happened to Dennis Nedry's attempt to sell the embryos for millions and the new characters introduced in this. This 4 episode story and the characters introduced are what makes this game good.\n\nGameplay is point and click with quick-time responses. This is where I believe the game has the most issue. The quick-time responses are the most annoying, hassle inducing aspect of the game. Especially if you want to 100% achievement the game you will have to repeat a section over and over to time everything. Sometimes though you know what to do a button sometimes did not register or even at time a micro second early or late and you are off for the sequence of events. However, if you can get past this the story and dialogue in regards of the gameplay make up for it.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Telltale Games, enjoyed Jurassic Park or enjoy both. Though I had issue with the quick-time. The story and plot and new characters make up for it and make the game a "should play"","February 23, 2014","true","8.6"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","54","62","0","3"

The Walking Dead 1 & 2, The Wolf Among Us, Back To The Future, and especially the Poker Night at the Inventory series - All excellent games that kept me enthalled, entertained and content for so many hours. Being a gigantic Jurassic Park fan and having watched all the movies and read the book countless times - when I saw that they made a Jurassic park game, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to play it. Unfortunately.. this game fails to deliever on so many levels. Yes, they have the music. Yes, they follow the Jurassic Park storyline. And Yes, they manage to do an excellent job at submersing you into the Jurassic Park world. But other than that, it doesn't have much else to offer. The voice acting isn't the greatest, but it isn't the big issue. The big issues are the poorly sequenced context-sensitive timed events, the lack of impact that your decisions make throughout the storyline/game, and the horrendous amount of glitches that severely hinder your progession. Unlike other Telltale games, Jurassic Park makes you tap multiple keys which pop up on the screen for a mere second of time. I believe this is done to show you how many different death sequences they designed for the game (there are oh so many - in fact, they even put in a death counter to show you many times they stuck it to you). Next there is the lack of impact your decisions make. There is only one point in the game where your choice determines whether or not a character will live or die -- this changes the ending of the game, and it happens right at the very end. Lastly, the glitches. I haven't seen a game so mired with glitches after its release since "Call of Cthulhu" and "Alone in the dark". I had to restart sequences atleast 5 times in all of the 4 episodes of the game in order to progress through the storyline. Having said that, I was determined and managed to contend with all of the glitches, and progress through the abysmal storyline in order to make it to the end of the game, just so I could say that I've beat it, and that I managed to get my money's worth from playing it. -- But I didn't get my moneys worth.. in-fact, I strongly believe Telltale games should pay me for Alpha and Beta testing this atrocious blight upon my steam game library. Buyer beware - this game is not worth your time or your money -- although, if you liked "Gone Home", then you should give 'Jurassic Park: The Game' a try, because you obviously like terrible games and Jurassic Park would be an outstanding addition to your steam library of 'videogame classics'. I hope they don't drop the ball on their upcoming Game of Thrones videogame, or I will completely lose my trust in Telltale's ability to make a decent videogame worth playing.

(of course you do)\n2) Do you love the Jurassic Park story enough to deal with a whole game being based around QTE-style (Quick-Time Event) gameplay?\n\nIf your answer to the second question is yes, then you will undoubtedly love this game for the story quality alone, if nothing else.\n\nThe story is based at the same time as the first movie, and it revolves around Gerry Harding (from the first movie) and his daughter who find themselves in the midst of the storm (the very same storm from the movie), who must find a way to escape the island. Throughout the game they come across various problems, which you as the player must solve.\n\nThe game is your standard "adventure" genre game, you go from scene to scene, you look for clues or things to use, and you move on to the next scene. Once in a while you will find yourself being chased down by a dinosaur however, and that is where the QTE gameplay sets in - which at times can be dreadful, but it will really only be frustrating if you insist on obtaining all the achievements for the game.\n\nI am baffled to see the game being rated so poorly (54/100 metacritic), which is mainly due to the fact that people wanted more than just a QTE-based game, which fair enough would have been nice, but it is not like the game was ever advertised differently - it is just people whining that they did not get what they wanted.\n\nLike I said in the beginning, if you are a Jurassic Park fan, this game will be enjoyable.

One moment you're gazing at the amazing dinosaurs, that graphically, hold up really well today; and the next moment your clenching your buttcheeks as the Trex and raptors are trapping the intrepid explorers in cars, trees and kitchens. Spielberg sucks you in, chews you and spits you out. It's a very immersive experience. Immersion is where the game then misses the mark.\n\nConsidering that all of the game's action sequences are entirely played out with quick-time events you're at the game's mercy when it comes to survival. While this would be tense and suspenseful in other game, Jurassic Park: The Game consitently pops a shiny healthbar in your face right before the action begins. Both spoiling the surprise and giving you a reason, other than your survival to play for (namely medals). It draws you out, while a moment before you were still sort of among the creatures of yore.\n\nThe immersion breaking doesn't end there. The character models often act and move like poorly articulated puppets, and their props tend to float around in their hands. Furthermore, when they move, they often run straight toward the doorpost in one angle, but safely sail through the door opening in the next. When the action subsides you'll be solving puzzles. By my account I played maybe four actual puzzles and everything else was related to sequential dialog options.\n\nIt's a shame though, because the game really thrives when it plays with its source material; showing you sections of the park that weren't shown in the films. It game is at its best at the end, where it fully embraces it's Spielberg roots by going straight back to Jaws. However, on its downtime, it is rather dissapointing.","June 11, 2015","false","8.4"," 58 of 80 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","58","80","4","2"

Telltale the developer, has done a wonderful job recreating iconic locations from the film, and at the same time introducing new dinosaurs with a whole new story. It takes place during/after the events of the first film with a whole new cast of characters, so there’s plenty of original content for those thinking it’s just a recreation of the film.\n\nThe story and characters are at the heart of Jurassic Park. Gameplay is point and click and although fun, it’s nothing terribly interesting that most people have probably already experienced in The Walking Dead (a more popular game by Telltale). The characters are well made and each has their own distinguished personality that fits into the story in one way or the other. Generic is not a word I would use to describe any of them. The story is filled with plenty of unexpected moments and has great pacing while being spread over 4 episodes that will probably take you 7-8 hours to finish.\n\nThe game reminded me of the film so much that I just had to go back and watch it again.

So far through 2 episodes of Game of thrones I would compare the two with Jurassic Park being more difficult but Game of Thrones episodes are longer and It has a better story.

Add a point if you are a fan of point-and-click games, especially those made by Telltale (as am I), and add another point if you are a fan of the Jurassic Park intellectual property (as am I).\n\nThe game takes place during and immediately after the events of the first film, and mostly follows Jurassic Park chief veterinarian Gerry Harding as he attempts to make his way off of Isla Nublar with his daughter.  The plot thickens as a corporate espionage scheme to recover Dennis Nedry's stolen dinosaur embryos goes awry, and the few stranded survivors left on the island find themselves hunted by a previously unknown species of dinosaur.\n\nAs far as plots go, it's one of the better ones you'll see in a movie tie-in.  Dialogue is surprisingly natural, and the game reuses a lot of hallmark music and sound effects from the films.  None of the films' main characters are featured in the game, but fans of the movies and books will appreciate how "Jurassic Parky" the game feels as it tells its story.\n\nJurassic Park: The Game by Telltale Games is an enjoyable experience, but it suffers from quite a few technical glitches and just generally isn't as polished or deep as the company's subsequent masterpiece, the Walking Dead series.  Character voices tend to have a strange echo to them, more noticeable during quieter moments than during action scenes.  Occasionally, going to the main menu will cause your in-game mouse pointer to disappear, necessitating a reload from the last checkpoint.  Conversations with other characters are okay, but rarely do your choices of what to say have any real impact.  These problems are minor, but numerous.\n\nAs this is a highly linear, character-driven game, there are long story segments with little to no real gameplay; if you enjoy point-and-click games you'll know what to expect, but it may be a bit slow-paced for unaccustomed gamers.  Quick-time events are sometimes a bit flat, but the good ones are quite thrilling: you'll be hunted by velociraptors, chased by tyrannosaurus rex, and even stalked by a giant underwater mosasaur.\n\nIf you are an avid pointer-and-clicker, and especially if you're a fan of Telltale, consider this game.  If you like Jurassic Park, definitely consider this game.

It came with the "Telltale Package" I bought and I gave it a try. I was expecting a "Walking Dead" with dinosaurs but that's not exactly true. The gameplay is pretty similar on the few-puzzles end but with less decision making and more quick time events plus not everything you do has a timer.\nQTEs are  a big part of the game so I you don't like them you are going to have a bad time. More so because they are harder than any game I played so far (generally speaking) but I guess they were made this way to add a layer of difficulty and replayability considering every episode has a score system. Perfectionists are going to want to have a gold score on every episode and I don't think it's that bad to die every now and then. But I really wonder if there are people who ace all QTEs on the first try. Camera and character controls are another matter. They are lazy to say the best and exploration is non-existent. There are at best 4 angles in an area and once there you use the keyboard to use the camera. The KEYBOARD!!!\nStory is connected to the first movie which is kinda cool and has many well thought references which is cooler and progression is similar to every mainstream story out there. It also has its share of plot twists. The ones near the end are totally stupid and bad guys are even more stupid but I didn't expect much anyway so yeah...\nGraphics are exactly like in the screenshots and OK in my opinion. They don't matter much anyway...\nSoundtracks are pretty good. Some of them I recognize from the movies, some from every horror movie ever and some I don't know. The movies' original score is used frequently and that's a right choice if I ever saw one.\n\nFor me this was kind of a free game and I don't regret playing it.

But don't pay full price for it, unless you really want to support Telltale Games; the game is way too short for that.\n+ Dinos! It's no spoiler when I say that the films' loveliest dinosaurs made it into the game. The T-Rex's roar is done to death, but we Jurassic Park fans need it.\n+ New characters in a new story, but if you know the films some things should be familiar to you, in a good way: they're not necessarily random references to make you go "hah! I get this reference!" (well alright, some are - but they're subtle).\n+ Nima gets more interesting as the story progresses.\n+ The very last fight made me giggle nervously, it was so tense and exciting. Gerry obviously knows parcours!\n\n+/- Your choices don't have any consequences for the characters - except for one at the very end of the game - unlike The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us (which made Telltale Games so great). I know you can't judge a game by another game, but let me just warn you now so you won't be disappointed later.\n+/- The quick time events have you pressing the WASD buttons in random orders. Sometimes I thought, hey, I get why I have to click left and then right, but that was usually after the fact and oftentimes after I'd already been eaten. But maybe I just suck; and anyway, you can always try again and if you remember the sequence in the right order you'll probably just get a silver medal.\n+/- Yoder gets more interesting as the story progresses, but then when he loses it all the sympathy I felt for him seemed misplaced. He went from a flat character to a round one back to flat again.\n+/- Graphics are fine, but mouth movement is often distractingly off.\n+/- Music is fine, too. Some use of the original soundtrack, but otherwise not very interesting or unique. Does the job.\n\n- Very short; only four episodes, so about six hours.\n- Hardly any replay value, unless you want gold medals for every quick time event.\n- The relationship between Gerry and Jessi is exactly like the one in the second movie. Get yer own storyline, Telltale!\n- You don't really know where the story's going, as the characters make it up as they go along. So when the game ends it's kind of unexpected. If they'd told us at the beginning that we could choose between phoning for a helicopter or getting a boat, we could've at least seen the second option coming.

This game is really great. Once again, Telltale makes a great game that wants to be a movie. Personally, I feel they should have used this game story for a movie sequel. The story is much more believable than the sequels were, and I really like the characters. The characters grow and change through the game, so be prepared to change loyalties. Most of the game is played through choosing conversation options and the quick time events. You are graded by performance, so make sure you make the right responses and have a quick trigger finger because it can cost you. The game looks good and the soundtrack makes good use of sounding like a Jurassic Park score. You'll hear all your favorite themes from the film, but not so much that it sounds like they ran out of ideas. The only complaint is that the game can lag. The game wants to be a film, and sometimes there is a pause between sequences. It's like when the DVD skips momentarily. It doesn't really hinder gameplay, but it can be a minor annoyance. Also, the mouse pointer may disappear, but that can be fixed by just reloading the segment you were at. These two glitches did not keep me from enjoying the game and I am working on another playthrough just to get the rest of the achievements and play for a slightly different outcome. If you liked the movie Jurassic Park, I am certain that this game will not disappoint.","April 6, 2015","true","18.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","4"

Some scenes happen in showplaces of the movie but no characters from the Spielberg picture will appear in the game.

Being Telltale, they of course have quicktime events, and I used the keyboard, and sometimes I KNOW I pushed a button only to have it fail, and others I didn't push it, but it still counted, so it can be frustrating at times, but it didn't happen every time. I will say it seemed less forgiving than later titles.\n\nThe game picks up sometime during the first film, but none of the characters show up, not really anyway. There are 4 episodes in total, and some achievements that are missable, if you are into that.\n\nYou do get some dialouge, but it's not quite like later titles where it really affects anything, it's more or less just there for flavor. The characters aren't horrible, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe action scenes are overall well done, and the use of quicktime can lead to some tense situations, but as I said, the only issue is sometimes it won't register properly leading to frustration with the system.\n\nYou get to control a few characters, and you meet the expected dinos and some not from the films. In the end, it's a decent action/adventure game, but not with a deep storyline.\n\nI'd say get it on sale, then if you don't care for it you're not TOO much upset over $5. If you liked the movies, you'll have an overall good time, and if you like achievements, there are some you can miss but you can load certain parts of an episode to get them again, and you will mess up because of the quicktime event format.","December 3, 2015","true","8.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

And what a hell of a job they did!\n\nWhat's a Telltale adventure game?\n\nTelltale specialises in adventure games that are easy to complete and usually almost all achievements can be obtained in just one go. There's a great emphasis on immersion hence the many cutscenes and the QTEs incorporated into them.\n\nThey can usually be completed in 8-10 hours and there are numerous scenes where a choice can be made - this may result in the sacrifice of a character or it can affect the ending in various ways. Inventory is usually limited to a couple of items - there's no abundance of puzzles and those found throughout the game are easy to complete.\n\nWhat's their Jurassic Park game like?\n\nAs said this is a direct follow-up to the 1993 film Jurassic Park. There are returning locales and references to many things, thus, if you are a fan of the JP films this game is a must for you. The new scenes and characters are also very interesting and we get to learn some new things of InGen along the way.\n\nThe game is a tad bit more difficult than the rest of the Telltale games. First of all, QTE have to be timed more precisely and more quickly. It is common that you make mistakes and the game has an evaluation system for this - gold, silver and bronze levels can be attained. Gold levels indicate no slipups - you can only obtain a handful of achievements by not making any mistakes.\n\nThe "scenario" menu gives you the ability to return to some of the QTE events to give them another go. This is a must if you want all achievements obtained as no slipups are a must to have 100% completion. In fact, there are some conversation-related or easter egg-like achievements throughout the game. Some episodes must be completed again from beginning to end to really see everything that is intended to be seen in this game.\n\nThis time inventory is non-existent and walking is not possible with characters. Instead the icon in the lower-left corner of the screen indicates if there are other locations (rooms) to visit in one scene so we click on these instead of making our protagonists walk. Sometimes clicking on objects is not enough but we have to drag the mouse while doing so - a nice way of interacting with the game's world but a bit too tedious. Telltale games released later on shed themselves of this system and became easier to complete. Oh, and no choices exist to affect events later on in any form.\n\nAll-in-all, Telltale's JP game is pretty exciting and it is a must for the fans of the JP franchise as well as for fans of Telltale's adventure games. You just have to get yourself over the not-too-refined QTE system and here and there the game has some audio issues and a somewhat mediocre engine not always offering nice scenes to look at.\n\nStill, with a great discount it is an easy grab especially with the oncoming Christmas sales.","December 13, 2015","true","8.1"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","0"

The characters are not particularly interesting, in fact the only reason you'll remember them after finishing the game is because their unimaginable stupidity. The events feel forced and most of them happen, because someone is doing some dumb ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe dialogues are so poorly written, that each time a character opens his/her mouth, you feel like they are reading lines from a pórn movie.

When Jurrasic Park was announced as one of the two bonus games, I was stoked because I loved the movie when I was a kid and at this point have fallen in love with TTG's newer adventure games.\n\n\nThat much being said, I was met with dissapointment. The writing does not feel like it captures the same passion Telltale had with other games (the stories in The Wolf Among Us, Tales from the Borderlands, and The Walking Dead all feel very compelling and can draw you in even if you aren't a fan of the source material already). The voice acting is top notch, but the writing itself just isn't there so far.\n\n\nThe quick time events have become incredibly intrusive and distracting, with many of them not making a difference whether or not you fail (an example being when you nearly run into the other main character while driving to the visitor center, which has an identical outcome regardless of if you make the QTE in the very short time it gives you).\n\n\nOn the same subject of the over done QTEs is also the fact that this game has possibly the worst controls of any Telltale adventure. You are all over the keyboard, and many of them have very strict timing involved or you will fail. Also, the steam overlay will occasionally make the button prompts dissapear (which has so far only happened to me on keyboard, and not controller).\n\n\nThe graphics are not mindblowing, but they do what they need (as is typical with these games), however it is much less stylized than the other TTG titles, when it really could have benefitted from more of a traditional TTG art direction. Also, there is no silent pause like the other TTG games have, and the pause screen that is in the game is incredibly loud and obnoxious (t-rex roaring every couple seconds).\n\n\nIs this game playable? Sure. Would I recommend it? Only to die hard fans of both Jurrasic Park and TTG. I would recommend pretty much any of the other TTG games over it, with Tales from the Borderlands or The Wolf Among Us being my primary recommendations. Jurrasic Park just lacks the polish and soul that simillar titles from the same studio have in extra-large helpings.","April 20","false","7.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Jurassic Park, like most other Telltale games is a point-and-click adventure that has 5 episodes that guide you through the story. Based on the blockbuster movie franchise: a small group of people and scary nocturnal predators that are hunting the group.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of the first movie. The game begins with an unknown woman that is running away in a dark jungle, from some scary, unknown creatures with shiny eyes, she is being chased of a cliff. Barely surviving the fall, she ends up on a road, while an oncoming car is heading straight her way. From there the story skips back to earlier that day with a father and a daughter overlooking the peaceful jungles, searching for dinosaurs. In one interesting scene a fight breaks out between a Triceratops and a T-rex, while the main characters have to dodge and run from the crazed fighting giants, not trying to get squashed and trampled. The game is story driven, enjoyable and very thrilling and exciting at times.\n\nThe game is 2/3 watching quick time events and 1/3 easy puzzle solving. At times it feels like watching a 5 hour Jurassic Park movie. There is not much exploration or hard puzzle-solving. There is no inventory and a short five hour play through. This game could be more considered as an interactive movie, which some of you might really enjoy (I am one of them). Fans of the film might also enjoy this game, for its familiar locations, and its “real” looking dinosaurs. If you enjoyed the movie Jurassic Park, you will enjoy this “game” for sure. A fun fact: there are a couple of dinosaurs that were not in the original movie.\n\nIt is possible in this game to make the wrong decisions, or fail a quick time event. During the quick time events, dinosaurs jump from the bushes, after which the player has to press a sequence of buttons to either dodge the attack or miss and end up being torn to bits by his fangs or claws. It is hard when you are so involved in the cut-scene and sitting at the edge of your seat, to keep paying attention to the required button sequence. You have no choice but to finish the whole sequence again before you can move on, which can get in times very frustrating. The game has two different endings.\n\nPros\n- Beautiful cinematic sequences.\n- Nicely animated dinosaurs.\n- Interactive movie experience.\n- Thrilling action.\n\nCons\n- Precision button pressing can be frustrating at times.\n- Linear.\n\nScore:\n7.8","April 28, 2013","true","10.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

I love Jurassic Park since 1992-3 i was one of my first Video Home System Cassetts i get (good old times) and i love dinos since long time. So i love Telltale games even they could somtimes better (longer, more options, choices) but this time it gets hard. Sure my hope was to high. Normaly i dont talk about graphics but making a new look and then a jungle, there could be more details in this game, but its not a big deal not even the clipping mistakes, but i like it has a german version, what i miss in other games. It dont have a fast forward/ rewind/ skip option or TRADING CARDS and not much change, you cant rescue the most, the good great dangerous tattooed bear that looks like the bad guy and the friendly guy are both not what they look but both die so who cares? All other runs not well too, at the end you can rescue 2-3 people, wow. A nice piece of game, not a epic story but fine, yeah for Jurassic Park Fans its fine who know the movies but for some it will disappointed for others it will be maybe good enough.

Several times I had to reload a scenario because the mouse cursor or option to switch scenes simply disappeared, even if I was half-way through the scenario.\nDespite playing it on a good laptop from 2011 (the same year as the game was released), and the fairly mediocre graphics, the frame rate was consistently low and often fairly laggy. The story was well-presented and quite interesting, but the characters (especially Nima) were bland and flat.\nWhat really killed the game, however, was the Quick Time Events. I don't have a problem with QTE's, and having them as the main gameplay mechanic works quite well when the game you're playing is essentially an interactive movie, as this one is, but these QTE's are handled so poorly that it just ruins the game. I don't know if it was the result of the bad frame-rate or lag, but I lost count of the amount of QTE's that I matched perfectly only to be told that I had got one wrong, or the times when I had to press three different arrows in the space of less than a second, thereby resulting in multiple deaths and forcing me to replay the same sections over and over again until I had memorised the fairly long sequences of button-presses rather than relying on actual digit dexterity, which is the whole point of QTE's in the first place. As the game is, it is literally impossible to pass a large number of the QTE's on the first or even fourth try.\nSave your money and get some of Telltales later games instead.","October 23, 2015","false","4.7"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

I'm just judging it based on the PC version and not the iOS. Other then a couple of audio glitches (repeat dialogue, echoes while outside) that occured during gameplay I see nthing wrong with this game. I know some people are put off with the lack of free roaming you can do, as you simply switch scenes instead of physically pushingthe analog stick (I played with a controller) to reach there. But really, it's not that big a deal as you do much more interesting combos of context actions.\n\nThe story is set during the day of the first movie where everything goes to hell. You control multiple characters left in the park for reasons very connected with the film (a mercenary waiting to take the DNA sample that Wayne Knight's character never delivered and a dino vet and his young daughter (this may be the only child character in JP I don't want to feed to the T-Rex). The tension is palable, the voice acting is up to par with other titles and the dialogue and story (as well as relationships with other characters) keep you engaged.\n\nIf you are a fan of TellTale's other more recent games likeThe Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us, Tales from the Borderlands and Game of Thrones and you liked any of the JP films (especially the first one) there is no reason not to buy this, especially if it goes on sale.

The books, the movies, all of it defined my childhood.  My mother once hid the movie, because she got sick of rewatching it over and over again.  Like any other Jurassic Park fan, I picked this game up to give me more of that Jurassic Park Experience, and I was not disappointed.\n\nFirst, the story:  I’ve read nearly all of Michael Crichton’s works, from Andromeda Strain to Micro.  And I must say, this game nearly perfectly captures Crichton’s writing.  The crooked get their comeuppance, not all the heroes live, the question of “should man have this power?”  I do, however, have some gripes.  The pacing was off on occasion, and there were quite a few “ex machina” moments (LOOKING AT YOU TOUR CAR).  There were also a few deaths which could have used more explanation.  However, the story did remain fresh, interesting, and expanded upon the movies very well, tying a lot more into the books.  8/10 for story.\n\nSecond, the Gameplay:  Really, there’s not much to say here.  It’s a Telltale game.  You QTE, you solve puzzles, you talk to people.  But the game was varied enough to keep me from getting bored.  7/10 for gameplay\n\nFinally, the overall feel:  Despite what many people are saying, this game is amazing.  The story is tight paced, the characters are wonderful, the gameplay isn’t too boring, and the sounds/voices are perfect for the game.  I would love to see future games like this.

No spoilers here, because this is actually a good game in that respect if you're a fan of the franchise.\n\nThe biggest problem I had was keystrokes not registering and, and this is a real gamebreaker for me, the inability to stop playing and pick it back up at a later point. This might need some explaining, but basically this is what happened; While in the story, I got stuck in a level solving a problem, so I returned to the main menu and tried to restart that specific part. But it was locked...so I tried replaying the part that came before that, and when I finished that part, it didn't continue the storyline but instead returned me to the main menu...which means I have to replay the entire chapter...\n\nThere are some other little nuisances, most of which are about the very linear storyline (although certain fight scenes can have different ways of playing out, as long as you don't die) and trouble with the controls, but mostly the fact that at some points I got too focused on the controls that the environment just became a blur, I didn't catch half of what was said and missed just about everything that was not an arrow pointing in a direction with a green circle shrinking to indicate the required timing.\n\nThis is, however, like I said, a really good story running parallel to the original first movie and it is reasonably executed.

But no, this game is only quick time events there is no actual gameplay. It is like watching a boring long winded B movie version of Jurassic Park made up of cutscenes, just waiting for the opportunity to hit Up, or maybe Down or sometimes Left at the right moment. Fail to get it right and the cutscenes repeat again until you do and believe me that gets really repetitive and boring very quickly. You miss a lot of the QTEs too because sometimes you forget that you're actually playing a game as there can be such a long time between interactions.\n\nAll in all the graphics are OK, the story is boring, and the gameplay is non-existant. Indeed if you really want to get a feel of the gamplay. Just put any of the Jurassic Park movies on, grab an Xbox or other controller (it doesn't have to be on) and when a dinosaur appears on screen and a character is in peril,  just hit B or X on the controller to dodge. If you feel you weren't quick enough, just rewind and try again.

I suspect it is often as short as a fifth or a quarter of a second, which is frankly absurd. I often don't even have time for my brain to register which key I am supposed to press before I have failed the task. This is compounded by two other problems - these QTEs are often chained together into sequences of several QTEs where the icons are layered over the top of one another (so you cannot see the next button in the sequence until hitting the current), and they are utterly unforgiving -  a single failure will result in the death of a character, and the sequence will need to be started again. There have been instances where I have had to repeat sequences 15+ times, and learn the keypresses by rote in order to get past.\n\nThis said, the story and characters are reasonably engaging, at least for the first two episodes - the game is at it's best when delivering narrative on a scene by scene basis, or when it has small logic problems for you to solve. The writing however takes an utter nosedive by the time you reach the third and fourth episodes, which are also QTE ridden nightmares. By this point in the game the source material gets thrown under a bus in order to pad for content (there's now a geothermal powerplant in an underground volcano base that will explode if not dealt with, wtf?).\n\nSome other elements are massively over used. The T-Rex as an example seems to conveniently teleport around the island and is present in a significant part of game, appearing in every other scene to allow for lengthy, annoying QTE sections that just waste your time without adding anything to the narrative.\n\nOverall, there could have been a decent game, and the first episode was genuinely entertaining if not a bit rough around the edges. It rapidly devolves into frustrating nonsense however - I suspect the developers were running out of time and as a result quality really slipped.","August 29, 2015","false","4.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

The usual point and click approach of collecting an inventory full of junk and rubbing the items together till you solve the puzzle would have just killed any kind of tension and not fitted with the atmosphere of the film. It is instead a mix of simple puzzles, conversation sections and reflex sections that are kind of like a simplified version of Heavy Rain. These work really well and it avoids getting frustrating as you can make some mistakes without being killed, it just affects your medal. Also if you are repeatedly getting killed it will reduce the difficulty for that section. The story line is good, it fits in a lot better than most of the film sequels. The graphics are pretty good compared to other Telltale stuff but still have room for improvement; there are a fair few bizarrely contorted facial expressions. The inclusion of medals, achievement and two alternate endings give this more replayability than standard point and click games.","May 4, 2012","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Most of the exploration is replaced by Heavy Rain-esque quick time events. These can get somewhat frustrating quickly as they become pseudo games of memorization and Simon Says. The exploration and quick-time event gameplay isn't terrible, per se, but it could be much improved on and leaves a lot to be desired from the standard point and click adventure game fan. Otherwise, the plot and voice acting, as well as some particularly exciting cinematic sequences within the game, more than make up for the less-than-stellar gameplay. Took about 5 hours for a full playthrough of the game.

I'm glad to be one of those few who would not. I enjoyed the story and characters in this game and how it was divided into "episodes" and I thought gameplay (albeit mostly Quick Time Events) was fun, if sometimes frusterating, and the dinosaurs looked competently good. On the bad side, the game felt long, even though I liked it, the human animations lacked a great deal of polish, and there were frame rate drops for no reason.

You also get some dialog choices, but as far as I can tell it barely affects the story.

Players are prompted to press a series of buttons on screen and failing to do so swiftly and correctly will lead to disastrous consequences. Jurassic Park: The Game is built solely upon this foundation and nothing more.\n\nDespite this, Telltale still brings to life the world of Jurassic Park. Every dinosaur encounter is suspenseful and both the plot and characters are the very least, interesting. Unfortunately, the game is marred by several bugs. Audio tends to fade in and out sporadically and frames drop at specific sequences.\n\nI applaud Telltale's attempt at venturing into more mature territory.

A lot of the timings for the buttons can be a bit odd and aren't always natural, and unlike heavy rain if you die the story doesn't continue, so there are probably not multiple story paths just a main one where you can die.\n\nHowever where it falls short as a game, it fills in with a good story with a focus to detail.

For example, if multiple buttons came up at the same time, sometimes it was a choice, but sometimes they were all required. This cost me multiple achievements, which often require perfection. I'm not sure I'll go back and replay sections just to clean that up. I enjoyed the story, but the lowest common denominator graphics really hurt when there's a Wii version. I like that Telltale can actually be serious, which gives me hope for the Law & Order game. Sam & Max does nothing for me, and even Back to the Future seemed more corny than any of the films. And dinosaurs make everything better.","April 23, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For a Telltale game, the mechanics are very clunky, and oh, did I mention that this game is riddled with quick time events? Not to mention some of them being nigh impossible to get through - some QTEs require you to press directional buttons in a sequence, but only the current button required is shown to you, which makes it rather difficult to go though the sequence. But fear not! Spamming buttons also works as well since pressing a wrong button doesn't penalize you in any way.\n\nHonestly, this is one of the worst games Telltale has ever made in a while. The only reason I recommend this game is for its story, while not amazing, is pretty good, and can entertain you for about... let's say, 10 hours?","July 19, 2012","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Why am I seeing so much flak for this game? This is better than half the games you'll get out of an indie-bundle, and those get praised and noticed more than a 'mediocre' game like this. Yes, it's a low-budget game, but Telltale did a mostly great job with their resources. The only thing really wrong with this is the unforgiving QTEs and slow scene transitions when investigating.\n\nThe thing is, for a Jurassic Park GAME, this is the best we've gotten besides maybe that GBA park-sim. This captures the feel and experience of the first movie with a group of well-rounded characters and a fairly enjoyable plot twist. When people inevitably die, you aren't just watching a dino eat, you're watching someone you cared for disappear. It's a small element the movies lacked, which along with the strong plot puts this above the second and third ones. The first movie still holds strong in being the main attraction, but this tie-in fits right alongside it as a desert to any fan. Just don't go in expecting a proper video-game, and be ready to practice a few sequences two or even three times before the game will let you continue to watch itself unfold.\n\nIf you're a Jurassic Park nut, buy it. If you're a casual fan, pick it up when it's on sale. If you are neither, this game might not have much for you. Still, it's a fact that there's tasty meat hiding inside this flawed package, and it's probably scared of the nasty T-Rex riding the bandwagon.","November 12, 2012","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is solid and the dialogue is good.  I found most of the characters somewhat unlikeable, though.  The gameplay consists of a mix of pressing the right button at the right time and some logical, but pretty easy puzzles.  I wasnt very fond of the timed button pressing, but it did fit with the actions of the scenes, and if you miss the buttons multiple times, the game makes it easier to do (eg, you might only have to press one button instead of two or three at that same time).  Rounding out the interaction is the dialogue options and exploring the environements.  The graphics are decent but nothing special.  Both the voice acting and music are excellent.  Overall, it took me about 6 or 7 hours to complete.

The game suffers from a poor implementation of quick time events. There are too many of them (TOO MANY), and they are quite random. The mouse-and-keyboard control during the exploration scenes is rather clumsy as well. None of it is bad enough to make the game unplayable. If the player misses the QTE button presses, the "punishment" is having to see usually some quite entertaining death scene. And if the player keeps on missing, the button presses are simplified so that the story can go on. I'm not here to excuse how lame the whole thing is, though.\n\nBut you're not here for the QTE's. You're here to see some dinosaurs. And at least there are lots of them. Across the four episodes, we get the herbivores and a plethora of carnivores, starting with the mighty T-Rex. That's the best part.\n\nThe story is rather standard. Passable for a Jurassic Park spin-off. Some of the characters are quite interesting, although cliched. There is a surprising amount of optional dialogue and back-story that, thankfully, is also skippable.\n\nI enjoyed the game with its action sequences. You need a big screen TV for this. It's popcorn cinema in game form. For fans of adventures games and Telltale's other, better games, this is a sore disappointment, but if you forget about the pedigree, there is an average action movie... I mean action GAME (sort of)... hidden beneath the clumsy controls.\n\nProtip: Try turning 3D on with Tridef 3D or the equivalent Direct X-to-3D conversion. Adds greatly to immersion. Who hasn't wanted to see a Velociraptor pop out of the screen (even in a lame game like this)?\n\nVerdict: 6/10","May 13, 2015","true","17.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Such examples are items being held are slightly off (like a knife attached to the outside of the hand instead of it being in his grasp) or audio repeating itself at a key point (locating objects with the binoculars).

Yes, the game pretty much consists of dialogue wheels, looking around the environment for clues, and lots of quick-time events as you're being chased by dinosaurs, but if you approach it less like a traditional video game and more like an interactive cinematic story, it's really enjoyable. The story is intriguing, the characters are likeable, the environments and the dinosaurs look great, and a lot of the action scenes are really thrilling. I'll admit, I jumped quite a few times while playing this.\n\nMy only major complaint is not with the amount of quick-time events in the game, but with the fact that some of them are nearly impossible and require lightning reflexes and several tries to complete. There were times when a button would come up, and before my brain could even register what button to push, I'd miss the cue, trip over a rock, and get eaten. I would say only about 5-10% of the QTE's in the game were that frustrating though, while the rest weren't too difficult. It was annoying at times, but not enough to ruin my enjoyment of the game overall.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Jurassic Park movies, do yourself a favor and don't miss out on Jurassic Park: The Game. As long as you can overlook a handful of frustratingly difficult QTE's, you'll be in for a fun, suspenseful, exciting, and visually pleasing cinematic adventure.","January 6, 2014","true","9.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I chucked it aside and never looked at it again, yesterday after reinstalling I gave it another go and I guess they patched it because it worked fine. I thought the beginning of the game was somewhat weak but soon enough I began to enjoy what I saw. I personally like the story and the characters though I do not care for the 15 year old girl and I believe I have let her die one too many times but ill break down the good and the bad in my opinion.\n\nThe Good:\nDecent story that goes more in-depth as time goes on\nSome scenes really keep you on the edge of your seat\nDinosaurs feel natural and have some nice animations and head movements some of which is funny and humorous as well.\nThe Death scenes are hilarious.\n\nThe Bad:\nQTE's, this game is filled with them so expect to have to deal with them a lot.\nThe voice acting is the worse I have heard in a telltale game with frequent cut offs\nSometimes Scenes transition before they are done being played out.\nVery annoying bugs in episode 1 which lasted for one scene after which I never saw said bug re occur. The bug itself was having to re listen to dialogue play out after it had already done so.\nStupid new dinosaur hybrid added in to add more depth but felt like an exaggeration and stupid idea. The look of it makes me want to laugh than be afraid, you will see what I mean.\n\nIn conclusion, there was a lot about this game I enjoyed. I have sunk almost 8 hours into this game and am nearing the end of episode 4 and I can say the time was not wasted. Bought at a discount price, this game is very much worth it in my opinion.\n\nI would recommend this Title without a doubt. Sit back, cook some popcorn, mix a drink and enjoy the antics of Jurassic Park!\n","January 6, 2014","true","17.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Using the famous 'point and click' adventure from BACK TO THE FUTURE and THE WALKING DEAD, JURASSIC PARK: THE GAME is a satisfying experience, provided you can sit through the serveral issuses that plagues the game. Despite it's limitations, it's pretty entertaining, despite people wanting a 'dino shoot-em'. Think of it as an interactive film, as it allows you to control the fate of the characters you play. Even with the occasional bug here and lag there, JURASSIC PARK: THE GAME is an all right game, sure it's not perfect, and if you really wanted to know what happened to Nedry's shaving cream from the first film after the Dilophosaur attack, this game is for you, especially if you're a hardcore fan of the franchise like myself.

As at this time we are hearing of an upcoming film being made: Jurassic Park 4, this was an appetising opening act.\nSure, it is like they say with fumbling controls; but the story made it worth the excitement almost like watching a Jurassic Park film that I had never watched before (having watched 1,2 & 3). Indeed, apart from basic similarities, it was different (introducing Dennis Nedry) and refreshing, preparing me in awe for the upcoming film! If it was more like the films than it already is (minimally) I may have been upset as the handling was really quite fickle, I endured the acrobatic controls to enjoy a NEW story now rather. I enjoyed the game on the wall instead the big picture took so much of the frustration caused by the controls away!

I want it!" And with a lot of money in my steam account for the holiday sale, I thought it'd be a good idea to pick it up and give it a whirl. I do not regret it. This game is made by TellTale Games, the makers of Sam and Max, the Back to the Future Games, and the Bone Games. Here is where their craftsmanship AND their knowledge of the film comes in. I can remember the film like the back of my hand, and there were so many references that I was like, "oh! I remember that!" I especially laughed at the "hold onto your butts" reference. You see, this game starts with the embryo theives. The embryo theives are heading into the park as the storm on the island was about to ensue. Then, you come across the fat guy from the film that nobody remembers the name of's car. You open the car and find the dilophosaurus feeding on him. Then, you go to the point of view of a worker and his daughter. I like how in this game, the focus is not on Hammond, Dr. Allan Grant, and their crew, but the people in the background that you really don't think about when watching the film.Then, the lady gets attacked by a dilophosaur, coems across the guy and his family, you hit her with a car, and you sleep through the night events of the first film. You go to the visitor's center just as Hammond and his crew is leaving. So, you know you will never see the film characters. The rest cannot be spoiled because it is very exciting with like: five twists that are worth while. The one thing that bothers me is that this game is an entire game built on quicktime reaction. The game isn't really a challenge (there being no lives or anything and constant checkpoints are everywhere), but the quicktime events are just so annoying. It's a point and click as well, but you don't move with the mouse. The game basically looks and acts like a movie, so I guess the only way to express it was the quicktime events. They aren't that bad, but they can be annoying if you have slower reflexes. I give this game an 8.5 out of 10 because of the quicktime events that make it more frustrating.","January 4, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The short reaction time that is expected in some parts can be daunting but it is humanly possible, you just gotta be in the mind set for fast reactions.\n\nYou are given a rank at the end of each section, depending on how many mistakes you made during it. The ranks are Gold, Silver, Bronze and nothing. Gold requires no mistakes throughout the section, silver allows for 1 mistakes to remain in the silver rank, bronze allows 2 mistakes to keep within the rank but at 6 mistakes overall you don't get a medal for that section. Some sections you automatically get gold for simply playing through it, for example during a section based around the speech choices you can get gold as there is no mistakes to be made.\n\nThe achievements in this game are creative and unique, some involve exploreing the surroundings, some require taking the shortest path through characters discussions whilst other require making no mistakes/not dying during an entire playthrough!\n\nOverall I would recommend this game, it is exciting, interesting and extremely enjoyable.","July 3, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some may call it linear, some may call it a Quick time event compilation, but i think its a stellar point and click game. Its never too hard to a point that you need to look up a Guide but (most of the time) also not to easy. There were really difficult Puzzles though. Doable, but hard. Aside from the point and click parts you have the other Elements that this Game offers. First, the Story. Here is where the Quick time events come in. There are gonna be people that wont like these parts but heres the deal:\n\nBad Quick time event: Come right the hell out of nowhere and can cause cheap deaths.\n\n\nGood Quick time event: Gives you enough time to react, you expect it and it overall is placed better.\n\n\nI think this Game has the GOOD Kind of Quick time events. When there is a point in the game that uses this it shows you because there then is an icon at the upper right corner of the screen. At first its a Gold Rank (T-Rex). If you miss one little move that isn`t fatal, it turns silver (Triceratops). If you then miss 2 more times, it becomes Bronze (Dilophosaur). As you can guess, this is kind of a rating system of how well you did during these events.\n\n\n\n\nVerdict: I think that this game is overall very good. Flawed, but good. If you like Jurassic Park, then buy this now. What are you waiting for? ITS JURASSIC PARK! The story is especially great for fans of the movie because it basically takes place during the events of the first film, but here the focus is on other characters created for this game.\nIf you havent seen the movies, you can still play this game but you probably wont understand a lot of the references (theres quite a few!). Overall, Good Game.\n","December 9, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here we go, review of Jurassic Park: The Game!\n*que jurassic park theme*\nGraphics 10/10: For a telltale game, since this was made in 2011 im saying this from that years graphic standards, and it looks pretty good, with only occasional lag spikes, but when they happen they simply just pause the game, although not the music.\n\nMusic 7/10: Now I know what your thinking, OMFG WHY YOU RATE JURASSIC PARK THEME SO LOW OMFG IM REPORTING YOU TO STEVEN SPIELBERG, no im not rating the Jurassic Park theme that low, its the music made by the developers im talking about. It is still great, and it catches the overall atmosphere of the game JUST under perfect.\n\nGameplay: 8/10: I have to say, sometimes I enjoyed watching the characters talk more than playing the game, because of one reason in 3 words; QUICK-TIME-EVENTS! Seriously, it makes you press 2 different buttons in the same sequence AND you dont even know what the next button you need to press IS until it pops up onto the screen, and by that time you have about a quarter second to do that! The quick time events I enjoyed is where you need to keep pressing the same button over and over again until the meter is full, and also the parts where you have to concentrate by moving your mouse into a moving circle for a couple seconds.\n\nOverall 8/10: Its a great game for Jurassic Park fans, especially BIG fans like me, (srsly I own almost every dino game on steam), it would be ok for telltale fans, but if you don't take part in either of those communitys, DO NOT BUY IT!

Casual wise, this may or may not satisfy you.\n\nWhile I deeply love Telltale and the game itself, I also have a few minor complaints when it comes to that being the animation glitches and loading times between new scenes. My biggest gripe is that the story is a "been there, done that" kind of thing where the last 3 movies already did so. i.e. Stuck on a island, dionsaurs running rampant, chaos ensures. So, it just constantly drags on. Granted the new characters are ok, but not in the sense of nostalgia. John Hammond (including the aftermath of Dennis Nedry) is howerver referenced here and there considering this story (reminder that this is non-canon story) takes place in between the original and Lost World. The only thing that sets this Jurassic Park different from the rest is the inclusion of new dinos such as the Troodon and the Tylosaurus.\n\nGameplay wise, its the stuff you should expect from a TellTale game, given that this game is a point and click adventure much like the beloved Walking Dead game also released from TellTale. There was some annoying segments such as the action command either not showing up or it goes to fast making timing a chore.\n\nIs it worth the $30 price tag?

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995992757/recommended/201830/","76561197995992757","Derp Derp Kill Kill","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995992757/","1433 products in account","English version (wersja polska jak zawsze niżej)\n\nHave you heard the stories about these guys who, during the Jackson’s LotR shows took out the books and loudly complained (from the first rows of the cinema) that Tolkien had it different? Well, back in the day when Jurassic Park entered the cinemas I was that kid who quite loudly argued that „these are not velociraptors but utahraptors!” or that „dilophosaurus didn't do that!”. Consequently I had a rather biased approach towards this game. Even more so that by the time of JP's release Telltale had managed to completely destroy (at least in my opinion) another brand that was very precious to me: Back to the Future. Truth be told, while I didn't have that much expectations, this game has still managed to make me give up playing a time or two. And then I have returned because, well, dinosaurs.\n\nSpeaking of which, not all of the dinosaurs present in the movies (or, particularly, the first one) made it into the game. While there obviously are raptors, triceratopses and T-rex (still glorious!) there is no single diplodocus or brachiosaurus, which I can not forgive since the brilliant scenes in the first movie featuring these dinos. Furthermore, I get the impression that raptors do not get enough screen time. Telltale also introduces a few species not present in the movie. No spoilers, but they could have chosen better.\n\nAnother point that I want to make is that oftentimes the scenes featuring dinosaurs are plain stupid. Let me give you an example from early in the game when one of the protagonists tries to push a triceratops out of the car's way. With his own hands. You sure know the triceratops? The huge, heavy, thick skinned, three horned Cretaceous rhino? As a layman I know not to ♥♥♥♥ of rhinos (not like there are that many where I live, but still), and the said person trying to push away the dinosaur is an employee of the park, consequently I'd expect some basic expertise.\n\nIt doesn't much help that most of the protagonists of JP can be easily placed on the sliding scale of plain boring to idiot. The dialogues are also not as polished as in the studio's newer titles. Admittedly, around the fourth episode things liven up a bit and some of the characters get more interesting (usually for one or two lines of dialogue). According to the credits, different episedes have been written by different people, which sometimes results in characters acting completely differently and incongruently throughout the game.\n\nBugs and glitches also deserve a paragraph of their own. First of all, Telltale games have never been particularly well optimized and this might be the worst of them all. I have tested JP on two different machines, both well above the suggested requirements, and on both the game often stops for a second or two while, for instance, changing the camera position or in the MIDDLE of a quick time event. This is particularly irritating due to the fact that QTEs are not very well timed. Usually the game does not give enough time to react which results in learning the key sequences by the heart.\n\nTo sum up: there is a big list of issues I have with this game. It clearly lacks some polish and gameplay testing, characters are bland, dialogues boring, story both silly and predictable. Truth be told, I'd love to see JP the Game released now, by the experienced Telltale that have developed and perfected their style.  As for now, I may recommend this game only because of, well, dinosaurs.\n\nWersja polska\n\nSłyszeliście kiedyś o tych kolesiach którzy na premierowych pokazach Władcy Pierścieni Jacksona siadali w pierwszych rzędach, wyjmowali Tolkiena zanim jeszcze pierwsze napisy zdążyły przelecieć, szeleścili kartkami i głośno stwierdzali że „W książce to inaczej było!” ? Czego wspominam? Bo w czasach szkoły podstawowej byłem, eufemistycznie ujmując, lekko chory na dinozaury. W kinie szarpałem ciocię, która to miała pecha zabrać mnie na Park Jurajski, i głośno komentowałem że „ to nie velociraptory tylko utahraptory!” albo że „dilofozaur wcale tak nie pluł!”. Rozumiecie więc chyba że mam dość osobiste podejście do tej konkretnej gry? Tym bardziej że w momencie wydania Jurajskiego Parku Telltale zdążyło już absolutnie sponiewierać (przynajmniej w mojej opinii) inną szczególnie bliską mi markę: Powrót do Przyszłości. Po przeczytaniu kilku recenzji nie oczekiwałem po JP wiele, a mimo to gra dała raz czy dwa radę zniechęcić mnie do jej ukończenia. Mimo to wracałem bo, wiecie, dinozaury.\n\nSkoro mowa o dinozaurach. Pamiętacie diplodoki i brachiozaury? Te wielkie, czworonożne, roślinożerne, z genialnej sceny na początku pierwszego filmu? No to właśnie ich w grze nie ma. Są za to triceratopsy, velociraptory i oczywiście (wciąż totalnie za*ebisty) t-rex. Choć odnoszę wrażenie że raptory pojawiają się w grze zdecydowanie za mało. Telltale dodało kilka gatunków od siebie, nie będę nic zdradzał, ale mogli się bardziej postarać.\n\nCo do samych scen z dinozaurami, pozwólcie że podam przykład: w pewnym momencie jeden z bohaterów próbuje przepchnąć (rękami, żeby nie było wątpliwości) młodego triceratopsa z drogi samochodu. Czego się czepiam? Triceratopsy były roślinożerne, nie? Otóż, wspomniany bohater jest pracownikiem Jurajskiego Parku więc oczekiwał bym od niego przynajmniej pewnej wiedzy z zakresu ' nie wk*wiania kilkutonowego, gruboskórnego, rogatego gada którego matka może być gdzieś w okolicy'. Idąc dalej tym tropem: triceratops to w sumie taki kredowy nosorożec. Jeżeli dalej nie rozumiecie moich wątpliwości wpiszcie sobie 'zdenerwowany nosorożec' w wyszukiwarce.\n\nWłaściwie nie czepiał bym się gdyby tego typu sceny pojawiały się raz czy dwa, ale jest ich więcej. Do tego prawie każdego bohatera da się umieścić na ruchomej skali charakterów gdzieś pomiędzy 'totalnie nudny' a 'debil'. Dialogi też nie są jakieś szczególnie interesujące, podobnie jak fabuła. Aż dziwi że za grę odpowiada studio które później wydawało „Walking Dead”. Choć przyznaję że w ostatnim, czwartym odcinku akcja nieco przyśpiesza a niektórzy z bohaterów robią się odrobinę bardziej interesujący ( na jakąś linijkę dialogu lub dwie). A właśnie, według informacji w końcowych „creditsach” za fabuły odcinków odpowiadają różne osoby. Niby nic takiego, ale widać to w zachowaniu bohaterów którzy niejednokrotnie zmieniają swoje motywacje i postępowanie w sposób zupełnie nie pasujący do nich „z poprzedniego odcinka”.\n\nTo teraz bugi i glitche, bo zasługują na oddzielny paragraf. Po pierwsze, gry Telltale nigdy nie były jakoś szczególnie dobrze zoptymalizowane, a możliwe że ta jest najgorsza z nich wszystkich. Testowałem ją na dwóch różnych komputerach, obu znacznie przebijających rekomendowane wymagania, i w obu przypadkach często zdarzało jej się zwalniać lub doczytywać przy zmianie kamery albo W ŚRODKU quick time eventa. A trzeba dodać że QTE nie dają jakoś szczególnie dużo czasu na reakcję, właściwie często trzeba się zwyczajnie dać zabić kilka razy żeby zapamiętać sekwencje klawiszy do wciśnięcia. Nie pomaga jeżeli gdzieś w połowie gra zaczyna tracić klatki dokładnie w momencie kiedy musisz akurat wcisnąć (w około sekundę) lewo- lewo-góra-q.\n\nPodsumowując: mam z tą grą mocno na pieńku: brakuje jej grywalności, postacię są w większości nijakie, dialogi nudne a fabuła przewidywalna i zwyczajnie głupia. Prawdę powiedziawszy, zobaczył bym Park wydany ponownie przez doświadczone Telltale mające już na koncie „Walking Dead'y” i Wilka Bigby'ego. Wtedy ta gra wyglądała by zupełnie inaczej, bo teraz to takie JP na 57%. Mimo to polecam bo, wiecie, dinozaury.","March 15, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However the only huge downside I had to this game was that Telltale changed up the mechanics of this game with those ♥♥♥♥ing annoying arrows. So it had some really frustrating moments when you had to hit (sometimes predict) what keys to hit, if you messed it it would lower your overall situational score from gold to silver to bronze to nothing. If you died so many times, they made it easier after so many messups. Story wasnt too bad but it wasnt exactly the BEST. If you can handle watching Jurassic Park III, then you can handle the story in this game. Wait to buy this game while its on sale for at least $7 or under. Overall, the worst Telltale game I've ever played. I'd expect more coming from the developers of The Wolf Among us, The Walking Dead, and even Game of thrones.

I'm sorry, I just can't. I love Telltale games and I have absolutely no problem with well made episodic games; to me, they're like really good books that can be read (or played through) every so often just for an enjoyable story line and interesting characters.\n\nNot so with Jurassic Park, unfortunately. I'll start with the premise and the positives though...\n\nThis game is beautifully conceived and rendered; the premise was too tantalising to ignore. It is set immediately after the first Jurassic Park movie; Hammond, Dr. Grant and the others have just escaped the island in their helicopter. You play as a rag-tag group of characters consisting of other people trapped on the island by the storm, the group intent on stealing the dinosaur embryos and the mercenaries/rescue teams sent in to extract the survivors. It answers all sorts of questions and follows up several interesting threads from the film, like what happened to the dinosaur embryos Nebry stole - okay, in the film they were apparently buried in the mud by the storm, but this covers what happens when the can is found again. One of the characters you play as is Dr Harding, the vet who was treating the sick triceratops in the film, so there is some really nice crossover and continuity.\n\nThe graphics are stunning and there are some fabulous extra touches, like unlocking journal pages from one of the scientists which muse upon issues such as why the velociraptors are three times bigger than they should be; why the therodpods don't have feathers as they should, why the dilophosaurs spit venom when they shouldn't, and why the T'Rex's vision is based on movement (okay, it's all mainly to do with Dr. Wu screwing things up with frog DNA, but it's still interesting!).\n\nSo far, so good, but then the game runs smack into a solid brick wall of mediocrity that it cannot overcome no matter how much you want it to, despite being a die-hard Jurassic Park fan and the “OMG WOW!” factor that it's got DINOSAURS in it and how can DINOSAURS not be COOL?!\n\nSo what's the problem? Unfortunately, there are many.\n\nFirst off; the characters. Not one of them is particularly likable or even consistent in their personalities. You end up really not caring what happens to them, which ruins your investment in the game completely. You kind of wish that they would get eaten by the dinosaurs - in fact, I spent much of the game thinking I'd rather be playing as the T-Rex, because I'd have really enjoyed ripping the heads off the irritating mainstays. And they’d have deserved it.\n\nSecondly, the controls - I nearly put this as number one just because the controls are awkward, irritating, badly executed, inconsistent and downright frustrating. The lack of a decent control interface makes the game slow, clunky and repetitive as you find yourself playing through the same short section over and over because one little mis-click has you dead in the jaws of a T-Rex and when you've watched that same cut scene three times over you find your frustrations mounting - it's one of those games where you find yourself shouting at the screen, such pearls as "stop dying and start running, you idiot!" and many, many expletives. I tried playing with both keyboard and mouse and a control pad and neither worked properly.\n\nThirdly, the story line. It's... it's okay. Well, it starts off okay and then it just rambles off on a tangent that makes little sense. Seriously, the characters make some really bizarre decisions that end up keeping them on the island and in mortal peril for just that bit longer, apparently completely lacking in common sense and basic survival instincts. Being unable to skip the end credits was irritating but it clearly shows that each chapter of the game was written and directed by different people, so that lack of a coherent, consistent story might be the result of too many cooks spoiling the broth. You honestly get the impression that one team sat down, played with the dinosaurs for a while, got bored, and then handed it on to the next guys to have a go. You are offered tantalising glimpses that some of the goings on about the island were a lot darker and more illicit than the film indicated, but none of this is properly explored.\n\nFourthly, the pacing is awful. You either get loads of character development, which is for the most part boring conversations that you simply have to click-wade through; ploddingly slow investigative scenes which are just looking around and clicking on things until something is revealed,  or rapid action scenes that you simply cannot keep up with. I'm not kidding, racing driver reactions couldn't keep up with the speed of some of the keystrokes you have to make, and if you get one wrong, you've had it. You therefore die two or three times, but then you think 'Ah ha! I've memorised the sequence now' - ready to go for your final attempt, you find the game has realised you're struggling with this bit and has simplified the controls, which sounds helpful but actually just leads to you mis-clicking even more as you're anticipating steps that are no longer there. Frustration reigns supreme once more – finishing each chapter is a chore and the only sense of accomplishment comes from the relief that you’ve finally finished that part and can move on to the next dog’s dinner of a chapter.\n\nAs a result of all this, the achievements don’t really mean anything – it’s basically a way of marking that you’ve finished each chapter. Some of the achievements can only really be achieved on a replay, which is unlikely to happen given how irritating the whole experience was the first time around. Some of the achievements require a perfect, faultless play through – not impossible, I guess, but very unlikely and no doubt irritating to try to achieve. I certainly won’t be bothering to try for a ‘perfect game’ on this one; I’ve made it through the storyline and that’s enough for me.\n\nI imagine that in a year’s time, I’ll see this game in my library, re-read this review, and think; “oh, it can’t have been that bad, I must have been in a really bad mood when I wrote that, I’ll give it another go, after all, it’s got to be some fun, as there’s DINOSAURS in it and DINOSAURS ARE COOL.”\n\nYes, dinosaurs are cool.\n\nThis game is not.\n\nIt is an irritating pile of dino-droppings, and I honestly don’t recommend it to anyone.\n","June 27, 2015","false","7.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

Overall the story is pretty interesting, and there are tense points in the game.\n\nHOWEVER I'm sure all of you guys realize at this point that this game is a point and click. It does not seem like that was their intention from the beginning or something because this is a very poorly executed game of this sort. I can accept point and click adventures if I like the story but sometimes this really gets ridiculous. It switches perspectives WAY too much. You're listening to a really heated coversation between a veterinarian and geneticist about how the woman is a madman, and you've been choosing dialogue options for the veternarian.

It's very buggy and laggy, scenes don't playout smoothly where character models jump around in a glitchy manner and every once in a while the cursor disappears completely.\n\nWhat I really hated most about this game is that I hated all of the characters, and you're suppose to play and choose dialogue for almost if not all of them. Which is confusing because I both hate them and want them to get eaten ASAP but the game expects me to choose good choices. It's very confusing and contridating.\n\nMany people complain about the quicktime events but honestly, I look forward to them because it was both really action packed and super exciting to play through, as well as it prevents me from falling to sleep to the sounds of their boring ♥♥♥ conversations. I think the most interesting conversation in the whole game is the one between the dad and the little girl... and that's not even part of the main game, it's background dialogue. The voice acting is awesome but damn was it a chore to get through.\n\nExcusing my rant, don't get this game.

The best thing about this game is it has a complete set of new story line which is really awesome and thrilling from where the movie left with the canister of dinosaur embryos. The game consists of 4 chapters with hours and hours of fun game play. The graphics are good (Dinosaurs are made well matched to the movie with extra Dinosaurs) and different genre knows as Point-and-click adventure, role-playing which is not bad. You will get killed too with different awesome dinosaur kills =P Epic dinosaur battles Triceraptors vs T-Rex which is available only in this game. Perfect environment and weather conditions feels drizzling and feels went back to Dino times. Characters are appreciable & well made. Variety of dinosaurs including water Dino Tylosaurus (Which I always wanted to see) , Classic T-Rex , Dilos & Raptor. This game has 2 Climax! Lots of dialogues and variety of scenes according to what we dialogue or decision choose. Personally I love this game a lot. You earn medals gold, bronze or silver according to your game play (Death Trolls) and achievements. Sounds effects are impressive.

Re-live the Jurassic Park movie in good graphics, it fills that emptiness of lacking dinosaur games in the recent years. I thoroughly enjoyed the hours I've spent playing this game.\n\nCharacter development is alright, the player gets to make decision for pretty much everyone.\n\nThe game's fairly difficult in terms of reactive gameplay, it will definitely improve your reaction time and allows you to make clutch plays better in other games. I'd be surprised if anyone consistently scoring Gold throughout the game.\n\nThe game has interesting puzzles that you have to actually put into effort to solve (or trial and error if you prefer to not do the brain work at all)\n\nA fair bit of jumpscares from time to time.\n\nThe only improvement I can think of is the continuity of dialogue/speech/action getting cut off/skipped and the accidental ESC press will bring you to the main menu with delay.\n\nOverall it's another damn good game from Telltale.

I encountered no bugs, however, the game requires you to use multiple keys in quick time sequences. Many of these dont make sense, and include triple tapping and then finishing with another directional. The quicktime scenes are unforgiving, and sometimes the keystrokes fail to registered.\n\nThe game also suffers from some lag.

If you're a Jurassic Park franchise fan, you'll definitely love it. Why? There are so many references to the original JP movie and the second The Lost World movie. You can hear about John Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow, you can read a special journal which creates supreme logical explanations about the movement-based and binocular vision difference of Tyrannosaurus Rex and extreme big sizes of Velaciraptors because they were actually smaller according to paleontologist, besides Utahraptors and the venom spitting demeanor of Dilophosaurus and what happens to Isla Nublar after the first movie. Meeting with Sarah Harding (Ian Malcolm's girlfriend in The Lost World) was also a nice detail.\n\nUsing John Williams' score for the game? Telltale nailed it here. Awesome job.\n\nI went to see Jurassic World a week ago and the I watched the first 3 movies like 50 times in my life and I started playing this one and now I'm completely overwhelmed by the magnificent aura of Crichton's creation.

A world of myth come true with dinosaurs. I remembered the dino fever that this film created in every corner of the planet.\n\nPlaying this game was a good thing, good memories came back and I really enjoyed. despite the negative reviews this game has, I could enjoy the idea of the game. Here you play while everything started to go to the disaster. Also, I could read Jurassic Park book by Michael Crichton, wich I highly recommend.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHere you have the chance of playing several characters, something very common at Telltale game series. First, you play the introduction with Nima, a mercenary paid by  Dodgson. You remember  Dodgson, that guy talking at the beginning of the film with Gendry, the IT guy. Of course, we all watched the movie and knew what happened with Gendry. Nima has to get the Dino embryos, and that not gonna happen so easily. In the meantime, she finds other members of the Nublar island.\n\nAlso, you play with the Harding family, Gerry, and his daughter Jess. remember Hading, the veterinarian at the movie? Well,  the same. He invited the girl that last day for an educational experience, with will be a little complicated.\n\nThe idea of the game is not just exploring the island when the electricity goes down and other interesting things happen wich you have to investigate. In the meantime, running away from all perils of a  full dino island.\n\nLike all Telltale games, more than a graphic adventure is more like a visual adventure movie, you can have the chance of changing some things but not always. Maybe some ends but if something is meant to happen, that gonna happen. Of course, you'll have the chance of interaction between characters, each one with a  very well made personality, so that's a good one for the scripters.\nThe game explores other things the movie doesn't. Of course, I'm not comparing the great Jurassic Park with this game, but I think the game has their good things. I think the people of Telltale read Michael Crichton book to take some ideas from it.\n\nHere you have scenes to complete, and the game saves automatically after each one. Depend if you make mistakes or not, you can reach gold, silver or bronze status. remember Steam achievements if you like to complete them.\nI highly recommend saving every time you can just in case. There are very hard scenes and saving will be a useful tool.\n\nArt and Music\n\nFor a game made at 2011 maybe the cinematics would be better but I think the game, in general, is quite good. The landscapes well make and the dinos are good. Could the game be better in this aspect? Yes, of course. But I have to mention about the music. Is never disturbing, just great for the action scenes and with that reminiscence of the great John Williams creation for the original movie.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nA good game with a good story. I read other comments about the game and I don't understand why they say about phrases out of context or something like that. I think the game has the Jurassic Park spirit. I watched the movie at the cinema, I watched the movie again several times and I read the book. I think it has the spirit. That island had a lot of things to explore, and having the chance of creating over the created is just awesome. telltale did it so I give an 8/10 for this game. I enjoyed playing it!\n","May 21","true","17.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It feels like one very long and very broken QTE.\n\nThe control scheme on this game is horrible especially in action sequences. Mouse + keyboard just feels awkward in this one as opposed to other Telltale games like BTTF, Sam + Max, Puzzle Agent, etc, etc and the 360 control scheme is severely out of whack. The game will post on screen instructions with button presses supposedly in north/sout/east/west fashion, but I've seen multiple insances in just the first couple of minutes where what's displayed for what you would think the west (X button) is actually the north (Y button). The prompts aren't displayed long enough before the time runs out to decipher the wonky on screen display and hit the correct button and you end up like a bull in a china shop crashing through the scenery instead of getting it to do what you want. Then it becomes a memory game where you restart and try to time everything with the correct buttons while completely ignoring the OSD prompts\n\nI've been playing a lot of Telltale games lately since I never got around to them and am really enjoying them for the most part, but the controls in this one are very off putting. Very disappointed with this one. I don't like having to muddle through a game over simple timing and OSD issues\n\nI wanted to like this game. I really did but it's just an exercise in frustration and is unplayable from a basic control standpoint","February 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Everything is broken into quick time events, with relatively long gaps in between action segments. Failing an action sequence oftentimes results in death, which then requires you to backtrack to the previous checkpoint in that sequence and try again. The load times are very fast and you can jump into the action once more quickly if you happen to miss an important button press, but the repetition of these moments gets stale after the first episode. Still, I’d get on the edge of my seat every once in a while as I raced to fill up button press meters to run from a T-Rex.\n\nJurassic Park is not a very long game – only four episodes, making it one of TellTale’s shorter adventures. The dialogue and voice acting is solid enough, though they attempt to give fans a wink and nudge by implementing lines from the movie (“Hold on to your butts…), though they just didn’t mesh right and were executed similarly to corny catchphrases. I found a surprising layer of depth to the mercenary characters, however, the more I started to think about their motivations for being on (and eventually leaving) Isla Nublar. I’m also hoping that the character of Nima wasn’t meant to be sympathetic, as I found her to be annoying and her presence jeopardized or killed many people around her.\n\nThe game is buggy, in a few surprising ways. Dialogue lines would repeat on me in my playthrough, and during some action sequences some of the button prompts would not appear on the screen at all when I replayed events. It also isn’t a very pretty game – the overall look is stylized similarly to The Walking Dead or Back to the Future, although it is utilized far better in each of those games.\n\nIt certainly isn’t the best adventure game to be released in the past few years, nor is it a must-buy for Jurassic Park fans. Overall, the game is worth playing through on a Saturday afternoon just to experience another TellTale game, but the current Steam price is entirely too high. This game is only worth about $10 or less, ideally. Anything more than that just isn’t worth the price of admission. Recommended if you’re looking for a quick adventure game, and this game just-so-happens to be on sale. Otherwise, it’s entirely skippable.","December 8, 2014","false","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After my first few hours, I have lost most of my interest in finishing this title heres why:\n\n1.) Story- Even for the Jurrasic Park fan, the story feels painfully average. It's not terrible especially when compared to the plots of some popular titles,but for a game that wants you to point/click/qte through the game, an average story is less than acceptable.\n\n2.) Cheap difficulty- I hate games that hold your hand making everything simple, but just as annoying are games that make themselves hard through gimmicks. In this instance, the gimmick is the QTEs. There is little rhyme or reason to the button sequence, some areas have several buttons spammed in succession where even ninja reflexes would struggle, and you have less than a picasecond to respond before the prop is considered a failure; in some cases you don't even see a prompt. When the consequence is just not getting a perfect ranking, this is fine, but when you spend over an hour dying and rebooting because you can't hit wda swd as d a w s in under 2 seconds flawlessly that's just garbage. Some might say well use a game controller instead of mouse and keyboard, but in my experience with both, there hasn't been a difference.\n\n3.) Bugs: I have had to quit and reload the game several times because the mouse will randomly just disappear which makes a point and click adventure impossible and some QTEs impossible to pass. When the only solution this wonderful community has found to constantly work is quit and reboot it's just obnoxious.","December 26, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The puzzle solving elements of it are still intact, but are not nearly as challenging as they were in Sam & Max and Back to the Future, and are wedded to the dialogue and quick-time events that the newer games have. The thing is though that there is a big difference between the QTEs in Jurassic Park as opposed to a game like The Walking Dead. In Jurassic Park it's way more difficult to hit every single prompt and are more of a game mechanic than something to build tension. Sure, failing some of them can kill your character but in general you don't have to hit many of them to advance the story. You complete each scene with a Gold/Silver/Bronze ranking and you need to hit every prompt to get the gold, which nearly gave me autism as I was felt compelled to immediately repeat every scene that I didn't do perfectly the first time.

It's been a while since I played the game so I can't remember the specific issue, but some of the options on the menus are labelled strangely and it's easy to accidentally start new games or restart a scene you're already some ways into.\n\nOverall though, I think this game got too bad of a rap when it first came out.

The puzzle solving elements of it are still intact, but are not nearly as challenging as they were in Sam & Max and Back to the Future, and are wedded to the dialogue and quick-time events that the newer games have. The thing is though that there is a big difference between the QTEs in Jurassic Park as opposed to a game like The Walking Dead. In Jurassic Park it's way more difficult to hit every single prompt and are more of a game mechanic than something to build tension. Sure, failing some of them can kill your character but in general you don't have to hit many of them to advance the story.

The storyline is different from the actually movies but that's not a bad thing, considering a lot of people died in the movie (but, you could also say quite a few people died in this game too).  Telltale does a great job on their games, Poker Night at the Inventory was well made and fun game. The Walking Dead, although I only watched PewDiePie play it, had a great storyline, lovable characters, and made me feel sad when some of them died. This game was amazing, although at some points my mouse dissapeared which made Geff and Jess die by the T-rex with the tour car alot. Also, it made me not able to exit out of the speech thing when you asked Oscar about Sorkin.\n\nBesides those two minor,"glitches" I would reccomend this game.","January 1, 2015","true","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But what telltale games lack in gameplay, they make up for the storytelling and cinematics. You play as different characters and get a chance to explore their past and personalyties. Unfortunately the game is pretty linear and there are only 1 choice in the game that truly matters, although it kinda feels like all of them do.\n\nI also played this on a macbook pro retina and experienced some technical difficulties with the full screen mode where the screen was completly black and i could not do anything. After some research i figured out that there is no fix on this issue, but it was still possible to play the game in windowed mode. So if you have a Mac and wants to play this game, be awere that you might have to play in window mode, but it is not such a big deal and I still managed to enjoy the game.\n\nOverall i think this was a great game mith a good story and it is also cheap, I had a good time playing and defidently recommend this game.. especially if you are a fan of the other telltale games.","July 7, 2015","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealhive/recommended/201830/","therealhive","Hive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealhive/","212 products in account","I really liked Telltale's previous big franchise adventure games, Back to The Future and, especially, The Walking Dead - and since I've always liked Jurassic Park, I figured that this game would be right up my alley. Sure, I'd read the warnings in form of poor (I mean, *really* poor) reviews for this game... but I figured that, given my previous happy encounters with Telltale added my interest for Jurassic Park (who doesn't love dinosaurs?), it would still be fun. I figured that even though it might not be great, it could still be a good enough game. I mean, how bad could it be, right? Well, as it turns out: really, REALLY bad.\n\nLet's start with the actual gameplay: there isn't much of it. The story pretty much unfolds by itself, merely prompting you to hit the right buttons at the right time (which, at times, is an absurdly frustrating and pointless task). You can't explore as in other Telltale games, there are no choices to be made and you're generally just viewing an interactive movie. Which, even though it's a letdown compared to other Telltale games, could perhaps work... if the story was better.\n\nAnd that brings us to the story: while not bad per say, it's not something special, either. The story in itself is decent, no more, no less -  but it's "supported" by crummy dialogue and unlikeable and unlikely characters that are, at best, pretty forgetable. And you constantly switch between them in a fashion that makes you not really know who you're controlling at times, going from fighting a character at one moment to controlling the former enemy at the next. And there's no way to skip dialogue or any of the counbtless cut scenes... so when you die (and you *will* die) due to missing one of the gazillion reflex button hits, you're often forced to sit through the same scene again and again.\n\nAnd the bugs... oh dear. The bugs in this game forces you to constantly exit the game and, even worse, re-play some of the long and horrible sections again and again. And this game, mind you, have had 3 years to get patched up! Yet none of these absurd bugs, like the mouse pointer often dissapearing, has been fixed! Shame on you, Telltale.\n\nIn short: I'd only recommend this game to hardcore fans of Jurassic Park or Telltale. Preferably both. And even then, I'd only recommend it if the game is *at least* 75 % off. Come to think of it, you probably shouldn't even buy it if all those 3 criterias are fullfilled. Just stay away from this game. Resist the lure. You'll be happier without it.","July 7, 2014","false","7.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ATE412/recommended/201830/","ATE412","ATE412","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ATE412/","130 products in account","First off, I'm a HUGE fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, and when I heard that Telltale is making a game based in that world I figured it was the best of two worlds finally meeting.  Sure, others were saying negative things about the game, but I've played "bad" games before.  Well, not like this one.\n\nFor the first time in awhile, Jurassic Park actually presented me with a game that frustrates on gameplay ALONE, and that's saying a lot seeing there are basically only four buttons you need to press the entire game.  The QTE given in the game are so fast (and sometimes complex, ranging to a sequence of 3-4 buttons that need to be pressed within a second) that many times I found myself dying numerous times just to memorize the pattern.  In addition (although this might just be my computer) the buttons were sometimes non-responsive, leaving myself even more frustrated from dying over a SINGLE "misbutton".  Unlike with Telltale's Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us, Jurassic Park is simply a movie (and a poor one at that) where it will prompt you occasionally to push the left or right arrows.  Not so much "gameplay" in that idea.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it left a lot to be desired.  Sure, it was nice to visit the park again in a new light, and I secretly enjoyed it when they dropped some big names from the franchise in conversation (Sarah Harding, Peter Ludlow...), but many of the things that Telltale teased to us over 3/4 of the game would eventually just wander off never to be seen again.  In fact, in the majority of the fourth episode the main character says that it's impossible to clone any aquatic dinosaurs and then . . . there's an aquatic dinosaur (with no explanation).  At one point, a character makes a big threat to release a dinosaur into the wild, does it . . . and then nobody does anything about it.  They talk about dinosaurs escaping the pens, but, well you guessed it, they never go beyond that.  The story has so many plot holes and missing points at the end, that I felt very let down to call this an addition to the franchise that amazed me as a kid.\n\nMy advise on playing it?  If you're a fan of Jurassic Park like I am, sure.  Grab it.  But don't go for it until it's on sale.  For alot.","September 14, 2014","false","7.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The writing is actually pretty good, but the "gameplay" is virtually nonexistent, unintuitive, and buggy as hell.  It's mostly just twitch "puzzles" where you have to tap a direction when an arrow appears on screen, but it frequently gives you nowhere near enough time (I failed many times by hitting the correct direction within a quarter of a second of the icon appearing).  That wouldn't be so bad, but the direction you have to push is often arbitrary, so you have no way of knowing what it's going to be before it happens.  There are a few where it warns you ahead of time, and you're only supposed to push the direction when it pulses, which is very difficult since the game conditions you to immediately tap the button when you see the icon.  I think the designers intended players to play through a section over and over until you memorize the pattern, but they have a lot of unskippable dialogue and cut scenes that make that an even more tedious prospect than it would be anyway.\n\nIt only lets you specify once whether you want to use mouse and keyboard or gamepad (I strongly suggest mouse and keyboard), and if you change your mind you have to edit registry files to fix it.  I tried both, and the control is even worse with a gamepad.  The mouse pointer occasionally disappears, but you can work around that by going to the main menu, pointing where the icon you need to click on is, then going back to the game.\n\nI'm also having a recurring issue where the game will kick me back to the main menu, and forget my prorgress so far on the currrent scenario.  It's happened intermittently before, but now it happens every time, so I'm unable to progress beyond the part of Episode 2, Scenario 7 right after you take off in the chopper.\n\nI suggest just watching the game on YouTube instead.  You'd get to see the story without being hampered by the terrible gameplay.","December 28, 2014","false","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

A few button presses and tumble off the edge of a cliff later and the screen fades.\nAhhh, now we've switched characters and the opening credits roll as we listen to the familiar and excellent Jurassic Park theme music, which does a tremendous job of recreating the  atmosphere of movie.\nIt's now "earlier that day". Your cursor has turned into a magnifying glass  and your scanning the plant-life through a pair of binoculars looking for some elusive triceratops.\n\nClever Girl\n\nOk, so far so good,the quick time event sequence opening the game got your heart pumping, the more sedate scanning the screen through the binoculars was a nice change of pace.\nLooks like Tell Tale are on to another winner here, bring on the moral game changing decisions and mind bending puzzles.\nHere we Go!\n\nThey're Flocking This Way\n\nOh, OK, another quick time event, fair enough, oh and another one and now we're scanning the screen with the magnifying glass again.\nSurely I can't have seen everything the game has to offer, by way of game play,  in the first few minutes can I?\n\nI think things are a little bit different then you and I had feared...\n\nPretty much, yes. The interaction to be found here alternates between frantic quick time events (hit X to jump over a log, hit Y to doge a branch etc.) and the down time with the magnifying glass (playing" I Spy a Clue" across various scenes). Not that either of these mechanics are bad in their own right, it's just that together they aren't really enough to carry a "game" over four chapters.\n\nOur lives are in your hands and you have butterfingers\n\nThe quick time events themselves become repetitive very quickly.\nYou'll play through a scene, miss a button press, and die in some horrible way.\nYou'll play throughout same scene again, miss a different button press, and die again.\nRinse and repeat until your muscle memory kicks in and you clear that particular scene.\nAt least then you might be rewarded with some cinematics, a little more story to push to plot forward to the next inevitable series of timed button mashing.\n\nYou were meant to come down here and defend me against these characters!\n\nMaybe we're being a little too harsh, The story here is actually very enjoyable, and game can be quite immersive when the frequent quick time events aren't spoiling the atmosphere by pulling your full attention back to the game mechanics.\nThe characterisaton, whilst not a strong as other Tell Tale games, is still very good.\nYou'll get to play as several different characters through out the course of the game, and whilst all stereo types to varying degrees, this does help you relate to them somewhat, you know where you stand with the wise cracking teenage girl, or the tough mercenary without the need for hours of back story.\n\nI can't get Jurassic Park back online without Dennis Nedry\n\nSo strong story, decent characters and repetitive game mechanics, that about sums it up, right?\nPretty much, but there's another factor at play here too. The optimisation of this game is terrible.\nYou'll experience stuttering sounds, huge frame-rate drops and some lines of dialogue which will repeat themselves a couple of times before giving up and letting the game move forwards.\nNone of this is game breaking on it's own, but with the constant barrage of QTE's, it all works to destroy the immersion of a game which should (and does on occasion) ooze atmosphere.\n\nYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, that they\ndidn't stop to think whether they should.\n\nJurassic Park sounds like an excellent franchise for Tell Tale to get its hands on and I'm not sure why they didn't pull it off here.\nIt's such a shame because the Jurassic Park movies provide such a rich tapestry to hang a game on and the story here is actually very good.\nYou just need to push through the glitches and annoying game mechanics to get to enjoy it.\n\nAfter careful consideration I've decided not to endorse your park\n\nWhilst not an totaly un-enjoyable experience, I find it hard to recommend a game which relies so heavily on quick time events and struggles with optimisation issues.\nIf you're a fan of the movies and you're looking for a good story and strong characters then this is the game for you IF you don't mind A LOT of quick time events.\nHowever, if playing the same sequence several time over to learn which keys to hit and when doesn't appeal to you, then fan of Jurassic park or not, this game is going to annoy and frustrate.\nTell Tale has an excellent track record which, unfortunatley, Jurassic Park doesn't quite live up to.\n\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","January 15, 2012","false","7.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I like it and I don't like it. For those curious about the overall game, it's more like an interactive movie. You watch events unfolding and you can change the course of events or better events through prompts on the screen indicating keys that should be pressed and will have to be pressed at the exact time or quickly enough. There are alos dialogue prompts giving you options upon interactions with others. This game is not for me but may be for other people. I am a big fan of jurassic park, but not this game.\n\nThe major problem I find with it is watching and waiting, then when the prompt comes up I either missed it or mess up because I am too busy watching the "movie" or get tired waiting. The other problems are the numorous glitches, which I encounter and is unknown whether others ecounter them as well, which include the cursor not appearing during gameplay, the fact that scenarios in an episode already played through cannot be accessed, and that certain dislogue prompts leave to a brick wall. I had the dialogue issue and I had to replay the game from a previous secenio in a further episode which I now cannot access. And about that, I was halfway through the second episode when I went to resume playing and I was forced to begin from the first episode again and nothing I played in the second scenario could be accessed even though I played through the last couple of scenarious again.

It was a bit different than the other games from them that I played (Walking Dead 1 and 2, and Back to the Future). As the story goes, you play different characters and there are points in the story where you have to change characters so you can get move to the next phase. Kind of like Lost Vikings, if you remember that game. Then there are action parts where you have to press your arrow keys at precise moments to make the correct move. Again, like the game Dragon's Lair, if anyone is old enogh to remember that in the arcades. It took me a short time to get used to it. You can make mistakes as well, but it will cost you points in a sense there is a gold, silver, and bronze rank for each scenario. You can go back later and redo the scenario and get a better grade. And some achievements need to have certain desicions as well. Again, you'd have to go back and play the scenario and make the second desicion to get the other achievement.\n\nThe downside of this game is that it's really short. 4 chapters and I finished it in 9 hours. So it would be wise for this game to get it on sale, because it may be fun, but I don't believe it's worth the full price. Aside from that the only other thing is it COULD be buggey. It lags a bit so I don't know if it's on my end or the game. Let's just say, I don't have any other problems with any of my other games.\n\nBut aside from the minor downside, it is entertaining and fun to play. So enjoy.","January 1","true","9.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This is a really good game. And if you're a fan of Jurassic Park, it's even a GREAT game.\n\nHowever, it has an extremely QTE-oriented gameplay, even by Telltale Games standards. Which is probably why there are so many negative reviews: if you don't like this type of gameplay and you really didn't expect it then of course, the game is going to come off bad.\n\nThe story is wonderful, very close in style (and reflection) to the book, although I'll admit there are some pretty cheasy plot twists. The graphics now look a bit outdated but not bad enough to affect gameplay. Most of the characters are very enjoyable, the voice acting is pretty decent (which, along with the QTE gameplay sometimes gives you the impression you're playing a movie... if that makes any sense to you). And, of course, the soundtrack is awesome (gotta love that intro).\n\nThe steam achievments are easy enough to get 100% as well, if you're that kind of player :)","May 26","true","9.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

For those of you looking for the writing and edge of your seat moments of The Walking Dead series, you'll be dissapointed. You won't find them in this game.\n\nThe first major issue would obviously be the gameplay, which is entirely driven by QTEs. They're not that hard but they are constant and become boring very quickly. There is some very minor exploration but that is really just panning across a single screen until you find all the clues, which are highlighted anyway.  You can't control your character but simply jump between scenes at the press of a button. That pretty much sums up the gameplay for you.\n\nFor everything else. the writing, characters and graphics are fairly average. Nothing stood out to me. Music is taken straight from the movie, I can't remember hearing any original music at all. Some people might prefer that but I didn't. At times I would get an annoying glitch with the sound which added a echo effect to all the voices and some sound effects.\n\nOverall this game doesn't offer anything interesting to a Jurassic Park fan or even an adventure game fan. For hardcore Jurassic Park fans who are going to play this no matter what, like me, I would definitely say wait for a sale.","October 8, 2014","false","12.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grenadeh/recommended/201830/","grenadeh","Grenadeh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grenadeh/","961 products in account","Telltale is known only for their exceptional storytelling in games, dating back from the days of Wallace and Gromit (so no, JP is not one of their early games), and those games are really more visual novel than anything else. Most people probably never heard of them until Walking Dead, and having said that, Jurassic Park is a slightly more....prehistoric beast in comparison. Ahh....ah?\n\nYou have absolutely no control over characters in this game, compared to Walking Dead (I've not played Game of Thrones or Tales from Borderlands, so I can't comment on those) - you only get to select different scenes or subsets or characters within each "scenario", and then you often have to figure out puzzles. Most of them are pretty easy, and really there is only one puzzle at the almost end of the game where you'll basically have to spend some time, Google it, or just do it through trial and error. Maybe I'm an idiot.\n\nCompared to Walking Dead, the QTEs are much more difficult as well. The game is composed entirely of them, and the key prompts are challenging to say the least. I haven't tried it with controller but I'm hoping that it becomes easier. In addition to the QTEs being often fast paced and frustrating, they are somehow hard to see, and, nearly half of the achivements in the game are tied to doing them perfectly. There's even one for never dying - considering failing almost any of the QTEs means instadeath, it's a challenge, but obviously not impossible.\n\nThe story focuses mostly on the cryogenic Barbasol can storing the stolen embryos, and the quest of a mercenary to retrieve it. Thrown into this mix is a fair amount of loose inspiration from the actual book. Ingen dispatches some mercenaries to extract the survivors who missed the boat before the US military blows the island up. However, the story is based on the continuity of the movie, rather than the actual novel, in which Hammond escapes the island -but, Dr. Harding is a very different person who doesn't make it off of the island. Who is also apparently Sarah Hardings dad (not impossible but not how the actual novel goes) which is plausible if you read The Lost World, but contrived.\n\nFaithful to the movie, the game is full of suspense and action, with some science and ethical undertones. You will constantly run for your life and try to escape death at the hands of four species of carnivores, and even the trikes will try to kill you. There is no safety in this game and if you don't excel at QTEs, you are going to die over and over.\n\nI found it to be pretty entertaining and worth the money. I waited for years to buy this game and finally decided $8 was as cheap as it was going to get while I still cared. It contains a LOT of throwbacks and references to the books, and the movie and Telltale did a great job with authenticity. Mr. DNA, geothermal power plant, Henry Wu, the lysine contingency, the silly 3D Unix interface, Muldoon, the tour cars, all of that is in the game and again it very much explores a lot of the content that was in the book but not in the movie, like the rides, the aquarium, the underground tunnels, etc.\n\nIf you like Jurassic Park and you like Telltale Games, then you will definitely like this one. Go ahead and pick it up.","December 28, 2014","true","63.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The QTEs are the game play and are poorly designed, poorly implemented, poorly placed, sometimes make no sense and are poorly explained.  Gaming wise JPTG is an epic catastrophe that  deserves it's own pillar in the gaming hall of shame.  This is a work that could of been something much greater.\n\nThe Redeeming:\n\nIf you're a fan of a decent dinosaur tale and don't mind watching the death scene after death scene as you fail QTE after QTE you might want to give it a spin.  Some of the death representations are laughably side splitting and ludicrously enjoyable, so much so that I looked forward to and did not care to fail the QTE sequences.  The dinosaurs are the one awesome and redeeming aspect of JPTG.  They are awesome in every respect.  They look realistic, behave realisticly thanks to their great modelling and animation.  The dinosaurs save Jurassic Park The Game and it is on this one merit that I can recommend what I would otherwise classify as a classic gaming disaster.","July 8, 2013","false","8.8"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","2"

I still liked it, but it's a terrible example of a good game. Though it is no Trespasser, this game does terrible things with the Jurassic Park franchise the least of which being having a blatant Vasquez from Aliens ripoff. As far as story goes, the characters actions and events surrounded them seem to jump dramatically between being painfully predictable (The annoying shmutt with the flashlight's demise.) and utterly devoid of logic. (Raptor knife fight, sitting on a Rexy's face, you get the idea.)\n\nIt's really bizarre how downright bad the storytelling is though, considering Telltales recent endeavors with the Walking Dead and Wolfman series which have been excellent! They seemed to work out all the kinks in their story telling style here. This game is like seeing all the crappy 3rd grade crayon level drawings Leonardo da Vinci must of done before painting the Mona Lisa. On one hand, I'm glad they worked it out so that Walking Dead and Wolfman could be so good, but on the other I wish they didn't butcher Jurassic Park to do it.","December 20, 2013","false","2.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

But not just QTE's, poorly done QTE's.\nIn general, I hate filling a cut scene with some interactive "Press X to not die" but having a whole game hinging on this pathetic excuse for interactivity is down right dreadful.\n\nMy biggest problem with this is that it takes you out of the game. Unlike seeing that you need to move or duck or jump the game shouts at you "You're holding a controller! Press the blue button on the controller to do some special thing!"\n\nAlso, the game's sound is REALLY buggy. In the first scene in the game the audio was bugging out and the characters kept repeating their lines over and over again. Also, there were times when you would hear a strange echo even though there was no reason for one (specially at the end or episode 4).\n\nNow, when I say poorly done I'm not saying that it's just that they are frequent. Nope, they are actually technically poor. When the "Press the X button" icon jumps up on the screen if you mis-press the button it actually immediately fails. This would be a pain enough, but when you're told to move your thumb stick in a direction it's possible to accidentally hit the detection for the wrong direction failing you out.\n\nAlso, for some reason it was decided that the standard fair of QTE's wasn't enough. This game has complex button pressing. Sure, you'll find the average button mashing (press a button a bazillion times until a meter is full) and the button holding (press and hold a button until the meter is full) but this game had the HORRIBLE idea of combining those two so you actually have to hold both bumpers WHILE pumping a button until a meter is full.\n\nThere are also FOUR button combos which if you mis-press any of them in the split second you get to react you die.\n\nMy only happiness came at the end of the credits.\n\nTell Tale is the king of adventure games (second only to double fine) but Jurassic Park the game is something that should have stayed extinct.","December 22, 2013","false","6.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It is full of Quick-Time-Events with a story that smartly expands on that of the movie.\nThe events of Jurassic Park The Game run parallel to those of the first film, starting soon after Dennis Nedry’s unfortunate run-in with the dilophosaurus. While he is out of the picture before the game begins, his can of Barbasol, loaded with dinosaur embryos, plays a major role in the game. Jurassic Park The Game follows a group of survivors left on the island after having missed the evacuation boat during the storm that knocked out the power in the park. These include the park's veterinarian and his visiting daughter, a jilted geneticist who cares more about dinosaurs than people, the mysterious woman sent to steal dinosaur embryos and a few mercenaries to rescue the stragglers.\nEach of the characters has a backstory that the player learns more about as the game progresses, but most of the characters are so unlikable that it is difficult to care.\nJurassic Park The Game consits of two types of sections: action sequences and puzzle sequences. The action sequences consist entirely of quick time events. The worst offenders are the double or triple arrow quick time events. It is unfairly difficult the first time, but then stupidly easy the second time, and it gives the player no satisfaction.\nFollowing the lead of the boring action sequences, the puzzle sequences require virtually no thinking. Most are solved by clicking all the investigate icons until something happens.\nThere are a few graphical glitches, but overall, the environments and the dinosaurs look fine.\nLocations, sound effects and music from the movie are good used.\nI can not recommend it to anybody, except hardcore fans of Jurassic Park. There are a lot of better point and click adventure games.

Aside from that, the story moves along rather smoothly and has some rather interesting ways of puzzle solving as may of Telltales' games do. The animation style is lovely, and I'm rather pleased that there are many different animations depending on the way you make your choices and how you end up dying. Also, this game has an excellent soundtrack, though it uses a lot of the original music from the films.\n\nI would say that the time you're given to make decisions/press action buttons is a bit too short. It's rather difficult to end up with a gold ranking with a lot of the more action packed bits of the game. I can see from my previous playthrough of The Walking Dead series that Telltale has adjusted and made it a bit easier, but it was still extremely frustrating to die so many times.\n\n8/10 from me!\n\nHere's to hoping that Telltale will get the rights to make another game once Jurassic World is out!","February 26, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're limited to mainly quicktime events and point-and-click adventure/puzzle-solving scenarios. It's essentially like Telltale's The Walking Dead, where you're mainly watching an interactive movie, but unlike Telltale's amazing zombie game, many of your choices do not affect how the story will play out.\n\nThe story isn't that great either. Being that its gameplay is rather mediocre, one would expect for the story to make up for it, but it doesn't. Despite expanding on Jurassic Park, the game has an average to low quality of story.\n\nOverall, Telltale's Jurassic Park feels more like a B-movie than an actual game, with the only difference being that every once in a while you need to complete a quicktime event, otherwise you'll be forced to rewind back a couple of seconds and start over.","February 27, 2015","false","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quick-time events chained together by environmental point-and-click puzzles became the Telltale's trademark with the Walking Dead series, but this was their clunky first step in that direction (Telltale had previously only had point-and-click followups or remakes of certain Lucasarts adventure titles) The voice acting tends to swing from good to terrible and the story isn't all that great. It's nice to see more of Isla Nublar than what was seen in the movie, even if it's while you're frantically tapping buttons to run away from a Tyrannosaurus Rex. It ties in clumsily with the movie series, so I guess it's okay it's only partially canon.\nI really only give this my recommendation based on gameplay footage of the final chapter (the point at which Telltale actually started getting the hang of the QTE-based action) where the quick time events really lend themselves to the urgent urgency (If you realize I just quoted Ian Malcolm, good for you) of the situation at hand (Get to the boat, don't get eaten by the motherf*ckin' T-Rex!) and Nima's subplot was nicely done (if you should decide to listen) and worthy of a re-review.\nI give Telltale's Jurassic Park: The Game a 7/10\nIt's not what I wanted out of a Jurassic Park game, it's got its problems, but it manages to get past these obstacles and  expand on the movie's story (even if it isn't canon anymore)  without having to involve the movie's original cast","February 15, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a good game and there are far more failure states then the walking dead or fables games. The controls seem like they were made more for console then PC this is also apparent in the settings you have to change the Res one click at a time I wanted to use my xbox controler. I found that after you start the game with mouse and keyboard, that option is kinda closed, and I am not sure how to change it. it is a little more clunky then the walking dead games and the timing can be tricky but this is not where this game shines.\n\nTell tale is very good at their name. Jurassic park is my favorite movie I have seen it about 100 times I am 25 and I still watch the movies from time to time I have also read the books. This game takes a story I always wondered when I was a kid. and that is, with a park that size there had to be more people on the island then what was in the movie. So what happened to them and how did they get off the island? This game so far is telling that story.

There are three basic scenarios you'll have to deal with, but the combination never clicks. The one closest to Telltale's usual style involves panning the camera around a location, looking for things. You don't have to look very hard, as everything of interest has a big question mark attached, which turns into a magnifying glass so you can click on it. There's no inventory to manage, so all you're really doing is triggering information about the environment or telling characters to open the only door available to them. It looks like a game, but never feels like one.But is more difficult than other Telltales games such as Walking Dead season 1 & 2.\nYou play as 7 diffrent pepole which is nice,but diologe and character personality are very low sadly.The attempts at human drama are also poorly served by a particularly weak visual style. More realistic than the usual cartoon Telltale approach, yet blighted by jerky animation and freakish facial expressions, it's hard to warm to these crude digital puppets and emotional investment in their plight suffers accordingly.You can hardly blame Telltale for trying something different, given the enormous number of licensed games it's undertaking right now, but Jurassic Park has neither the charm nor ingenuity that the studio is known for. Come the end of the four episodes, each lasting roughly an hour, there's just a strange feeling of emptiness. The game is never interactive enough to make it feel like you've survived a thrilling adventure, nor does it inspire any emotional or intellectual engagement with its characters, situations or story.\n\nBut if your a Jurassic Park fan or just love Dinosaurs it's a Must have!♥","June 23, 2015","true","112.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game takes place after Jurassic Park and game foucuses on Jerry Harding.If you think you have heard that name before hes the guy from the sick triceratops scene in Jurassic Park.His character devolpent in this game makes him a pretty good protagonist.The other main chararcters consist of his daughter Jess,a woman who used to live on the island before it became Jurassic Park(her name is Nima),and Billy yoder(the antagonist),and some others.Now as your thinking most likey thinking,yes,there are lots of dinosaurs in this game including the infamous Velociraptors and Dilophasaurus,and last but not least the Tyrannosuarus rex.Now the gameplay.It could be better and theirs not really any major decision making exept for one part which I wont spoil.But aside from that the action parts are really fun and the dialog is pretty interesing.And you cant forget the entertaining death scenes!Now finally the story.To say the least it does feel like im playing a Jurassic Park sequal but in video game form. So overall if you love Jurassic Park you will most likely enjoy this,and if you like telltale,you sould also enjoy this, So overall I give it a 8/10!

They used plenty of references, but for me it fell flat.\n\n- Extremely annoying and unlikeable characters. (the teenager was perhaps the sole exception) If it wasn't for the fact that I wanted to finish the game, I'd root for the dinosaurs instead (also Gerry Harding was a character in the movie, but he doesn't resemble the movie character in appearance/age. Same as above.)\n\n- Frustrating control system that quickly turns into a quick-time-event-fest; for example a simple task such as walking up a set of stairs or doing some swimming strokes, will require you to tap/smash buttons.\nGets  really  tedious very early in the game.\n\n- In relation to previous point, the achievements, if one cares about those (I'm no fanatic, but in general it can be motivating), timing a quick time event wrong, will cause you too lose out on quite a few achievements(requirement of "flawless/without slip ups" in certain segments of the game.)\nThankfully, the game has a checkpoint system of sorts, so you can reload the last checkpoint and try again, but sometimes you will have to replay quite a lot of game time, IF you want the achievement.\nPersonally, after a while I stopped caring and just wanted the  pain  game to end, abandoning potential achievements for what they are, pixels.\n\n- Very little decision making of consequence, usually there is only one path to go, and if you do something wrong, you'll mostly end up dead (at the very least lose out on an achievement). If I'm not mistaken, there are rougly  two  choices that has any bearing on the the story, one of them being a potential alternate ending (I prefer the "bad" ending. Greed is a b*tch).\n\n\nI could go on, but to sum it up, its safe to say that this is a game with  ZERO  replay value (if you want alternate ending, reload one of the last checkpoints only), mostly due to frustrating controls/mechanics, annoying/boring characters, and the fact that this a VERY linear interactive story, were your only job is to keep the characters alive (even if you'd rather see some/all of them to end up as dino fodder...)\n\nDo yourself a favor, save your money and avoid this game, no matter how cheap the prize, its not worth the frustration.\nWatch "Jurassic Park" the movie instead.","January 1, 2015","false","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that this is a Telltale game...\n\nThe game butchers the movie timelines until they are unrecognizable. The tie-ins are way too forced. Especially when generic characters are directly quoting other characters from the movie totally out of the original context. "DODGSON, WE GOT DODGSON HERE." The villain characters so far have been beyond unlikeable... but its not even a realistic kind of unlikeable. Snivelling, stubborn, and largely useless. I hate going through all 4 dialogue options because the jerk I'm yelling at refuses to listen to the first 3 choices. This game feels like it essentially plays itself if not for constant unnecessary QTE's. I've never played such a linear action/adventure game.\n\nSometimes you are required to do a button mashing QTE to lean in closer to a footprint. Or to look at a tree, or to look at anything. I used to complain when playing Heavy Rain that it was too hard to do basic actions like drink a bottle of orange juice, but this game takes the cake and then bakes another cake so it can take that one too.","February 12","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I buckled down and bought this during one of Humble Bundle's sales because it was from Telltale. After becoming familiar with the style of Telltale and their Walking Dead game, I decided to try Jurassic Park out because I happen to enjoy the first film. I'm not a hardcore fan. I can't say one way or another if the game is canon and stays true to the film or the novelization, but I will say as a fan of the first film. I enjoyed this immensely.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect but I wasn't expecting a direct copy of the movie which in my humble opinion it really wasn't. That's a good thing though. Picking up where Dennis left off with the embryos; new contacts were sent to retreive what he had failed to deliver. Meanwhile, there are still other park admins wandering through the park including a father and daughter. The latter left me a little unsettle if you compare it to the film. How could they not know havoc was breaking loose during the time of the storm? In any case, I ignored my curious questions and just rolled with it. By the end of the first episode I was hooked and ended up playing the entire game over four nights to spread out the episodes.\n\nThe graphics were pretty amazing. I thought the dinosaurs looked great..and scary! I thought the designers at Telltale did a fabulous job with that. The soundtrack was wonderfully intune with the movie and the ongoings of scenes. I really couldn't have been happier with this game in regards to that. The puzzles aren't really that hard. Some entry codes, but mostly timed controls of evading dinosaurs and such.\n\nI did not experience any bugs or glitches during game play. I am currently running Windows 8.1 on a 64-bit Intel Core i5 with a NVIDIA Geforce graphics card. Probably outdated to most gamers these days but it worked smoothly for me as does any of Telltale's games.\n\nMy only gripe is the controls. I chose to use the keyboard even though I did have my Xbox 360 connected. I didn't like how the controls were timed. I really was terrible at that. My timing was always off and would usually leave my characters getting mauled by a T-Rex or a Raptor, which in theory was pretty cool anyway so I'm overlooking that. My stats deal the horrible truth of how bad I am at timing controls and how many times I died throughout the game. Still fun watching everyone get eaten.\n\nBottom line is if you like Jurassic Park and you like gaming; give the game a try.\nBuy it on sale. It's only pocket change.\nIf you're bad at control timing, enjoy watching the characters get eaten. It's a hoot.","February 10","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a gaiden, a sidestory, that takes place right after Nedry's death and just seconds before the boat leaves. You have to click things in proper order, talk your way out of situations, time things correctly, and most importantly, remember the facts from the book and movie. That plays a critical role in the game itself. Also, one thing I found very interesting, is that if you have one person interacte with an object in one scene, usually, it'll be a minute before they complete the task you set them out. In that time, you need to switch to a different characters perspective and finish the task. The game can be pretty challenging if you're not paying attention, and down right jumpy. It is choke full of "DON'T GO IN THERE" moments as you recognize areas from the movie and you understand where the dinosaurs are lurking. Pretty scary.

That's a fair way of putting it. I must have gone through this game at least 4 times, and only now do I realize what was wrong with it. This game is divided into 4 chapters, divided amunst at least 3 different writers.\n\nThe first chapter of the game has the most movie line references out of all 4 of the chapters. But it's harmless and fun. It even gives us an eery set up to the troodons, who are the main threat built up through the first 3 parts of the game.\n\nThen we have the second and third chapters written by someone else. I'd say these are the best written sections of the game. The second chapter you'll probably find to be the slowest in terms of pacing. The third chapter, however, is great. And if you get this game, it'll be for this quarter of the game, no doubt.\n\nCharacter development through this point is great. It's probably the only Jurassic Park thing where you'll care about mercenary characters. The plot of the game involves several people getting trapped on the island in tune with the first Jurassic Park, and some iNGen mercs are sent into rescue them. The two we follow on this task, starting with chapter 2, is the wise-cracking Billy Yoder (whose name never gets old to say), and the tatooed muscle, Oscar. The two of them are a great duo, and serve to bring the most fun to the game without making things goofy or tensionless.\n\nThe other characters are fine too. You have one of the zookeepers, Dr. Harding, who serves as the game's protagonist. And he has to look after his trouble-making teenage daughter throughout the game. This serves as our family tie in for the movie, like all of the other movies. Then you have a latino chick whose name slips my memory. She's suppose to be tied to Denis Nedry's steal the dino embryos plot; and as such flips between being a good guy and bad guy. And then there's Dr. Sorkin, one of the head researchers with an animal rights activist side. This doesn't become too annoying until the last chapter.\n\nThe last chapter is where everything falls apart. It was written by someone entirely different from the other 3 sections of the game, and I think he was either the worst pick possible, or he really hated his collegues. Characters take jaring and cartoonishly dumb twists. It ruins the troodons that were built up as creepy, venomous, noctornal and unseen foes into the same dumb mob lizards as everything else. I shouldn't have felt more tension in the triceratops scene, yet I did. Character deaths are unsatisfying. Plans make no sense. If you're wondering who gave Jurassic World the idea for a mosasaurus, it's this game. Only the one in the movie got more screen time. AND NONE OF THE CHARACTERS IN THAT MOVIE HAD TO SWIM IN A TANK WITH IT. Yet chapter 4 of this game made it boring. My favorite character died. Then someone else makes a complete 180 that makes no sense, and they just turn into a Saturday morning villain. The side plot about the dino embryos became more plot centric than it should have been. And we retcon the movies in a way that makes me want to do the same thing to the writer.\n\nI can't speak for everyone. But I'm willing to bet that most of the negative reviews for this game are largly due to the forth and final chapter of this game. Reguardless of it, I'd still recommend this game for the first 3/4's. 75% may be a C, but I'm willing to say its enough. Wait until this game's for around 50% off or more. If you consider Jurassic Park the greatest movie of all time, this one will give you some joy.","November 24, 2015","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Read on for full review to be prepared for this game’s shortfalls.\nFirst the bad points, its SHORT, its only 4 episodes and I complete the story in 8 hours and that was with retrying a few sections over and over again, to try and get a perfect gold award for the quick time events.\nWhich also leads into another bad point, certain quick time events are the standard, press the button the minute it appears on screen, some are, wait until a ring shrinks and goes down and then flashes before pressing the button....now you can imagine and in a game emphasizing speed, quick button pressing, while getting chased by dinos on the screen, instantly just mashes the buttons as they appear only registering that it was a stupid ring version after it its already saying that you missed that quick time event! Another issues, is some you need to pressed one after the other, so for example it might pop up on screen for you to press 'down' and once you press that, it turns instantly into a 'left'. Now 9 times out of 10, this is find you have time to then press the 'left' button but every now and then it only gives you a heartbeat to actually press that second button...so even as your brain is registering 'left' and your finger is pressing 'left' its already said you failed, the only way is to reload and memorising that section and instantly press 'left' after pressing 'down' not even waiting to watch for it to pop up on screen.\nThankfully, it auto saves quite regularly but it still brings us to another issue, now I know this game is basically one long cut-scene but with all this reloading to try and get gold awards you can't skip dialogue! So get ready to hear the same thing over and over again.\nStill if your a fan of the films (which is properly the only reason your looking at this game), then your going to enjoy playing not just another story set in the universe of Jurassic Park but with new characters another perspective from the first film. It gives you references at certain points as to where you are in the timeline of the first film.\nSadly this is all happens in the first episode, as your playing, your characters sleep for the night, when they awake, its implied that the film has now ended, leaving just you guys on the island, now I can understand while this was done, to avoid the issue of why didn’t these two groups ever interact in the film but I'm sure I remember a scene in the film, where a certain group spent the night sleeping in a tree!\nTo me, this feels like a missed opportunity, they could of have more references, maybe stuff that happens in the film interferes in this game characters chances for escape, for example turning the power back on for the fences, could of prevented the characters in the game from linking up with the film characters.\n*Slight spoiler alert!*\nIt also could have made the first episode be stretched out to last 2 or 3 episodes, as sadly the 2nd episode of this is properly the weakest! It introduces more new characters but you’re sat there thinking what are they doing?! Why are they fighting amongst themselves?! And then your like, why aren’t they leaving when they've got the chance?!\nThankfully episode 3 and 4 are better, again its them struggling to either be rescued or get off the island, it almost feels like two different stories if it wasn’t for the episode 2 linking episode 1 and 3/4 together.\nStill I enjoyed and to repeat my opening statement, if you like Telltales games and Jurassic Park then you’ll probably enjoy too but only get if and when it’s on Sale.","December 1, 2015","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jasyla/recommended/201830/","jasyla","Jasyla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jasyla/","199 products in account","Jurassic Park: The Game was developed by Telltale and released in 2011. I’ve been slowly playing my way through it over a number of months. It’s not a long game but it’s well-suited to being played in small doses.\n\nFirst, I have to say, I love the movie Jurassic Park. It’s one of the rare things from childhood that isn’t solely enjoyed through a lens of nostalgia-tinted glasses. It’s still an exceptional experience for me now. So I might have a better opinion of the game than others who aren’t so taken with it.\n\nJurassic Park: The Game takes place within the timeline of the first movie, but with completely new characters. When Nedry doesn’t make it to the boat with the dino embryos, a mercenary is sent to retrieve them. Other major characters include the park veterinarian and his daughter and some more mercenaries, sent in by InGen to rescue the people remaining in the park. You play all of these characters – a total of 6 of them – at some point during the game, and the transitions between characters are seamless. Perhaps a little too seamless, as it was sometimes hard to tell when a switch had happened.\n\nThough the story isn’t anything exceptional, it’s true to the spirit of the movie. People being awestruck by dinosaurs and surviving attacks is pretty much the point. The writers are able to create a good amount of tension as each of the main characters have their own, often conflicting motivations. The dialogue sounds natural and the voice acting is competent. The environments are also well done, using replicas of the scenes from the movie, along with some new areas.\n\nWhile this game adheres to Telltale’s general oeuvre, it’s also quite different from the more recent releases. The story isn’t as strong, so I didn’t grow attached to any of the characters as I did in The Walking Dead. As a result, JP isn’t soul-crushing like many of the later Telltale Games. It doesn’t make you love characters over the course of a game only to kill them in front of you and make you think it’s your fault for bad decision making. There are decisions to be made, but they aren’t difficult and rarely have the same weight or consequences as a decision in TWD.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, I found JP to be a lot more fun than TWD or A Wolf Among Us. Now, I am someone who likes quick time events, so if you don’t you can take this with a grain of salt. JP felt more game-y than the recent Telltale games. There were many more places where you could fail, and more puzzles too. The QTEs could often be quite unforgiving, requiring some very fast twitch reactions, though not every failure resulted in death. There’s a medal system for each scenario. No mistakes gave you gold, while if you made many mistakes you could end up with a bronze or no medal at all. These medals didn’t seem to impact anything other than my pride though.  If you fail a critical event, your character dies, but not permanently, you just have to redo it until you succeed.\n\nThough the story and characters aren’t particularly memorable, I enjoyed my time in Jurassic Park. The 4 chapters in the game took a total of about 7-8 hours to complete. I do recommend using a gamepad if you’re playing this on PC, it made the QTEs (with one notable exception) much easier.\n\nRating: 7/10 – A fun game that captures the spirit of Jurassic Park with a lot of dinosaurs and fast-paced action sequences. Unless you don’t like quick-time events, then you should skip this one.","November 27, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story, being one of Telltale's early efforts, was enough to keep me interested. Characters weren't terrible but certainly not memorable like they are in The Walking Dead.\n\nThe actual playthrough was awful for me though, cutscenes kept starting and stopping, the audio was off a lot of the time, the quicktime events were buggy as hell and sometimes my cursor was missing - all leading to frustration when I was in the middle of trying to avoid getting eaten by dinos. I died more than I should have because of this and it was only because I like seeing things through to the end that I pressed on.\n\nIt showed promise, I guess for the games that came after it. I am glad I played it as it showed me a lot of how Telltale developed, both from their early gameplay and character development.\n\nHonestly, unless you are a really big fan of Telltale or Jurassic Park though, I can't recommend it.","December 7, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are three basic scenarios you'll have to deal with, but the combination never clicks. The one closest to Telltale's usual style involves panning the camera around a location, looking for things. You don't have to look very hard, as everything of interest has a big question mark attached, which turns into a magnifying glass so you can click on it. There's no inventory to manage, so all you're really doing is triggering information about the environment or telling characters to open the only door available to them. It looks like a game, but never feels like one.But is more difficult than other Telltales games such as Walking Dead season 1 & 2.\nYou play as 7 diffrent pepole which is nice,but diologe and character personality are very low sadly.The attempts at human drama are also poorly served by a particularly weak visual style. More realistic than the usual cartoon Telltale approach, yet blighted by jerky animation and freakish facial expressions, it's hard to warm to these crude digital puppets and emotional investment in their plight suffers accordingly.You can hardly blame Telltale for trying something different, given the enormous number of licensed games it's undertaking right now, but Jurassic Park has neither the charm nor ingenuity that the studio is known for. Come the end of the four episodes, each lasting roughly an hour, there's just a strange feeling of emptiness. The game is never interactive enough to make it feel like you've survived a thrilling adventure, nor does it inspire any emotional or intellectual engagement with its characters, situations or story.\n\nBut if your a Jurassic Park fan or just love Dinosaurs it's a Must have!♥","June 23, 2015","true","112.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The quicktime events (if you can call them that) require you to respond within a timeframe that I'm convinced isn't humanly possible except if you: a) memorize the sequence or b) button mash DWAS. The face modeling of reactions and emotions is horrid. Lastly, they have a few bugs to work out with the game suddenly quitting the scenario on you unless you decide to exhaust every possible option on getting back to where you were.\n\nWith the negative out of the way I will say this. The journal entries (which are not even part of the gameplay) do a good job of covering up the reasons for why the dinosaurs aren't 100% scientifically faithful. The reasons are well within the story's parameters. The voice acting is also decent at best. However, this two pretty details do not make up for the absolute destitute garbage that is the rest of the game. This game had so much potential but I can't shake the feeling that it was rushed for the sake of catching the media furor that came with the announcement of the Jurassic World.\n","June 29, 2015","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And have you played any of their recent efforts like The Walking Dead S2, The Wolf Among Us or Tales from the Borderlands?\n\nEver wondered what happened in between? Well, the answer is: This happened. This very game here. And as such it is a piece of gaming history I would say.\n\nBut first things first! As it is, Jurassic Park finds itself in a position which made it a weird game when it came out but also makes it a weird game nowadays. For completely different reasons. How singular is that? I don’t know, but probably very.\n\nWhen it was released it was a game that had thrown out almost all the things that make a Point 'n Click adventure. No inventory, no items, no walking around, no wild clicking on various things to find solutions to riddles you weren’t even fully aware you were actually trying to solve, very view traditional riddles in general, no manual saving and worst of all no clicking on the same thing dozens of times to hear all the audio bits. Instead it had quicktime events, eventing quicktimes and quickeventing times. And barely anything else…\n\nAnd we all said: What’s this supposed to be?\n\nNowadays, after we have played TWD2, TWAU, TotB and probably even Game of Thrones, we find that it has waaaaaay to much gameplay and not enough swearing, walking around in areas, making decisions that ultimately may or may not mean anything and broken, down-trodden characters.\n\nAnd we all say: What were they thinking? This dino game is one of the most annoying pieces of software I’ve ever played!\n\nNow, as a piece of history I think it is fine to play it. Especially so if you’re interested in the development of narrative driven games of the kind that Telltale makes today. It’s interesting to see that the ♥♥♥♥ed up characters (if a bit tame though) were already at a place where the gameplay had yet to follow. I was really surprised to see that they even had a child character here that wasn't enervating as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnd as a game on its own? Well, if you like the movie Jurassic Park, this is great. It’s tied in very, very closely to the events of the movie and expands on quite a few things. The writing is mostly decent or even good, although some parts are brow knottingly silly. But DO NOT expect a classic adventure or a modern Telltale game. Really, do not. So it follows that if you want either such an adventure game or a modern Telltale game then don’t buy this either. It’s neither of those.\n\nI think you can pay 5 dollars or so for it. That’s money well spent for this oddity of gaming history.","July 5, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other major characters include the park veterinarian and his daughter and some more mercenaries, sent in by InGen to rescue the people remaining in the park. You play all of these characters – a total of 6 of them – at some point during the game, and the transitions between characters are seamless. Perhaps a little too seamless, as it was sometimes hard to tell when a switch had happened.\n\nThough the story isn’t anything exceptional, it’s true to the spirit of the movie. People being awestruck by dinosaurs and surviving attacks is pretty much the point. The writers are able to create a good amount of tension as each of the main characters have their own, often conflicting motivations. The dialogue sounds natural and the voice acting is competent. The environments are also well done, using replicas of the scenes from the movie, along with some new areas.\n\nWhile this game adheres to Telltale’s general oeuvre, it’s also quite different from the more recent releases. The story isn’t as strong, so I didn’t grow attached to any of the characters as I did in The Walking Dead. As a result, JP isn’t soul-crushing like many of the later Telltale Games. It doesn’t make you love characters over the course of a game only to kill them in front of you and make you think it’s your fault for bad decision making. There are decisions to be made, but they aren’t difficult and rarely have the same weight or consequences as a decision in TWD.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, I found JP to be a lot more fun than TWD or A Wolf Among Us. Now, I am someone who likes quick time events, so if you don’t you can take this with a grain of salt. JP felt more game-y than the recent Telltale games. There were many more places where you could fail, and more puzzles too. The QTEs could often be quite unforgiving, requiring some very fast twitch reactions, though not every failure resulted in death. There’s a medal system for each scenario. No mistakes gave you gold, while if you made many mistakes you could end up with a bronze or no medal at all. These medals didn’t seem to impact anything other than my pride though.  If you fail a critical event, your character dies, but not permanently, you just have to redo it until you succeed.\n\nThough the story and characters aren’t particularly memorable, I enjoyed my time in Jurassic Park. The 4 chapters in the game took a total of about 7-8 hours to complete. I do recommend using a gamepad if you’re playing this on PC, it made the QTEs (with one notable exception) much easier.\n\nRating: 7/10 – A fun game that captures the spirit of Jurassic Park with a lot of dinosaurs and fast-paced action sequences. Unless you don’t like quick-time events, then you should skip this one.","November 27, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story, being one of Telltale's early efforts, was enough to keep me interested. Characters weren't terrible but certainly not memorable like they are in The Walking Dead.\n\nThe actual playthrough was awful for me though, cutscenes kept starting and stopping, the audio was off a lot of the time, the quicktime events were buggy as hell and sometimes my cursor was missing - all leading to frustration when I was in the middle of trying to avoid getting eaten by dinos. I died more than I should have because of this and it was only because I like seeing things through to the end that I pressed on.\n\nIt showed promise, I guess for the games that came after it. I am glad I played it as it showed me a lot of how Telltale developed, both from their early gameplay and character development.\n\nHonestly, unless you are a really big fan of Telltale or Jurassic Park though, I can't recommend it.","December 7, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They used plenty of references, but for me it fell flat.\n\n- Extremely annoying and unlikeable characters. (the teenager was perhaps the sole exception) If it wasn't for the fact that I wanted to finish the game, I'd root for the dinosaurs instead (also Gerry Harding was a character in the movie, but he doesn't resemble the movie character in appearance/age. Same as above.)\n\n- Frustrating control system that quickly turns into a quick-time-event-fest; for example a simple task such as walking up a set of stairs or doing some swimming strokes, will require you to tap/smash buttons.\nGets  really  tedious very early in the game.\n\n- In relation to previous point, the achievements, if one cares about those (I'm no fanatic, but in general it can be motivating), timing a quick time event wrong, will cause you too lose out on quite a few achievements(requirement of "flawless/without slip ups" in certain segments of the game.)\nThankfully, the game has a checkpoint system of sorts, so you can reload the last checkpoint and try again, but sometimes you will have to replay quite a lot of game time, IF you want the achievement.\nPersonally, after a while I stopped caring and just wanted the  pain  game to end, abandoning potential achievements for what they are, pixels.\n\n- Very little decision making of consequence, usually there is only one path to go, and if you do something wrong, you'll mostly end up dead (at the very least lose out on an achievement). If I'm not mistaken, there are rougly  two  choices that has any bearing on the the story, one of them being a potential alternate ending (I prefer the "bad" ending. Greed is a b*tch).\n\n\nI could go on, but to sum it up, its safe to say that this is a game with  ZERO  replay value (if you want alternate ending, reload one of the last checkpoints only), mostly due to frustrating controls/mechanics, annoying/boring characters, and the fact that this a VERY linear interactive story, were your only job is to keep the characters alive (even if you'd rather see some/all of them to end up as dino fodder...)\n\nDo yourself a favor, save your money and avoid this game, no matter how cheap the prize, its not worth the frustration.\nWatch "Jurassic Park" the movie instead.","January 1, 2015","false","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are game problems. These include minor issues, such as choosing the resolution sets the resolution at the same time, so if you're at say 640x480, and you want to get to 1920x1080, your monitor is going to pass through about 15 resolutions before you get there. This is annoying and there is no need for it, and should really be patched out.\n\nSpace, for some crazy reason, functions like the escape key in most games. The game is poorly optimised so if you happen to press it, expect a good 5 seconds until you're back in the game.\n\nMany a time for whatever reason the mouse icon was lost off the screen. Sometimes the only way to fix it was to quit the game entirely.\n\nThe plot and storyline is, passable, but not as brilliant as say, the remarkable Wolf Among Us or Walking Dead series.\n\nBut the quick time events. Oh man. The QTEs are where the fault in this game is 100%. Even with all the other problems, they pale into insignificance to the problem of the QTEs.\n\nThe QTEs have compound buttons on many occasions, such as Left then Down. However, the timing is instant, so if you don't hit it straight away, you fail. The game does not give you enough time to actually see the QTE before failing the QTE, and a single fail means you lose "Gold" rating. Further, these all occour in the high action story points of the game.\n\nSo what should be the action highlights of the game, the fun sequences, just leave you frustrated and angered as you see fail after fail and reload trying for that Gold and perfect QTE sequence. You'll start to repeat the mantra. Right down right right up up down right as you memorise a level's QTEs for the gold. Finish it and then move onto the next level to start again. Left up left down right up right......\n\nPoorly executed game with some of the worst QTEs that I've ever seen in gaming. Only for dedicated Jurassic Park fans.

A misstep, an unfortunate footnote in Telltale's path to greatness. While undeniably not as polished as, say, The Walking Dead, it is absolutely worth playing if you're a serious fan of either Telltale or the Jurassic Park franchise.\n\nTHE STORY\nThe Game takes the ending of the first Jurassic Park movie to some interesting places with the story of those left behind after Hammond & Co. were evacuated. Some of the philosophical questions of genetic engineering that get brushed past in the movie are given a lot more consideration here. The characters are mostly well-drawn and develop in interesting and unexpected ways as the game goes on. There's even a kid in it who isn't completely annoying! More than can be said for most of the movies. The affection and respect the dev team had for the franchise is apparent all the details they get right, from the Isla Nublar-shaped road signs and InGen-logoed steam pipes to the dinosaur sounds and music cues lifted straight from the movie. There are a few ideas in The Game borrowed from other parts of the JP universe, including Michael Crichton's books, which is fun to see. There's even a journal with unlockable content that charmingly retcons some of the paleontological inaccuracies of the first movie.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\nThere are a lot more quicktime events than in later Telltale games. It arguably suits the action-oriented JP franchise but yes, it can be a little frustrating, especially if you're an achievement completionist trying to perfect every "scenario". The action scenes feel genuinely thrilling, though. The puzzle sections aren't as hard as the QTEs and are fairly intuitive to figure out.\n\nPRESENTATION\nThere are a few quirks that mark this as a learning experience for Telltale. There are some odd volume glitches. The graphics aren't cutting-edge, even for a 2011 point-and-click adventure. The graphics settings menu, bizarrely, requires you to change the screen resolution as you cycle through the options. The most irritating thing may be that when retrying the QTE scenarios to get better medals some of them dump you in way before any action starts. You have to sit through minutes of cutscene before you get to try again. Grrr. None of this is game-breaking, though. The voice acting, crucially, is top-notch, supporting a well-written script. The animation of the dinosaurs and motion-captured humans is pretty good (for a game of its type - we're not talking CryEngine stuff here) and the cinematography is engaging and cinematic, if not quite Spielbergian.\n\nIn summary, Jurassic Park: The Game is better than you've heard. I can't recommend it to the casual gamer who gets easily frustrated with QTE/narrative-based games but If you've played Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones it's worth going back to see this step in the evolution of Telltale Games. And if you're a big Jurassic Park fan it comes highly recommended, expanding on the lore in much more interesting and mature ways than the Jurassic World movie did.

I played the whole thing, but found that the story kept getting worse from episode to episode. No doubt, I still enjoyed playing it, since I've always been a big fan of the movies. If you can get it on sale and you like the movies, then go for it. I would not recommend it for full price. Episode one, was the most enjoyable and had the most similarities to the movie. That said, I think the storyline is often very farfetched and unbelievable. This may have something to do with each episode being directed by different people.","October 11, 2015","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, depending on how the game is played, and how much skill one has in the realm of quick time decision making, the game can get a little jumbled.\n\nI will start off by saying that I really do enjoy the game, and it has been a fairly entertaining experience, the parallel story presented in this game along side the events of Jurassic Park (1993) works fairly well. The game has a nice atmosphere and it looks good most of the time. I also find that the characters are pretty likeable, and the dialogue is fairly fluent and natural sounding as well. Though there are some continuity and contradiction issues in regard to the dialogue, nothing too distracting, however.\n\nThe game isn't exactly perfect. Instant respawns on death with little to no penalty give minimal consequence to actions, something that another more recent title, Until Dawn, exceeds at, leaving me feeling a little disappointed. Since I pretty much suck at all quick-time-event games, dying really distrupts the flow of the game at certain points as well.  The actual gameplay during action sequences can get a little sketchy too, I found that I died at least ten times in roughly two minutes, this may be attributed to the fact that I am really not that great at qte.\n\nOverall, I believe that the positives outweigh the negatives (some of which are purely situational) in Jurassic Park: The Game, and the gameplay isn't really that bad, I enjoyed some of the light mystery solving, and of course, the dinosaurs. I don't think that this game is worth its full price however, I got it 75% off.  I think anyone who likes a decent story and is a fan of the film will enjoy this title.\n\n7/10","October 10, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a gaiden, a sidestory, that takes place right after Nedry's death and just seconds before the boat leaves. You have to click things in proper order, talk your way out of situations, time things correctly, and most importantly, remember the facts from the book and movie. That plays a critical role in the game itself. Also, one thing I found very interesting, is that if you have one person interacte with an object in one scene, usually, it'll be a minute before they complete the task you set them out. In that time, you need to switch to a different characters perspective and finish the task. The game can be pretty challenging if you're not paying attention, and down right jumpy. It is choke full of "DON'T GO IN THERE" moments as you recognize areas from the movie and you understand where the dinosaurs are lurking. Pretty scary.

The nods to the 1993 film, the minimal cross-over, (although to be honest I wanted more,) the plot and the action are all good. The plot is actually pretty much what I thought "The Lost World" would be when I was a kid and went to see that. The dialogue seems kind of hammy at first but admittedly gives the feel of early-90s Spielberg. But while some of the problem-solving puzzles are fun enough, having an action scene being basically ruined by being forced to hit keys at various times just isn't fun and doesn't make you feel any more involved in the action.

It picks up moments before the ending of the first movie. The game itself is focused on the story and gameplay elemtents mainly consists of puzzels, looking around and picking dialogue options. The story itself seems to be abit more lineair then the more recent telltale titles like The Walking Dead, but it still has various dialogue options. The more frantic moments are accompanied by quick time events. Those QTE's are sometimes a bit too abrupt, and not very clear to me untill after my character got mulched to bits (but rarely).

One of these reviews were its hard to say positive or negative, its right between.\n\nPros:\n\n+ an original story\n+ interesting characters\n+ to a degree interactive\n+ cool action scenes\n+ alternative ending\n+ controller support\n+ Nvidia 3D is fantastic!\n+ a lenghty story with 7,5 hours. Compare this to a 2 hour movie with the same price tagg, you definitely get your moneys worth (for a sale price at least)\n\nCons:\n\n- 28€? I think thats too expensive, but on the other hand a blueray costs the same amount for less content. At sale its perfect\n- QTEs timeframes are sometimes extremely short and impossible to get on the first try\n- the rating system (bronze, silver, gold) is kinda pointless. I just wanna enjoy the story and its very distracting and only worsen the experience of enjoying the adventure and story\n- some plotholes, but most movies have some\n- ....its more a movie than a game, even though it has "Game" in the title its totally another movie.\n- almost no choice throughout the whole movie. Its just QTEs and pressing the right buttons to progress, not to make choices. They trick you with dialouge choices, but they dont matter at all. Sometimes you can even fail a QTE and the movie will still go on, just downgrading your rank (bronze, silver, gold) kinda disappointing\n- buggs.....not too bad but you will also notice some stutters and hang ups, but never game breaking\n- puzzles are a nice idea, but executed badly. Its more rewarding to just guess around than to actually think about the situation\n\nOverall I still recommend this "game" in a sale. If you see it as just another action oriented Jurassic Park movie, I think its really cool. Nice cliffhangers between episodes will want you to keep on watching. They also throw in some stuff that only hardcore JP fans will notice, I really appreciated that.

The game takes place after Jurassic Park and game foucuses on Jerry Harding.If you think you have heard that name before hes the guy from the sick triceratops scene in Jurassic Park.His character devolpent in this game makes him a pretty good protagonist.The other main chararcters consist of his daughter Jess,a woman who used to live on the island before it became Jurassic Park(her name is Nima),and Billy yoder(the antagonist),and some others.Now as your thinking most likey thinking,yes,there are lots of dinosaurs in this game including the infamous Velociraptors and Dilophasaurus,and last but not least the Tyrannosuarus rex.Now the gameplay.It could be better and theirs not really any major decision making exept for one part which I wont spoil.But aside from that the action parts are really fun and the dialog is pretty interesing.And you cant forget the entertaining death scenes!Now finally the story.To say the least it does feel like im playing a Jurassic Park sequal but in video game form. So overall if you love Jurassic Park you will most likely enjoy this,and if you like telltale,you sould also enjoy this, So overall I give it a 8/10!

The story, being one of Telltale's early efforts, was enough to keep me interested. Characters weren't terrible but certainly not memorable like they are in The Walking Dead.\n\nThe actual playthrough was awful for me though, cutscenes kept starting and stopping, the audio was off a lot of the time, the quicktime events were buggy as hell and sometimes my cursor was missing - all leading to frustration when I was in the middle of trying to avoid getting eaten by dinos. I died more than I should have because of this and it was only because I like seeing things through to the end that I pressed on.\n\nIt showed promise, I guess for the games that came after it. I am glad I played it as it showed me a lot of how Telltale developed, both from their early gameplay and character development.\n\nHonestly, unless you are a really big fan of Telltale or Jurassic Park though, I can't recommend it.","December 7, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Jurassic Park: The Game by Telltale Games lacks many of the qualities that have made their more recent games so successful, but when viewed by itself; stands as a solid dinosaur-themed adventure.\n\nExpect something akin to a visual novel with button rhythm elements and plenty of tension.  You could likely play through the story in approximately 6 hours, but you'll get a lot more out of your purchase if you're an achievement junky.  There are some bugs that aren't going to go away and some of them inadvertently make achievement hunting more frustrating than it should be, but it's far from game-breaking.  The going rate of $19.99 is probably asking too much at this point, but for $8.00 or so this is a worthwhile pick-up for anyone who likes to be chased by dinos and/or prefers their games heavy on story-telling.","April 24","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So super shortened version:\n\n6-8hrs of Gameplay to complete\n\nGame is awesome so long as you don't mind controller input error being a thing (if you don't press it 100% DIRECTLY Right when it says "R analog >" it will count it wrong 90% of the time.. there's no sensativity setting to fix this) then you'll be happy with this game.  That being said, with the occasional input error, you get to see a lot of the awesome death sequences you wouldn't otherwise see, a lot of them are really well done and intense ^_^ #silverliningboys)\n\nMake sure you talk to the people with the R-Trigger when available otherwise the story/characters might feel bland.  Remember, in Telltale games, YOU control the story being told.  Dialog is important; explore it.\n\nI got emotionally attached to the characters.  Experienced joy, frustration, worry, edge of my seat intense moments.\n\nSoundtrack, scenery, voice acting = immersive and fine as butts ^_^\n\nCaters to the fans of the original movie, but isn't JUST for fans of the original movie, because it can easily stand alone as it's own story.\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying it at full price (because of the controller input issues being potentially very frustrating to some people), but definitely pick it up during a sale.\n\n*Should be noted, it doesn't recap your stats or story at the end like some of the other Telltale games does, which is disappointing, I wanted to know how many times I died to the button boss.*","April 27","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story told in the setting of the Jurassic Park movie/book is origingal, though completely based around the well-known and loved story. As far as I could tell, not many choices actually change the story other than some dialog options and sadly it doesn't let you compare your choices to those of others. It's an adventure game, meaning that it's really based on story more than skill, though sometimes pressing buttons exactly right required me to try several times (I did a lot of dying). There are also fun acheievements to unlock as you go to keep things interesting. I'd say that compared to The Walking Dead games by Telltale, which I gave 5/5 stars, this gets a 4/5 stars. It's super fun and definitately intense, though there were only a few moral dilemas. I felt like some of the "puzzles" one had to solve were just space/time fillers, but then again, I dislike puzzles and prefer drama more. It kind of felt like we were forced into various puzzles that felt silly.\nBottom line: I recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games that are based on story, adventures, and thrills.","April 30","true","79.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The former changes locations and the latter must be pressed AFTER the otuer circle connects with the inner circle.

I didn't care for the fact that at times the game didn't catch the that i pressed the correct button because it was loading or saving but other than that a typical telltale game..Good voice actors, good story made up for the junky graphics and kind of junky mechanics..They even showed us the dead and eaten dennis nedry , guess he didn't say the magic word to the dinosaur before being eaten..","May 1","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story told in the setting of the Jurassic Park movie/book is origingal, though completely based around the well-known and loved story. As far as I could tell, not many choices actually change the story other than some dialog options and sadly it doesn't let you compare your choices to those of others. It's an adventure game, meaning that it's really based on story more than skill, though sometimes pressing buttons exactly right required me to try several times (I did a lot of dying). There are also fun acheievements to unlock as you go to keep things interesting. I'd say that compared to The Walking Dead games by Telltale, which I gave 5/5 stars, this gets a 4/5 stars. It's super fun and definitately intense, though there were only a few moral dilemas. I felt like some of the "puzzles" one had to solve were just space/time fillers, but then again, I dislike puzzles and prefer drama more. It kind of felt like we were forced into various puzzles that felt silly.\nBottom line: I recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games that are based on story, adventures, and thrills.","April 30","true","79.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not sure how much they paid, but it must have been a large sum.\n\nThe game itself likely lasts around 2 hours, however you will spend six hours on it due lengthy animations retrying to get past death scenes.\n\n90% of the story is a stretch. For example, you unlock a locked, key-coded door by placing a picture on a wall.\n\nNoone in this game actually had to die if they would have waited around for dinos to leave.\n\nThis game made me more misogynistic.\n\nOnly reason I suggest this game is because you are probably bored looking for a game to fill the void that BF2 predecessors left.\n\nGet this through Humble Bundle.\n\nWorth $5-10 tops.","May 4","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Once you're able to get around the first major bug (cursor disappearing and refusing to come back without either reloading or restarting the game), then the minor bug (cursor disappearing) in the rest of the game is a cakewalk. It would be nice to get the bug fixed.\n\nHowever, I liked that this was based around Jurassic Park and loved how it connected itself to the movie. I would definitely buy this game ONLY if you can get a really good deal and HIGHLY recommend reading the discussion boards to help with the bugs. Although, if you don't want to be bothered by bugs, I'd pass on this game.","May 3","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you look past that, it's a big quicktime event mess with sometimes ridiculous moments. And the one thing that Telltale games are based around - the story is generic and forgettable.

There's a few minor bugs throughout - very rarely the voice audio would spike in volume for a second, and a couple of times the camera jumped around in an unexpected way - but nothing that prevented me from becoming engrossed in the story and gameplay.

I would like to say it lives upto the Telltale standards, but it does not, which is fine, because I do believe it is an earlier effort at making story games from franchises. Regardless, it is a reasonably fun game though not that deep in terms of character development and writing.","May 16","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a hardcore fan of the novels and movies, I feel Telltale have horribly ruined the concept of Jurassic Park. I cringed the entire way through this very long cartoon. So disappointed in this game.\n\n--> The graphics is like I said, a cartoon.\n\n--> The animation is really bad. I mean REALLY bad. It's still VERY glitchy.\n\n--> The dinosaurs are portrayed as unrealistically stupid and slow. This goes especially for the raptors and T-rex.\n\n--> The writing behind this game is a joke.\n\n--> Quick Time Events are the devil. This type of gameplay forces you to become disengaged from the story since you are constantly on edge in case you miss a button press. (If they show, still buggy)\n\nThe game is basically a cartoon to watch. There's no control. It's entirely QTE. You might as well watch this on YouTube.\n\nTo save youself some money, watch the game here. It's pretty much the same thing:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7O7hiJnPHUM","November 17, 2015","false","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
