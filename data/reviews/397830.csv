All you need to do in this game is seek crystal into dungeons. Everytime you load a map you have a timer so you need to rush to find crystals to restart the map and create a bigger one. Repeat this as much as you find this fun.\n\nI lasted 1 hour.","January 14","false","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
