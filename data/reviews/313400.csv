Picture a bullet hell shooter drenched in futuristic neon blue which fully rotates at the press of a button, existing in three dimensions as you fly sideways through waves of enemies while trying to keep up with the madness on screen.\n\nThe number of systems and mechanics at work at any given time in Revolver is in itself intimidating, which when paired with its genre-typical difficulty level and the added intensity of a third dimension, can feel like borderline excess for the sake of it. But Revolver pulls it all off because underneath the inscrutable exterior there’s a very deep, developed formula at work, all focused around an elaborate shooting and scoring system that is only as invasive as you want it to be.\n\nDifferent types of shots affect different enemies, various meters are raised by particular stimuli, and multiple paths through levels create even more room for experimentation. Revolver fully commits itself to being as complex and unique as possible within the capabilities of its systems, and while this means it’s likely the least accessible shoot’em’up I’ve played in a very long time, its desire to nurture and expand the boundaries of advanced play feels like a justified trade off.\n\nRevolver expresses this best in its challenge mode, which features 50 quick, extremely focused missions which give you a specific task to complete in a short period of time. To me these felt less like fun bonuses to the main game, but rather a comprehensive tutorial detailing the minutia of Revolver’s intricate mechanics and how best to use them. This is accomplished through the challenges themselves, and also the contextual hint system which drip feeds you information in a way that is much easier to parse given you can immediately apply it to an appropriate situation.\n\nReturning to Revolver’s main stages after completing a number of these, I was surprised just how much more I understood about the game I had already beaten once, and how significantly more capable that had made me where simply reading a manual and playing the game had not. I also began to appreciate all the little things I hadn’t even noticed before, like the finer points of the scoring system or how to best utilize the rotation feature to line up enemies, which further solidified in me the idea that Revolver had fully thought through each of its mechanics and the interplay that develops between them. The more I was able to understand the more I enjoyed playing, and it made me wish that other games would be as thorough in their initiations.\n\nBut even if you aren’t interested in getting deep into Revolver’s metagame it’s still a fascinating beast of a bullet hell shooter to play around with. Rotating your ship is an ingenious hook that somehow never manages to feel clumsy or obscure important information (an even more impressive task when put up against Revolver’s brainmelting cyberpunk visual style).\n\nIt’s a “cool” that didn’t need explaining; a “cool” which leaked out of the screen like a kettle getting ready to blow its top and told me that I better get ready. And then the game started and all pretenses of restraint evaporated as Revolver boldly declared that it wasn’t going to settle for being just enough shoot’em’up and neither should you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW_Tr5E-yts\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 15, 2015","true","2.6"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","36","38","0","0"

The central "gimmick" here is that you can rotate the battlefield through 360 degrees to evade bullets and concentrate firepower etc. Whilst this seems like a simple idea, in practice it is one of the most inventful, unique and genuinley challenging shmups I've played for maybe 20 years. Grab it for less than a fiver if you like old skool shooters.

Ikaruga's wilder, more futuristic cousin I think. That's a good place to start when discussing RE:ACTOR. From Cross Eaglet, this bullet hell shmup takes a simple premise and adds a unique mechanic, instead of polarity, you're dealing with rotation. The field of play can be rotated along a 360 degree axis around your ship. In effect, you're flying through a "cylinder" as opposed to a flat playfield as is often the case, with enemies swirling all around you, and the landscape forming a three dimensional tube that often branches and splits, with numerous junctions appearing that will allow you to choose your route (this offers -immense- replayability as you high score hunt or figure out new routes through various stages).\n\nAs you rotate the field of view, the bullets also rotate, so a near impossible field to navigate suddenly becomes a flat line that's easy to dodge, and all of a sudden the game forces you to think in three dimensions, with objects often coming at you from "depth" as well as from the top, sides, front and back. It would be a bit easy to lose track were it not for the utterly gorgeous aesthetic which keeps things simple and easy to keep track of. Everything is presented in a washed out, futuristic neon blue, clean lines and clear presentation keep the game running at a flawless 60fps no matter what you're doing, with everything maxed out on my rig the game looks nothing short of artistic (Oh god please let there be an occulus rift option down the line).\n\nAs is the norm for such japanese bullet hell games, the music is energetic, electronic and upbeat, it maintains a strong pace and a good sense of place, but isn't exactly going to reach the heady heights that Ikaruga managed (but then nothing is ever going to manage the soundscape of Ikaruga, let's be fair). It's good enough though, as is the sound effects, which do the job with satisfying explosions and gun noises, everything sounds correct, which is really all that needs to be said. You don't buy these games for the sound, but it's good to see that Cross Eaglet got everything lined up and the sound presentation is clearly up to spec.\n\nWhat makes this game stand out is the rotational mechanic, which is nothing short of inspired, it imposes a learning curve, and with an Xbox or PS pad, you'll be wise to map it to the shoulder buttons, but after half an hour of getting used to it, you'll be swooping back and forth like a pro, and the game opens up, once you make it past the opening stage, you'll then find junctions everywhere, and you'll be able to navigate through a gorgeous cityscape.\n\nIt's hard, as any good bullet hell should be, but it's worth every second of your attention, offering visual and gameplay delights as you duck and weave your way through a constant barrage of firepower. Each boss makes full use of the rotation mechanic too, forcing you to quickly improvise and adjust to the constant incoming flak that they toss your way, and within a few goes, rotating will be second nature, you may even look at other bullet hells and feel a little... lacking... when you try to change perspective and find you can't.\n\nAt this price, it's an absolute steal as well, for what you are paying for, you're getting one of the best experiences since Ikaruga, if you're a fan of the shmup genre, this is an easy sell, if you're new to the genre, getting this and Ikaruga should be high on your priority list. Both of these games are well worth your attention.","October 25, 2014","true","1.9"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","36","50","0","1"

I don't always manage to complete all of the highest regarded ones. The best just feel awesome to play, though.\n\nThis game has a silly name but the triggers (if on a controller) rotate the screen around the action. This lets you turn a screen full of bullets into a single line and then use a laser to blast the bullets apart for points. It sounds like a gimmick but it's a lot of fun and provides a really interesting challenge and a one of the most fun and unique scoring systems I've seen.\n\nThe rotation mechanic is also important because you auto-kill items and enemies that are in the background, which you can only see/target if you are rotated a certain way. There are sections where you have to keep your screen facing "forward" to destroy obstacles in the way, while balancing the need to rotate to survive enemy shots.\n\nI think there may be 4 levels with bosses. I'm not sure because I have only managed to beat the stage 3 boss in the single mission mode. I'm definitely going back though, and I recommend it highly.","January 12, 2015","true","3.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I happened to see it on the store front and checked out the video - at that point I knew the game was for me!\n\nThe game's unique gameplay mechanic is to rotate the world around your ship and this is exploited brilliantly to chain enemies and avoid walls of bullets.  I wouldn't describe the game as bullet hell, but more like a Cave shooter; there are plenty of bullets for sure, but every single one of them is there to be used to increase your multiplier.  Although you only get a single life, the game isn't so punishingly hard that you can't progress a few levels with some practice, but like any good shooter you can choose the risky play styles which could net you much more points at the expense of progress.\n\nGraphically the game has a unique look to it, very reminiscent of the demoscene product "cdak" by Quite and Orange.  On level three things get shaken up a bit which is welcomed at that point.  Musically this game is incredible, covering a wide range of styles but remaining high quality throughout, and the soundtrack is right there in the game folder.\n\nA fantastic game then and one that I'm sure I'll keep replaying not just for the score but for the sheer enjoyment of it.\n\n9/10","October 25, 2014","true","4.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

To summarise, Revolver 360 is a 2.5D STG taking place in 4 stages, with branching paths and bosses at the end of each level. The player shoots enemies and objects coming from all directions in a 3D plane whilst moving within a rotatable cylindrical playing field. Bullets can be rotated-around and cancelled through abilities which use up constantly-recharging resources. The scoring system is based around cancelling bullets and enemy chaining (although the chaining is not nearly as strict as games like Dodonpachi, which is notorious for its perfection-demanding enemy chaining). There are also 50 short challenge levels which test the player's knowledge of the different game mechanics, as well as their memorisation.\n\nAs someone who usually plays STGs for survival and tends not to care about getting high scores, the scoring system in Revolver 360 is so addictive that it has gotten me hooked and trying to improve my scores regularly in spite of my preferences for survival play.\n\nThe scoring system is based around two multipliers: a first multiplier which is based on chaining enemy destruction, it is capped at X16, although this limit can temporarily be broken through using overdrive mode; the second multiplier is a count of how many bullets you have cancelled. Bullets are cancelled through destroying enemies as they are firing lasers, using your ship's own lasers, or using the emp shot (a powerful charge shot which breaks through blue beams which lasers cannot cancel) and overdrive, which cancels all bullets on screen once activated. Larger enemies fire more bullets at lower health, so the player has to be careful to leave them on as little health as possible to cancel as many bullets as possible. The effect this has on the gameplay is that it encourages players to be constantly taking risks, as it requires them to rotate clouds of bullets directly towards them to cancel them out with a well-timed/positioned laser cancel. The nature of the first multiplier encourages players to mix up their main shot (which works as you would expect from a basic STG shot type) and their laser for the most optimal chaining. This combined with the fact that there are many routes to take throughout the meticulously-crafted and gorgeous levels (there are even secret routes!) means that there is a ton of player freedom and replay value.","August 13, 2015","true","13.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","3"

Get it.\n\nLong version: I'm so happy there are more and more Japanese games appearing on Steam. Sure, some of them are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dating sims but there are lots of gems still not released on the platform. Playism has been delivering (and translating, I believe) Japanese indie games for a while now through their site. Some of them make their way to Steam and they're always very well ported: there are always proper resolution config, control options and such. Revolver360 looks great, supports up to 4K resolutions (16:10 option is hidden under F10 key but that's a minor thing) and of course runs at 60FPS.\n\nRevolver360 has been praised in shmup circles and rightfully so. It's a great take on the genre with 2D plane you can rotate to avoid bullets or find secrets in the background - see the trailer, it explains the basics pretty well. The game's as hardcore as you can get which is the main draw for me. This wouldn't matter if the mechanics weren't fun, of course, but they surely are. I only wish the game would use more colors as it's blue on blue for the most part but that's a design decision and who am I to teach the devs. The tutorial is hidden somewhat in the challenge mode, be sure to try that before trying to clear the main mode.","October 27, 2014","true","3.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

THIS GAME IS AWESOME!\nREVOLVER360 RE:ACTOR is a shoot'em up game; but it has a very interesting difference from other games in this genre: you can rotate the enviroment!\nFor example, you can use this ability to line up several rows of enemies and destroy them at once or to avoid screen filling attacks. This ability also made the game a lot challenging since the enemies and some goodies are placed around the enviroment. In addition to this ability, you have access to a straight laser attack which can eliminate enemies and some projectiles, and an overdrive move which removes every projectile from the screen.\nThere are three modes to play in this game. I recommend completing the challenges before playing through Reactor mode to learn the basics.\n\nPositive Points:\n- The enviroment rotation mechanic is very innovative and has made the game unique\n- Multiple paths in stages\n- Nice difficulty (The game is hard at first. But when you get used to the mechanics it becomes easier.)\n- Nice visuals and soundtracks (Soundtracks are bundled with the game.)\n\nNegative Points:\n- TOO MUCH BLUE COLOUR!\n\nNotes:\n- The game can freeze on launch due to one reason: downloading scoreboards. To avoid this, check ((Offline Mode)) in game's config file which is in the game's main directory.\n- I haven't finished the game, so it's early to tell the game is short or not. I'll update the review later about this.","May 16","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the great things about this game is that it is very approachable for all skill levels.  In fact, I actually cleared this game (there are no continues, so every clear is a 1cc), which is a first for me as I have never cleared a shmup without using a continue (terrible thing to have to admit, I know).  It only took a few practice runs of the 2nd and 3rd stages, and a couple replays that I watched from the leaderboards to achieve this too.  However, there is alot more difficulty and depth in the scoring, plus numerous challenges to satisfy you after you have gotten that first clear.  In addition, each stage has multiple routes, some of which require conditions to unlock, so the stages have alot of replayability.  My favorite way to play this game is just practice one stage, experimenting with different routes and rotating in different areas to shift bullets for better scoring, or to find more items or destructible objects.\n\nFrom the video and screenshots you can see that the graphics are very unique and original, and quite good too.  The first time you play this game, make sure you try the challenges first.  The beginning ones are what actually teach you to play the game.\n\nThe rotating mechanic is also very original.  It feels like you are actually changing the shape and pattern of the enemy bullets and I think this game is worth playing just for experiencing this neat new system alone.","October 12, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A mechanic that hasn't deeply explored in the genre and was fun to try.\n\nThis implementation falls a little short, the rotation can be a bit too dizzying and when combined with the ship direction not matching the scroll direction leads to a hard to digest visuals for the eyes.\n\nThe player weapons, enemy patterns and bosses however fell short and ended up being the standard faire seen in this style of game many times before.

I managed to beat it after just two hours. You can get hit countless times and still make it through the levels. This means you don’t really need to use the camera system that much, since even if you do get hit by offscreen enemies, it doesn’t really matter.\n\nStill, there aren’t many recent 2D shooters with such a nice presentation and the game is definitely fun to play, so I can easily recommend this to any fans of the genre.","November 9, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get a good amount of health in the beginning to fend off damage, and you can repair your ship with pickups found through the game, but you only get one life, and if you die, it's game over.

Anyone who has enjoyed a 2D side-scrolling shooter should appreciate this game, because REVOLVER 360 RE:ACTOR is basically a long overdue update to this old genre of games. It literally adds an extra dimension, which impacts the game mechanics more than what one might expect!

Fun for casual gamers too (like me), but also diehards in the way Tetris can be competitive. GL HF!\n\nNote: No multiplayer (other than scoreboard).\n\nEdit: Just found out that the game is shorter than I thought, so I got through more of the game (%-wise) in my original few attempts that expected.

I've gotten to rank 32 in the leaderboards so I feel like I've gotten a good understanding of the mechanics.\n\nYou have 3 types of shot. Normal, Laser, and I guess you could call it destroy. Normal rips up enemies but gives little score, laser shoots through enemies and builds score by giving a chain kill bonus, and destroy shoots through enemy blue/purp attacks and also leaves anything it hits near death. Normal shot is the only one that can hit enemies in the background which shares a different chain bonus from laser. You have limited laser shot that regens. Destroy uses meter that is shared with the overdrive power which when activated rapidly regens your laser as well as buffing your shot damage.\n\nYou can also rotate the map left and right to line up enemies for destroy/laser combos or to avoid shots that would normally hit. It is also crucial to rotate to be able to attack background objects that will give score.\n\nThere are background chests that hold powerups. You don't build up your shot like most STGs from powerups in this one. Instead they hold health, laser reload, or overdrive reload. They spawn the same powerup in the same location everytime so for score its important to know when you should be using your laser/destroy/overload abilities so that you don't waste any powerups.\n\nIt's quite a bit of fun once you get into the mechanics. There is also a challenge mode which helps you understand how to build score and utilitze the mechanics the best. Only minor problem I have is that this game is fairly short and the final boss at least in my opinion was somewhat lackluster. But this is an indie STG which has really amazing mechanics so I can't get too hard on it.\n\nThe brightness (and afaik the lack of ability to turn it down) is another minor problem but you get used to it.\n\ntl;dr if you like ikaruga and can deal with the fact that this is an indie game and thus doesn't have as much production values or as tuned boss fights as some other STGs then you'll be in for a treat.","January 2, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The UI is awesome and the graphics impress me alot, this game is very fun. And those who enjoy "bullet hell" games, so to say, would most likely enjoy Revolver360 Re:Actor.

When twenty games vie for your attention with the same "new" concept (reversing polarity is a popular one), having something that actually switches things up feels fresh and exciting. I died on the first boss (ouch), but I can't wait to try again tomorrow.\n\nAt it's core, this is a 2D shmup. It doesn't have the functionality of the established 3D subgenre so it really does feel like a big change from the side-scrolling or top-down classics that we love... and their many spawn that we don't so much.","May 30, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What did I destroy? Why so many bullets? Where am I???\nYou are probably going to ask yourself these questions while playing this game. 100% hardcore with an amazing music and tons of enemies. Your finger will stick to the button "Fire", your eyes will bleed from thousands explosions and your face will hurt from the giant amount of facepalms you made when you accidentaly pressed "laser" instead of supermegaskill to destroy bullets.\nBest game for those who like to kill enemies and shake a head with the great music.","December 11, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The level design is beautiful and works very well with the 360 degree rotation.\n\nOne word of caution: if you are prone to getting motion sickness in video games then this may not be the game for you.","December 6, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I sucked at this game so can't really reach that far to enjoy those beautiful scenery. :'(\n\n2)You should add in more stuff something like power ups when in-game and maybe some sort of "money" just to upgrade your revolver and get stronger by the time you play the game. I believe it will be more addictive :)\n\n3)(Multiplayer) You see just like other steam games, playing with friends is always more entertaining  than solo and competing with each others too.(PvP?)optional.\n\nLast but not least, I have to say that this is probably the best shooting game I had ever played. Highly recommended for shooting games lover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 17","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
