It's a difficult unfair unpolished game with bad handling and collision detection. For a platformer that's clearly meant to be difficult, good implementation is crucial and that makes a bad thing worse.\n\nSubjective: ★★☆☆☆\nObjective: ★★★☆☆ — Graphics: ★★★ — Content: ★★☆ — Handling: ★★☆\n\nhttp://played.today/owys.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMIqQiKmajk","October 19, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

I made it do the 4th level I think maybe 5th and it's just a constant die & repeat then start over from the beginning. I can only take so much of that when I decide it's just not worth the headache. Others may like this but getting a thumbs down from me.","December 19, 2015","false","0.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Imagine not being able to see where you need to jump in a platformer. Also, did I mention the limited lives? I did! Because that's a big ♥♥♥♥ing deal!!\n\nThis game is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

When you get a game over, it says "Game Over" 3 times which suggests that the dev. for got to just crop the audio down to one after getting it from somewhere, kinda lazy bro... A bad Super Meat Boy clone. Not worth checking out for $8, just wait and get Super Meat Boy during a Steam Sale for $0.90 (it typically goes on sale for that much).\n\n\nGot this game as a part of an indie bundle.","October 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is bad. The best way to describe it would be imagine an introductory one month high school Unity assignment. Nothing feels complete. Level design is bad, sound is bad, nothing about the game is enjoyable.\n\nAlso, I kept running into a problem with controller support where once vibration started it would not stop until the game was closed.","December 17, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morlan/recommended/394770/","morlan","Morlan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morlan/","880 products in account","It looks cute.. sweet.. friendly..\nAlas it's a brutal unforgiving game that will punish you for forgetting the exact spot where you had to change "strategy". Strategy = walk, run, walk (jump of course) but without an opion to run/walk. The game decides when you walk slow or when you run, changing in mid-jump even.\nIt's a seemingly simple looking platformer that uses "hidden" platform attributes to raise the difficulty. You casually walk and jump in a slow manner, minding your own business when suddenly WHAM! (no, you're not a lovemachine) you're catapulted towards the next obstacle because..uhm there's no because.. Because at that point in the platform the character is meant to run! Next time you learn..\nThis is just bad design/definition of "platforming" to me. Furthermore the "wall jump" requires some random pixel perfect (yes I know what I said) precision to climb some walls, so you just try and try again until you -accidentally- hit the nail.. or the keyboard for that matter, and quit in frustration.\nIt doesn't help that there's no window mode or sound options.\nIt would be alright for Ludum Dare event but most certainly not for 4.99..or less.. The need to remember exactly when the walk/run mode changes is taking all the fun away and making it a chore..\n\nNoth Anks!","January 17","false","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Imagine ibb & obb with the rage of Super Meat Boy. I hope they patch this game as it deserves. I'd pass pleeenty of hours playin' it if they fix/arrange menu, gamepad system, solid online features is welcome too.. And of course, levels and who knows workshop. ^_^ .

The style has some neat ideas, I just don't know how it passed quality control. Half the time you get very glitchy games and have to restart to get it working properly. Apart from wall jumping though, there is not much to it and you get the feeling it is the type of thing that could be thrown together with Unity personal edition over a few weekends rather than a legitimate quality Steam title.","April 27","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
