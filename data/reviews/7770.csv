Most people only hate this game cause they played 30 minutes and assumed that the game's never picking up, or just know it's a 3rd person shooter of a beloved strategy game, which means it'll automatically be bad. Enforcer is far from that.\nYou haven't lived till you've gone mach 5 around a mall, launching grenades everywhere in a fountain of death, obliterating all in your path. There are countless weapons and powerups in this game to please you (do not unlock the freeze gun), and the upgrade system allows you to improve just what you want. This upgrade system is key to the game, as it's what turns a rather simple character into the super sonic, destructive Enforcer he should be. The main objective of about every level is "Murder Every Alien", and that's all you need really. Beautiful death and carnage for the sake of it.\nThe levels are generally very open and allow for exploration, which will let you unlock bonus levels and get more points and more upgrades. But they never feel mandatory, so you're free to just kill to your heart's content. The game allows you to check at any time where the next enemy spawner is, so that you can go there to kill things without having to get lost, allowing the flow of the killing to proceed unhindered.\nThe game does suffer from some flaws, as any will. If you take too long to go to an objective, your scientist ally will persistently annoy you to continue onwards. A few of the guns, such as the aforementioned freeze gun, will be useless and since the only way to get rid of a gun you're carrying is to use up your ammo or find a different one, it can create a problem at times.\nBeyond those, the rest are insignificant upon this beautiful creation. The game isn't really complex or as deep as its predecessors, but it doesn't have to be. The game succeeded in being a well-made, over the top, insane shooter, and it succeeds well.","July 15, 2014","true","7.2"," 70 of 89 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","70","89","4","0"

A bad shooter, a bad use of the X-com IP, and aging badly. However, for this review I will assume you've got it in the X-com Complete Pack rather than spending money on it (Please don't do that, it's not worth 5 Euro/Dollar/monopoly monies in my opinion)\nAs such, I will actually recommend you play it, after all, you have it from the complete pack so the only thing you can lose out on is time.\n\nIt has a lot of bad, and yes, the reputation is kind of deserved. After X-com Interceptor has you beating aliens in space, there really wasn't much else to do in the X-com story. So we're not really getting a story here.\nThe story is: You're a robot. You wake up. Aliens are attacking. Go kill aliens. And...That's about it. There does seem to be an idea of a story in there but it's kinda hidden.\nSimple, but it works. It's slow to start, but you'll eventually unlock bigger guns, the ability to go faster than many projectiles and even more guns, and even more big guns. Did I mention you go fast and have guns? I think I did. Taken as a continuation of the X-com franchise, it fails. Hard. But if you take it as just an X-com based shooter you get as a bonus with the rest of the X-com pack it is less painful, and at times it becomes fun. After a while it becomes an amusing shooter where you slaughter entire hordes of aliens while flying from one end of the room to the other launching spinning disks with blades attached to them. There's the standard (For the time) hidden secrets to find, big levels in which you can explore a whole lot, and a lot of aliens to shoot at.\nIt also takes a little from bullet hell games, as your bonus points(And I think maybe super speed too) resets when you get hit. You won't die from just one quick hit, but you will find yourself actually trying to dodge things so you can keep going fast.\n\nIt doesn't make the game great. But being completely honest, I wouldn't say it's awful and bad either. Don't take it as a hardcore serious game, take it as a casual amusing shooter narrated by an amusing scientist who seems to enjoy watching his creation(You) wreck the alien invaders.\nIt's not good, but I wouldn't call it bad either. And since it's in the X-com pack you may as well give it a go.\nAt the least, play a few levels before you decide whether it sucks or not. It might surprise you","November 1, 2014","true","5.3"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","19","24","3","1"

So forget all notions of turn-based strategy and base building and all that. This is a simple run and gun TPS.\n\nYou run through loosely divided sections killing absolutely everything you come across -- in this case, enemies that spawn from generators. You only wield one weapon at a time and can pick up others as they spawn in the level (and they respawn after a while). Killing enemies makes them drop points (literally) which you gather and can trade in for upgrades to your weapons, health, speed etcetera. It's all kept as mindless as possible -- run around for too long without direction and you get a gentle reminder of where you're supposed to go, in the form of a big blue blinking arrow over your head, so that, in theory, even the biggest idiot can find his way around. Even so, I managed to get stuck at level 3, where you're supposed to go up somewhere but I could find no way of getting there -- the game has no mini-map or mouselook. Whether that says something about the game or me, I wouldn't care to say.\n\nIt reminded me a little of Painkiller (there's even a weapon that shoots blades), except that Painkiller has more variety, better graphics and higher difficulty. This game is by no means a classic, but as far as mindless fun goes it does what it sets out to do. I'm giving it a vague "not recommended" based on just the half hour of play I had with it. I can't really recommend buying it on its own, but as long as you don't go in expecting strategy, it's an inoffensive addition to the X-COM Complete Pack.","June 13, 2014","false","0.6"," 51 of 83 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","51","83","2","0"

The game has barely anything to do with the X-Com franchise anyway.\n\nThe fixed camera angle is a little annoying and you can't choose not to pick up a weapon if you run over it but the game is perfectly serviceable as a budget title. The game does get a little repetitive, though it does have the occasional special objective to spice things up a bit; but I didn't notice because I was having too much fun blowing up aliens!\n\nOne blemish is the voice acting of the Professor. He's rather annoying and his voice does chime in when ever you're lost (Followed by an arrow which will tell you where you need to go), but ONLY if you get lost so only the most wangsty players will find it an issue.\n\nPros;\n- Fun\n- Lots of aliens to shoot, lots of (unique) guns to shoot with\n- In game help doesn't completely lead the player by the nose\n- Bug free! (Something you don't see anymore)\n\nCons;\n- Repetitive\n- Fixed camera can get annoying at times\n- Voice Acting is horrible\n- Quite possibly the ugliest game I've ever seen!\n- Why is it even called X-Com?\n\nMy suggestion would be to get this with the X-Com: Complete Pack.

Want another high-quality TBS?  Maybe an interesting tactical spinoff involving flight simulation or RTS elements?  Well ♥♥♥♥ YOU CONSUMER, all you get is a clunky and awkward third person shooter with a budget of 14 cents, merry friggin christmas!\n\nThree enemies (some kamikaze droid, the sectoid, and what I'm guessing was supposed to be a chryssalid) are spammed at the same reactionless drone that does random ♥♥♥♥ like touching civilians to beam them up to the enterprise or killing the same transporters.  Yes, every map, every objective-- it's all the ♥♥♥♥ing same.  Three weapons total that you can't switch in and out of but instead just get whatever you picked up last and roll with it, three enemies types constantly spammed at you, two possible objectives.  Zero variety whatsoever.\n\nAlso, its graphics... I know it's an old game, but were they even trying?  The animations themselves are absolute ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThen we get the annoying announcer.  Judging from the repetitive gibbing of Sectoids I guessed this wasn't a kids game, but I was probably wrong.  The announcer is the same poorly acted scientist that makes sure to compliment you in a childish way every time you shoot your ♥♥♥♥ing gun at a transporter that you were supposed to take down.\n\nFinal verdict: 3/10.

I got a a lot of X-COM games in a humble bundle, and I never expected one of them to be a third-person shooter. And a fun one at that. The gameplay is simple, and that works in its favor like you wouldn't believe. All you have to do is run with WASD, shoot and turn with the mouse, and press space to jump. That is all, and it works beautifuly. The game consists of 38 missions, which have a few different styles of completion. It could get repetitive if not for the gameplay and some fun levels thrown in here and there. As far as weapons go, there are only as many as you collect and research, as all weapons and power-ups are collectable. So on to enemies. There are plenty of types of enemies, and when bosses start showing up as regualar enemies, you see just how far you've come. The story is the weakest point, as it is basically there to string together the levels. The voice acting is great, the game sounds pretty good, but there is a lack of soundtrack, though I suppose it is made up for due to the insane amount of shooting you will do. My only major gripe with the game is that since enemies just run towards you, it can force you into a corner, and with bigger enemies, that basically means death.\n\nMy final score: 7/10\n\nIt was a fun little journey that I think you should play, but thats it. I have no strong feelings toward replaying it like other games, but its still fun, for at least one time around, and with different skins and neat weapons, there is some more fun to be had.","August 31, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has you playing The "Enforcer" a robot made to face off against the aliens of the X-COM franchise.\n\nNow this game would be enjoyable it feels good if you change the controls and mouse sensitivity. However the game really starts to fail when you realise you can't change the camera angle. Instead of, like modern Third Person Shooters, changing the camera angle with your mouse, the game instead keeps it static. The camera is pointed down making it near impossible to hit enemies at an angle of elevation. This will probably be first noticed in the second level, set in a mountain range you're moving both up and down rocky terrain.\n\nBetween levels you can upgrade and research or increase the power of weaponry (e.g. range of the flamethrower), upgrades  (e.g. extra damage) and improve yourself (e.g. ammo capacity). This, while not unique, does add in an X-COM vibe and add more to the game.\n\nWhilst I wouldn't recommend this game to the average person, or many X-COM fans, I feels it is quite harshly reviewed it isn't the worst game to have ever been created, for one thing it does feel quite good to be in the shoes of a non-incompetent X-COM operative. I found it enjoyable however it's flaws mean I will probably only ever play the game in short bursts, if I play it again.","January 7, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They gave them to a few unrelated developers and said, make something we can sell out of this.\n\nI don't recommend you buy it as a stand alone, but if you bought the complete pack you might have some fun with this if you don't look at this as a serious X-Com sequel.\n\nWhat I recommend in this game is the shear sense of excess and abandon. This game is like the master levels in Doom II, except more so. At some point the level bosses become the regular enemies and they begin to fill up the smoldering remains of humanity in areas the size of the parking lot at disney world, and then they take more than one shoulder launched nuclear missile to kill.\n\nDon't get me wrong, critically speaking, there is no story to speak of, the mechanics are basic, options limited and the exploration is limited to trying to find glowing letters that spell out B-O-N-U-S in semi open levels, but this game is like Smash TV meets Contra meets Doom meets Chex Quest.\n\nWhen you're running 120 mph laps in a shopping mall with a helicopter blade strapped to your arm vertically, the aliens flying apart in front of you as if they've been thrown into a blender on the liquify setting, an effeminate lisping scientist is yelling something about "BIG BONUSES" in your ear and your robot avatar says "Back off space freaks" and you're only to the half point in the game you'll understand what I'm talking about.","March 11","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You sprint through levels shooting anything that moves while uncovering hidden rooms and power-ups. There's really not much depth to any mechanics outside of a simple upgrade system, but why should there need to be? This is a dumb shooter about killing aliens and absolutely nothing else.\nThis is not an X-com game, but it's a fun game in it's own right, especially given its cheap price tag.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll play this over The Bureau: Declassified any day of the week, but hey, that's just me","January 26","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it a few months ago and it was as all the old xcom game 1 game for 5$ or all 5 games for 15$ (3$ each). For 5$ there are probobly better steam games but for 3$ as a bundle how can I say no even if you only get a few hours of life out of it. The game suffers similar problems to The Bureau but more so. The Bureau as least has many of the classic parts of the game just the semi turn based part throws it off. Any how...\n\nYes I recommend the game and its meta score maybe and over exageration of how good it is. If your looking for a quick, simple, "shooter", alien blasting and an awesome robot that takes devestates robots as well as a sectopod 1v1 any 1 of your soldiers this is the game for you. Take vengance for all those times in all xcom games where the alien dominate you becauase now your the one doing the dominating. The hardness setting do not make the game much harder. You 1 shot with your laser rifle which has unlimited ammo as your would with a mid tech rifle in any game most basic humanoids. The power ups and ammo based weapons some are lack luster and some are game breakingly awesome. As in getting tactical nukes that can have multiple shots or time stoping all enemies for 10 seconds. Your robot named Enforcer... can be upgraded which is the only tactical part of the game as in what to upgrade when. You can upgrade your speed, jumping, max ammo and hp. You also can upgrade a variety of buff items to enhance them and also your limited ammo weapons (which is everything except your basic attack). My favorite weapon and I recommend maxxing it out first is the Mass Driver. It combines decent firing speed and accuracy of a rifle with the minor splash, aoe and penetration of say a grenade launcher. 1st upgrades to your robot I suggest are improved jump and some speed. To be fair it as an ok attempt to make a "shooter" but when ever a game series that is well established changed game play like this it usually turns out people hate it. People want same but different not different but similar.\n\nPros:\nGame is short, can win in a few hours once you have done it before\nLevels are short, about 5-15 minutes, good if you have short time\nUpgrade self as say enemy within\nAwesome stats\nNo hit locations\nFairly mindless playing\nSemi hidden bonus money and bonus level items (1st play through found 90% of them and 2nd time them all)\nBonus level (they are sort of mini games to earn more money after every level if you find the hidden bonus level item. Some are annoyin some earn tons of money. Most are fun enough and have a 60 second timer. Such as 1 is pack man with you in place of pack man and 1 is frogger like ect)\nNo psionics! As in you are a robot so basicly immune in all games to it. In enemy unkown there are a few exceptions that can hit robots and the High ethereal do have some that can hit you. But not mindcontrol or panic! The enforcer to fight aliens is a great idea.\nHigh defence probably too much making it too easy vs standard aliens when you have 400 hp and they are doing less than 5 per shot\nSome replay value\nSkins!\nMultiplayer (for the perpose that you can still play it with out an other player but start on any level for fun)\n\nCons:\nToo easy most of the time except a few bosses which can be quit tough\nNo hit locations\nFairly mindless playing, getting sort of repetative objectives for most levels\nVery little story line besides intro, near ending and ending\nWay too many items spawn for you to use making it almost laughably easy most of the time\nNot a strategy game as said above!","January 8","true","35.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
