Stacking those silver circles of gaming goodness in the corner of the machine, and battling evil in all its many guises was a great rush... That was until with seconds to go to beat my prey, the ever elusive "END BOSS," one hit would stand between me and my goal! The "GAME OVER" screen would flash and the "Continue Counter" would tick down from 10 to 0... Sometimes, the quarter or token would take but other times I would have to start from scatch all over again!\n\nThe gameplay on Rock Zombie can be a bit glitchy at times. If you are not standing in the exact spot you should be, the zombies and/or bosses will damage your health bar to a ridiculous degree... The storyline is amazingly cheesy but even with all that said, I enjoyed the hell out of this guilty pleasure feast! The driving beat of Rock and Metal made this game a treat! And let's face it, who amongst us gamers, music lovers, and seemingly mad hatters, haven't dreamt of fighting the forces of Hell, clad in leather and rocking out?! Although, I must admit that I would never treat my guitar in such a manner... But hey, I will leave it for you to decide!","March 12, 2015","true","14.5"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","2"

Thematically, it's about what you'd expect including B-movies that are so bad it's good. Enemy types vary slightly and they peddle out new enemies as levels go on, but none actually pose much of a problem even on harder difficulties. Level design is varied and feels arcade-y. There is also a driving sequence which was a nice touch to break up the game. The only thing I wish was that there were more boss fights.\n\nControls are a little wonky because you configure your controller upon booting up the game. So even if you have a 360 controller (which it shows more as an example than defacto) you have to step through each button one by one. Which is great if you have other controllers, the problem is that the game detects analog input. So when you press anywhere in the diagonal range, your run speed turns to a walk speed, which means the first boss who has an OP special ability is hard to run away from.\n\nBottom Line: A generic (single-player?!) brawler with a generock soundtrack. It's funny without trying to be, which made it enjoyable for me.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm9i6uMOqnQ","November 20, 2014","true","2.0"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","1"

Personally I like games like Double Dragon, Streets of Rage, Final Fight etc so I liked the game a fair bit. It's a fairly basic game in the genre, but it doesn't have multiplayer for whatever reason and the audio design is fairly bad.","December 19, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolronz/recommended/328640/","coolronz","coolRONz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolronz/","707 products in account","First off I think this game isnt for everyone, if you are a fan of B grade action/horrors you'll get a kick out of it. The game itself is quite challenging. Like most brawlers the enemies are recycled with different abilities. There are zombies that walk, crawl, run at you, barf acid on you, even zombie dogs like in resident evil, zombies that are fire that explode a bit after you kill them so be sure to give them some space after taking them down. Also there are landmines tha you can coax zombies to run over that blow them up, just be sure not to walk over them. lol Its a litle more difficult when there are landmines and a horde of zombies running after you. But you can fire a shock wave at them to thin them out pretty quickly, but that needs to be replentished, which is a nice touch, surprisingly theres a lot of thining and strategy in this game. I haven't played this game much, just got it for 40% off and glad I did, at first it kinda sucked, hard controls etc. But the level up and coin system is pretty cool. Graphics arent bad but aren't really great either, but the smoke and rain effects really do look cool in a 3D backdrop. I LOVE the back ground music, I find myself nodding my head as I play! This is a very unique game directed at a very small audience. Theres not much play time to finish the game, but for the price I do feel it warrants a buy and see. The story telling is typical shallow, but I got a good chuckle out of it.","October 11, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics and sound are fine, however the controls are a little wonky, although i wouldn't say their so bad it makes it unplayable.\nNo much else to say really, im happy with this just cause i like the genre and there's not many of these kinda games on Steam, so it's not like it has much competition. If you like this kind of game, and you can work with the controls and you have 5 bucks spare i would recommend.","December 3, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deviancy17/recommended/328640/","deviancy17","DevNotHere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deviancy17/","6 products in account","Rock Zombie has a lot of potential to be a fun hack and slash game.  It features a female band that are like a cross between the Runaways and some band from an anime cartoon, it has a lot of cool hard rock/heavy metal reference and music (all made by the game developers, there isn't any licensed music in the game), and it has a very cool 80's like horror vibe to it.  However, it has a few flaws that hurt the game.  The controls on the 360 gamepad aren't very responsive at times, the saves are stored in the registry rather in a directory on the hard drive so if you're like me and use CCLeaner quite a bit to clean out trash, you'll lose the progress you've made in the game, and the achievements don't unlock on Steam until after you exit the game so some may think you're using SAM since you could have 8 achievements that are unlocked and all at the same exact time.  I was hoping that the devs would release a patch that would allow saves to be synced on the cloud, that way when CCleaner is run the saves would merely be restored when syncing up with the Steam cloud, and I was hoping they'd make the achievements unlock on Steam as they are unlocked in the game but no such luck.\n\nHowever, if those issues aren't issues in your eyes and you dig campy 80's horror, zombies, and hard rock/metal themes, you may want to check out the game.","February 22","false","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But seriously, this game has gone out of its way to make me wonder why I even bought it, and (at the time of this writing) I've barely played it at all.\n\nThe keyboard controls are horrendous, stiff and unwieldly like a shopping cart stuffed with a cow being guided by one of those slow, lumbering push button robot abominations that the 1950s assured us we would all have in the space year of 1982. It still amazes me how people assume they can get away with making crap keyboard controls for a PC game (or port) simply because you can now easily plug controllers into a USB slot. If you're going to make a PC game and/or port, MAKE THE FRELLING KEYBOARD CONTROLS ACTUALLY WORK. Don't make me constantly have to fight with your crap just because you assume we all want to use a controller for every damnable game.\n\nSpeaking of fighting, the combat in this game are all about how poorly hit boxes are implemented. In a classic case of not knowing what they're actually doing, the devs (or maybe just dev, who knows) have committed the mortal sin of allowing an enemies hit box to extend to you, yet your hit box doesn't do the same when you're a very tiny fraction of a degree up or down from them. This also rears its ugly head when you're facing upwards or downwards, where I have literally whiffed more air than Mighty Casey despite being almost right on top of an enemy.\n\nThe landmines either have an alarmingly large hit box or their timers are much too short, because I have never once been able to set one off to explode and then gotten away without taking damage. Plus the person who decided to stick a landmine right in an area with heavy glare so I couldn't see it until it exploded in my face and killed me has a special place in my colon.\n\nSaid special place is open for the person who figured that this horrible, wannabe faux rock music blaring constantly was an excellent idea. You can literally not be able to throw a dime and not land on some tiny little indie rock band who would willingly pleasure you in very lewd, dehumanizing ways for a chance to have any kind of attention paid to their music outside of the rat hole gigs that they always have in some two bit dive provide you with some actual, passable rock music for your game.\n\nOh, and of course the game can spawn money, the thing you need to be able to unlock extras, outside of stage bounds. Try all you might, those coins will forever mock you.\n\nDespite all of this, I'm going to give the game more of a chance. Maybe I'll find some kind of treasure under all of this crap and have to revise this review. Or maybe it will simply pile even more onto me that will make this into an even more negative, bitter review. Only time, and my willingness to soldier on, will tell.","December 31, 2014","false","3.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","7","16","4","0"
