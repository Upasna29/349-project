Reverse Crawl isn't exactly what it looks like on the surface; The game is more about controlling a group of "Evil" minions that grow in strength through your decisions during multiple turn-based battles. After every battle, you get a choice to upgrade a specific area of your strengths; This could be making your Skeleton Minions deal more damage, or one of your more powerful creatures to gain a new ability. The Campaign is about three solid hours, give or take, and there are no real penalties for losing a "Mission". Every step gives you a choice of up to 3 different pathways, save for explicit encounters, and you can grow in strength depending on what you choose.\n\nMissions vary from taking down a Hero to gain more XP, to ambushing Merchants for loot and special upgrades, or enslaving/saving evil guys from the good guys. There's a LOT of variety and strategy, with every upgrade providing a unique and interesting ability that you can play around with. The difficulty is so-so; I didn't have any real troubles during the campaign, but I'm used to Nerdook's style of gameplay. After beating the campaign, you unlock New Game+ mode as well as Endless Mode, which becomes more or less a dungeon crawl.\n\nIf you enjoy turn-based RPGs that let you continuously grow more powerful, as well as enjoying cute (if amateur) art, then you can't go wrong with Reverse Crawl. I suggest that you go to a flash site (e.g Kongregate) to play some of his older games, like Dungeons of Kong, Cat God vs Sun King, Deadly Neighbours and more. They're all free and can give you a good example of his abilities. Still, for $5 Reverse Crawl is a steal. I can see myself playing over and over again in the future, and making new, fun decisions.\n\nI don't review often, but this game was a day-one buy for me, so I give it my all-star 10/10 rating. I hope that you enjoy the game, Nerdook is a great guy.","September 26, 2015","true","7.7"," 74 of 80 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","74","80","2","8"

It's basic strategy elements have been done before, but the replayability does get boosted with the ability to grab skills based on the missions you take on. There's an element of strategy that's present here in the way that you grab minions and their specific strategies and weaknesses they have against each other. It's not going to stick around long, while there is some replayability, it's too simple at the surface, and the game isn't too complicated in the end. But it's solid for a cheap price, and has a couple of cheesy moments to help make the game a little bit more out there in the end. There will be a bug here and there, and it's not the most visually appealing game out there, but it does the job where it needs to in its gameplay.\n\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/w_N_4mjAexg\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nCore tactics are reasonable for the price, especially considering the idea of replayability and the different traits that you can take.\nGood introduction to basis strategy mechanics. Not too complicated, but complicated enough to cause you to actual attempt to\nStory moments have groan inducing humor, but honestly that is a plus in my book as it did get a laugh or two out of me.\nDo like the randomization elements in there, even if they may be imbalanced over time.\nSeems reasonable for the price that it's going for.\nVisuals do have a certain charm to them in the end.\n-:\nVeterans of the tactics genre won't find enough here to keep them entertained over a long period of time.\nThe music does get repetitive after a while, even if I wasn't necessarily expecting that much out of it.\nMain campaign is short despite replayability.\nA bug here and there. In particular, certain character specific events can cause unmovable states due to not being able to select any more minions.","September 24, 2015","true","2.0"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","38","43","3","0"

Enemies, oh i'm sorry, "good guys" come in waves and we as the "badguys" must deploy our waves to kill them.\nUnfortunately It gets really repetitive really fast and I know why.\nThe game uses a hex grid system like Heroes of Might & Magic games so while fights should be tactical and played smartly, the AI doesn't offer a great challenge so often you are just clickling through waves.\n\nIts a shame really as its a nice twist on the usual wave fighter game since you must pick a unit type, such as archers and fend of various waves until you win or that group dies and then you select your next unit type. I feel the system would be very good in a PvP game but I don't know if there would be enough public interest to warrant a PvP mode/standalone game which is a bit of a shame.\n\nI also feel the game wouldn't be so bad if the game as a whole didn't feel so uninspired, it isn't bad but it feels bland and devoid of charm.

The description makes it sound like you are the bad guys and are killing the heroes... this is not accurate. Yes, your closest companion is undead but you were the ones attacked by some not-so-nice people with less than benelovent goals.\n\nI guess developers are scared to make you play an evil role, despite some success with things like dungeon seige and overlord. I came into this game hoping for some evil role play, but got none of it. There are a couple of choices that are "bad" but nowhere near as much as I wished.\n\nWell it's got some stategy to it, and some lighthearted humor - if I had kids I'd say I would let them play this though it might be difficult for really young ones to understand the strategy elements but there really is no losing in the game as far as I know - you just restart the battle and they are pretty quick so no stressing about dying as much. I prefer casual games myself so I liked it, though I know some people will whine about it being not permadeath or something.\n\nAnyway the pictures showcase the game pretty well in this case.","September 26, 2015","true","6.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

Via its manga style dialogues, you play a king resurrected by his necromancer daughter, trying to get his kingdom back from the Red Queen. Along the way you will battle heroes and monsters, as well as gain allies that will join your cause.\n\nAll this is done through the core gameplay of tile based tactical combat, and, like the story, the combat is light but surprisingly with a level of depth. You command limited groups of summoned minions (which includes the revenant king and his necromancer daughter), and duke it out with similiarly limited groups of enemy monsters. There are some tactical varieties such as the ability to flank as well as melee engagement rules. Also, you will gain threat during combat which is essentially mana for you to cast spells. There are a variety of enemies, as well as "hero" enemies who will appear again and again throughout the game, getting stronger as you progress.\n\nAs you win each battle, you will be given a choice of rewards (new spells, new allies, upgrades), as well as a choice of which storyline path to tackle next. These are randomly picked, thus ensuring a level of replayability to the game. The same is true when you lose battles, as the game does not end but instead you will take a pick of which negative choices to pick.\n\nOverall the game is fun and engaging, and never does it take itself too seriously with its silly anime humour. For the price, it is definitely recommended for those wishing for something a casual tactical tile based combat game with a solid story.","September 25, 2015","true","1.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Actually it just means you control the ˜bad guys ˜ or the minions of the dungeon that was invaded. You do not control any enviromental features.\n\nI would resume this game as progressing through stages of good and fun turn based strategy battles. With RPG elements: during and after every battle you get XP which you can use to unlock new units , buy new spells, etc.\n\nMain Pros:\n\n- Simple yet nice graphics that work fine;\n\n- Almost casual in the meaning that mechanics are easy and fast to learn and you dont need to go through a lot of stuff , set up or story in order to get the actual battles started;\n\n- Yet strategic enough that you have a kind of rock , paper and scissors that makes sense and does a lot of difference in the outcome of the battles. Choice and a little thinking , planing and experiment does matter.\n\nMain Cons:\n\n- Highlighted ˜you are the dungeon˜ feature will not translate well for most ( if not all people ) , so make sure you are aware of what this is before getting the game\n\n- A little bit short , with limited yet present replayability\n","February 19","true","9.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","2"

The game's story also features a branching storyline with each task you choose (each chapter allows you to pick 1 of 3 tasks) potentially altering the game.\n\nThe combat provides a decent challenge for new players, but over time the challenge is easily overcome when you recruit overpowered minions such as a golem or a swarm of rats.\n\nIn terms of replay value, the campaign is only about four hours long, but upon completing the game you have the option of doing an endless dungeon, taking on the Red Queen or entering New Game+.\n\nThe game's major negative comes from its options menu, which is nearly nonexistent; the menu only contains three options: sound, music and full screen, all three of which can only be turned on or off.\n","September 24, 2015","true","5.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenGamer37/recommended/400660/","GreenGamer37","GreenGamer37","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenGamer37/","130 products in account","The key for this game was indirectly given to me by the developer for review purposes but it will not change the tone of my review\n\nI will start off by clearing the misunderstanding of the phrase “A dungeon crawl where YOU are the dungeon!”  Speaking frankly this line is the worst possible way to describe a tactical turn based game, especially a one like this. Do not think that you will get to set up your own dungeon, build defenses, place enemies and traps to stop heroes from reaching the end goal because you won't. According to my knowledge what the phrase “YOU are the dungeon!” means that you get to summon minions to face the heroes hired by the Red Queen which is a nice twist.\n\nReverse Crawl as mentioned before is a turn based game in which you play as the “Revenant” King revived by his daughter, a necromancer and the “only” survivor of the assault by the Red Queen on her father’s castle. Your main goal is to defeat the Red Queen to reclaim your kingdom.\n\nYou get to recruit many different types of minion groups which you can summon to fight for you (there is a limit to the groups you can summon for each chapter). By gaining experience (either by defeating enemies or using spells) you can upgrade or gain; spells, minion groups and abilities. This freedom of choice adds a lot to the game. The battles carry out as all basic tactical turn based games, either move a minion to an adjacent space to the target for melee units or attack from a range for ranged units. With one of the new updates a skill tree has been added which gives perks to your minions.\n\nI can’t say much about the story without spoiling it. The events that happen in each chapter depend on your choice for example you can either try to get new minions or get a specific item to improve a minion/character or gain new abilities. These events lead up to 3 different choices before the final chapter (i.e. the showdown with the Red Queen) that affect the ending.\n\nThe art style for an Indie game is actually quite good being quirky and funny at times. The character's especially the Revenant King have odd personalities a thing which I really like. The Almighty Revenant King can sometimes even act like a child. All in all Reverse Crawl is a great game for $6 though I must say it is short, excluding the replay value (branching story).","November 13, 2015","true","10.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

You now must use various undead and other minions/monsters in battle to get new powers, new allioes, andgain stength to defeat her and reclaim your kingdom. The story does nothing that will really surprise you, but I liked it. It got me from point A to B and gave motivation to what I was doing.\n\nBattle is performed in waves, both of your enemies and allies. They have X number of waves, usually around 3 (but it goes 1-5) and you have a few waves yourself. Your team will consist of premade groups of certain monsters that have their own strengths and weaknesses. Each type of unit has their own set of powers, but you also have a bar of spells that may be used on any units turn in addition to their normal actions. These can be direct damage, summons, heals, stunning, and so on. So while I say the battles are "simple" there is a good range of various actions you can take every time given the resources. The battles are pretty well balanced, though I hate the Alchemists.\n\nI beat the main campaign in 4 hours, which to me is fine for the asking price.\nThere's an Endless Wave mode, and a New Game+ mode I can choose now. When going through the campaign you pick from 3 different power-ups to gain new ally groups, buff existing groups, or gain new powers, and there's an upgrade screen as well for various buffs to your team, so I imagine going through the campaign again will allow me to focus on different areas, and use other groups I didn't use much in my first play through.\n\nI don't quite get the tag "You are the dungeon" since I never got my own dungeon, didn't get to set traps for heros by luring them with treasure or evil deeds etc..

I can't stop playing it. I'm always so excited to start playing it and have to pry myself away each time in order to stop playing it. It's so much fun. I really didn't think I'd like it near as much as I actually do. I'm so glad I bought it now. It's so worth the money. They make the game simple to understand and pick up, challenging enough to make you keep coming back, and engaging enough to encourage you to to keep playing and trying if you don't win a certain quest the first time around. It's everything I typically want within a turn based strategy and I have a good grasp on what I want since I grew up playing these kind of games. The only two minor critiques I can give on this game is that on the "Endless" option it gives at the end, I wish it allowed you to send out one of each group you've picked up along the way to make it even more endless versus the 3 or 4 waves (can't remember which one it is right now) they give you. The other critique is I wish that they allowed more power options after each quest. That would be especially helpful when going for a certain theme as I'm currently trying to go with a Necromancy theme as much as possible on my current run through of the game. I feel like they should allow one option for each catagory of powers (Necromancy, Saboteur, etc.) each time. Other than that, it's a fantastic game. This is definitely a game I will be encouraging and even begging my friends to play (I've already started begging one of my friends to do so). As far as everyone else is concerned, if you love to play turned based strategies but don't want to lose your life over a game, don't buy this game. If you love to play turned based strategies and wouldn't mind forgetting you have a life, buy this game. Reverse Crawl receives 4.5 skeletons out of 5. The last skeleton just has a head and a torso.

I'd say you need about 3 replays to have seen all the game has to offer. Once the game is beaten, you have a New Game+ option, allowing you to restart a game with a few of the traits you unlocked, as well as an Endless Mode.\n\nThe game itself has quite a bit of humor and its obvious that it isn't supposed to be serious business. Gameplay wise its a simple Turn Based Strategy game. Each Chapter puts you into a situation where you have to fight multiple enemy waves with waves of your own. Before the start of the fight you can select your first group to send into the ring. That group will be chosen from a randomly generated set of minions. While you do unlock unit types, they do get a random trait, such as Armored (getting extra armor) or Weak (Doing less Damage). You can reroll your Unit selection 3 times, if you don't like the traits on the unit you need, and then you go and fight. Some units get special attacks and depending on your options you can play rock, paper, scissors by selecting a unit type that is strong against the enemy. The group you selected will remain on the battlefield until they are wiped out, or you won the chapter, and then you get to select a new 'wave'.\n\nThe game has 3 side story lines (Mages, Drow and Goblins), which can only seen through to the end one play through at a time.\n\nI think the asking price is fair for about 12 hours of game. Its not to challenging, of course this also depends on your choices and which units you unlocked and have available to you.","November 1, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The storyline isn't bad either.  A bumbling daughter wants her daddy back and viola!  He's now a zombie king hooray!  Hilarity ensues and you get to pick and choose from line ups of monsters you want to summon to represent you in battle.  Even if you don't like any of the line ups with their possible stat buffs and debuffs inflicted on most units, you can reroll for new units to use three times before your stuck with those units.  Including, yourself and your daughter as well as others you might encounter who will lend you their powers and prowess if you do the right missions.  That's the other cool thing, the missions are not all encounterable in one playthrough so you have to play many multiple times to see all the missions there are to achieve at.  The graphics are top notch for what the game is and the game play is simple and intuitive.  Easy to grasp in other words.  If you're looking to get into turn based strategy games, this might be the one to get your feet wet with so to speak due to its simplicity and its appeal from the beginning tutorial which is short by the way, to the harder missions and decisions.  For six bucks not on sale but it is right now for four dollars and seventy-nine cents, it's a steal of a game and a great way to kill time and actually think about what you're going to do.\n\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 10\nReplayability: 9\nLearning Curve/Ease of Learning: 10\nOverall Rating: 9/10","September 26, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game is purely a simple casual turn based combat game.\n\nThat being said I actually enjoyed the crap out of this game, it has a simple kind of charm to it.\n\nTechnicals: The graphics are nothing special, 720p stretched out and locked at 30fps but it isn't too big of a deal considering the kind of game it is. Options are also limited, only toggles for fullscreen, sfx, and music.\n\nGameplay: The combat mechanics of this game are nice and simple but do the job very well, the idea is you select a dungeon and then you get entered into a combat hex-grid. You and your enemy each deploy a squad of units to battle each other, your squads are premade and can only be used once per dungeon. Each squad is designed to counter certain units and is weak to other units. I.e. Skeleton Archers are very effective vs. armored units or units with the dodge ability but are weak to regular melee units that simply have a lot of hp or units with holy attacks. These squads also get randomised debuffs and buffs and you can reroll your choices 3x per dungeon (once you unlock enough groups they won't fit on your 8 choices and you can also reroll to get the group you want to). You each have a limited number of lives (times you can choose a group) and once someone has exhausted it they lose. When you lose you can simply start over, when you win you get a choice between 3 rewards which will sometimes affect the plot or open up other dungeons.\n\nThere is also a spellcasting mechanic that uses threat, essentially mana in a bar that fills up to 25. As you kill enemies you get threat, some units/buffs also generate threat. The spells will increase in cost when you use them during a single matchup, once one of the two groups has died all the values reset again for the next matchup (there is also a quest reward you can choose in the course of the game that lets you cast without cost increase and I full recommend taking it).\n\nZone control is also present which is the only real way of blocking units from passing through directly to your range units (there is no collision so if the enemy has a large enough movement range they can go right on through), at the beginning of a turn if a unit is standing next to an enemy it's movement is limited. For a melee unit that means only being able to move one tile that turn, for a range unit it means they can't move at all that turn and can only shoot at an adjacent enemy (or guard of course).  That is pretty much all you need to know about combat.\n\nPlot: It's a nice and simple plot, without spoiling too much: You are the ruler of a land, baddies come in and slaughter everyone, you are reanimated alongside your army and you try to take the kingdom back. It's not a plot heavy thing, very light with a kind of straight-man thing going on sometimes and there are some fun little bits.\n\nThe game's length runs 25 dungeons with little bits of plot, some of these dungeons are your choice while others are required at set points. There are a total of 3 final battles/endings which change depending on a choice you make in the previous dungeon.\n\nA playthrough lasts about 2 hours and I had a lot of fun with it. It's probably got 3 playthroughs in it if you want to try all the endings and middle choices. That being said that's about all the gameplay you will get out of it. There's no multiplayer and the game gets really easy once you develope a solid strategy. The lack of any real punishment for losing also means you can hammer away until you win which is a bit of a disappointment for me, if choices meant more and losing could eventually damage my army to the point where doing a full playthrough isn't possible every time then it'd certainly make things a lot more interesting.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game to anybody who likes turn-based combat. Do not recommend to those who want a dungeon management game or a dungeon crawler. The only "reverse" parts of this game are that you are using units that are traditionally bad guys and that you start on the right instead of the left.","September 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's all cutsey and well done.\n- The game throws you right into the action, but explains everything as you progress.\n- Sound and music is just fine, nothing groundbreaking, nothing bad.\n\nCon:\n\n- Options menu consists of 3 options (Sound, Music, Fullscreen), doesn't need more options for my taste\n- It is hard to tell the hp bars apart sometimes, I think you'll (I'll) get used to it though, the bars are basicly at the bottom of the unit and may overlap other units.\n\nNot quite sure on the theme, after the first 55 minutes I'm quite unsure how I'm actually the dungeon in this game, it's basicly a tactical turn based game where I can spawn "defenders" to stop "intruders". So far I'm moving around on a map and basicly creating my own story, not defending a dungeon.

Usually I enjoy Nerdook games for casual fun but feel they miss depth, but this is one of my favorites.\n\nIt's a simple strategy game where you, as the king of your kingdom, have lots of different squad types you can call upon in battle like archers, mages, warriors etc. You pick a squad based on what can best combat your enemy, and try to get through as many waves as you can. When that squad dies, you can pick another, and try to beat all the waves of the encounter before you use up 3 squads.\n\nThe reason it works so well is because there's a lot of choices you get to make. There's a crap load of squad types and you can choose from a selection of them with randomised traits in each scenario. You also get to choose which missions you go on, whether you want to earn new squads, abilities, upgrades etc. And even when finishing a scenario you can pick between 3 types of your chosen reward. I don't believe it affects the story a whole lot, but you also get to choose pathways at major story points.\n\nThe main gameplay is a fairly simplistic hex-based strategy but has an interesting magic system where killing enemies or changing squads gives you 'threat' to spend on spells. It's a bit boring at first but after you get some new spells and develop a few strategies you like it's more interesting. Combined with the fact that you get literally a tonne of squad types by the end, it's better than average.","March 27","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I've noticed something. When a siren takes control of a homuwhatever, and kills the mage that summoned it with it, the game breaks. An easy fix is just aborting the quest and starting over, but it's annoying to have to do that at the end of a mission, especially with the lack of checkpoints, and if that mage was the las enemy.

It's quite similar to the Braveland games if you've played them, except with much more branching and variability to the campaign, and more strategy involved for each encounter.\nStory is simple enough fare.  You're a King, slain by an invading army from the North, headed by a less than pleasant Queen.  Resurrected by your necromancy-practising daughter, you set out to expand your army and take back your throne.\nYou start out with a limited amount of undead minions to choose from, and over time, and depending on which quests you undertake, your evil henchmen army can grow and become quite varied.  Everything from Giant rats and bats, to zombies, goblins, frost elementals, dark elves, and then some!  Each unit has their own skills and specialties, combined with a random trait that is assigned every encounter (and can be varied further by "rerolling" your squad to vary the available units and traits, though this is limited to 3x per encounter).  All in all this means a fair bit of thought must be applied to the later battles.\nOne issue for me though was once I obtained a Spider Queen I pretty much steamrolled the middle couple of hours of the game before the challenge came back at the end.\nThe art style also deserves a special note, that alone was most of the motivation for getting this on a whim.\nTo sum up, if you're looking for something simple in a fantasy setting that has a fast-paced flow and enjoy the juxtaposition of cute visuals with the dark and demonic, you simply must snap this up.","September 28, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although new game + is included, it's actually easier than the first playthrough due to keeping some of the unlocks you gained the first time round. I'd like to see a harder difficulty introduced.\n\nI've more than got my money's worth from this. With a bit of fine tuning, I'd come back for more of the same.","September 30, 2015","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why does the Almighty Revenant King  say to his daughter "Yay! Wolves! can we take one home as a pet... Please!?".  I think the developer accidentally got the dialogue switched between characters or it's written by an eight-year-old girl.  I'm not sure.","October 9, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Usually I enjoy Nerdook games for casual fun but feel they miss depth, but this is one of my favorites.\n\nIt's a simple strategy game where you, as the king of your kingdom, have lots of different squad types you can call upon in battle like archers, mages, warriors etc. You pick a squad based on what can best combat your enemy, and try to get through as many waves as you can. When that squad dies, you can pick another, and try to beat all the waves of the encounter before you use up 3 squads.\n\nThe reason it works so well is because there's a lot of choices you get to make. There's a crap load of squad types and you can choose from a selection of them with randomised traits in each scenario. You also get to choose which missions you go on, whether you want to earn new squads, abilities, upgrades etc. And even when finishing a scenario you can pick between 3 types of your chosen reward. I don't believe it affects the story a whole lot, but you also get to choose pathways at major story points.\n\nThe main gameplay is a fairly simplistic hex-based strategy but has an interesting magic system where killing enemies or changing squads gives you 'threat' to spend on spells. It's a bit boring at first but after you get some new spells and develop a few strategies you like it's more interesting. Combined with the fact that you get literally a tonne of squad types by the end, it's better than average.","March 27","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Replay value is so-so, there are minor story tweaks, and you get different units if you do different levels. RNG is a factor in a lot of it, but honestly, even if you get bad RNG.. this game isn't really particularly difficult. It's the kind of game you play when you have a quiet moment. When you don't want to be, or can't be online, and just need something to click at and do. Maybe you're watching Netflix, or laying in bed trying to fall asleep and have poor sleep hygeine.

However, let me say that the game is not what I expected, this is not a bad thing. I was expecting a game where I would have a dungeon with levels and I was trying to prevent heroes from getting my treasure, this is not the type of game this is. Rather, it is a story that follows you and your necromancer daughter as you attempt to overthrow a kingdom. The game allows you to make decisions that affect how the game works, there are decisions that affect the ending and there are "skills" that buff your minions, maybe give them extra health, or give you a sword that increases crit chance. Very short game, can be beat in about 2 hours. If you're looking for a game you can easily 100% it's this one. It requires 3 playthroughs to to get it, so about 6 hours for the 100%. None of the achievements are really missable, they just can only be accomplished once per playthrough. One of them is kind of misleading due to the name, so I had to put an additional 2 playthroughs in to get it, however the game is very enjoyable, each playthrough yields a new experience so I didn't mind.\n\nTLDR: Great game, I reccomend it, easy to 100% for all you achievement hunters out there. (2 hours of gameplay, 6 hours to 100%)","December 26, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an interesting concept, but it doesn't meet the expectations I thought it sert with its introduction of controlling the monsters that heroes fight. It still seems much like the traditional fight enemies and progress style, which comes with the heroes, so in that regard, it has no real change from fighting enemies that, once the game progresses, become too easy to defeat.\n\nAdditionally, the game isn't that well balanced, with some of the troop spawn being worse than others in a way that caused me to only use the during the tutorial because I hadn't unlocked better ones yet.","May 26","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It claims you are the dungeon, spawning minions to prevent pesky heroes from exploring it. That's not the case at all. You are in control of a mage that can spawn the typical dungeon enemies (skeletons, zombies, giant rats, etc), but you aren't controlling a dungeon. You fight in various locations against enemies that are just called heroes. I was very disappointed by the game once I started playing.\n\nYou might manage 3 hours of playtime on your first run. It took me about 7.5 hours to get all of the achievements which required 2.5 runs through the game due to certain choices you make through the campaign.\n\nI bought the game on sale and still feel like it's not worth your time.","June 6","false","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
