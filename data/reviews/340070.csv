Have you looked for a similar game? Well Battle Ranch is very much like it.\nThe first levels you learn how to plant seed, grow plants and defend against the enemy wild boars. You get new tools as you progress through the levels, the season changes and new enemies comes with that.\n\nThis PC port is decent. I noticed some low resolution textures in the introduction film but the game itself looks alright. It should be able to run on most systems. You can play it in window or fullscreen, whatever you prefer. Battle Ranch does not support 1920x1080 resolution, however I didnt have any issues with black borders or anything like that.\n\nI haven't seen everything this game has to offer yet, but from what I can tell so far the game has a lot of content, just like Plant vs Zombies (and I put over 100 hours into that game). I will update this review as I progress, but for now I can say that it's an easy buy for any tower defence or resource gathering player out there. It's cheap and fun!","February 2, 2015","true","2.4"," 52 of 89 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","52","89","5","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/340070/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","I do not know many games that tried to emulate and challenge the original master of the line tower defence, Plants vs. Zombies (PvZ). Battle Ranch takes the same basic principle and, frankly, merely does it again. They should have at least made the turrets something else than fruits. Still, there are some differences for its own merit.\n\nEvery level throws a bunch of different zomb... uh, I mean freaking boar vikings at the ranch and you have to defend it by planting defensive turrets. There are both fast-loading pea shooters and burst turrets with longer reload-times, turrets with slowing capabilities, debuffers and outright defensive plants that block enemy movement or projectiles from hitting your plants. There are single-use items like bear traps and different area-attack bombs all the way to the slowly replenishing banana missile silo. Mobs sometimes drop special single-use items as well. Defences are no real innovation in tower defence but adequate enough.\n\nThere is a good variety of different enemies from the basic grunt through more enduring varieties to ones with special abilities like flying, fast moving capabilities or tunneling under everything. There are several tanks too. Alas, within these special capabilities the boars do not differ more - every boar of a certain special type looks and behaves always exactly the same way. It would have been nice to see some variation or maybe stronger or weaker types of the specific specialities. However, noting that almost all the game graphics files are plain images, some crazy graphics mods might become available in time.\n\nDifferent from PvZ the six-row field is divided into two separate parts: the garden and the turret field. Field hosts your defensive capabilities while in the garden you play a constant mini-game of planting and harvesting fruit for score that's used to buy turrets. There are 18 different garden plants, one for each turret type. They differ from each other with their reharvesting times and score production rates, and in addition few of them have to be replanted after harvesting. You get a full score (i.e. a star) from a level if you harvest all of the fruits required by the level.\n\nOne thing that's nice is that you don't have to click every single fruit you harvest - simple slide by the mouse cursor is enough. However, annoyingly enough the frame rate appears to be locked to 15 FPS, resulting in clunky animations. Also, the PC port (Battle Ranch was originally a phone/tablet game) has merely one resolution available, which is a huge oversight. The early levels are also super-easy so I'd wish there was a turbo button to speed things up. That or it should generally be slightly faster paced. Also, you can't redo levels: you have to play through the whole thing again if you miss a star for that season perfection achievement.\n\nThe story mode has 50 levels divided into five seasons (the regular ones + unpredictable) plus a couple of special levels for each season. The only differences between the regular seasons are the fruits and the obstacles that you have to clear to fill the whole garden: grass, stones, tree stumps and snow are just reskins of the same stuff, as are the "tools" required to clear/harvest them. In the unpredictable season and bonus levels between stages some special effects can affect the garden and your plants, like rain grows more grass to block the garden (minor annoyance) or localized tornados destroy plants in random locations. Unpredictable season is clearly the most challenging (and suitably, the last one) of the otherwise easy story seasons.\n\nAfter story you can hurl yourself into the bonus games and mini games: there's a pure gardening mode and a long defence mode with several stages of enemies with the same fruit defenders. It's a shame there were often just one or two levels of the more intriguing mini games like the one where the field is filled with treasure chests, each one containing either a boar or a weapon to use againts them, a click opening the surprise. Myself, I found the puzzle levels of Boarmania the most interesting, for in those the roles are reversed: you are given a set amount of boars and you have to destroy the gardens behind rows of defensive plants. There were 15 levels of these but I wouldn't have minded having more.\n\nLike any farming game, this one also has a silly garden for you to waste hours with. Any garden plants can be planted there with a set fee and you'll get some money for the plants thus harvested. This is probably the most viable way to get the two grindy achievements (get 1 million dollars and harvest 100000 fruits). Fortunately, you can hire a slow-walking but tireless farming gnome to do the harvesting for you and let the game run on the background while you play something else. Nevertheless, it's still going to take a lot of time if you want them. I've effectively AFKed some 50 hours of my game time and silently grinded the fruits in the background while actually hacking away at knights or ruling vast kingdoms elsewhere. Oh, and there's also a barn with potential (and quite expensive) cows and chickens and stuff but I figured it was a waste of grinding time to grow chow for animals (unintentional shout-out to vegetarianism).\n\nIn effect, there's about 30 hours of real playing involved. I'd call it Above Average and in my opinion it's worth its list price of 7 euros especially if you loved PvZ, maybe about half that if tower defence still tickles your fun bones. The oversights in porting it to PC dull the outlook, though the devs have said they are at least looking into the resolution matter. Modding might make it more interesting even though there's no Steam Workshop at the time or (AFAIK) planned out.\n\nIf you're sceptical whether you'd like it, there's a demo on the game's Steam Store Page. Initially I tried it and was satisfied to buy it at launch, but it's also a good way to see whether you can put up with the resolution, clunky animations and the similarities to PvZ. It's convenient that you can continue the full version from where you were left in the demo.","March 4, 2015","true","95.3"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

There's a fruit plant, and green peppers, both of which give points, and when enough are built up, you can place "peashooters," which spit stars, and "chili peppers".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamexotic/recommended/340070/","gamexotic","Bloodgroove","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamexotic/","2172 products in account","Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants rests in a subgenre of Defense games that is most often represented by Plants vs Zombies, which I'm embarrassed to admit, I still have yet to play.  Even so, that shouldn't keep us from discussing Battle Ranch on its own merit.  Because, even though it's not a game I would have actively sought out, thanks to Epic Quest Games, I was given the opportunity to play Pigs vs Plants to create my own opinionn of a game which receives very little hype.  Having been a steadfast fan of defense games since the iconic Defense Grid: Awakening came out, Pigs vs Plants comes as my introduction to this style of defense games where you play on a game board and enemies move from one side of the field in order to destroy your resources and reach your base at the close end of the field.\n\nIt might be thought of as simpler to the full field style Defense games, but not without a similar brand of frantic pace in getting your own defenses in shape in preparation for the onslaught.  You still have different types of towers, even if they aren't upgradable, and tools to slow and stop the enemies.  The other element that isn't present in traditional defense games is how your resources are generated.  You must plant crops and harvest them, rather than generating points by killing enemies.  This adds to the exceitment by giving you the additional dimension of managing your crops.  Not only are there a number of towers at your disposal, this is also a pretty good variety of tools, and an in game store that allows you to buy tools, unit slots, and other things that come in useful to help you fend of the enemies.\n\nWhen you first start the game, one of the more notable aspects is the art style.  It has a comical, fun style that is easy to appreciate, even if not ground-breaking.  I have to give credit to Playboom, an unknown developer for putting together something that is fun, challenging, is incredibly addictive, all for a remarkably low price of $1.99.\n\nIf you're looking for some mindless entertainment and don't require something that represents the high bar of technology, you might just want to give Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants a try.  For all of the things that it does right ?I recommend it.  My final score is a 7/10.","May 21","true","9.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It's basically the same concept with a few differences such as pig vikings instead of zombies, yes that's right I said PIG VIKINGS, also in addition to simply not being killed by the pig vikings you need to produce a certain number of each crop to earn a gold star for the level; crops are basically your sunflowers in this game, they produce food which gives you points to make weapon plants.

First and foremost, you can't just plant down your growth plants and expect them to instantly generate your resources. You end up having to water them first, which adds to another level of management, aside from placement of defenses. In addition to that, there appears to be a mechanic that involves collecting a certain number of fruit or vegetables from those plants in order to get a star for each level, though to be honest I'm not entirely sure what that adds aside from a sense of completion.\n\nThe watering mechanic seems to come further into play during later stages of the game from what I can tell, and... Well, actually makes for an interestingly frantic gameplay compared to the relatively slow looking animation of the pigs you're fighting. There's a lot to keep track of at once, but it never feels too disorienting, just... Like there's a lot to do and keep track of which is actually pretty good.\n\nSo, if I can edit, I will once I get further into the game, I'm only up to the level at which the player can unlock the greenhouse, so please bear with me for now. The greenhouse is about what you'd imagine from similar games, allowing the player to generate some coins and... In my opinion being a rather fun gameplay mechanic, but more likely than not that opinion stems from my appreciation of idle/incremental gaming.\n\nSo far, I'd give this game a 7/10, it's not perfect, the animations feel somewhat awkward in places and the art style isn't necessarily the most pleasing, but the gameplay itself is really solid and it's definitely worth picking up if you're a fan of similar games. Seriously though, it feels like there's a lot of content I'm missing, all things considered, so it's safe to say it's pretty packed with enough to keep you entertained for a while.\nThank you for reading if you did, and sorry for this being so drawn out.","February 15, 2015","true","4.7"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

Some foil trading cards are in short supply to the point of none available on the store. I previouly thought it meant the cards were bugged; however, I have come to understand it is just a low supply of cards. For example you will be unable to purchase the foil Cactus Holder. This means it is impossible to get the Foil Badge for this game at the moment. On the flip side, if you don't care about badges and only selling cards this might be a great opportunity.\n\nThe cards for this game are:Boss Boar bugged zero sellers\nCactus Holder bugged unlisted\nRocket Boar\nSkate Board Boar bugged zero sellers\nTurnip Mine bugged unlisted\nSoul Axiom has the same problem (if going for badges) / opportunity (if trying to get rare cards) by the way.","April 12, 2015","true","2.5"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","6"

I have beaten Plants vs Zombies like 5 times, So I wanted something simular and thought I could settle even if this game is not as good, however there are several reason this game is unplayable to me:\nDelayed/Sticky Input - You often try to click things and it doesnt work, or you click on something and cant get rid of it. Also, entering my profile name was hard, it shouldnt be hard to type a string in a box.\n\nOdd Resolution Issue - The game is constantly switching resolutions, from launching the game to playing the game, there can be up to 3 changes to resolution. (It also has no resolution chooses, and the one they picked is spectaciularly low, as with many low quality games)\n\nLacks Ummph - What I mean by this is im not connected to the story, or the units. Every plant in plant vs zombies, has some form of connection, (IE: Wall/Tallnuts cry when they are eaten) this game doesnt attempt any of this. Plus I dont want the zombies to eat my brains or my plants, but do I care about pigs raiding my farm? I guess I could become a pork farmer.\n\nGraphics - Could be better, could be worse. I find they hurt the eyes after awhile, Do not like them.\n\nTLDR - Unresponcive, Resolution issues, Bad graphics, Overall Poor. Play PVZ for the 6th time.","June 4","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
