Most of the faster cars have horrible handling making it downright impossible to avoid obstacles and keep up with the AI racers, but try to pick a car with better handling and you finish about 60 seconds behind due to the slow acceleration and top speeds. The extremely good AI racers take away a lot of the enjoyment of this game, and it's not a bad game by any means. It just needs a difficulty setting for casual players like me.","February 15, 2014","true","2.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I'm so glad its here on steam.\nI would recommend this for anyone who likes R/C cars or action racing.\nPlus, the driving physics are acctually fairly real for R/C cars (other than the ability to jump on command.)\n\nUpdate:\nFisrt off, if you're using a keyboard and mouse: RIP. You WILL need a controler for this game. Plus, it sucks that you can't set keycommands (or button commands or controler, you can only use the ones that they give you.\nTurns out the just first map is really the best (in terms of build quality.) The rest of the maps have a bunch of "mystical walls" or in other works invisible surfaces. With slower cars you don't really have to worry about these, but faster cars are required for certain races. Sometimes when you're flying down a stright-away your car just go flying to one side for no good reason. This can make it impossible to win some races against the OP A.I. with infinite N2O that was put in place for the "Knockout Races.\nDespite its cartoony look, its very competative game and can be hard to beat with all these glitches.\nI'm still glad they tried to bring it back, but why reinvent the wheel?\nI might still recommmend this game if it goes on sale, but $10 is a f***ing rip-off. (glad I got it on sale.)\nIf you're easily enraged; leave this page now/do not buy. If you don't mind the glitches mentioned, and like R/C cars; just get it when it goes on sale.\n(Sorry for typos, or misspellings, I'm stuck on this race where s*** keeps going wrong, and its p***ing me off.)

It feels like motorstorm but with crappy dirt trails in the way cars handle, the menus are obviously console oriented and what happened to fast paced responsive controls?? Really disappointed, the original game has such cool physics yet this reeks of an unfinished console port for a casual audience.\n\nI recommend the original RC Cars game, though in 4:3 resolution, the graphics are not far apart, yet the gameplay is much better","March 30, 2014","true","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I love how the cars handle.  I love the environment for its novelty and variety.  I love pulling off the jumps.  I love ramming people in the shin and making them hop on one foot.  I love the music.  The difficulty is just right, so I'll play a track a dozen times to get that gold medal.  I've never been big on racing games, but I'm glad I discovered this one.","September 3, 2012","true","32.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some nitro action and jumps... What more would you want. For starters better Xbox 360 controller support. Currently my gas button is the controllers start button. Feels weird to play like that but at least it works. Unsure if im going to be able to remap them using 3rd party utilities or just Google... I like the game though.","July 19, 2013","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ability to run your car into people's legs, boost and race in human territory makes the game incredibly fun and is a very non-serious racing game.","March 31, 2012","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It might be fun on the PS3 (I don't know if it is or not), but do not buy this game for your PC.  The huge deal breaker?  Gamepad support is COMPLETELY BROKEN.  The actual button layouts do not in any way correspond with the diagrams depicted (on a PS3 controller) in the options menu, and there is no way to edit the provided layouts.  The way controls are actually assigned to the gamepad is completely nonsensical and makes the game virtually unplayable.  I even attempted to play it using just a keyboard, but any racing game fan will tell you that you need analog steering controls to play a racing game.  Smash Cars is no exception.  Trying to play with the keyboard was a frustrating and messy experience.  Your only hope might be to use a steering wheel setup, but I wouldn't even count on that working properly.  This is obviously just an awful console port with zero post-release support.  I wasted my money on this crap.","May 15, 2012","false","2.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","3"
