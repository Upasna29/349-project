"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/371390/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Flix the Flea is a two button platformer where we play as some kind of mutant flea that snuck on-board into a space shuttle and is brought to space. If you were to skip the opening you would have no way of knowing you are in space as there are pterodactyls, bats and even trees. Granted it does take place in caves but why mention we are in space then? Nothing really makes sense which is not a bad thing but you see all this game has to offer in the first mission. Each level feels very similar even though they are visually different. There is a life system and if you lose all of them it is back to the beginning of the game.\n\nThe only way to lose your life is if you touch a  pterodactyl that flies around the stage. It is a lot easier said than done as the screen is far too zoomed in and everytime you jump you will have no idea what lies ahead.  Most of the time that leads to you following down all the way to the bottom since pterodactyls do have a huge arrow pointing at their location when near that also makes a highly annoying warning alert. But it is not uncommon to land directly on top of one and die. There is a shield powerup that allows you to take up to two hits which comes in handy.\n\nJumping itself is pretty simple and works well enough. As said before there are only two buttons. One to jump to the left and one to jump to the right. The longer you hold down a button the further and higher you jump. It works well enough when the game is not demanding precise platforming but it does feel like a lot of trial and error as you can't really see where you are heading until you take the jump and get a better feel for the level. Bugs and stars both litter the stages for you to collect and add to your highscore but I don't believe it adds lives once you reach enough. Though I did not bother collecting most and may be wrong.\n\nWhich brings me to my main problem with the game. It can only be played in a tiny window with no way to increase it's size or play in fullscreen. That may not be matter to some people but I find it worth mentioning as I personally can not stand playing in a window. There are no graphic options which doesn't really matter much since this game is not demanding at all. Graphically it is not a bad or good looking game. It is acceptable and does the job. There is no way to rebind the keys which may bother some as the default keys are left arrow and right arrow. Flix the Flea is really lacking in any options and is as bare-bones as they get.\n\nUnfortunately the music in this game doesn't fare any better than the rest of it. It is mediocre but the main issue is that it is very short and loops over and over again with no option to turn it off. It is one song throughout the whole game which will be burned into your consciousness by the end of it. The jumping and bug crunching sound effects sound fine but the pterodactyl's screech is obnoxious. Repetition sets in fast due to all these factors and Flix the Flea doesn't do anything to remedy that issue in later levels. Instead it focuses more on precise platforming which just don't work well with the way you move in this game.\n\nThe novelty of only using two buttons is a good one but executed poorly. It is a very low budget game made by one person but I'm afraid I still can't recommend it. There is just very little fun to be found here and your time could be better spent elsewhere. Slamming into walls while trying to jump to the exit can be entertaining for a while though it quickly loses it's fun when the levels start to demand more precision. The only reason to play this game is if you got it through a bundle and want to collect it's trading cards. Which is actually broken and no cards can drop during the time of this review. It's kind of a shame to slam down such an obscure game but it simply isn't worth a recommendation.","June 11, 2015","false","1.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","1"

The game is like this: hold the button to jump right or left as long as you think should be enough (for the jump power) and do that over and over again to get higher and higher to the top.

However, Tetris’ simple gameplay belies difficulty scaling, amazing music and an addictive streak that borders on brutal. Flix the Flea has none of these things and is essentially an 8 bit game dressed up to look appealing and run more smoothly (Bugaboo the Flea, which in fairness the developer freely discusses). I admit, watching the gameplay videos I almost feel a pang of regret no longer having access to the game. But then I remember.....I remember the jumping mechanic (I really wish Flix could walk a little), the unappealing objective of jumping to the top of the levels, and the slightly bizarre miniature pterodactyl. Because that’s essentially the long and the short of it, charge jump, pray you land ok, repeat. It’d be wonderful to elucidate on other features or challenges (yes you can collect things, no it doesn’t make the game more fun), but that’s basically it.\n\nIf the idea of holding down one key or another to charge a jump sounds infinitely repeatable, fun and challenging then this is the game for you. Otherwise, if you’re looking at owning a Psychotic Software game, then pick the other one (Power Up), which is a lot more fun.","April 28","false","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Flix the Flea is a game that functions as a semi-platformer, with, according to the developer, inspiration from classical 8-bit game of old. The idea behind the game is something which I like, but the execution of this idea just does not live up to my expectations of the game.\n\nPros:\n-Interesting mechanic using charge-up bar to jump higher\n-Reasonably well designed levels\n-Very few bugs from what I could see\n\nCons:\n-The controls. You use 2 buttons to get around by jumping sideways to reach the platforms. This becomes frustrating as it is difficult to gauge where the platforms are, and more than likely you will just keep missing them\n-Only runs in windowed mode, with not many options available\n-The enemy are annoying as they follow you when you are trying to jump. This makes it extremely difficult to progress\n-Soundtrack and SFX was annoying to me and just added to my frustration as I repeatedly died\n\nThis game had potential to be a fun little platformer, but due to difficulty and the sound, it's more of a frustrating journey than anything else.\n4/10","May 18","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
