I really loved the idea of this.  The sneak/hack genre is wonderful.  My problem is that I have completed the game in 48 minutes.  That includes some interruptions as well.  There is simply not enough content here to justify a game.  At the end, I wondered if I was just playing the demo.","July 14, 2014","false","0.8"," 129 of 144 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","129","144","0","0"

Controls and gameplay are pretty simple. You sneak using WASD avoiding guards and cameras, can unlock the doors (E), hack (Q), kill guards and civilians (SPACE), hide their bodies (2) and change outfit (3). You will also find and read some documents to understand what happened to you. That's it if I don't miss anything.\n\nGameplay, story, music and minimalistic cyberpunk'ish graphics style are pretty satisfying, I can definitely say I enjoyed them all as well as the game on the whole. Yes, the game is short and won't take much your time to be completed on 100%.\n\nPros:\n+ Simple controls\n+ Nice-looking cyberpunk'ish graphics\n+ Story (despite it might seem typical)\n+ Soundtrack (special thanks to Gavin Harrison !)\n+ Short (yeah, it's a + as I don't need to put dozens of hours into a tiny game)\n+ Easy to beat for 100% (apparently, a + for anyone who isn't indifferent to achievements)\n\nCons:\n- Short (I doubt anyone would complain if the game were longer)\n- Pricey\n- Low replay value\n\nI'm literally forced to pay attention to the price. Yes, guys, I agree the game is pricey. I also understand some disappointment and comments and reviews saying "lack of content", "too short" and agree. Store page is a really promissing one and raises your expectations from the game. My thoughts were like "Ouch, it's like a mix of my beloved Monaco (50+ hours played) and Frozen Synapse (well-known and highly acclaimed by critics and players), I should check in out". That's why I've purchased and played "Light".\nHowever, I don't think the fact the game is pretty expensive (for the content it offers) gives the right to leave a "Thumbs Down". I enjoyed this tiny game (I'd especially highlight its music), got a +1 perfect game, learned several new English words (despite it has a Russian localization, I played it in English), didn't invest much time in it and I've also supported indie game developers. I don't regret doing all that and in general cannot say anything bad about "Light", that's why - my "Thumbs Up"!\n\nSome notes/recommendations to developers:\n• Add more content and reduce the price. Seriously. Mentioned Monaco offers you a huge amount of multi-level missions, 8 characters, up to 4 players online co-op, story with its charm and humour as well as soundtrack by Austin Wintory[austinwintory.bandcamp.com], Steam-features like leaderboards, cloud, Workshop + level editor but is still priced less. Something is wrong here ...\n• Probably, add more achievements (to pass each level unspotted / under some defined or devs' time / to kill all guards on a level etc). At least it will increase players' playtime and will add some challenge. This point completely depends on your attitude to achievements and your fantasy/creativity :)\n• Probably, add Steam leaderboards (competition spirit, you know). I doubt it will be worth doing, but still, that's what comes to my mind\n\nP.S. You won't lose anything if you don't play this game, but you will likely enjoy it if you do. And Steam is not the place where you can complain about the price. Even just released games are offered literally tomorrow with a good discount (my example: bought Asteria that was released a bit more than a week ago with a -75% coupon received for badge crafting). Countless bundles popup almost every day. You're warned multiple times about the price and content mismatch, so you are free to buy the game when it's on sale or comes to a bundle. Then you'll be more prone to share some love with "Light".","July 16, 2014","true","2.3"," 72 of 89 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","72","89","0","3"

You see everything: basically, where all the guards and cameras are, and their field of view; however, you can't zoom out: the game annoys you by not giving you a complete overview, because otherwise it'd be too easy (which it arguably already is).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/271730/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Note: video review embedded below.\n\nIt’s tough to review a game that’s only distinguishable by the pieces it borrows from its contemporaries. I don’t mean to simply say that Light brings nothing new to the table, but that it actively feels like a collage of other games stitched together in the hopes of success by association.\n\nWhether it’s aping Hotline Miami’s style, Monaco’s varied action stealth design, or Gunpoint hacking interface, I could barely make out what exactly Light itself was under the influx of familiarity. Perhaps I’d have been at least partially OK with that had Light managed to match the quality of its inspiration, but the distressing blankness and ineptitude it presents itself with makes it hard to accept it as even a rudimentary clone.\n\nWhat’s more, Light seems to have no idea itself what it wants to do, and consistently places bets into the areas it’s weakest. The skeleton of a plot attempting to give context to a collection of squares is played out and terribly structured, yet more often than not it’s placed at the forefront of the game and is usually your only sense of motivation within a level. Without it there’s no setting or continuity to anything you do, but with it you’re stuck with a mess of unexplained motives and hazy details on some elaborate corporate plot that apparently justifies you mass murdering its security personnel.\n\nMechanically, Light is somehow in even greater disarray. In an era where stealth games are more impressive and dynamic than ever, Light is an embarrassment of shoddy AI and minimal depth. Though you need only avoid your enemies vision cones, audial awareness having missed the cut completely, Light still manages to become confusing and frustrating through the combination of horrendous controls and an unclear aesthetic.\n\nYour character controls as if he’s walking through an ice rink, sliding around clumsily and allowing little room for precise control or quick reflexes. If you screw up your path you’re almost certainly dead, unless you somehow can maneuver yourself next to an enemy and kill them first, a task sufficiently complicated by randomly clipping on the environment while hoping the controls don’t spazz out completely.\n\nMost times I was caught however were do to never having seen the enemy in my path at all. With the entire game rendered in shades of blue and different light sources being impossible to distinguish from each other, enemy view cones often snuck up on me having blended into the background or somehow glimpse me through a wall I didn’t realize was actually a window. Somehow for as simple as everything about Light is, it finds ways to fabricate difficulty spikes by making everything as dysfunctional as possible, yet always with a complete lack of self-awareness.\n\nHaving run through the Light in under an hour, I’m rather surprised I’ve even managed to even write this much about a game that’s nothing if not hollow. For as great as the games Light heavily borrows from may be, its only unique contribution is a less sophisticated and functional amalgamation of their parts. As far as food analogies are concerned, Light is asking you to settle for spoiled lunch meat, as if you haven’t already seen the mountain of steak nearby.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjREiJPqb8\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 6, 2015","false","1.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","2"

The game can easily be completed in one sitting, no high doses of caffeine to stay awake needed. i managed to complete half the game in 0.3 hours before I grew slightly bored.\n\nThe missions tend to be the same, sneak in, avoid people and cameras, silently kill and disguise yourself and then hacking terminals. Once all terminals are hacked, and items found, you can go to the exit. The game is very much a 2D hitman with lots of colour and less things to do - there are no special ways of disposing of the security other than just normal attacking or silent attacking. The idea is good, but so much more could have been added - such as trip mines then using a distract ability to get the security to run over the trip mine to get to a noise you made.\n\nI would recommend the game if it was cheap, but the current price is just asking too much for such a simple and quick to beat video game. It is very much something you would have seen on a Flash Game website.","July 15, 2014","false","0.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keohookalani/recommended/271730/","keohookalani","keohookalani","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keohookalani/","2712 products in account","Light is a simplistic stealth game with an interesting story. Different from most other Stealth games I personally have played, Light drops you in the middle of a conspiracy where you wake up knowing nothing. Light reminds me of Monaco, but with some of the most useful abilities all rolled up into one character.\n\nGetting the hang of Light is pretty basic. WASD move you around, E causes you to interact with objects, while 2 and 3 have their own uses I will not get into, lest I spoil some of the fun. One minor difference from Monaco is that the guards in Light do not ever give up. Once you have been spotted, they come looking for you. Further, if you are detected, then you only have 2 minutes to complete the mission before reinforcements arrive. Honestly, this makes sense to me.\n\nWhere as Monaco is slapstick silly with humor that just seems to be used to lighten the mood, Stealth has none. You are merely driven to complete the Story and find out what is going on.\n\nThe music in Light was pretty entertaining and for once I didn't actually listen to anything else while playing it.\n\nI wish controls could be readjusted, however, joy2win can solve this problem for you. A nice feature called peek is introduced which allows you to point your mouse in a direction and right click giving you a peek of that area. You'll have to try it to understand.\n\nThe graphics are very simplistic, but for what the game does, not much more is needed. Things that need some detail, are detailed. Those that do not, are not. Could more effort have been put into it? Absolutely, however, the game isn't designed that way on purpose. It features an interesting matrix of graphic features that make you worry about sight lines, and whether or not you can be seen. Personally I find this entertaining as it keeps you fairly focused.\n\nThe biggest problem here is the price tag. At 12.99 this game is seriously overpriced. While the dev has promised additional content, nothing yet has been seen of which I am aware. Due to the pricing issue here, the game is being knocked a few overall points. I didn't notice the price tag when I started playing.\n\nOverall: 7.2/10 - Get it in a bundle or at a serious discount and you can add a point and a half. Don't pay $13 for this... currently not worth it and it feels like it's been abandoned by the dev.","May 12","true","6.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Looking at the pictures you would not think it has a story as the square-shaped characters all represent the employees of a multinational company with a sinister agenda.\n\nAnd while it is interesting to find out who you are and what the company is after just because there are intel files scattered across the dozen levels I would not call this a "gripping narrative". On almost every level you need to find the exit while avoiding the cone of vision the company guards have. Regularly, you need to hack a terminal or the door but the hacking is simply done with the press of a button without the inclusion of any minigames.\n\nThe problem with Light is that the text the creators came up with that appears on the store page is misleading - it simply makes us believe that this is a more complex game than what it really is. This is not necessarily a problem - especially if a game has a great soundtrack such as Light - but Light's gripping tale suddenly ends after 12 levels. Half of which can be completed in a mere half an hour.

Great minimalistic look, tight controls and nice hacking in the heat of the moment to open doors, acquire data, shut security cameras off so you can find the information you need and escape. the stealth mechanics are simple and great, as you see in the pictures it's all about the enemies field of vision and, you, and the objects between the two, don't be in their vision and use the surrounding objects to hide from them. One cool thing too is that you can knock anyone out and wear their cloths to disguise your self in front of security cameras (not enemies though) and hide their dead bodies in like a closet. The story is also nice where you have lost your memories and are set to acquire more information about yourself and the company that's out to capture you. Didn't finish the game, so i don't know how many levels there are, but so far I'm liking the game. Wouldn't mind seeing a level editor with Steam workshop to have a lot of community levels.\n\nUpdate: Just noticed you see all the levels in the begging, there are 13, and I'm half way through. Knowing how many levels there is (that get harder the further you progress), it isn't that many concidering i finished 7 of them in less than an hour.

Worse, it's told clumsily (e.g. confidential project journal entries printed out and scattered in the company's lobby, to name one of the less stupid moments). The gameplay looks interesting, but in the absence of level design to hold it together ultimately boils down to "run around, tap at yellow things, avoid red things". The guard AI is dull and seems to have been rostered from extremely nearsighted personnel who all forgot to bring their contact lenses to work. The "hacking" looked cool in the trailer but does not actually lead to any interesting possibilities, instead acting as a red-key-blue-key-green-key series of hotspots.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty good, though.","July 15, 2014","false","1.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

It's too bad. Still, I won't hesitate to buy the next game from this studio. They have tons of talent and now have very clear feedback on what they need to focus on next time. Seems like a guaranteed hit. Good luck!\n\nOLD REVIEW BELOW\nWow, great game! Why then am I saying don't buy it? Because it's an hour long. It's also not really challenging at all. I failed 3 levels and the rest I passed on my first try. What we have here are a team of great artist, composer, programer and project manager but completely lacking a dedicated or talented level designer(sorry to offend this person). The game just isn't long enough or challenging and without a massive community of mod makers this game is theft at $9. If you can get it for $5, go for it.\n\nI will definitely buy the inevitable multiplayer sequel.","July 14, 2014","false","1.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

So my opinion is a bit more neutral but certainly not negative, hence the "yes" recommendation.  Basically, you have to sneak your way past guards and security cameras, hacking computers as you go to open doors or turn off cameras, in order to clear a set of basic puzzle-like levels that involve gathering information and such to figure out why you're in the situation you are here.  The better you are at hiding and remaining unseen, and the faster you complete the levels, the higher your score.  You can see the cones of view of guards and cameras though, which helps in figuring out when and where to move.  Combat is an option though, and you can kill guards or bystanders and disguise yourself as them, though this typically decreases your score.  It also frequently triggers a 2-minute countdown until reinforcements arrive, meaning you'll likely be in more trouble if you can't finish the level before then.  The story was nice and the music was good, both of which helped keep my interest especially when I had trouble passing levels.  The graphics and game mechanics are simple, but those seem to work in the game's favor, making it easy to understand and play.\n\nHowever, the game is on the short side, as many reviews before have said.  As I write this, there are only 12 levels in the game and they didn't seem particularly large, but I've read that the develers do plan to add more content.  Once you figure out how to clear the levels, they're probably only a few minutes long each, at most.  It took me a bit over 3 hours to finish the game while trying to remain undetected and not killing people if I could avoid it.  I'm not sure how some people are finishing this in less than 1 hour -- maybe I'm just bad at stealth games and/or they're really good at them.  But for me, it was a decent length even if it did involve replaying the same few levels a bunch of times, and wasn't as frustrating as some stealth games can be for me.\n\nAlso, there doesn't seem to be very much replay value here.  Sure, you can replay levels trying to improve your score, but that probably isn't much fun after a while.  Achievements aren't a big draw here either, as you'll get 12 out of 13 simply by clearing each level in the game.  I guess figuring out the last one is the trick.  But once you complete the game, there doesn't seem to be very much to encourage you to replay it.\n\nThe price may be the biggest drawback here:  $13 is a lot to pay for a 12-level game with limited replay value that can be completed in a few hours if you're not a good player and less than 1 hour if you are.  It does come with the soundtrack (in .wav format though), which helps cover the price a bit, but it still seems like the $/hour value here isn't that great, especially if you're good at stealth games and end up breezing through this.  I got this in a recent Humble Bundle and at the effective price I paid there, I think it was worth it.  But given the length/duration/replay notes above, I wouldn't suggest paying full price for this -- watch and wait for a sale instead.  I think you'll enjoy this game a lot more, whether or not you're a fan of stealth games, if you can get it at a nice discount.","November 15, 2014","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Those familiar with the Metal Gear Solid series will be familiar with the phrase and know what it means, but to the uninitiated, Light is a minimalist stealth game where your number one objective is to complete simple "find the item, hack the consoles" while staying out of the enemies' and cameras' cones of vision.\n\nThere's really not that much more to the game. Avoid cones, access data, and engage in a simple hacking mechanic to open doors and shut off cameras.  Coming in at a very small twelve missions, it shouldn't take anyone who grasps the mechanics quickly enough that long to complete, and there's not really much else to engage with beyond getting better scores on each mission.\n\nLight makes for a pretty fun one or two hour experience, but the price tag may be just a tad high for how little content there is and how simple the mechanics are. Had the hacking and disguise systems been fleshed out just a tad more and the narrative been a bit more involved, I'd have considered it somewhere close to the level of Gunpoint. At its current price however, it's probably best to hold off for a sale or permanent price drop before committing.","September 21, 2014","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can change your suit (aka disguise) for suit of killed civilian or guard.

The gameplay is exactly as they show it, not much more, not any less.  The graphics are alright, as well as the sounds and music.  There's a story there, but it's not anything way over the top, and it's obviously not the focus of the game.  Therefore, if you like what you see in the trailers, than you might like the actual game.\n\nWhere the issue comes in is the game's length compared to its cost.  At only 12 levels, all but two or three of which can be easily solved in under a minute or two, it's quite possible to see literally all this game has to offer in under a half an hour, even if you don't manage to rush your way through every map.\n\nThere is obviously much more that could be done with this in terms of content (additional levels, level editor, diverging story paths), and mechanics (more hacking options outside of unlocking doors and disabling cameras, additional enemy types or obstacles) which people may come to expect from such a game, but the developers chose to keep it simple, and I don't feel misled.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game, and it plays as expected, it's just far too short, especially considering the current price.","July 20, 2014","false","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/absolutelynotneo/recommended/271730/","absolutelynotneo","Herr Stannis Drachen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/absolutelynotneo/","955 products in account","Light is a top-down stealth game with a rather beautiful visual style. Despite its very simplistic graphics, and the representation of characters as squares, the game does a really good job with aestethics, pleasantly combining its blue-ish colour palette with nice shadow and lighting effects. The sound is equally minimalistic, with only a few sound effects being featured, while the music selection is ok and appropriate in the context, but after a while it can get quite irritating.\nOver the course of around 12 missions, you will have to try and sneak around, avoiding patroling guards and security cameras while accomplishing your tasks per each map. These range from hacking a terminal to collecting intelligence, and often require getting to one specific computer, from which you can deactivate cameras and open locked doors, then backtrack or find the newely opened access point. Guards have a standard route they follow, and they don't deviate from it unless they spot you. This makes the game trial-and-error based, which can be quite fun an times, and frustrating at others. Wearing a disguise makes the guards' area of detection considerably smaller, so that it's much easier to navigate around the maps.\nKilling guards is possible, but only from close range, and it's not recommended, since it will eventually alert other guards, and they will call for reinforcements. This will also considerably lower your score for each level, not that it matters in any way except for personal satisfaction. I played the whole game stealthily and avoiding detection, and it took me around 2 hours to complete the game 100%. If you don't attempt to do this, you might be able to finish it in under an hour. The plot is interesting, but sometimes confusing\nIn a nutshell, Light is a pleasant experience, and if you play it stealthily, it will boost both your satisfaction and your gametime (though not by much). However, considering its length, the 12 euro price is absolutely ridiculous. I got it in a Humble Bundle, so it's perfectly fine, but if I were to buy it individually, I would not spend more than 3 euros on it. My recommendation : wait for a 75% off sale.","January 17, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It's quite short (you can finish it in uder an hour), the controls are simple, and the levels are rather small. Still, I recommend it; after all, a game doesn't have to be incredibly long, full of complex mechanics, or with huge levels to be captivating.\n\nThe art style, for example, is beautiful, and so is the soundtrack. It really sets the tone for a stealth game in which you sneak around hacking systems while trying to recover your memory. As far as the stealth system goes, you must avoid getting spotted by security guards and cameras; civilians won't do anything if the spot you. You must be aware of their patrols, and their range of vision; you can peek around to see if the coast is clear, and you can also use disguises. Although, unlike other games with stealth and disguises involved, using a disguise doesn't make the security guards friendly, they just reduce their range of vision (which means they'll spot you only when you're close to them). You can kill the guards (and even the civilians) and hide their bodies, but it won't go unnoticed, as you'll have some time before they send in reinforcements.\n\nThe hacking mechanic is also a simple one. You just need to approach the terminal you're willing to hack, and hold E until you hack it. After that, you can enter "Hack mode" even when you're away from the terminal, and, in this mode, you can disable security cameras and open locked doors.\n\nThe story is the typical "guy who lost his memory uncovers a conspiracy while trying to regain it", but it's still interesting, as you find notes and hack into systems looking for info about it.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a nice, albeit short, stealth game.","December 11, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Only 4 disguises was a bit too little, I would have liked to have seen a bit more variety.\n\nStory-wise, the game builds up and up and up and up and then stops. The climax never really comes, you just end up in a prison and escape. The rest of the story is boring and un-memorable.\n\nGameplay. No. Not good. The game really tries to push the "sneak - hack - steal" gameplay, but overall rushing was the best and quickest tactic. Just running through mashing space and sometimes pressing E worked surprisingly well. Guards had Metal Gear syndrome, where they couldn't see anything UNLESS you were in the default clothing, in which case they were eagles. Also, having a guard disguise did nothing different to a civillian disguise. This really took me out of the "stealth" part of this game because just killing a civillian and switching costumes, then leaving the body there had the same effect as sneakily killing a guard, switching his costume, putting him in a cupboard and stealthily running away. 2 minutes until reinforcements and a disguise.\n\nAchievements were laughable, just complete the game to get all of them. The disguise achievement just kill someone  and mash "3" for a while and you'll get it.\n\nLevels - 12. Not enough. I played the game mostly stealthy and beat it in ~72 minutes. Speedrunning the game would take ~18 minutes, maybe less. Workshop support and a level editor would make the game long enough for the £10 they are charging. By my logic, a game should cost £1-£2 per hour. This game costs £10 an hour. Yay.\n\nOverall rating - 4/10 - Not worth your time.

The gameplay can be challenging at times, particularly if you are trying to go quiclkly through the game, and the story is fairly compelling - I found it very interesting to actually read all of the story related parts. Also, the game has some great music and sound effects.\n\nWhile I do think this game is a lot of fun, it is extremely short; you will likely only get an hour or two out of it, unless you want to redo levels to try and get a higher score. Due to the length of the game, some people probably won't think the price is worth it, which is fair enough as it is fairly expensive for the amount of time you can really spend in the game. I think with the addition of a level editor or something along those lines would make it well worth the cost for anyone however, since the game itself is as I said quite good, just very very short.\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay, here's a link to a quick 2 minute long video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8n_YASVsrc\n\nAnd if you would like a more indepth look at some later levels without any story spoilers, here's a link to a more detailed video that is approximately 15 mins long: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9fBf2yHC1Q&feature=youtu.be","July 14, 2014","true","1.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Light is a fun little stealth/action game, the stealth mechanics are fairly typical (disguises, hiding bodies etc.) but unless they are a specific mission requirement they're often not essential to make progress in the game.\n\nFor me personally it just turned into a quick dash around the levels trying to kill the bad guys and get out, this was largely due to the fact that the stealth mechanics seemed fairly irrelevant (you can disguise yourself but enemies still spot and react to you in the same way). Overall Light doesn't quite deliver on its premise and it certainly isn't worth the full asking price but for a very low price or in a bundle it's definitley an entertaining diversion.\n\nhttp://jamesvssteam.blogspot.co.uk/","January 28","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

What was delivered is a slightly too fast, hollow game with nice graphical design. Just a few points regarding gameplay: The complete lack of intelligence behind all the non-security NPCs is dissapointing - I don't know why they randomly wander about doing very little aside from sitting and pooping, and have no kind of reaction to external stimuli whatsoever. The unecessarily pumpy soundtrack would make more sense in an action game, and the overly fast movement makes any real feelings of fear of capture null and void. Why can nobody see over the tops of tables? The quick retry option, whilst nice for fast paced gameplay, makes it feel like there is no real penalty for death. And the achievements? One for passing each of the short levels, and kill a collection of random NPCs to change outft repeatedly - that's it. Nothing relating to getting through a level undetected, or locking a security guard in a room via hacking, or maybe even killing every guard in a level without hurting the civilians.\n\nAll the features of this game (aside from the perspective and visual style) where polished to a mirror sheen in games like Gunpoint and Mark of the Ninja, with more interesting stories, whilst also providing more engaging gameplay. It had potential, with an interesting aesthetic and the opportunity to innovate, but it falls flat.","November 15, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However I can understand the curve being a bit of a sharp increase, given how few levels there are.\n\nI was left a bit nonplussed at the end, when it abruptly cut to credits without any closiure as to whether my actions saved the world after all.\n\nI would still recommend this game though as it was entertaining.","July 15, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yet, this game doubles as a melee only top down action game where you can literally speedrun the game in 15 minutes, or less by simply killing everything by repeadedly pressing space and suprising guards around corners. It even has the "press R to restart" I feel like I'm back in Hotline Miami. It's scoring system is meant to deter you from making the stealth game play like an action game, but scores don't matter! The real incentive is the amount of fun you have when taking out all the backup they throw at you when you've murdered every poor innocent square and guard there is on that level. I mean sure, you can actually do the objectives, they're super straightforward and easy, but the real enjoyment is in surviving waves upon waves of the backup.

But the bigger issue here is that the game is fundamentally and conceptually strong, but the execution of these concepts fall real short. It's like a sad thing more than an angry one.\n\nBy all means, if you value money, don't get this for $15. There is no point whatsoever. Short on content, undeveloped ideas and a pretty easy game to be honest. Wishlist the game and get it when it goes on a deep discount ($5 or less preferably).","July 31, 2014","false","2.5"," 6 of 30 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","6","30","0","0"

I got it in a bundle so I probably paid 40-50p for it. I probably wouldn't pay anymore than £1 for it... mainly because I spent about 35 minutes on it and completed it. There are about 12 levels on it and they are fairly short levels, probably complete them in around 2 minutes. They aren't that challenging however it could probably be a little more challenging, if you were to stealth it all the way.\nHowever, the game doesn't really reward you for any of that, you may get a few extra points but they are essentially pointless as it offers no extra reward and gives you no incentive. Also because of this lack of extra reward or incentive, replayability is not really a thing...\n\nAlso, there could've been much nicer stealth with the added mechanics such as disguise and hide body. Hide body allows you to hide your assasinated corpse into a cupboard so the guards don't spot it and alert the police. It seems that backup is called as soon as you kill someone, so it doesn't seem that helpful as whenever I had a body spotted, I didn't notice any extra guards/police spawn.\nDisguise also seems to be useless, the only useful thing is to get the achievement and to change your colour. Apart from that, security cameras still spot you and so do guards so to say it disguises you is something of a dirty lie... A dirty, dirty lie!\n\nThe game is nice and simple though, basic graphics and simple gameplay. It was fun for that half an hour but I doubt I'll be replaying any time soon... Maybe leave it on to get the rest of the steam trading cards (the only incentive I can see for playing it longer than half an hour). I would only urge you to buy it if you like the game and it's not anymore expensive than £1.\n\nEDIT: I have just seen that they are incorporating level editor into it. This would definately change my review and most of the criticism I have for it and hope that it will be incorporated sooner rather than later!","January 17, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I read some reviews which let me down at first but I jumped in to check for myself.\n\nPros:\n-Art: I do like the blueprintish 2D view from above.\n-Controls: Controls respond well.\n-FPS: The game is running well without any problem on my Nvidia 580.\n-Stealth: Stealth is efficient, you need to stay out of the vision of the guardc and cctv.This is rather easy most of the time (if you get a guard outfit the vision of all the enemy gets reduced by 2, it is then very easy to get out of sight of everybody)\n-Punishment: If you get caught, depending where you are of course but there is a high probability that the guards will find you and one shoot you. This is good as its avoid the raise alarm run all over the place and everybody gets reset asap. As the level aren't that big it is ok to die.\n-Level design: The level aren't very big, which is good when you die and have to restart at the beginning.\n\nCons:\n-Art: It takes time and trial to understand some of the object (like windows took me 10 run to see the difference and why that guard was seeing me despite being inside a room).\n-Doors: As soon as you get too close from a door it opens automaticaly, it is annoying if you want to peek inside and see the most of the room.\n-Kills: All the time, the only option is killing the guard and "innocent people" ? Despite the description of the game saying "Stash unconscious guards in cupboards", if I kill them, they will be dead and not unconscious.\n-Story: The story will be forgot as soon as you close the game, even the mission objectives lack excitment sometimes and it's a little all over the place.\n-Hacking: The prologue was not clear on one point. When you hack a terminal, you can access the item unlocked at anytime and you don't have to stay near the terminal you hacked.\n\nI quite enjoyed the game but it lacks on several points.\nSpecialy when it comes to time. It took me an hour and a half to go through all the game, I have seen reviews which indicate they closed the game in under an hour)\nThe story isn't memorable, I was reading it but just to be sure I wasn't missing anything. You won't play for the story (better for you to play gunpoint if you want something similar with a bit more of story and being able to choose your path in it).\n\nI do like to compare game to movie when it comes to price as this is, for me, interactive entertainements.\nFor about a bit more than an hour I would expect the price of the game to be similar to a movie theatre ticket (around 7/8euros in France), I got the game on sale for 6euros which suits me well.\n\nI do recommend the game despite being so short. It was fun to play it.\nThis game is probably for people who love stealth game and want a game that can be finish in the evening.\n\nLuuna.","January 3, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not BAD, but it's far from good.\n\n\nLight is a... mini game with simple graphics, simple control and a nice soundtrack. You are an unknown person who has lost his memory and you are trying to escape an unknown compound while finding out what happened to you. Sounds like a story and it is. Actually, this whole game is all about the story, everything else comes in second.\n\nThe game is super minimalistic: you are a blue block, neutral people are white block and hostiles are red. The world is made of lines, blocks, security cameras and lines of sight. What you need to do in each level is complete a few tasks, read little chunks of a story that unfolds as you progress and finally find an exit at each level and progress on to the next.\n\nTo be honest, Light feels more like a demo of a bigger game or just a simple demo of a game engine. The controls are very simple (direction moves, attack, hack, use) and levels are very, very short. If you know your way around, you can complete most levels in under a minute and be done with the whole game in less than 20! On my first (and only) run, it took me 45 minutes to complete the whole game. I can't say I enjoyed it, I can't say I disliked it. It was just one of those games that you go through and forget about them after a good night sleep.\n\nOh yes, the game  has 13 achievements and you will get them all as you play the game. 12 are for completing levels and 1 for using a disguise 15 times. The disguise one is as simple as using a single item 15 times on the very first level. They are that easy.\n\nOverall, the game is not worth its current price ($12/€12).

I read some reviews which let me down at first but I jumped in to check for myself.\n\nPros:\n-Art: I do like the blueprintish 2D view from above.\n-Controls: Controls respond well.\n-FPS: The game is running well without any problem on my Nvidia 580.\n-Stealth: Stealth is efficient, you need to stay out of the vision of the guardc and cctv.This is rather easy most of the time (if you get a guard outfit the vision of all the enemy gets reduced by 2, it is then very easy to get out of sight of everybody)\n-Punishment: If you get caught, depending where you are of course but there is a high probability that the guards will find you and one shoot you. This is good as its avoid the raise alarm run all over the place and everybody gets reset asap. As the level aren't that big it is ok to die.\n-Level design: The level aren't very big, which is good when you die and have to restart at the beginning.\n\nCons:\n-Art: It takes time and trial to understand some of the object (like windows took me 10 run to see the difference and why that guard was seeing me despite being inside a room).\n-Doors: As soon as you get too close from a door it opens automaticaly, it is annoying if you want to peek inside and see the most of the room.\n-Kills: All the time, the only option is killing the guard and "innocent people" ? Despite the description of the game saying "Stash unconscious guards in cupboards", if I kill them, they will be dead and not unconscious.\n-Story: The story will be forgot as soon as you close the game, even the mission objectives lack excitment sometimes and it's a little all over the place.\n-Hacking: The prologue was not clear on one point. When you hack a terminal, you can access the item unlocked at anytime and you don't have to stay near the terminal you hacked.\n\nI quite enjoyed the game but it lacks on several points.\nSpecialy when it comes to time. It took me an hour and a half to go through all the game, I have seen reviews which indicate they closed the game in under an hour)\nThe story isn't memorable, I was reading it but just to be sure I wasn't missing anything. You won't play for the story (better for you to play gunpoint if you want something similar with a bit more of story and being able to choose your path in it).\n\nI do like to compare game to movie when it comes to price as this is, for me, interactive entertainements.\nFor about a bit more than an hour I would expect the price of the game to be similar to a movie theatre ticket (around 7/8euros in France), I got the game on sale for 6euros which suits me well.\n\nI do recommend the game despite being so short. It was fun to play it.\nThis game is probably for people who love stealth game and want a game that can be finish in the evening.\n\nLuuna.","January 3, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then the credits are rolling, you’ll have at least 12 of the 13 achievements and absolutely no reason to revisit this ever again.\n\nLight is essentially a top down stealth game, the only problem being that stealth is almost entirely unnecessary due to the ability to kill guards, simple level design and a general difficulty factor of “Non-existent.” Game mechanics such as being able to drag enemy bodies and hide them in lockers are quickly revealed to be utterly pointless, while hacking is little more than a delayed standard interaction. Even the threat of enemy reinforcements, a two-minute timer counting down from the moment you make your first kill, means very little - in the unlikely event that they manage to arrive before you beat the level, they’re just as easy to dispose of as regular enemies. There is no tension, no frantic escapes or desperate assaults, and consequently the game ends up feeling nothing like a stealth game and more like a 2D walking simulator.\n\nWhich might not be so bad if the story was compelling. Told entirely in text boxes just a little too small (and with words that often miss out the letter L. Intentional or not, it’s distracting), it begins on the cliché of “waking with amnesia” and never really recovers. There’s no hook - vital to any game storyline, let alone a game of this length - and the little boxes of text soon become as pointless as the ability to disguise yourself in a guard’s clothes. Beyond that, the narrative simply doesn’t gel with a game world in which the people are, well, cubes. Minimalism and storytelling worked for Thomas Was Alone because of a fantastic voiceover and a solid few hours of gameplay. Both are missing here, and it’s impossible for me to imagine anyone walking away from the story feeling inspired, enlightened or otherwise impressed.\n\nThe graphics and audio really are Light’s saving graces, then, and they work in almost perfect symphony. With a perspective that immediately invokes Hotline Miami, the distinct visuals allow Light to take on an identity of its own with striking environments that create a perfect blend of digital and reality. The music is similarly terrific, providing an atmospheric soundtrack with an air of the suspenseful and the ominous, without ever straying too close to downbeat. It’s mostly enjoyable on its own, too, which makes the soundtrack's inclusion with purchases of the game a nice touch.\n\nBut in the end, there’s simply not enough content here, or content that plays well, to justify spending anything more than the cost of a (cheap) coffee. Even high score fanatics will be hard-pressed to stick with it for any longer than one or two hours. I don’t believe the developers - a team of five, according to the credits - set out to make a poor game, or to rip anyone off, but regardless, the game as it exists now functions as little more than a demonstration, a proof-of-concept, perhaps even the tutorial to what should have been a bigger title. It’s a shame, because Light’s not a bad game, not truly - it's just not enough of a game at all.","December 2, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Killing guards go unpunished, and killing everyone you see is consistently easier than trying to remain undetected.\n2. You can hide bodies, but having one found has no immediate repercussions.\n3. You can assume disguises, but guards see through them either way.\n4. The graphics are designed with line of sight in mind, but details not in the player's line of sight remain visible either way.\n5.

It's sort of like Hotline Miami, except without...\n...the atmosphere\n...the well-told story\n...the varation\n...the freedom to solve levels in different ways\n...the weapons\n...the fun\n\nNow I've told you what it isn't, but what is it? Well, it is a game about standing next to orange objects (notes, keys or computers) and pressing (sometimes holding) "E" to read/pickup/hack them. If the object is a computer or a key, it can open doors to let you go from A to B. In between the orange objects are white objects that you can hide behind so that red objects don't see you. You can kill them (by pressing SPACE), but it doesn't make a huge difference.\n\nThe story is told through the orange "notes": memos, diaries etc. that happen to be lying around and tell you the story bit by bit in pretty much chronological order. It's not very original or well written.\n\nI wanted to like this game. I liked the first few seconds of the game, waking up in an apartment with the minimalist 2D line-art graphics, details like the radiator with a sock lying next to it etc. During those first few seconds you find an orange objects that turns out to be a note telling you that you might feel weird and have trouble remembering much, but that you can just take it easy and wait. So far so good. In the next room there's a big orange objet that looks like a newspaper. It happens to be some secret note that was lying out in the open and sort of reveals everything you really need to now about the story. From then on everything, the graphics, music, gameplay etc. is very repetitive.\n\nSo what could the developers do to makes this a better game:\n-Better writing: "don't tell it, show it"\n-Give the main character some personality. Let him comment on things. Let us get to know him.\n-Create NPCs that we can interact with and have conversations with. Let them tell us the story, let them lie and deceive, let them be friends or enemies or anything in between.\n-Let us examine all kinds of objects and don't make it too obvious. Create an inventory system and let us pick up objects.\n-Make the "hacking" interactive. Let there be a small puzzle to solve or something like that. Let the hacking enable us to do other things like trap a guard in a room by remotely locking a door.\n-Give us different ways of making diversion, eg. starting a fire, or placing a decoy\n-Let us have weapons, even if only a few ones. Lets us use our dexterity.\netc. etc.\n\nBasically, make this more of a "2D minimalist Deus Ex".","December 29, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks pretty and the idea is nice, but it just doesn't seem....finished. The basic gameplay is an obvious rip-off of the likes of Hotline Miami and Third Eye Crime...but there are some stupid flaws in the "finished" product.\n\nFirst of all, the game can be finished in about 45 minutes. £9.99 for that? That's ridiculous. I know that we shouldn't judge games based on their length, but surely this is pushing their luck...\n\nSecondly, there are some curious flaws in the guards motion. It's tricky to predict their movement because you watch one, and he turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left, turns left...so you follow him, and he turns right and shoots you. There is NO warning he's going to do that. In addition, it seems very hit-and-miss whether they can see through things like chairs (and yes, I know about the windows - that one was obvious)\n\nThirdly, some of the gameplay features don't seem to make any sense. If you kill someone, the guards are alerted immediately, even if there's nobody else in the area. You can hide the body, but it doesn't make any difference at all to what happens next. You'd expect the guards to take longer to find you...or perhaps the timer doesn't start until someone finds the body? If you kill someone you're given the option to swap clothes, but again, it doesn't seem to do anything. Camera still detect you, guards still shoot you on sight....so why bother?\n\nThere's a good game here...and I'll be interested when it's finished.","January 17","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's sort of like Hotline Miami, except without...\n...the atmosphere\n...the well-told story\n...the varation\n...the freedom to solve levels in different ways\n...the weapons\n...the fun\n\nNow I've told you what it isn't, but what is it? Well, it is a game about standing next to orange objects (notes, keys or computers) and pressing (sometimes holding) "E" to read/pickup/hack them. If the object is a computer or a key, it can open doors to let you go from A to B. In between the orange objects are white objects that you can hide behind so that red objects don't see you. You can kill them (by pressing SPACE), but it doesn't make a huge difference.\n\nThe story is told through the orange "notes": memos, diaries etc. that happen to be lying around and tell you the story bit by bit in pretty much chronological order. It's not very original or well written.\n\nI wanted to like this game. I liked the first few seconds of the game, waking up in an apartment with the minimalist 2D line-art graphics, details like the radiator with a sock lying next to it etc. During those first few seconds you find an orange objects that turns out to be a note telling you that you might feel weird and have trouble remembering much, but that you can just take it easy and wait. So far so good. In the next room there's a big orange objet that looks like a newspaper. It happens to be some secret note that was lying out in the open and sort of reveals everything you really need to now about the story. From then on everything, the graphics, music, gameplay etc. is very repetitive.\n\nSo what could the developers do to makes this a better game:\n-Better writing: "don't tell it, show it"\n-Give the main character some personality. Let him comment on things. Let us get to know him.\n-Create NPCs that we can interact with and have conversations with. Let them tell us the story, let them lie and deceive, let them be friends or enemies or anything in between.\n-Let us examine all kinds of objects and don't make it too obvious. Create an inventory system and let us pick up objects.\n-Make the "hacking" interactive. Let there be a small puzzle to solve or something like that. Let the hacking enable us to do other things like trap a guard in a room by remotely locking a door.\n-Give us different ways of making diversion, eg. starting a fire, or placing a decoy\n-Let us have weapons, even if only a few ones. Lets us use our dexterity.\netc. etc.\n\nBasically, make this more of a "2D minimalist Deus Ex".","December 29, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
