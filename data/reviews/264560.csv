There is nothing wrong with point & click games, the stories are amazing, but I sometimes I miss the range of RPG games & this game gave it back to me.\nQuest for Infamy is the silliest game I've played in a while & the sarcasm reminds me so much of the point & click games of my childhood.

The art style does a great job at attempting to stay true to the classics and the music (at least for me) fits in the game perfectly. Regarding animations, this game succeeds with them and even the gory parts of the game have turned out good. As for the voice-acting, in general they've done a decent job with it and there are very minor flaws which probably won't even bother you. I've only encountered one monster but the fighting system is very simple and easy to learn (basically it's like in QfG, you hack, slash, stab or something of the sort). And last but not least, the game has a good amount of humour which you will witness here and there.\n\nSo in conclusion, aside from very small details regarding voice-acting, I would call this a perfect game. I understand 20 dollars is expensive for some people, but think of it this way - it's thrice or more times cheaper than your usual triple-A title on launch, so I would take it as a bargain if I were in your shoes, deciding. :)\n\nEDIT: Alright, I've completed the game and I have to say that this game is TOTALLY worth the 20 dollars. It is very catchy, the world is just HUGE and the overall story is great. It's nice that, as others have also said, in the end you get to be a hero too as a perk. In any case, if you are a fan of good old Sierra games, you won't regret buying this game.","July 10, 2014","true","31.0"," 81 of 92 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","81","92","0","10"

The people at Infamous Quests don't disappoint in giving us a humorous look into the seedy underbelly of the world of Lonaria. After escaping from the clutches of a baron to the east, Roehm hitches a ride to the Valley of Krasna as he flees toward the north. Volksville, Tyr, and the surrounding countryside is filled with unique and interesting people that will either help or hinder your progress to save your hide. Over two years in development, and lots of blood sweat and tears later, the experience shows just how passionate the development team has been in bringing their dream to life. If you're looking for an adventure experience that'll tickle both your nostalgic as well as your funny bone, then look no further than this title. I promise you won't be disappointed.","July 10, 2014","true","36.1"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","50","56","0","1"

Characters like Roehm, Kit and Rayford sound great.\n- Puzzle design. Sometimes I did some clever things.\n- 320x240. It's a pretty neat resolution. A lot of the artwork looks great, especially the backgrounds.\n- Roehm. I like that he's got more personality and attitude. Similar games tend to have a main character with the personality of an apple. I'm not that fond of apples.\n- That one guy wearing the clothing of the hero from Hero's Quest. He made me giggle.\n- A lot of the writing is great.\n\nBad:\n- Voice acting. Sometimes there's reverb, sometimes it's muffled, sometimes the accents makes no sense, and sometimes the voice actor honestly isn't good at acting at all. Overall, I like the voice acting, but it's all over the place.\n- Puzzle design. Most of the puzzles are fine, but it's easy to do puzzles in the opposite order, and it's especially frustrating when you're denied to do the solution because you haven't triggered an event elsewhere which is an arbitrary requirement. There's also a few puzzles where logical actions not only fail, but give you a generic "Can't do that."\n- 320x240. I like the graphics, but with the exception of the character sprites a lot of it looks like it was scaled way down. It would have been interesting to see it go for a higher res look.\n- The premise of being a bad guy is neat, but you're not really much of a bad guy. You fight bandits, help out people, and well, have a bit of a potty mouth. There's a ton of wasted potential.\n- Bugs, oh so many bugs. Background objects rendering in front of character. Clicking on edge of screen to move to next screen can be a surprisingly large challenge, especially in windowed mode. Some scripts can get very confused if you do things in an unexpected order. And I was able to find a way to skip a sizable portion of the game because I like exploring too much.\n- The combat is kinda dreadfully boring. But I'm willing to excuse the game for it as the combat is dreadfully boring in every game of this subgenre.\n\nIf Steam supported horizontal thumbs up, I would probably lean more towards that. People who eat up adventure games for breakfast will enjoy this, but others might just get frustrated. I am definitely thinking a sequel has great potential though.","July 16, 2014","true","20.3"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

This isnt an easy game, not as easy as most adventure games released nowadays (but also not as hard as for instance Quest for Glory).\n\nIt reminded me most of Hero's Quest/Conquest of Camelot. Except the maincharacter isnt a very nice person, he's quite  egocentric. Which is nice for a change, I also like his dark humour ;).\nIts mostly adventuring with a little fighting.\nThis is an adult themed game. There's killing and cursing. I havent seen any sex or nudity yet, but there are hints it might be possible (maincharacter is a ladies man ;) ). Dont expect a Leisure Suite Larry though.\n\nAll text has voice actors. Some of them are brilliant, some of them, well, are not. A lot of cheesy overacting, I love it.\nGraphics are... retro. Awesome.\nSystem requirements? a pc will do\n\nIf you have fond memories of the old Sierra games and youre looking for a challenge you'll love this.\nIf youre new to adventure games  this probably isnt a game for you.\nIf you dont like the retro style dont buy this.\n\nOne thing though, the price seems high. Especially for a retro game. But dont forget you'll have many hours of fun playing this, and for me every euro I spent on it is worth it.\nOne of those games I'm convinced I will finish eventually.\n","September 9, 2014","true","5.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","2"

Good clues built in to dialogue with people to help you think your way through.\n-Balanced difficulty for combat\n\nCons\n-Odd pacing, Act II/III don't have as much meat as Act I. Minor quibble. Still a meaty game.\n-Voice acting could be hit or miss. Funny lines would sometimes be delivered in ways that made the joke less effective\n-Fan service in female designs was overkill. I'm usually fine with it, and to a certain degree with your character it makes sense. But it was laid on a little too thick.

This game easily has one of the best musical soundtracks\nI have heard; it syncs perfectly step for step for the entire adventure, and varies\naccording to what you do and how you play. The voice acting is professional, and the\ngame offers the option to turning it on or off, and having subtitles with or without\nthe voice. There is a comic/ satirical undertone throughout the game, making it one\nof the funniest point and click adventures I have played.\n\nYou have the option to play as a warrior, mage, or a rogue. The story incorporates\nyour choice throughout the game. The warrior is a solid character to play if you\nare new to this style of game. The rogue unfortunately has limitations to what they\nare capable of doing, such as not being able to pick all the locks even though you\nhave 100% lock picking, and the stealth element that prevents enemies from spawning in\nany area you go to, instead of stealthing around enemies. The mage, who relies on\nspells, is actually the strongest in the game. The spells add a level of depth\nand make the mage feel well rounded.\n\nThe level design of the game is a true open world, where you have the option\nto travel all over the map. There are also puzzles that are tied into the open world,\nwhich adds a level of depth. Some things did take away a bit from the old school feeling of\ngames such as Quest for Glory in that they did present a map for certain more confusing\nareas, instead of having the player write out and figure out how to get through those\nareas. If anything, I found that the game opens up too soon, making it more difficult\nto understand or follow the main story, as you can easily get bogged down by side\nquests or errands. This is only in the first chapter however; it focuses and progresses\nvery well in the second and third chapters. The game also offers a day and night cycle,\nwhich adds a huge level of depth by what creatures come out during what point of day,\nand how you can complete certain objectives giving it a greater feel and personalty.\n\nAlthough you do get tips and clues, the game does not hold your hand and lead\nyou to each step, which is nice to see. The usage of items in the game made sense and it was up to the player to figure out what was needed and where from the sea of items in the game. The story was entertaining, and unlike many of the current games out, I was really blown away by the ending. This game is highly recommended.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\n\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","April 7, 2015","true","27.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

If you've ever played Quest for Glory or Kings Quest, you'll feel right at home with the gameplay. The fact that your character this time around is a rogue, rather than your typical do-gooder hero, adds a lot of flavor to the game and the dialogue had me laughing all the way through. The game also offers a little bit of replay value, which is unusual for the genre, by letting you play through as 3 different classes. The only real flaws the game has are that it can be a little buggy at time, although the devs seem to be pretty good about addressing there, and there tends to be a lot of clutter in your inventory, which is a small peeve of mine in this kind of game.

To begin with the game is very reminiscent of the classic adventure games of the past. The fact that QFI draws inspiration from the Quest for Glory series is made obvious, not only by the name, but by the graphics, music, sound effects, and even characters. It is the finest example of this type of game I've played since QFG IV was released.\n\nAs not all of you may be familiar with these type of adventure games, I'll give you some details on game play. The core game is centered around exploring a fantasy world filled with memorable (and humorous) characters, finding out what their problems are, and helping them solve them. In Quest for Infamy you take on the role of a character who is, in essence, a self-centered jerk. However, as the player you have a fair amount of control over just how much of a jerk and just how self-motivated you actually are. In my case, for instance, Roehm was merely a smart mouth with a heart of gold deep down. Of course, that's all down to personal preference. It's just as easy (or easier) to be a genuine scum bag that goes around stealing or destroying everything he can.\n\nWhatever Roehm's background motivations may be, creative problem solving is a major part of the game. A great deal of moving the game forward is about finding the right item to use in the right place at the right time. In similar games of yesteryears this could often lead to frustration. Quest for Infamy, however, manages to remove this frustration almost completely by leaving plenty of clues around for the player to follow up. If you're ever stuck, there's no need to bang your head against the same brick wall for hours at a time. You can simply pull on another thread until you have a breakthrough.\n\nAnother aspect of the game is combat. Although it's true that the system is fairly simple, it's also very enjoyable. Being able to bash bad-guys and loot their corpses adds a real element. The fact that it's simple (and even easy) doesn't take anything away from the game. Combat isn't the focus of Quest for Infamy, it's merely one of it's many enjoyable facets.\n\nI feel I should also mention the voice acting. In most cases it was very good and all of it added to the experience. In all honesty, some of the microphone work could have been better. However, considering the production budget of the game, the job was very well done. I feel certain that the success of this first game (in what I sincerely hope will be a series) will lead to even higher production quality in future.\n\nThe music fits the game perfectly and the composer deserves hearty congratulations. I actually found myself humming some of the tunes absentmindedly. In my book that's a sign of a quality musical score.\n\nMy one complaint is about the language in the game. Although it's certainly not as bad as most modern television shows there are a number of curse words throughout. In my opinion there was no need for that. The writing is excellent and the humor often brilliant. I personally see curse words as a comedic crutch. It's one I feel QFI didn't need.\n\nAll in all, I feel that Quest for Infamy is an excellent buy. I'm hoping to soon hear news of a sequel in the works. I missed the Kickstarter campaign for the first game. I certainly don't want to miss a second one.","July 19, 2014","true","35.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Certainly no hero, Roehm is a roguish fellow, although he's not a complete villain either.\n\nThe game is quite huge in terms of places to visit and things to do.  The artwork for the game is well-drawn and it has an entertaining story with an interesting cast of characters.  It also offers a lot of replayability in that one can pick from a Thief, Brigand or Sorcerer.  While Thieves can sneak into houses the Brigands can engage in caravan attack missions and Mages can collect spell components and learn new spells.  More than just changes to the combat system, each class has its own unique storylines and its own way of dealing with problems.  For instance, while a thief may sneak past 3 unruly hunters using the thief tunnels the Brigand can simply fight them off while the Mage can cast a fear spell that sends them running in terror.  Each class has unique missions to accomplish and can befriend different casts of characters to learn more about the world around them and those who populate it.\n\nThe game's story itself is quite good and has a very dark, gothic style to it as well as mischievous and perverted sense of humor.  The game functions well as a loving tribute/parody to Quest for glory and the adventure/fantasy genre in general.  Longtime Sierra fans of olde will appreciate many of the Easter Eggs hidden throughout the game thought it's completely unnecessary to be an oldschool Sieera fan to enjoy the game in general.  The game also features very good voice-acting and narration to accompany the story.\n\nThere are some complex puzzles to the game that can be quite tricky and confusing though, but it's well worth the effort to make your way past them and find out what happens next.  The focus of the game is much more on adventuring and solving puzzles and soaking in the fun than on combat, so pure-adrenaline junkies should probably stick to Skyrim.  If you're easily offended and want something more PG you should probably stick with Quest for Glory instead.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 9/10 and I do hope it has a sequel someday. :)","July 19, 2014","true","62.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I am a life long Quest for Glory fan, and had high hopes for Infamy ever since stumbling across their Kickstarter page. I purchased the game shortly after release and intially found the game charming and nostalgic, but soon discovered that its story, world, puzzles and fighting were clunky and confusing.\n\nPROS -\n\n-Impressive Artwork\n-Good music\n-Crude and genuinely funny\n-Good voice acting and some interesting characters\n-Big nods to classic Sierra Adventure games whilst still remaining its own game\n-Massive potential for future releases\n\nCONS -\n\n-Navigating the world gets confusing. Too many screens and unnecessary details add a lot of unwanted 'Fluff'\n-A lot of the Items you gather are useless and very few are class specific; so your inventory becomes a jumbled mess quickly. Again, 'Fluff'\n-Combat is passable but not great. I remember being more engaged in Quest for Glory (1-4) combat even though both combat systems seem very similiar. Can't really place my finger on why the QFI Combat is so boring...\n-Bugs and out-of-order trigger events can make game unplayable.\n-Most puzzles are fairly straight forward but there are a few obnoxious 'Seriously?!' moments. No happy medium.\n-Quest for Infamy seems to lose its identity quickly. I feel like a bunch of ideas were thrown out and then cherry picked to slap around a Quest for Glory clone. This is ultimately why i believe the Quest for Glory series feel superior.\n\nIn the end, QFI is not a bad game, it's just not a great game. I wanted to love it, but after 24 hours I had to move on. Maybe grab it if you're a big Quest for Glory fan and if it's on sale. Otherwise, if you're looking for a great Quest for Glory 'clone' for FREE - go download 'Heroines Quest' on Steam ...

At that time PC adventure games, unlike their console counterparts, didn’t require skill or reflexes, but rather patience, wit and persistence. They presented the player with gripping stories or humorous situations and each problem in the game was solvable only by the sharpest of thinkers. Long has since that age been forgotten by most, but die hard fans refuse to move on from the fascinating genre. Luckily enough, some developers are just as reminiscent of the time and are more than ready to bring the nostalgia back, and with crowd-funding options like Kickstarter, these games are now becoming a reality. One such game is Quest for Infamy, a point-and-click adventure which raised over $60,000 and gave hope to adventuresome fanatics everywhere. Does the game manage to bring you back to that golden age of the 90′s, or does it fall flat?\n\nQuest for Infamy‘s gameplay stays largely the same but refines the already familiar points and introduces new modern mechanics to make an even more enticing experience. After escaping an angry baron, the cynical protagonist, Roehm, lands in an alien world where choosing whose side he’s on and what he’ll do falls upon the player. The game largely bases its likability on the humorous dialogues and situations Roehm gets himself in, with the lack of point and direction in the start only making the situation even more ridiculous. While the game soon does get a goal and a fantastically well written plot as mysteries arise all around you, the world moves and progresses unrelated to what the player does, making it seem alive and moving. However this isn’t only a point-and-click adventure game as it tries to combine certain RPG elements in the already established core. Some of these work to immerse you further in the plot while some of them feel tedious and tacked on. Having to eat, sleep and manage your money as time moves on, for instance, make it fairly challenging to go out at night, but they do well in making you feel like you are a part of the game world, something not a lot of games excel in. Sadly the combat is simply abysmal, lacking any kind of depth or ingenuity.\n\n\nThe world itself is beautifully made, every background flawlessly representing the diverse atmospheres and locations. The nostalgic art-style coupled with the small resolution and mandatory windowed mode do well in capturing that classical adventure climate, and are sure to bring any avid player back to that special age of gaming. From the lush forests to the medieval towns, this fairy-tale like world never ceases to amaze, and the events that periodically occur throughout the game make it feel alive.\n\nThis is also coupled with an excellent soundtrack that fits just as well as the visuals and manages to pull off every atmosphere impeccably well. And since there’s an insurmountably large amount of them, at no point will they get old so you will oft have a hard time leaving the screen you’re on simply because of the terrific tune playing in the background. The sound design further proves to be well made with the voice acting, speeding up the classical process of having to read every dialogue line. While the voice acting is cheesy for the most part, this is intentional and when the game gets serious the cast does a good job in doing so as well. Not to mention each character has their own personal actor behind them making the world even more immersing than it already is. Special props need to be given to the sarcastic narrator who delivers each line as humorously and condescendingly as possible, giving the entire game more personality.\n\nTechnicalities aside, this is still largely a point-and-click adventure game, and since the world is foreign to both you and Roehm, exploring it and learning about it can be satisfying. In fact the story and setting are one and the same, building atop one another as you progress – it’s very open-ended structure. There’s also a lack of hand holding as you can do as little or as much as you want in this stunningly realistic world, and this allows you to organically learn about the environment as opposed to just giving you info, making every conclusion gratifying. You will have to write down notes as you study the magnificent structures and learn about the intriguing and cheerful places you visit, whether it’s by finding items or conversing with the characters. The inclusion of a journal could have made this game a lot easier though, as some of the information you gain is easily forgotten. Since the game is far from linear, you can choose which characters to side with and how to go about playing the many sub-plots and quests that litter the game, which blend perfectly with both the world and setting. Not one person will have the same experience as every choice impacts the plot and tailors the rest of what will happen.\n\nSince the game does feature such a vast and open world with varied locations and atmospheres, it becomes harder and harder to actually solve the presented problems. The usual puzzle structure is just as difficult to figure out as any of the games of yore, meaning you won’t be able to simply solve a puzzle by going from point A to point B, but will mostly likely have to run across points A, B, C and D just to get a piece of the puzzle solved, made even harder by the enclave of distractions and side quests which all offer more opportunities for new adventures and loot. And since there’s always only a slight hint and/or lead as to what you might have to do, actually drawing conclusions and managing to solve the puzzles is acutely enjoyable. The puzzles are focused more on exploration, dialogue and most importantly experimentation and then drawing conclusion from the information that you have rather than the usual mini games, even though these aren’t lacking either. And since you’ll usually prematurely get the items you require, seeing how the seemingly random trinkets fit into the story never fails to amuse.\n\nExploration sadly isn’t all rainbows and flowers, as your clicks have to be extraordinarily accurate to move on to the next screen and Roehm may sometimes glitch out while you’re trying to get him to do something.\n\nQuest for Infamy isn’t lacking in problems, and it sometimes doesn’t even attempt to fix a lot of the ones the games of yore held, but it also manages to wholly bring you back into the nostalgic world of adventure games with captivating plots and witty dialogue. The large and diverse world feels alive as the player can decide how much or how little he wants to get involved with the unique characters and intriguing sub plots. The setting and story build on top of one another to create an unforgettable and believable experience and they both immerse you in the overall silliness of the quirky story. And while there are some design flaws, namely the awful combat system, pointless grinding and awkward controls, some of the layered puzzles, beautiful locations and enticing events will surely draw you in and lead to satisfying conclusions. Whether you’re experimenting with items or organically learning about the world, the game is sure to draw you in. Just don’t be fooled, this isn’t a game made for people with short attention spans and a desire to let off steam, this is a sophisticated game that makes you think and perhaps makes you laugh here and there. Quest for Infamy‘s wittiness is undeniable and it’s unique and organic flow of gameplay and story will leave even the veterans of this genre scratching their heads, trying to figure out some of the complex puzzles and mysteries in the hours of fun challenge this game provides.","July 17, 2014","true","18.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Still, nothing as memorable as most of the pieces in QFG.\n\nThe voice acting ranges from atrocious to great. Sadly, the narrator is one of the worst voices in the game and you'll be gritting your teeth at how aggravating it is. This coming from a person who loved Sadwick's voice from the Whispered World. Overall the voices are passable, with only a handful of bad voices and only a handful of great ones.\n\nThe writing is passable for the most part, except for the jokes and "generic" messages of the game(when you try to use an item at something that doesn't do anything), which are often painfully bad. It's possible it's just because of the narrator's grating voice, but I couldn't stand the game whenever it tried to be funny or witty in describing things or actions. The visual humor in the game was, after all, alright and even good at times, and I didn't try to play it with the voices off.\n\nThe graphics are as you would expect from a game of the middle Sierra era, although the character portraits are sometimes(minor characters only) extremely bad. Overall the visual side of the game is quite good.\n\nI've only passed the game with one class, so I can't compare the alternative ways to solve problems, but mostly the solutions are logical and easy to come up with. A bit too easy most of the time. On the other hand, I faced two laughably poorly designed problems in my Brigand playthrough. Sadly, the other one is the very first quest of the Brigand story, which will leave you with a very bad taste in your mouth.\n\nThe overall story is alright, but some parts are extremely rushed and other parts aren't explained at all. It's possible I somehow managed to miss or forget some explanations or content, given that the game isn't too linear as far as point&click games go(for instance, I saw one of the main bad guys only twice in the game, in the beginning for a short monologue, and the final screen of the game for 5 seconds). You can do most of the things in the game in any order you want, which creates a dissonance between action and purpose, as you'll often be holding a handful of items you picked along your way just because you could, only to find out they're something very important that you're later on explicitly told to get. For instance, one character told me to get 4 pieces of a macguffin and explained it'd be a hard task and all that, and I already had 3 pieces in my backpack, creating a very awkward situation from the story perspective. There are also plenty of locations that I couldn't find a meaning to, although I suspect that's because they are meaningful only to the thief and wizard classes. Or perhaps I was merely too foolish to understand them or find out what they were about. Some were clearly alternative paths to take if you so chose, as you could in the old QFG games.\n\nThe combat mechanics of the game are lackluster and boring, although you can just skip almost all of them by just running past the enemies. So, pretty much the same as in QFG.\n\nA badly missing aspect of the game, that was crucial to QFG, are skills. There are only a few skills in the game, that have barely any function. The fighting skills are meaningless since you can drink super-cheap healing potions when you need to(they cost 10 per, and you get 5000 coins within the first few hours of the game). Aside from them, there's sneaking, climbing and thievery. All of them are more or less only necessary for the optional content of robbing houses, which is pretty meaningless since you swim in money anyway. And since you can train the skills by just clicking repeatedly on a place, with no time passing, it is a meaningless excercise. The reason why it worked in the QFG games was that the games had a fairly strict time limit, so you had to choose what to do, when and why. Here, as far as I could tell, you have infinite time so the skill checks might as well not exist since you can grind them up if you choose to.\n\nThere is a sort of point tallying system in the game, where you gain infamy points for doing things. Unlike the QFG games, where you always saw the maximum amount of points, and could gauge your progress in the game and how well you were doing, here it seems meaningless as there's no comparison point. I got 300 points. I have no idea if that's good or bad. Also, the reasons for gaining points are seemingly random. Suppose you have 5 choices on what to say to a character, they all give different amounts of infamy points in increments of 5. That's the only difference, as far as I could tell. Obviously I'll need to play the game through choosing completely different options to see if there's a meaning to all of it. Sort of related to the points system, you can do small things that seem to have absolutely no point in the game, like giving an expensive gift to a character or the like. Sure, you get an achievement and a line of dialogue or two, but that's pretty lackluster for the cunning needed to purposely purchase an item, deduce whom would want it and give it to them. The deeds themselves aren't really reward enough, since there is little reactivity to it. Again, perhaps I missed something and didn't succeed in doing these "quests" properly, but as I have no way of knowing, it's frustrating.\n\nOverall the game is pretty much as you'd expect from a serious fan homage to the QFG series. Some bugs remain(mostly voice clips mismathed with the text, some graphical bugs) but they didn't really affect enjoyment of the game. Nowhere near the quality of any of the QFG games, but enjoyable none the less, if you're a fan of the QFG series. If you have never played a Quest for Glory game, you're likely better served by playing one(all) of them rather than this game. But given that the main audience for the game IS the QFG-crowd, I have to recommend it. It's decent enough and will make you remember fondly the classics of yore.","July 12, 2014","true","15.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It's not just that the actors are terrible, which they are, but the quality of the sound recordning is also bad, and the writing itself is just a complete failure at trying to be funny.  For general gameplay otherwise, it's just tedious from what I played before giving up.  Maybe it gets better later on, but all I did was wander around a confusingly laid out town and talk to people getting increasingly frustrated that a required plot point wouldn't get triggered involving a public execution.  Once I finally triggered that by exhausting all dialog with every character in town, I wandered around some more trying to find someone who could trigger a class choosing quest.  I finally get that, then I'm dumped outside town, and I'm wandering around trying to find some monster I'm supposed to kill and not finding it for 20 minutes.  That was enough for me.","March 28, 2015","false","1.4"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","0"

YES! A perfect homage to old school adventure games.\nGreat music, really funny, huge open world to explore.\n\nThe story is loooong. Took me 21 hours to complete, (I only needed to look up 1 hint.)\n\nThere were some rooms & characters that were not involved with my path (the Bridgand) so after game was done, I read the walkthoughs for the other 2 ways to play. The 3 play methods are very different from each other. You'll get everything needed for the 3 roles, so you'll have a bag full of stuff you won't use. It prevents "mindless click & combine" strageies and makes you really think logically.\n\nThe puzzles are "medium" difficulty, I never felt frustrated. It doesnt take a genius to figure these out, but I didnt find them super easy either. Since the world is so big and there are so many characters, it takes lots of time to peice together what you need to do.\n\nCaptivating & fun from beginning to end.

Just finished it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has much of the old school adventure games. It is very funny, has nice puzzles and it not too easy, but also not too difficult to play. Some things in the game are supposed to only happen when playing with a specific character, and that was sometimes frustrating. For example, as a sorcerer I didn't manage to get the horse, while it was very obvious that this could be done at some point in the game. The game is not too linear, but some things can only be done/learned after a particular event has happened, and this got me stuck once. The scenery, music and voices were all great. I might give this another try as a thief/brigand :)","May 23","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
