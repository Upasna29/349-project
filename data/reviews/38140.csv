Making pizza, eating pizza, loving pizza, hating pizza. Pizza pizza pizza. Well this game is why. Never before have we had the privilege to literally make pizza from chicken scratch. This 'game' (I myself would refer to it as a simulator; simulating perfection that is) gives us a first-hand look on where these literal slices of heaven come from. Right down to its roots. Fighting off bears, milking goats, watering grass, it has every detail. This - is how you make pizza. You don't just slap some dough in the oven. No, you raise it up from the ground, from the dirt. You pour blood and sweat into this. No pain no gain, this is what pizza's all about. You think it's just another food? Yeah, I guess you would, because you obviously haven't played this game - being the reason you're turning to a pizza god for a review. I have nothing but positive things to say about this masterpiece, this... Pizza Party. It is a party alright. Yes sir, a party indeed. Grab your watering cans, bear cages, and spatula boys, because it's your turn to make a pizza, to make your own slice of heaven on earth,","April 28, 2014","true","15.8"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","31","37","4","16"

You have certain goals you need to achieve in a certain timeframe to earn stars.  The slightest misclick or delay in following things in the proper order will ensure YOU WILL FAIL TO ACHIEVE GREATNESS!  I tried following various guides and end up misclicking the well fountain causing me to lose 19 coins and end up missing the target time.  This game is more difficult than Dark Souls and Super Meat Boy combined.","January 20, 2014","true","152.6"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","0"

This game isn't for casuals one bit. This "game" isn't even a game more than it is something that prepares you for the real world. You start out with some chickens and some water, and through the means of capitalism you reach your way to the top of the food-chain whilst selling panda bears on the black market.\n\nI know, if I'm ever a fathermother in the future that I'd let my children play, and learn just what it's really like to be a farmer that reports to McDonalds.\n\nGame of the year.","January 6, 2011","true","0.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"
