This is based on about 8 missions of the game (I have, however, beaten Enemy Within and am an avid fan of TFTD and JA2, so I have a decent basis for comparison).\n\n+The game is turn-based, with turns broken into two actions for most character types.  An action can be either a move, an attack, ect.  Sound familiar?  HOWEVER--  they have improved it by making it possible for any character to either move twice, attack twice, move then attack, or attack then move without requiring any special skill.  It makes the game feel a little less "gamey".  Attacking twice sounds appealing, but there is a decent range of damage for most weapons, making it no sure thing that you will kill or hit with both shots, resulting in more retreats and reloads than in XCOM.\n\n+The tempo is different.  Whereas with XCOM you have the pop-in enemies that will literally drop from the sky, the maps for FS have pre-placed enemies only.  It does have the "activation" upon discovery, however, so turns have to be carefully budgeted with units in reserve when exploring (just like in XCOM).  Where it diverges is that the enemy can also take 2 actions of any type and there are more, smaller bands of aliens that you encounter, making you budget healing items more carefully, as it can be more of a marathon in some maps than the 3-4 batches you have in XCOM.\n\n+Your squads are composed of classes, with scouts=snipers, beserkers=heavys, combatants=assault, spiked kid=support.  Their overall functions are logically similar to their XCOM equivalent, HOWEVER, they seem to have improved it by making a larger number of levels (more choices) AND by allowing you to purchase skills that you passed up on level ups using FOOD (an in-game resource).  This means it isn't necessarily a choice to have A or B, but will cost you if you want to --change your decision for that character later on--.  Only the first selection in that block is free with your level--with resultant changes costing food. (UPDATED, tested and is a either-or, but can be switched back and forth for food cost, allowing you to RE-spec fighters for skills that you prefer).\n\n+You have a base that allows you to research new gear, repair your squadmates, plan your next attack site, and manage your squads.  Again, it has been improved by removing silly half-♥♥♥♥♥ base building (go X-COM: UFO DEF style or go home XCOM!) and instead making each pre-set base facility have its own associated resource and developments.  The medbay has new healing and recuperative unlocks that you spend med supplies on, the mechanic has weapon/armor/ammo upgrades you unlock with scrap, and the armoury has squad and recruitment options you unlock with food.  This seems to be a more logical and "realistic" approach than the generic alien resource trope.\n\n+When selecting missions, you will have several sites to choose from, HOWEVER those that are not time-essential remain on the map, allowing you to send a squad after them on following missions.  Missions also list the objective, reward (food/scrap/meds/personnel) that you will get, allowing you to make informed decisions and plan your upgrade path.  There are also gathering/recon missions that you can send a single soldier on each turn to get 100 of each resource, if successful (this is similar to the EXALT missions in XCOM); soldiers gain XP for these as well and it is a nice way to get recruits trained into a specialty.\n\n+Individual soldiers can be customized, but here is where the budget shows: there aren't many options apart from pallete changes for each class.  Classes do have variation in voices and gender, so repeats aren't as telling.\n\n+Inventory options are similar, but you have more options than those in XCOM.  Each weapon can have upgraded ammo types and personnel can have either pistols or shotguns as secondaries (berserks can also have rocket-based heavy weapons).  Armor and ammo do not have to be built at cost each time, but has a one-time investment and X-number of missions before being available in the loadout screen.\n\n+The UI is extremely similar and contains pertinent information in an easy-to-digest manner.  If you've played XCOM you'll be able to pick it up without a real tutorial.  Some objects use SPACEBAR to activate in-game (doors, resource caches, bombsites), but it responds well and is intuitive.  No frills.\n\n+Animations and sounds are a little simplistic, but have fewer "twitches" than in XCOM when using cover.  Gunfire sounds hollow, but mods should fix that in the coming months.  Models are functional and resemble their show counterparts well, with the exception of the main characters, who are more caricatures of their real-life counterparts.\nOn the bright side, this means shorter load times and smaller installs.\n\nIf you enjoyed XCOM, but would like something a little different, give this a go.  If you did not like XCOM, there are a few tweaks that the devs have made that I found extremely welcome, as they irked me in Firaxis' offering (the doom track, terror sites being a roulette of options, and other artificial "gamey" limitations).  At $40, it might be a bit steep, but I can't say yet if you will get that value from it.  Further play will be required, so stay tuned if you're on the fence, and I will update this as I can.  So far, so good.\n\n==UPDATE 20141002==\n+Additional notes: Haven't been able to play as much as I would like (work has been crazy this week), but here are a few more observations:\n+You can enter buses!  Not a huge deal, but a cool element for urban maps!  Sniping from the bus interior feels more organic than just climbing it.\n+There are a greater variety of missions (investigate crash site, sieze location, rescue individual, escort individual, bug hunt, plant explosives, scout site) that helps to break up the formulaic approach a bit.  You will still use similar tactics, but it keeps things somewhat fresh.\n-Difficulty still seems a bit too easy on Normal.  Will experiment with hard, but veterans of XCOM might find it undaunting on lower difficulties.  There will be close calls if you are careless, but if you take your time, use overwatch and bounding movements wisely, the early game can be a breeze.\n-Movement is calculated as X number of spaces from a unit, so you might be able to reach certain things even though the path your unit takes might seem circuitous and longer than the number of allowed spaces.  This works both ways, so give enemies a wide berth (skitters can close pretty well and climb walls...).\n+On my first play-through, I'll admit that I have a "one more mission" kind of compulsion, lending me to later nights than is perhaps condusive to my work schedule.  The missions are quick enough and load extremely quickly, making this a perfect "after work" game for me.  Playing it does not seem like a chore and without having to worry about losing countries or interceptors, it makes it a less stressful, but still tactically satisfying game.  Again, I will continue updating this to note any change in sentiment or perception.","September 30, 2014","true","16.7"," 416 of 477 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","416","477","0","14"

I needed a fix until the next update for the Longwar mod comes out. In order to get into the mood for Falling Skies, I watched the first episode of the TV series, which I had not followed yet. I have now played about 5 or 6 missions.\n\nFalling Skies is just not fun to play. I am still continuing because I hope that it gets better over time, but this game, compared to XCOM, does not require much strategic thinking because:\n- There is no general overwatch function. (Only one class can use overwatch.)\n- The enemies I met so far do not use cover, except for the controlled humans, which are zombie-like and not a threat at all. I guess those mechs I see on the screenshots will not use cover as well.\n- From what I heard, elevation has no effect on hit probability (except for the sniper class).\n- The enemies do not move on the map, before you spot them. You therefore just walk a few steps and kite a few enemies back. You seem to be completely safe when there is no enemy in view, so you can take as long as you want to reload or heal your squad. Each single fight will be the same as the previous one: Full ammo, no bleeding, no special conditions. In XCOM, in contrast, I feel the pressure, with some soldiers running out of ammo, some panicking, some bleeding to death, while the next pod of enemies just found me and starts flanking my soldiers.\n- The special bomb or search missions do not give you any feel of urgency as the bomb missions or the MELD mechanics in XCOM do, because there is no timer.\n- You basically do not enter buildings. It is like the original DOOM, where each location has only one single elevation level and you will never have one soldier inside a shipping container, and another one on top of it. If, like in some cases, you can enter buildings, the roof is off limits.\n- All elevated positions have lots of access points from all sides, so that there will not often be a situation that a combattant has to think about the safest access to a fortification.\n\n- The battle music is a boring tune and repeats forever.\n\n- I found no bugs except for the problem, that whenever I click a command like "hunker down" at the bottom of the screen, the game starts to scroll down, so I need to manually scroll up after every soldier's turn.\n- This game is like XCOM half a year before release, before the fine-tuning. Everything is there, but the spirit is missing. I admit, if I would not know XCOM EU, I might like this game.\n\nI feel that this game could be nearly as interesting as XCOM Enemy Unknown if only a few design decisions were changed. Falling Skies' programmers did a good job. The setting (an underdog setting compared to the-high tech organization called XCOM) is interesting, I do not miss XCOM's base building or air battles.\nI will continue playing this and hope I get hidden movement patched in, and that cover and elevation will play a larger role later in the game.","October 2, 2014","false","11.0"," 171 of 235 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","171","235","4","6"

The reason I picked it up was purely down to the similarities between it and XCOM EU/EW.\n\nSo, is it any good?\n\nAfter playing it for a couple of hours and completing a handful of missions I’m happy to report that I’m actually enjoying it.  Significantly more than I expected to as it happens.\n\nThe tactical element of the game should be immediately familiar to anyone who played XCOM EU/EW and it’s obviously licenced the XCOM “engine”.  So that’s a positive.  The key differences are as follows:\n\n•  All characters (enemy and player) are able to take two actions in any order – so fire twice, fire then move, move twice, etc.  Whether this is good or bad is a matter of opinion.\n•  Enemy characters have levels too, so a level two Skitter will be tougher than a level one Skitter.  I see this this as a good thing as the game should scale better as your characters/gear improves.\n•  I’ve seen very few one shot kills (something that happened a lot in XCOM), again whether this a good thing or not is down to personal preference.\n•  Most characters don't have the ability to carry out overwatch - only the fighter class does.  I personally find this quite annoying but provided you take it into consideration it doesn't really cause a problem.\n\nThe Base section is fairly basic and doesn’t have any of the building elements of XCOM.  Essentially there are a handful of areas to visit between missions (armoury, infirmary, etc).  Each of these allows you to purchase upgrades using one of the games three resource types (food, metal and meds).  So rather than research all upgrade processes are similar to the Foundry in XCOM.\n\nOn the subject of resources – each mission will reward you with a specific number and type of resources.  This encourages you to choose which mission to take based on what upgrade you’re looking to unlock next.\n\nOne other thing significant deviation from the XCOM template is that timescales on everything (upgrades and healing) are measured in X number of missions.  So there is no setting fast forward on and skipping tactical battles because you want your favourite soldier back in action.\n\nGeneral observations regarding the game:\n\nGraphics are OK.  There is nowhere near as much polish or detail as XCOM and some of the animations are a little suspect, everything does the job though.  On a side note there are also a lot fewer customisation options for your troops than XCOM (this is purely cosmetic so makes no difference to gameplay).\n\nSound is probably the weakest area.  All of the guns I’ve heard sound underpowered and some of the unit acknowledgements get tired fast.  Also blow up a car – you’ll wonder if it just exploded or backfired!\n\nThe AI makes use of cover and tends to focus fire on an individual soldier (from what I’ve seen) but there is nothing revolutionary here.  I’ve also not seen any of the flanking behaviour XCOM had.\n\nSo overall would I recommend it?  Yes – yes I would.  However I do so with the caveat that it should be approached know that it’s effectively a poor man’s XCOM.  That said I’m a massive XCOM fan and I’m still enjoying Falling Skies: The Game (so far – I’ll update this review once I’ve played it a bit more if that feeling changes).","October 1, 2014","true","4.4"," 91 of 125 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","91","125","2","8"

In game technological  advancements are in very small steps so each game seems much longer than an XCOM game.   The weapons change appearance as they advance, but your character is always dressed in shabby clothes no matter what armour or other advanced attachents your wearing.  The music in this game is very depressing and the voice overs and "acceptance of orders" replies are un imaginative compared to EU.  It has enough bug crashes to make you wonder why the makers never put in an auto save after each move, as it does get old redoing missions that crash near the end.  Its also gone old school with spawning mobs, they are all in static positions and triggered into existence by proximity.  therefore caution always pays off and they have no real answer to sending in a character to spawn them and then pulling them into your well defended positions.  This limits your tactical options as to negate the mobs disadvantage in this area all mobs have more hit points than any of your characters can deplete in one turn. Therefore keeping your squad together at all times always pays. There is no tech tree, air defence or ant farm, but I actually enjoyed being free of those particular aspects of XCOM.  I did miss the absence of the enemy capture facility which was a big + for EU. This game was not as good as XCOM but playing through this for the first time was more fun than playing through your 30th game of EU or EW.  They should have teamed up with the blackguards crew who know how to make lower tech games interesting and fun, by excersising a corny sense of humour.  There are absolutely no laughs in this game it takes itself far to seriously.  I'm going to recomend this game but only for XCOM fans who need a day off.","March 14, 2015","true","77.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","21","24","4","0"

You have a base which you can build upgrades costing metal such as flash bang grenades and armor. You have a barracks which can use to purchase recruits and buy upgrades to increase the default squad size from 4 to 5. looks like it goes all the way to 6 squaddies. The med bay can research new equipment like paddles to save squaddies from dying out. There are different classes which have a skill tree very similar to XCOM. They even have a Bureau feel where you can send your lesser trained units out on side missions to gain experience and resources. One you get a few a few missions in you start having a choice of missions with different objects that each give you so much of the 3 different kinds of resources. All pluses in my book. Some of the battle maps are large, with interesting layouts.\n\nOn reflecting on it more its really got to be a licensed engine. Units behave similar, the same red bars for the edge of the map, and lots of other similarities that just make it hard to imagine its not the same engine\n\n\nNow the downside. Reaction fire is only allowed by the Fighter caste. The voice overs are nice, but just as weak as the show. The art direction is terrible. The say they have a auto save system, but its actually a traditional multiple save and reload when you want (the only bad side was I was mislead, but was actually glad for the surprise and being lied to considering I like saves I control). The keyboard layout is locked and *really* should have been more xcom in its layout if they cared. It just doesn't have the polish of XCOM. For me, I'm glad I got it. However, if you expect XCOM quality or don't have a burning need for more even if its a little less, you will be disappointed.","October 1, 2014","true","99.0"," 43 of 71 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","43","71","0","3"

I always approach games based on TV show and movies with low expectations, but as a fan of Falling Skies, and Firaxis' XCom game (which this is heavily based on), part of me wanted it to be good.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucq1DuAI3og\n\nPoor graphics, bad sound assests and mixed quality voice acting. The game's tactical squad based mechanics are relatively solid, building on the XCom engine from Firaxis, with a few tweeks and changes. The strategic management portion of the game between missions is very basic and serves little purpose other than to select missions and research some very basic upgrades. The alien models are nicely done, and pay good tribute to the show. Human models are less so, with very bad facial animation and laughable lip-sync. Human characters are just about accurate enough to recognise them as characters from the show, but overall look very cartoony.\n\nThe AI is pretty bad and predictable. Even if the enemy forces do manage to hit one of your soldiers, the chances of losing one of them, or even failing a mission is low. While there are a few different mission objective types, they all feel the same and soon become repetative to the point of boredom.\n\nActors from the show reprising their character roles for cutscenes and some unit barks are a nice touch. Sadly, story based missions and cutscenes only happen once in a while, and the game is padded out with random and repetative side missions where you only get to take random soldiers who have nothing to do with the show. This makes the game feel very generic and disconnected from the TV series.\n\nIf you want a decent tactical squad based shooter, go and buy XCom from Firaxis. Mechanically it's the same game, but more in depth, more polished, better graphics, many user mods - and not to mention cheaper.\n\nI'd normally say that a mediocre TV tie in can still be a worthwhile purchase if you're a hardcore fan - but as characters from the show and story missions only make up a very small part of the this, it is hardly even worthy of carrying the franchise title.","October 15, 2014","false","5.2"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","0"

If you liked XCOM but got bored with small number of missions and items, Falling Skies is a good choice.\n\nThe game focuses on tactical missions, there is no base expanding etc. The only strategic-like view is choosing a mission from among a few available. Because of that the time is measured in missions (soldiers recovering in infirmary, building upgrades).\n\nSoldiers with each level up receive one new skill which you have to choose from two available. What is nice comparing to XCOM is that you can actually change a selection later (for a fee). There are four classes (sniper, soldier, heavy soldier, scout) and you can later unlock medic class.\n\nThere is either a lot of different maps or they are randomly generated. Having played for 20 hours on over 50 maps I haven't seen two the same yet.\n\nThe most annoying is lack of overwatch - it is a class specific skill available at first level. However on 10th level using overwatch will also give it to all other soldiers (regardless of their remaining action points).\n\nThe game is overall very easy (I play on normal difficulty). I have never lost a soldier and never had to reload the game. Wounded soldiers do not go to infirmary unless they lose at least 50% HP. The game starts at easy so you can safely fight with one soldier vs one enemy skitter (In other UFO-like game, you need four rookies to stand a chance against a single allie), however later it becomes more difficult and sometimes having 3 soldiers against one alien is not enough.\n\nEnemies do not move on the map until you see them. So as long as you haven't spotted any alien, you can take your time in the middle of the street to reload, heal, wait for skills cooldowns etc. You don't need cover because no one is going to come for you.\n\nAnimations of soldiers moving, reloading etc. cannot be skipped and you cannot issue new orders for another soldier when one soldier is moving - slightly annoying. Similarly when selecting next soldier via keyboard shortcut you have to wait for the camera to move, luckily clicking on the soldier directly doesn't trigger any camera movements.\n\n"Technology tree" is very unclear. After some missions just a new technology/upgrade appears in infirmary/workshop and you have absolutely no idea what was its prerequisite. As a result, after each mission you have to visit infirmary and workshop to see if there is something new available.\n\nSome aspects are slightly unrealistic, e.g. you can poison a mech or kill it using knife. Also there are sometimes some minor "line of sight" bugs, but it's not any worse than in XCOM.\n\nAfter about 40h of gameplay and reaching soldier's level 10 you can unlock one more level called "Elite". This gives boost to all stats and allows to buy very powerful skils such as:\n- ordering all soldiers to shot the target (it consumes only 1 AP of the soldier who used the ability)\n- a sniper rifle shot with 100% chance to hit and 500% damage\n- empty a clip of the weapon into the enemy with 100% chance to hit\n- mind control a mech for 3 turns\n- give immunity to all damage to all soldiers in short range for 1 turn, or to one soldier for 2 turns","June 24, 2015","true","54.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That should really be enough right there to tell you all you need to know about the game. But if you are still interested, it is a turned based SRPG in the vein of Valkyria Chronicles, X-com, and the upcoming Operation S.T.E.A.M. game.\n\nThe game is obviously based off the Falling Skies TV show, which I do not watch, so this review is from just a game aspect, not from someone who likes the show as well. There has yet to be a ton of info that I feel like I'm missing out on because of not watching, and other than cameos from named characters, I have yet to see a draw besides the title of the game.\n\nBeing a turn based SRPG using guns, you can be quite tactical. Each turn you can do 2 actions, typically from Move, Attack, Defend, Reload, and then skills. So far I have seen only a handful of classes (Beserker, Scout, Fighter, Shield Kid), and each has a few skills that are quite nice. Sniper gets a 10% accuracy boost every 2 other turn, for one of your actions, Shield Kid can take in extra items which is great for healing items, Fighter has a counter attack when enemies are moving in range of them, and Beserkers have suppression. If you have watched any of my streaming, you can see I tend to use Suppression as often as possible. There are more skills as you level each character up, but Those are the big ones so far.\n\nYou move around a map, that has fog of war, and enemies littered randomly around it. All your characters take a move, then the enemy takes theirs. I tend to move my units as a group, so that I hopefully don't run into too many enemy units at a time, and can pick them off easily, or use suppression to keep myself from taking damage. Enemy has humans which like you use guns, and these alien things (from the show, but I don't care for their names) which seem to be heavy melee units.\n\nThe graphics are completely lacking. Faces are extremely bad, and sometimes I can not tell if a character is male or female without looking at the name. Graphics are not a huge issue for me, but I do need to point out that they stink. To go along with that, physics of the game are extremely bad as well. Sometimes an enemy on the ground, can you shoot you while you are on the roof of a 2 story building, in the middle of it, not on the edge of it. Takes some getting used to, after playing games that have a much better line of sight check.\n\nEach attack has a max amount of damage, as well as chance of hit based on distance, obstacles in between, and if the defending unit is in cover. The line of sight is a sometimes affected here, but typically only if you are on the same level of terrain, any shots up or down do not seem to change if you get a better angle. Some units do have bonuses for being on higher ground, but it is a skill, not a given.\n\nYour base game, consists of 5 areas, all available after the 2nd mission. Your HQ to basically decide which mission you want to do The barracks where you can recruit new members, and change out their weapons, ammo, armor, and item(s). Need to upgrade a weapon, armor, or ammo then you should head to the Armory. Wounded squad members go to the Infirmary, which you can also upgrade to get faster recovery and better items! Last is the memorial, which reminds you of your dead party members, which I have yet to let happen (admittingly one of the freezing games I was likely going to lose someone), so I don't know if it is just the name, or if the avatar is shown too.\n\nAs for the story, which these games should use to drive you to keep playing, it is quite lacking. After the first 2 mission of the tutorial, you really don't get much of a story except for the mission statement, which is less than a paragraph in most cases. I kept having the feeling of why am I playing this game over another game in the genre? The lack of a story (which should be a TV tie-ins best feature!) so far has really left the game fairly dry.\n\nBiggest problem I have with the game is that it crashes. During my 3 hours of streaming (found here and here) I crashed out a total of 4 times. Twice it was a hard crash with an error message that sent me to my desktop, while 2 more times the game just froze waiting on the enemy (under suppression fire) to take their turn. Reading the steam forums for the game, there are other bugs that cause the game to crash as well. Some people are crashing after viewing a specific cut scene, others have an issue where the game wont load after doing specific weapon upgrades, and then of course the issue I have with suppression fire. Hopefully there is a patch incoming extremely quickly, and some Q&A testers getting reamed out hard.\n\nOverall the game is just what you would expect from a TV tie in. Dated graphics from over a decade ago (ive seen better looking PS2/GCN games), game play ripped from other genres (thankfully the best part of this game), and game breaking bugs due to lack of testing from a small studio. In the form it is in, I'm going to give the game a 5 out of 10, mostly due to the bugs and the lack of a story so far. *IF* they patch the game in the next week or two, and fix the bugs, the game could easily move up to a 7. I will likely play this game a bit more, rather than just be done with it, but only if they fix the bugs, as crashing every mission is fairly annoying.","October 11, 2014","false","5.5"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","2"

I find the controls annoying most of the time and feel that they could be polished up a lot more.  Transitions between areas of your base are annoyingly "wooshy" -  the camera whips in and out and around so fast it almost makes me feel nauseous.  I don't like the interace in or out of combat either.  It's poorly conceived and feels clunky.  Combat is okay but I'd prefer a better interface and sometimes it's hard to see where you want your units to move - terrain features like trees, boxes, etc. can get in the way.  It's hard to tell if you'll be able to fire on an enemy from any given position.  The combat areas feel too cluttered, whereas very similar maps in other very similar games, ... okay, I mean XCom again, don't.  Obviously it's a lot like the new XCom, however it pales in comparison despite some interesting ideas, such as being able to purchase the second upgrade at any given rank with resources.  WIth a bit more work this could be a great game.  I only have a few hours play time but have to say that without a bit more effort from the devs in the form of a few patches I can only say this is a mediocre game that I want to like more than I do.

As is, ONLY buy on sale and if you have patience.","May 3, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously? Combat Knife, okay, but this is "too sci-fi").\n\nSo, considering all relevant non-extremist reviews, Falling Skies seems to me as a TV series game adaptation built on X-com:Enemy Unknown, adding some just-the-must user experience kit, not including advanced turn-based combat mechanics, and sold it straight out.\nI will play through, because I like all alien hunting games, storylines, and turn-based strategy in this theme, bit that's all.","May 8, 2015","false","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
