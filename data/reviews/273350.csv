Thank you.\n\nI originally gave this game a positive review, I return to change my opinion on it to a degree. While I still find the underlying game here an amazing one, that I have spent many hours in that I have enjoyed, I can tell you the game has it's flaws.\nThrowing all the drama away (All those DLC complaints are nonsense, they either affect nothing or are not out yet, the base game is basically all you need and pretty much all anyone has atm ), you should know the visuals, animations, and core gameplay is astounding, that the core balance of hunter and monster was carefully thought out, and that the game could very well be worth it to you.\n\nHowever, its current state and where is is headed is not one I can suggest to anyone at this time.\n\nDespite all its great core gameplay, it's hard to enjoy it because of the incredibly long list of growing, and yet never corrected problems. Not one of the below problems has been addressed yet:\n\n-Bugs involving numerous crashing, matchmaker ejecting you, cursors not going away in game or turning invisible in menus, objects turning invisible, people falling through maps, and stuff in general breaking the entire match sometimes.\n-Wraith is too hard to catch at stage 1 and stage 2, though not the best fighter in the game, and a bit underwhelming, since it always hits stage 3 without issue it's proving to me a tedious match that ends in mostly defeat.\n-Evac has balance issues, Kraken is the best Pick in Defend, while Wraith is the best pick in hunt, and hunters almost always win rescue and nest because Lazerus and time restraints. (and for some reason there is a map/mode vote for the next day. However 4 hunters and one monster, so the next game mode is always decided by the hunters; seems a bit of a useless system)\n-Lack of players has created matchmaking issues seperate from some others. A lot of disconencting problems, games and game lobbies giving you the boot, even in game sometimes.\n-You will have a hard time getting into a game as what class/role you actually want to play.\n-There are already hackers in the game, though they are getting permabanned, they are still there. (New patch added hacker protection)\n-People leaving games to avoid losses, leaderboards are currently useless.\n-Not much base content, but enough that if you really like the base game you will get your $60 out of it at least. First DLC released, new free maps, and some other new stuff and features.\n-When your game crashes from a bug, it will imediately fill your spot so you cannot re-join it.\n-Performance issues for some people\n-Game requires steam online, so maintenance or steam bugging out will kick you from your games.\n-CTD's, Device Hung Errors, and other crashes are common. occuring rarely.\n\nThe game actually is not as bad as those reviewers talk about, a lot of them are actually mistaken and have not played enough of the game, they still think the dome is used for keeping monsters out. Trust me when I say the game is not like Titanfall or Destiny, it is actually good, it's just Tech issues, lack of player interest, and need of more content- and none of them happening, is what hurts the game the most.\n\n(The Devs of this game btw are not evil, they are actually some of the nicest most helpful people, despite their frustrating community around them. The publisher 2K, Microsoft, and sony however, all keep them from releasing patches, they push them around on DLC matters, etc.... keep that in mind)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate: 03/11/2015\n\nFirst patch is out, game might have more problems now than it did before the patch unfortunately.\n\n-Mouse issue still happens, but much less often\n-Still lagging and stuttering on anything over Medium settings, on a Gtx 760 8GB Ram and I5-4570 Processor. I don't think this is what I would have expected a month after release.\n-Game CTD still occurs\n-Increase in "Device Hung" errors.\n-Wild life bug making them disappear, fall through ground, etc...\n-All the other big bugs like falling through the map are still there, some more or elss likely but all still there so far from what I have seen.\n- Skins disappearing now, have to follow a guide on trying to get them back.\n-Wraith bugging out in game during abiltiy cast animation\n-Hacking still rampant\n\n-No matchmaking or balance updates in this patch, apparently those come later.\n\nI still do not recommend this game to anyone, at this point.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate: 03/12/2015\n\nDLC 2 new free maps coming to X-box live. Guess what, PC purchasers of the game have been issued a one month delay for all free DLC (Maps, gamemodes, etc). Make of that what you want...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate: 03/19/2015\n\nTier 4 Hunters Revealed, alongside Behemoth they come out at the end of March apparently, on the 31st of March.\n\nNew patch today should be up any minute: "Fixes rare issue where Wraith freezes when using decoy or staging up" This was a big issue caused by last patch, and one of the critical bugs listed above.\n\nSo far information on what confirmed to be coming at the end of this month is as follows:\n\n- 4 New Dlc hunters, and new monster "Behemoth"\n-TRS Co-founder: "We'll be keeping an eye on the numbers for these guys same as for the other hunters. Nice thing is that the March 31st drop includes the ability for us to micropatch. No more waiting weeks for balance tweaks!"\n-The balance update that was out on console, for wraith and other issues, is finally coming on or before the 31st as well.\n\nThis is exciting news, not much in terms of bug fixes listed, but good news on every other front so far.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate: 03/24/2015\n\nThe balance patch is live, you can see the full notes on the Evolve forums.\nThis has improved the game a lot balance wise, and because of this I will be re-visting the top review. I still can't recommend it, but it's getting very close to a point where I will. Possibly after the 31st updates...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate: 03/30/2015\n\nTier 4 Hunters\nTorvald\nSunny\nSlim\nCrow\nBehemoth\n\n2 New Maps for XB1...

Context and Game Development\n2. Product/DLC Release Cycle\n3. Gameplay and Mechanics\n4. The Community and Match Making\n5. Summary\n6. My Playhours justified!\n\nContext and Game Development:\n\nFor those that continued reading, I'll start off with some context since the game's launch, in case many newcomers do not know or care to do the research. The game was released earlier this year, post a very productive alpha and beta. However, shortly thereafter, you may have heard of the DLC uproars and consistent bugs/glitches/fails that plagued the retail version for a very long time prior to any patches. Due to development focusing on the production cycle, the fixes were set in parallel to what developer provided the console version. Therefore, realize this that some bugs still exist (talking about the stupid cursor bug that happens once in awhile, and a few others) due to a delayed patch cycle. Even with patches, many things seem to be a "1 step forward, 3 step backwards" type of deal. That is, due to the rapid push-out of DLC, the game has continued to experience new problems most patches, or just pure errors that again take time to fix.\n\nProduct/DLC release cycle:\n\nI'll be short and sweet with this. The DLC release for the game, many find exploitive and attrocious. As for my opinion, I am fine with the DLC, but as of late, it has become a disappointment. In the beginning, the DLC was standalone; most of the DLC was cosmetic as skins for weapons, character or class specific and what not. The skins themselves were weapons only, meaning the overall design of the characters would not be altered in any form besides weapons or color schemes, but this has changed with the release of the Meteor Goliath.\n\nUpon release of new characters, monsters were sold individually and so were hunters (this individual sale was where the problem resided). After a community uproar, the sale policy was changed and those tier 4 characters were provided via Season Pass 1. Same to the tier 5 characters with the introduction of the Season Pass 2, yet it did take time to change to this bulk buy concept. To TRS' (Turtle Rock Studios) defense, this was their first AAA title and IP, so it was still a learning experience, but the overall monetization efforts between them as well as the publisher My2k was a big failure.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics:\n\nYet, the most upsetting part was despite the awesome content, the combination of new content and a fledging company resulted in terrible balance issues between hunters and monsters, even character specific. These problems still persist and despite the outcry, these problems will continue. The issue resides in the process of balancing where character trials are done by Pros and ESL Teams (keyword being TEAMS), meaning minor balance adjustments pros suggest catastrophically impact the overall public player base due the unreliability of solo matchmaking and metagame mechanics of tracking/hunting/team-composition.\n\nTo put it in lamens terms, the pro teams that provide feedback for character debuffs/nerfs or buffs run in teams far more efficient than anything you will encounter in public matchmaking. Therefore, if someone picks something out of the recommended team composition or perks, the entire team suffers as random teams cannot perform to the level of pros or regular teams which consist of friends willing to communicate. Some ways this misrepresentation has ruined gameplay/mechanics stems into monster health/survivability and just simple things like how ineffective the hunter jetpack has become as of late. This misrepresentation results in the whole community debates of "Monsters too OP, or Hunters too OP." This disproportionate representation inevitably leads to similar issues of player base segmentation due to skill gaps as described in the following category.\n\nCommunity and Matchmaking:\n\nFinally, the last category many will be most interested in as this is still an area of concern and all else aside, my main reason to recommend not buying the game. The community has risen and fallen multiple times since the game's release (which has been about half a year almost at the time of review). At the moment, the community has fallen under the 300 Steam mark, meaning you cannot view players online in game anymore since the number is so low. This inevitably leads to horrible teamplay as skill levels differ so much. Even more so, the new Matchmaking 2.0 makes the traditional Hunt mode to be a catastrophic failure as the skill segmentation is done poorly due to the inbalance between players. You may have experienced some form or another of said reasons in the free-to-play weekend, but these problems will persist post-weekend as the player base again levels out.\n\nMore so, the overall community is inaccurately respresented in many forms. The subreddit for evolve may have more members posting than those playing at a time, along with the game developers continuing to favor the input of pros to continue this infant dream of competitive gameplay. I say infant due to the overarching problem of a small player base negatively impacting any efforts to improve competitive matchmaking.\n\nIf unknown, Matchmaking 2.0 is an effort by TRS to promote competitive ranked play. Prior to MM 2.0, players could play the traditional Hunt mode without any penalty of leaving prior to match completion without penalties in the form of reduced Character rank or timeouts. MM 2.0 has shifted the traditional form into only ranked play, meaning the original Hunt mode was removed for this competive copy and there is no way to enjoy the original Hunt form outside of running a Evacuation gameplay (Evac being the 5 day campaign, either PVP or PVE, being 4v1 or 4vCP) or custom match with friends.\n\nSummary:\n\nTo sum up my overall decision, with the reasons above and with foreshadowing as the game development is plateauing out due to the final push for DLC coming out soon in the form of the remaining Tier 5 characters, it is a good idea to avoid the game, at least until it is within the $20 - $30 mark. However, by that time, I assume the game's player base would have fallen even further, so its best to avoid purchasing the game.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\n\nEdit Sept. 5, 2015:\n\nMy Playhours Justified:\n\nHad this as a comment to address my play hours, but people skipped it, so here's my justification for play hours.\n\nTo those mentioning my play hours, realize my review is based off of the time since the beginning to now, post all that development. To be frank, as many others have mentioned it in other reviews, the game was extremely promising in the beginning being visually and mechanically fresh, so let's say ~250 of those hours were within the first 3 months of game release. By that time, many DLC and patches came out coupled with balancing issues where my play time dropped drastically as the appeal to the game fell.\n\nSince then, the only real reason I do play, or continue to do so is due to my own friends playing it far more intensively than I am. I became a part of a team, and was the dedicated medic for most matches, so I can't necessarily leave friends hanging, as playing without a dedicated team is tough. However, recent changes are making that seem like a viable solution rather than continuing as my recent "hours played in the last 2 weeks show." I only say this as many can understand, playing a game to only experience frustration or ending on a sour mood post play is not appealing in any way.\n\nThanks again for reading!","September 1, 2015","false","378.0"," 1,883 of 2,207 people (85%) found this review helpful 83 people found this review funny","85","883","2","83","67"

The game is shifted to a point where new players must play with other bad players to receive a rank. Thereafter you will most likely be stuck with terrible players as top players have already formed parties and do not want to lose their rank by losing games with newer players.\n\nFurthermore DLC is continously being released which you have to pay for. The downloadable characters are overpowered in order to temp you to buy them but in fact it just ruins the game as it is no longer balanced.\n\nLastly, and perhaps most imperative is the fact that minimal game support is provided to gamers outside their main target markets. Thus gamers such as myself are forced to play with terrible connections. This makes the game almost unplayable if you are paired with someone from a far location- which is likely the case since their player base has declined so dramatically. The game experience for all concerned is utterly frustrating when this happens.\n\nErgo, at this point i would like to discourage people who are considering buying this game due to the direction in which this game seems to be going","September 20, 2015","false","007.6"," 632 of 786 people (80%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","80","632","786","33","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/er3vos/recommended/273350/","er3vos","Er3VoS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/er3vos/","185 products in account","So a few words about Evolve.\n\nTo begin with, this game has one of the most amazing ideas I’ve come across in any FPS and PvP game. You either play as the big badass monster or as one of the 4 Hunters, thus creating a 1v4 concept that can really blow your mind.\nThe real question about any game though isn’t how fun the idea is, but rather, how much does the fun last, especially in an Online game such as Evolve. So, let’s talk about some pros and cons for this game to get more into that matter:\n\nThe Pros List:\n1)	The premise upon which this game is built is mind-blowing and exciting. Hunters versus Monster thrown into a quite big PvP arena, each side with its own strengths and weaknesses.\n2)	Amazing graphics and great voice-over suck you into the game straight away, creating a great atmosphere of feeling either the hunted or the hunter.\n3)	Well thought mechanics for both Monsters and Hunters, requiring smart plays, on both sides, to be able to win.\n4)	3 Different Monsters (with a 4th coming up) with different playstyles\n5)	12 Different Hunters (3 for each class) and more coming up, each one unique in his role, than the rest, offering great depth to this game.\n\n\nThe Cons List:\nThe game is far from polished, meaning not only the bugs you’ll encounter still lingering around but also matchmaking and balance issues that end up being really disrupting for the game experience. Let me emphasize a bit on the matchmaking and balance issues though:\n1)	The matchmaking of this game sucks: Have you ever wondered how it feels to have a game that asks for your role preferences and then goes and completely ignores them? Well that’s the case with Evolve at the moment. Evolve, asks you to pick your preference in a scale of 5, with 1 being your most preferred role and 5 your least wanted one and guess what, the game doesn’t seem to care at all. You join a game and the role you are given is very so often the last one you wanted to play.\n2)	80% of the games you join are already started, while you are given the spot of a previous BOT (or AI if you prefer) player, usually without perks(starting buffs you get to choose, when you normally pick a role) and almost always, already in a very bad spot within the game, with your side, losing hard.  If you choose to leave the game, you get 1 minute penalty (which isn’t much on its own) but trust me, it adds up pretty quickly when that happens 5+ games in a row, especially with all the loading screens you get to suffer each time.\n\n3)	Balance: There are a few issues here considering a few Hunter and Monster characters. Some Hunters being underpowered at this point (or pretty useless I should say) and some other characters being quite better on their specific role, giving you no real options when it comes to choosing what you are going to play. For the Monster side there is one Monster (Wraith) that, as it is now, rules them all. And the problem isn’t whether you win or lose, but whether you can actually have fun, winning or not.  Well, that’s not the case when you play against the Wraith cause usually, the hunt sums up to the same pattern ,15 minutes chasing it, while being impossible to catch as pug hunters, then 2 minutes of it wrecking your team cause it reached Stage 3. Fun?\n\nThe balance issues are known to TRS and are said to be targeted with future balance patches and so. But, time is of the essence here and TRS doesn’t seem to believe so. Almost 2 months since game release but no balance patches yet (just a minor bug fix patch) while they spend their time announcing new maps and skins and characters (but I’ll get to that a bit later), leaving their player base overwhelmingly frustrated (27k players at Launch – 3k players 2 months later).\n\nSo overall balance and MM, are what kill the most out of the fun of this game.  It simply won’t let you enjoy the game as you would like to, due to the game’s incompetence to respect your preference towards role and playstyle choices.\n\nMoney-making games and greed :\n\nThe game is getting 2 free maps at 30 of April (1 month from now) while Xbox players will be getting the content 31 of March, seems fair to me… Why? Probably cause Microsoft paid some huge money for their console to get priority…\nAlso, while the game’s community dies fast, to the point of no return, what we only see, is more DLC and paid character packs coming out (25$ for 4 new hunter +15$ for a new monster), 2 months after people already paying 50$ to get the base game. That sounds pretty crap to me but I’ll leave that to everyone’s perception and pocket condition.\n\n\nTo wrap things up :\nYes this game can be quite fun, but after a given time of probably 30 hours or so, you find yourself, getting more and more frustrated over issues that shouldn’t even exist in this game to begin with.\nI wouldn’t recommend paying more than 25$ for this game especially when you consider the 40$ you have to pay to get the new content.","March 20, 2015","false","100.2"," 752 of 953 people (79%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","79","752","953","30","34"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RandoomTask/recommended/273350/","RandoomTask","Serostasis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RandoomTask/","15 products in account","Alright, what can I say about this game that hasn't been mentioned already?\n\nIf you're like me, you ignored all of the negative reviews of this game because the core concept of the gameplay just seemed so irresistibly unique and interesting. If you're like me, and you're willing to ignore ALL OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS OF THIS GAME, just because the potential of the gameplay intrigues you, then let me talk to you a little bit about the gameplay that you may be oogling over right now.\n\n--Simply put: it's not as fun as it may look. It's not very strategic. Very quickly it becomes highly one-dimensional, formulaic, and repetitive.\n\n--There's only one "balanced" gameplay mode, and that's HUNT. There is essentially no single-player.\n\n--"Hunt," unless you take it to a competitive level--GETS OLD FAST.\n\n--Want to take your game to a competitive level, and you don't have three other friends IRL who also play the game? GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.\n\n--And, if by some miraculous chance you do manage to find three internet strangers that are also skilled, friendly, and willing to take the game to that competitive level with you, I must ask: HOW LONG IS THAT ONE GAME MODE GOING TO REMAIN FUN FOR YOU? I can tell you from personal experience that even if you do manage to get to that level, IT STILL GETS OLD FAST.\n\nIn a nutshell, that's the breakdown of the GAMEPLAY of Evolve--which is probably the only reason you're eyeing this game right now, after all. Now I'll get into the specifics of the game a bit more:\n______________________\n\nGAMEPLAY: There's no "cat and mouse" strategic warfare going on here--90% of the time you are running as fast as you can toward the monster; and oh, that 10% of the time where you're actually "hunting" the monster? You're hunting a wraith, and it's tedious--it's not fun.\n\nWhen you're not running toward the monster, you are battling in a dome. Against a good monster, this will require incredible coordination and positioning between the hunters, which you, as a random solo-queue pubber, WILL NOT HAVE, AND GOOD LUCK FINDING OTHER SKILLED, FRIENDLY PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH. I'll talk about that a bit more later.\n\nDLC: Just disgusting, disgusting. I'm not even going to talk about this, it's been beaten to death by everyone already, and rightly so. It makes me sick. 2K should be embarrassed. And now that the game has been priced down to $13 or $15 from the $60 I paid at release? F U 2K. That is all I can say. It's a SLAP IN THE FACE TO THOSE WHO PAID THE $60 WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.\n\nCONTENT:  There's only one viable game mode. I've talked about this already. It gets old FAST.\n\n"BALANCE": This issue is notorious for Evolve. Personally, I think that the "top-down" method of balancing that TR has instituted is in fact appropriate; balancing is addressed from the perspective of highly skilled players, and that is how it should be.\n\nThe last time TR adjusted balancing based on the perspective of random, solo-queue, no-talent pubbers, we were seeing such atrocious trash as 45 second dome cooldowns, absurdly OP hunter compositions, and a meta-game that WILDLY favored the hunters in competitive play.\n\nThe game is NOW closer to being balanced at higher levels of play, but due to the basic core concepts of the game--which are just not interesting or strategic enough, imo--Evolve will never be truly balanced.\n\nMATCH-MAKING: Just awful. To me this has been the reason why I've finally had to turn away from this game, as much as I wanted to like it. Hunt 2.0 came far too late, and we need more statistics that determine a player's skill level than just a pathetic W/L rate.\n\nI've told you in the section above that it's imperative to find friendly, communicative, skilled players to queue with. That is hard, and it takes a lot of time. It took me months to build a friends list of decent players and by that time most of those players were leaving Evolve anyway.\n\nPersonally, I have high standards when it comes to finding players that I enjoy gaming with--maybe it will be easier for you, I'm not sure. But I can't tell you how many players I've queued with that just relentlessly complain about the "balance" of the game, rather than taking a long cold look in the mirror and admitting that they are unskilled.\n\nStop blaming the balance of the game, accurately assess your own skill level, what you could improve upon, and then find better players to queue with. It's that simple.\n\n\n\nEvolve has been such a colossal waste of potential. Ignore this game at any price--it's more frustration than it's worth. If you buy this game you are letting 2K essentially get away with fraud.\n\nTL;DR: REPETITIVE GAMEPLAY AND LACK OF CONTENT MAKE FOR AN EXPERIENCE THAT IS HARDLY WORTH $10, LET ALONE THE $60 THAT I PAID FOR IT.","December 22, 2015","false","241.6"," 229 of 274 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","229","274","13","4"

If your PC is capable of running this game on high-end graphics then you can be standing in awe while staring at a rock wall or even the skin on each Monster.  Kudos to TRS for amazing artwork, animation and environments.\n- Balance is *almost* perfect.  I say almost because the Wraith can be down-right impossible to beat without a highly coordinated Hunter team.\n- Evacuation Mode has approximately 800,000 different combainations maps and types of game.  It spans across five matches.  Usually starts with Hunt and will end with Defend.  The other three matches are voted between two choices.  This is quite interesting as it will keep all the matches fresh and challenging.  Additionally, if Hunters win then the Monster gets a balance buff.  If the Monster wins, Hunters get a balance buff.  This balance buff can stack as well depending on how many matches are won consecutively.\n- Hunt is still adrenaline pumping fun.  Even when losing, the match is enjoyable.\n- New maps are great with adequate choke points, trap areas and escape routes for both Hunters and Monster.\n- Co-Op (two to four Hunters versus 1 BOT Monster) is a nice change of pace if you're not interested in fighting a player controlled Monster.\n\nCons\n- Price.  I was definitely on board with the launch price, but once I saw all the DLC at game launch my face turned into confusion and realized that even the Monster Edition barely scratched the surface with everything being sold in the DLC store.\n- The game can get boring rather quickly if you're only playing solo (which is my case).  I found myself switching to another game or taking frequent breaks in order to get myself re-interested in playing.\n- Loading times are still questionable.  It's not uncommon to be waiting up to seven or eight minutes just to get the game loaded and started.\n- Tactics become predictable.  This might be due to the game being so new, but nothing really stands out except a bum rush tactic for both Hunter and Monster.  If a pre-made group exists, then some different tactics might be seen but this is far and few between.\n- The amount of content is... well, lacking.  There needs to be more game modes and maybe even a single-player campaign so Evolve doesn't go the way of Titanfall.\n- Monster AI needs tweaking.  Currently it almost never engages until Stage 2 or 3 and then always runs at a certain percentage of health.\n- Hunter AI needs squad commands.  Currently they just follow you anywhere you go.  A command to have the AI follow Daisy would make my day.\n- There needs to be a system implemented to where you could earn in-game money/currency to buy some of the cosmetic DLC.  This would make a large portion of players happy as they could PLAY MORE to EARN more.  Just buying DLC out-right with money after a hefty AAA price tag is very frowned upon.\n\nMy opinion now versus the way the game was is still relatively the same.  I'll keep the review as thumbs up because I can see myself playing this game semi-frequently to get my heart pumping adrenaline rush and be satisfied.  My only concern is the longevity of the game.  More content needs to come out and quickly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n****Below this line is a review for BIG ALPHA EVENT and OPEN BETA.  I left it in here to see howt his review progressed.****\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nI normally do not write extensive reviews for games on Steam, but I'm making an exception for Evolve that is developed by Turtle Rock Studios and published by 2K Games.\n\nHere are some outlined pros and cons:\n\nPros --\n- The game is amazingly beautiful.  Even on medium graphics it still amazes me.\n- The optimization is even better.  The game runs smooth and didn't notice much framerate drop even jumping all over the place with the Monster and Hunters.\n- Massive promotion of teamwork with the Hunters.  It's required, otherwise you're claw meat from the Monster.\n- Monster is probably some of the best solo play I've seen in strictly a PvP game.  Their options are limited now, but given just enough to feel like an actual Monster.  Honestly, it feels like playing a super fast Godzilla.\n- The level design has almost a perfect balance.  Based on the three levels, they're just big enough to feel roomy for the Monster and just small enough not to feel so overwhelming for the Hunters.\n- If you're not careful, your entire day can be consumed by saying, "Just one more game..."\n\nCons --\n- Very limited feel right now.  This is unfair though as the game is in Alpha at the time of writing this review.\n- PuG's seem to be at a disadvantage.  Voice communication does help, but some are not keen using that media.  Maybe implementing some voice commands via macro would be helpful (Similar to Planetside and Planetside 2).\n- Kraken seems completely overpowered broken right now.  I've faced them a number of times and the Hunters consistently get slaughtered (again, Alpha as this may change over the development cycle).\n- I'd like to see the Hunters get some sort of buff or advantage as the match is prolonged by a very stealthy Monster (such as locating the Monster easier or get a jetpack buff).  I've played a Monster in complete stealth mode and wasn't discovered until evolving into stage 3.\n- Loading into a new game could be optimized better, but it's nice everything is so automatic (half con/pro).\n\nAs you can see, the Pros are far outweighing the Cons.  By all accounts, I was grasping for Cons to find about the game because it doesn't have very many.  This is a game that is F-U-N.  Simple as that and when it can keep your attention for hours at a time and then yearning for more once tearing yourself away from the PC/Console then the game is supremely made.\n\nAt first, I thought the price tag of the game was a bit steep for what's being tested.  However, with the Alpha tag and the promise of more Hunters and Monsters plus a plethora of weapons and perks then it seems more and more reasonable to pre-purchase this game.  There's also the fear of initial "hype" and after a month the game will be dead.  I do not believe this will be the case as each game feels unique, fun and adrenaline packed.  I'm not kidding about the adrenaline.  After every single game (even ones that are one-sided) my heart is pumping and feel a rush of exhilaration (win or loss).  Obviously, nobody wants to lose the game, but still feeling that rush is something many games do not accomplish... ever.\n\nThis review is pretty generalized, but so is the Alpha state or... generalized state.  You're only getting a taste of what's to come and that completely excites me how more is coming.\n\nConlusion --\n- If you're having fun in the current Alpha state, you'll probably be like me and pre-order.\n- If you're on the fence, but still having some fun then I'd recommend seriously purchasing to get the full taste once the game is released.\n- If you're playing and do have some fun, but get bored after a few games then hold out for a possible sale in the future.\n- If you do not like it at all, then at least follow the game to see updates because you may change your mind.\n\nAll in all, GREAT game.  You do not see games like this very often and can keep your attention with an iron grasp like Evolve.","November 3, 2014","true","44.3"," 848 of 1,127 people (75%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","75","848","1","26","24"

Or as the monster, run run run eat, run run run eat, evolve, run run run eat, evolve, kill the hunters and win.  Even though it's repetitive the gameflow can lead to some epic battles and tense moments.\n\nThere is an actual solo mode, 'evacuation'  which emcompasses a few maps with a few well made cutscenes to set the stage.  The bots (both hunters and monster) in this mode seem competent and as far as I've seen has no major flaws.\n\nThe graphics look ok.  Nothing special here.\nThe sound is pretty good though.  From the distant stomping of the monster to the wildlinfe screaming as you run past.

The Laz will just hide a mile away until people die then stealth in and rez them. If he used Laz device on a dead body it should add a strike, but if he uses it on someone in last stand it shouldn't IMO. Also, when he takes damage in stealth it should reveal him much longer IMO.\n\n- Daisy seems EZ mode, just follow the doggy and find the monster who's hiding. Seems to mostly negate sneak strats, the best thing to do as monster is just run.\n\n- Few things take real mechanical skill in this game. Aiming is easy because monsters are big. Playing the monster isn't as challenging as I'd hope. My only monster losses came from being forces to play it when I wanted to learn the game playing hunter and not knowing how to play Kraken, though I got forced into a losing game as Kraken for example.\n\n- I'd rather there be 2 maps than 9 or what ever the game has honestly. No map stands out, it's just more to learn and annoying.\n\n- The MM system is terrible. You set what role you prefer from most preffered to least, then when you search it trys to get your preffered roles first. I was under the impression that you would queue up for medic then get medic 100% of the time or monster etc.\n\n- The lobby system is annoying and takes too long to get a game going or finish a match. I wish it was in and out. Takes about as long as ranked in League to start a game and even more time when it ends.\n\n- Trapper can run through tunnels and ♥♥♥♥ spamming harpoons in front of them virtually ensuring they're impossible to catch so long as he has a good headset to know when you're trying to outplay him by cutting him off.\n\nSummary: Massively over-hyped game that's worth about 30 dollars IMO for all 3 sets of hunters/monsters, but you pay 60$ for only 2 sets and the DLC for the 3rd set is way over priced, around 25$ I think, but see for yourself.\n\nPlease don't make the mistake of giving this greedy scam company money like I did.","February 11, 2015","false","52.7"," 1,125 of 1,564 people (72%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","72","125","1","35","27"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NASAScientist/recommended/273350/","NASAScientist","NASA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NASAScientist/","83 products in account","Over-promises, Under-delivers\nI usually don't buy into the hype of video games before release, but I thought I'd give this one a shot and shelled out $80 for the extra hunters and monster that will unlock in a future patch.\n\nUnfortunately, I regret that decision.\n\nThere are a few technical issues and a host of design flaws I see in this game that make it not a serious contender for long-term play in my opinion. This is aside the fact that a AAA-title game selling for $60 came only with a very linear multiplayer game mode. There is no single-player campaign or any other mode except a singlular multiplayer experience repackaged as multiple game modes (as if playing bots in 5 maps consecutively makes a "campaign" mode). I felt a bit robbed by that. It'd be one thing if there was a lot more depth in the game with regard to the classes or gameplay, but this game's multiplayer just feels unsophisticated.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have nothing but respect for Turtle Rock Studios and think they made something cool here, but I think they need rethink some of their designs if they want this game to have any staying power.\n\nDesign FlawsThe game appears to have little to no balancing of matches/players. I'll join a rotating team of novice players and get torn apart by different monster players for 10 rounds in a row; conversely if I am lucky enough to be on a team of decent players we'll go through monsters quite easily. The same goes when playing as monster. If there is some sort of balancing in place, it is poorly implemented at best.\nThe timer for the round ending is usually in the hunter's favor, when it should be the other way around, as the hunters have unlimited respawns.\nHunters can revive too quickly, and too often before dying outright (or stealth needs to be removed). A good team can always just save one of 2 possible stealth classes and run away as the last man standing, wait for their team to drop back in the game and start over. This one person can shoot 1 bullet from an extremely long distance and stop the power plant from being destroy and do this repeatedly until reinforcements arrive, whereupon you (as the monster) can destroy the whole team again except that one stealther, and the same thing happens again ad infinitum.\nHaving to use the smell button every 2 seconds is a poor design decision. Overly repetitive actions should just be automated. Real skill isn't about rubbing your tummy in a circle while patting your head; it's not about being able to right click to smell every 2 seconds while pressing 1-4 on other players. It should involve careful timing and placement of abilities, not spamming them.\nPounce either should not be allowed in combat, or not be broken with 1 tiny bullet. A competent group of hunters will never allow it to happen in group combat, so it exists now only as a tool against newbies. If something exists only for newbies, it is badly designed. Design should be geared towards competent play, not newbie play.\nThe class skill up design was poorly thought out as it forces people to do stupid things in game to get level ups (for example, allowing people to die in order to up their resurrection count).\nThe game could have been given a great amount of depth if team classes could be mixed (i.e. your team could choose to go 2 assaults and swap out something else). As long as the game was balanced appropriately, this could really work and compliment people's preferred play-styles better. But instead you have a game where half the time you'll end up playing a class you don't even want to play, making that whole 30m round feel like a waste of your time.\nSimilar to the previous point, the classes you pick have static skills that cannot be changed. This makes the game too predictable from the perspective of each side. How cool would it be if each time you faced a monster, you didn't know which particular skill combination they chose?\nThe leaderboards cannot be sorted. It makes no sense to prevent that, and can't possibly be that hard to implement.\nParnel's design needs some work. The rocket launcher is useless at range. Super solider is a skill that feels put in because they could not think of an anything else to give him. Combat shotguns requires being too close to be effective — why would anyone play him when Markov has better range, and more consistent damage, and better team utility with the mines.\nThe Wraith could use better design. The Abduction skill is almost useless because it still triggers traps/mines and hunters can easily jet away after grabbed. Supernova is just a spamming ability that requires no real skill or effort to use, just move into the biggest clump of hunters you see (but a good group will be spread out anyways). Warp blast is good for movement and damage but it knocks players away when you (as a melee monster) need them near you, so it works against you.\nJoining in the middle the a game with a character you don't want is frustrating; it should just let a new game begin instead of forcing people to play characters they don't want (even if you get your "preference", you may not necessarily get your preferred character).\nIf you're going to have preferences, they should not be per class but per character because the characters vary so much.\nThe ranking of the leaderboards is by mere games won and not ratio, encouraging people to obsessively leave and join games because they refuse to play other classes in the hopes they can max out their wins, rather than trying to find and stick with a good team to keep their ratio high.\nThe leaderboards load incredibly slowly. It isn't technically difficult to stream a few bytes of numbers over an an internet connection. There's no reason this should be slow other than straight up poor programming or using a dinosaur server.\nThe loading screen as you're on the ship is lacking aesthetically. What's with the rocking wheel and boxes blocking your view? There isn't a camera angle better than that? What about outside the ship (of course looking up at the ship to avoid seeing the monsters movement below).\nYou cannot change your game settings without leaving the game or lobby. So, if you want to change the sound volume, for example, you need to quit the game you are in, or leave the lobby you are in. This is completely unnecessary from a technical standpoint.\nThe patch notes are extremely vague, leaving players wondering exactly what or how much something was changed\nDamage + healing values in the game are unknown.\nThere is no reason to show a "Humans killed vs. Saved" count at the end of each map in campaign mode. It is almost completely arbitrary and adds nothing to the game.\nIn the same vein, there is no reason to show the "auto-balancing" part at all — let alone so slowly — after each match.\nOn the subject of "auto-balancing", what exactly is changing when the game is being balanced? Why be so vague about what is going on?\nThere are unnecessarily long wait times between games due to extra animations of planets and other things that needn't be there. It's one thing to make people see some stats or information, but showing nothing is a waste and I highly doubt that time is needed to load anything.\nThere's no support for the "recently played with players" feature of Steam.\nTechnical IssuesThere are so many design issues I reached the character limit, forcing me to remove this section. >_<\nThe bottom line: The game is surely fun for the first many hours (I definitely put my fair share in) but the current design issues eventually push away all but the most dedicated fans. Don't take it just from me, look at the numbers yourself: http://steamcharts.com/app/273350#All\n\nWait for it to get down to ~$15 with all DLC, then it'll be an OK buy.","March 20, 2015","false","85.8"," 354 of 485 people (73%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","73","354","485","16","15"

The character banter can get interesting.\nWell, that's about it, pros-wise.\nI am not a big fan of playing as the monster. Although I do admit that it is more thrilling, and some pople might enjoy that aspect of the game way more than playing as the hunter. Being a monster is a tenser experience. You're constantly on the move, constantly looking for food, and trying to figure out how much time to feed you have, before you have to run, and then where is the perfect spot to evolve.\n\nCons:\n1. The content. The content in this game is minimalistic. There is a short "campaign", which is  basically 5-rounds of various modes. You can beat it in around 40ish minutes. And that's it. There's scarsly any story, and I just can hope that Turtle Rock will eventually release additional campaign chapters that will make it more interesting. Other than that you are getting 16 maps, 3 monster characters, 4 hunter classes with 3 characters per class. You can't customise your characters beying the perk that you select before the round begins, or the skins that you buy from the shop, but we'll get to that later. Evolve claims to be an AAA title, yet, given the content that is avaiable in this $60 game, I can't really agree with this claim. A stale series such as CoD usually offers you a full campaign (aka story mode), multiplayer with a dozen of maps, a fair ammount of customisation for your character. BF does the same. Alternatively, games like Wolfenstein: TNO, or Bioshock offer you an immersive world with a strong story and a overall a memorable experience. And I can't really say that Evolve offers any of that. What it does offer if, is a shop, to go and buy tons of DLCs\n2. DLCs. There is a LOT of DAY ONE DLC content that 2K is trying to sell you for additional fee. In fact, the shop looks like something that belongs in a F2P game. Some people defend the game buy saying "well, you don't have to buy this content", "it doesn't affect the gameplay", and even "GW2, WoT and DOTA 2 have shops".\na) The fact that I don't have to buy all that content doesn't change the high probability that at some point this content was part of the base game .The sheer amount of it indicates that the customisation option is an innate part of the game, and at some point it was likely indluced in the game without the shop. Ripping contnet from the base game with intent to sell it on top for a $60 price tag, when the game on it's own is already a barebones product that doesn't shiny with an overwhelming ammount of conent to being with is just a poor sales practice.\nb) A comparison with likes of GW2 is also innacurate, because GW2, albeit a beast from different genre, had tons of content in the base game, something that Evolve, with it's 16 samey-looking maps can't boast.\nc) WoT and DOTA 2 and other F2P games don't  require you to ponny-out $60 just to get in to the game, so it's only natural that those games will have shop.\nFinally, 2K's argument that allegeldy without that shop and ton of DLCs the game wouldn't be able to exist, is doubvious at best, when you see other AAA-titles brinning more content for the same $60.\n","February 12, 2015","false","7.6"," 981 of 1,405 people (70%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","70","981","1","30","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caulfieldscrow/recommended/273350/","caulfieldscrow","Pashio Biceps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caulfieldscrow/","222 products in account","I played the alpha whatever thingy. And I will prefence this by saying I didn't much care for L4D2. And I'll get to why that matters in a second. But what I want to say goes beyond the bugs and load times and connection and preformance problems that are in a lot of alphas. Which were rampant in this one. I want to talk about the core of this game so here goes.\n\nI do not like this game at it's core. What it is, is very shallow. Which is not the problem. But how it is executed is the problem, for me atleast. The premise is very simple, 4 hunters 1 monster trapped in a jungle, who will win. But what this leads to is a bunch of tedious running. Let's explain how the monsters work and what is truly wrong about this game to me.\n\nThe monster works like this you spawn in at stage 1. You can either kill all the hunters or destroy a power relay to win. But when you start you are generally to weak to kill them. But there are 2 more stages. Which you can get to by feeding on weaker creatures in the jungle. Stage 2 for most monsters, you are an even match and can win most fights if done correctly. Stage 3 you are an overpowered killing machine and unstoppable. They could tweek the monsters to balance them so that's not what I really want to get at.\n\nThe heart of my problem is the complete lack of variance in how you play a monster from stage to stage.  And how they change the abilities of a monster stage to stage. And what I want to address are things I believe they will not change in the full release.  You only become more powerful from stage to stage. There is no trade there is no cause and effect there is absolutely no reason not to hide and run until you get to stage 3. There is no thought to making the monster complex. Or thought of incentivising stages. Which means you spend almost every match running from spot to spot trying to catch up to something thats just as fast as you. And can scale cliffs faster than you and can cover it's track almost completely.\n\nNow for the L4D2 comparison. The reason I didn't like that game is similar to why I don't like this, and wouldn't you know it the same people made both. Both games make a huge emphasis  on the maps you play on. Not what you do on them. They spread and spiral, but there's  not really much substance. You run and run but you really get no where. Both games use this long slog through nothing to create the illusion of accomplishment. When really you just spent 20 minutes with sub par combat on a sub par map, running. That's all you do. None of the guns in either game feel particularly good.\nAnd both games are entirely dependent on having a full team of people who know exactly what they are doing for it to work at all. Which let's be honest doesn't happen a lot of the time in any online multiplayer. If you're not playing with friends that is. Which means that this game like L4D2 will be relagated to, friend only play. For a lot of people. Which for the love of god take into consideration before blowing $60 on this game.\n\nI am not by any stretch of the imagination saying this game is terrible. I am not even saying don't ever buy it. But what I am saying is don't hype buy. This game is, to me one of those games that is only as fun as you make it. And considering there are a lot of games that will give you fun co-op play at a much lower price. Then why drop $60 on this. I feel that like Titan Fall this games hype will be short lived. As people slowly realize this game has as much substance as a glass of water.\n\nNow I think mindlessly criticizing is pointless. If you do not have a clear idea what you want and what would make the game better. You are basiclly just being a picky child who stubbornly refuses to eat his vegatables. So I'd like to speak my peace on that front.\n\nThere are many things they could do even now that would push the game towards what I'd want. I just don't think they'll do any of them. Even now they could, --"completely get rid of the power relay"--. The relay is pointless and slows possible combat with the monster. Why push the pace now, when you can get to stage 3 and force them to meet you when you are more powerful than them? I mean think about it. Imagne there's no relay the monsters at stage 3 now he actually has to hunt the hunters. it would completely flip the dynamics on there head. And make the game more interesting.\n\n--"Keep the stupid relay"--  but make it physically impossible for stage 3 monsters to get to it meaning you can only attack the relay at stage 1 and 2. And making the desicion to go to stage 3 a risk reward decision where you have to find and kill the hunters\n\nAnother thing if,  oh no the magical relay to import to get rid of -- "Greatly reduce the speed and mobility of stage 3 monsters"-- at this point it's just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid you just stand no chance againt a stage 3 monster with the relays. if he gets to stage 3 you've already lost you just have to sit there and watch him destroy the relay. And die.\n\nWhat I really want, which is albeit a lot harder at this point because they've already kind of commited to monsters and their design --"Give me a real reason to stay in Stage 1 and 2!!!"-- I mean the lack of thought in this, what I'd consider the most important part of the game is kind of shamful on their part. But this is how I believe the monster should be built, and funnily enough it utilizes some L4D2 elements. To me stage 1 should be all about stealth, shush ♥♥♥♥♥ and read on because. What the game does now is NOT, that. And NOT, what I mean. I mean stealth in the true sense. I do not believe stage 1 monster should leave foot prints, or be able to be trapped in the bubble. And should be able to cloak, and\nhave a move akin to the jocky in L4D2 which would also cut off in game mic. Now is that not more intersting than running and eating things? Having the ability to watch and hide and wait for someone to lag behind, then strike. To have an actual reason to stay, for atleast a period of time in stage 1. Stage 2 I'd say it's fine the way it is for the most part a balanced fight good mix of power and speed both sides should have a chance of winning a head on fight. Stage 3 should have some sort or negatives to the massive power increase. There needs to be pros and cons. Not having them makes it pointless for hunters to play when the monster hits stage 3 why not just quit? it's like playing monoploy for another 3 hours after you had to mortgage every property but one. What's the point? And people will just start quiting out when monsters hit stage 3 if it's not balanced. Which will ruin all the weirdos fun who love this game the way it is only because they have some kind of power trip. Which trust me other people will not indulge for long.\n\nBut I mean honestly  --"I do not understand the point of different mosters at all"-- . It should be 1 monster with a great verity of branching paths. Making multiple monsters just narrows what you can do in a single match! Which also makes the game boring because from the word go you know exactly where it's going. Where if there were only one monster, you'd have no idea what to expect each time you met the monster. Making it much more exciting when you met. I mean it is called evovle right? Why can't one monster "evolve" into all of the bull crap monsters they are making? Why can I not see how the people I'm up against play first. And then deside what kind of monster I want? Just a thought.\n\nI mean the reason I'm writing this is because I heard the hype. And I wanted it to be that good. And honestly it's just not.\nIt's a sub par game with mountains of potential, that will probably all be wasted. As they get on their own hype train, and ride that mofo straight to Titan Fall station. Just another sub par blip on the gaming radar. Oh well.\n\nP.S it's no wonder they're blocking reviews until full release when a 3rd of reviews are negitive.\n","February 10, 2015","false","3.1"," 351 of 489 people (72%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","72","351","489","13","7"

Sadly over-all I can't recommend the frustration I've experienced from this game to anyone else.\n\nThis is not going to be one of those reviews that bashes the game because of it's dlc policy. Abusive or not we're here to talk about the game as is and frankly there is plenty of diverse content to enjoy in this game. There are four character classes; Assault , Medic , Trapper, and Support and there's also the Monster class. Each of those classes have three different characters to enjoy it with. There's a medic who uses a TF 2 med gun to heal you but then there's also Lazerus who's best time to heal a character is actually after they are already down or dead. There are assault characters who are best up close and personal and assaulters who do their best damage at a distance. There are 15 characters in all to unlock and each one plays utterly different than the other. I can actually applaud the variety\n\nI can also praise matches that go perfectly. There are times where you are the exact class you want for an entire Evacuation match (which is really 5 mini-matches rolled into one big instance) with a great team against a skilled monster. When it comes together Evolve is a lot of fun.\n\nBUT Evolve doesn't come together all that often. The only way to start playing is to just enlist into a massive pool of random players and hope the game puts you into a match of your preference. You rate the classes on a scale of 1-5 which measures how much you want to play a give class. When you pick you preferences the game even promises to try and give you your top picks as often as possible. Total and utter bold faced lie:\n\nI usually have the monster rated 5th in last. He or she (yes there are female monsters) plays just fine and is balanced enough as long as you're pretty crafty. After a long day at work where I have customers ganging up on me day and night I don't want to play a game in which a group of 4 does their best to gang up on me. That is my number one preference and I have felt it ignored at every chance it could. I've spent ten straight minutes joining and rejoining matches in the hopes that I wouldn't be thrown into a monster roll or a dead hunter and have quit without even playing a match. There is no way to indicate that you want to start on Day 1 and that you are willing to wait for a party as long as you get the position you want. Yes it's annoying watching impatient players come and go, but I'd rather do that than join a match as a level 1 Wraith already domed and down to half health.\n\nThere's a way to play Evolve strictly Co-op (the monster is AI controlled at all times) and this has sadly become my only option. The monster AI is good but also lacking in everything you want it to have. You want the monster to be like a Predator from the movies; giving you a mighty good chase only to lead you into a tunnel where you are BBQed by the crafty monster as he chargers threw your party like a bowling ball (I won once using this strategy). Sadly the AI doesn't have that resourcefulness and most matches are just you following the monster from feed sight to feed sight getting in a shot here or there till it reaches level 3.\n\nWhat brought this review on was a repeating glitch I've been suffering from in Co-Op where I've finally said enough is enough. As stated before Evacuation matches go on for 5 days and saves the best XP and accolades for the end of the 5th day. I've been suffering from a glitch that for some reason ejects me from matches stating "I am not signed into a profile so I'm not allowed to play" despite the fact that I'm on Day 3 already. I am thusly ejected from the match and miss out on the XP I deserve and since there is utterly no way to have any say about which match you join you've practically just wasted your time.\n\nThese problems can easily be fixed with a few patches and I am genuinely intrigued as to how this game will grow. Depending on who wins a day (the monster of the hunters) the game will introduce a pro-winner perk that'll change the game. The hunters can get AI buddies to follow you around or portals to transport you around the level while the monster will get increased wild life, more aggresive wildlife toward humans, ecetera. The perks sadly go away at the end of the match; I can't help but feel the loss of depth. Imagine if they carried over through-out the campaign? There could be massive amounts of angry wildlife, which are bombarded with a space laser that the humans saved. They need to expand Evacuation, possibly into an intergalatic monster war (there is a terraformed moon revolving around the planet so I'm assuming we'll get up there at some point.\n\nI'm sorry for the massive length I only wanted to get every thought out and I thank you for reading if for some reason you did. I do like this game and I had some fun with it but in it's current state or at it's current price I can't recommend this game","March 4, 2015","false","29.3"," 560 of 805 people (70%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","70","560","805","17","18"

Sadly, they have not.\n\nThe game still feels like an extended game of tag where the hunters try to catch a monster, then immediately switch roles and try to avoid the monster or face getting chain stunned to death. It never feels like your hunting the monster, tracks and sign are easy for anyone to follow, most of the game is spent chasing the much faster monsters. There is the occasional chance to cut off a monster, but experienced players minimize these opportunities.\n\nThe thing I find most frustrating is that it NEVER feels like there's a balance, and the devs really don't know how to fix it. In the latest patch one of the characters I enjoyed playing, Cabot, received around a 50% nerf to his damage. He may have been slightly overpowered before, but a nerf that large screams lack of pre-testing or extreme over-reaction.\n\nAs much as I want to enjoy Evolve, I just find it an exercise in frustration. I've only been able to stand for a game or two during events, in order to unlock the rewards, before I want to play something else.\n\nStill wish I passed on it at this point.\n\n\n------------- Original Review -------------\nI was looking forward to playing Evolve last night but was seriously frustrated by a lot of the functionality in game.\n\nYou cannot skip the initial tutorial, or any video. The character's are all introduced this way but their skills are simple for the most part, and could be introduced by a static graphic. Instead every player needs to sit around for 2 minutes while these videos play. I was so frustrated at one point I actually ALT-F4'd out of the game in frustration just so I could skip one of the lengthy videos.\n\nIn addition, you need to score your 'Favored' classes, there's no option to NOT play a class. I had no desire to play the monster or assault last night, but was stuck with them on multiple occasions. This included being selected for the monster in back to back games in a campaign, which caused me to drop out in frustration.\n\nEvolve has been compared to L4D's asymmetric gameplay, but it's a poor comparison. L4D built tension with tight areas, harassed the survivors with NPCs, and provided the Infected interesting ways to disrupt. There's no tension here, the neutral mobs only exist to provide a temporary buffs, food for the monster, or a minor annoyance.\n\nI think the most frustrating part is there's very little incentive for the monster to engage until it's ready. This might be interesting gameplay for the monster, but it means that all the hunters are doing is trying to catch up/cut off the monster for 1-2 big fights. That means in a 10 minute game all the hunters are doing for 7-8 minutes is running around the map.\n\nI can't say the fights are particularly engaging either. Most of the monster attacks cause a fair amount of knockback, and most of the CC/Deployables the hunters have can be instantly broken by a basic attack. As a result, all the hunters are doing is trying to avoid drawing the monsters attention, with the primary target being thrown around and CC'd to death with very little chance of evading.\n\nThe game may grow on me, but it wasn't worth the cost IMO.\n\n** Note ** The problem most people have is with the amount of DLC. Although I didn't have a problem when they announced the packages, since they were being upfront, I WAS disappointed to see a truck load of day 1 pay DLC not included. I stopped buying games from EA because of their practice of launching day 1, and microtransaction, DLC on full games. I will no longer be supporting 2K games after this.","February 11, 2015","false","27.2"," 353 of 500 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","353","500","3","4"

The gameplay is great.\n\nThe packaging however is truly godawful. Even without mentioning the horrific balls up that is the DLC, everything around the game is shoddy and desperate.\nUnskipable FMVs. I thought we were past this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that forced everyone to delete the file in their install directory.\nMatchmaking. Please, my god, don't match on experience. It means nothing if I can grind XP in solo matches but am actually useless in a game against human players. I won't even talk about the being unable to actually pick the class you want, or the fact there's barely any penalty for leaving an inprogress game. You know those people who haven't lost a game? Its because they leave if they're losing... which brings me on to\nCompetition. Ranking boards that rank on WINS? So if I grind enough, i'll be top, even if i'm truly godawful? Fantastic. You can compete with your friends to see how many games you play. Any form of serious ranking would be a godsend - even just an automatic loss for quitting an improgress game.\nGame Finding. No, I don't want to join a game as the monster where he's 2 bars from death and stuck in an arena. No I don't want to join a game where i'm in a team of complete AI against a human. That's what solo is for.\nGame Choice. I fancy a nice Nest game. Oh no, sorry, you have to play a full 5 round game to have a good shot of getting one of those games. But its ok, your team mates will probably leave if you lose a round. So it's back to solo.\nDLC - because obligatory corporate moneygrabbing is what all the cool kids are doing.\n\ntl;dr - great gameplay, ♥♥♥♥ wrapping, even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ publishing. Unless they do some serious reworking, I wouldn't recommend it.","February 14, 2015","false","47.4"," 579 of 847 people (68%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","68","579","847","23","12"

That means it is subject to change at the time of the official product release.\n\nEvolve was iconic at E3. It delivered cutting-edge visuals with immersive gameplay. It also introduced a style of gameplay that has not been ventured into much by other developers.\n\nAt E3, Evolve was the next big thing. It was the successor to Valve's immensly popular Left4Dead franchise. But did it deliver its intended effect?\n\nNo.\n\nThe visuals are stunning, the physics are wicked, the concept is good and the mouse optimization (along with changing the color scheme on the mouse) when you play as different classes is the neatest thing I could ever imagine a game would have (though I was slightly confused initially, as I did not know the game could do that). Then, what went wrong?\n\nThe core gameplay. The core gameplay lacked most of the elements which make a game worth playing. Throwing in millions of dollars and thousands of hours of development to introduce nifty elements to the game failed to mask its complete failure at entertaining the player.\n\nIn my five hours in-game, I chased a raving leaping lunatic monkey relentlessly, occassionally cornering it and killing it. However, the amount of time spent in chasing the said monkey was so high, that it was not worth the kill. The hunters were disabled by the fact that the monster moved significantly faster than them and could easily elude them even at close ranges. Occasionally, we spent nearly three-quarters of an hour, searching for a monster that switched positions from corner to corner of the map, making it impossible for hunters to intercept or even reach remotely near.\n\nDid you want to wait instead and set a trap for the monster near the power relay and kill him once he arrived there as a stage 3 beast? Too bad he had full armor at that stage, his hits dealt 3x damage and the power relay had very little health.\n\nTrapping the monster in a portable dome didn't help either, because he'd lunge around the dome till it ran out and escape, leaving you chasing him for another half-hour. Additionally, to the monster's advantage, there was no time limit on how long each round would take, so the monster could eat and elude at his leisure and take his sweet time destroying the power relay.\n\nLastly, the FOV of the game felt slightly absurd and personally for me, induced mild motion sickness, so that's a disclaimer for anyone wishing to try the game.\n\nBy the end, the game made me feel as bitter as this review is.","February 10, 2015","false","5.1"," 256 of 361 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","256","361","8","0"

Four hunters. Hunters chase monster, and if the game goes on long enough, monster chases hunters. Sort of. The game changes the objective of the hunters to defend a point when the monster hits stage 3 of evolution, which should really be called the "♥♥♥♥ the Hunters So Hard" stage.\n\nAll in all, that is the entirety of the game, a game that costs 60 USD, and doesn't really deserve to.\n\nIs it fun? Sort of.  Between in game voice chat bugs, a cursor that just wont quit in game, and a sense of general balance issues here and there, the game has a lot of problems. The core idea of the game is a good one, and has potential to be fun. Killing Floor and Orion Prelude have similar ideas, and both are a hell of a time.\n\nHowever, this game has more problems than good to it right now, a problem that I can't say for certain will be fixed.\n\nAs far as the ludicrous DLC amounts, look no further than the 99.99 USD PC Monster Race pack, that gives a fifth playable monster, two aditional hunters and four monster skins. It also includes the base game, but that is a lot for release day DLC in a game that lacks as much content even when compared to "free to play" MMORPGs by Aria Games (somewhat legendary in their lack of content in games), and even worse, when compared to the often times $1 Orion: Prelude where at least you can enjoy the sensation of killing dinosaurs, across more maps. Bare in mind that the fact that it costs 60 base, they are asking 40 for the privelage to play an entire monster type and two hunters.\n\nIf you, like me, bought this game; I am sorry, but at least you weren't the only one, and assuming the bugs get worked out, it can even be considered a good time. I will still be playing it occasionally, if for no other reason than a boost to my own self esteem, a desperate ploy to make me feel like I did not waste my money. If you were lucky enough not to, don't. Wait on it, and see if this game becomes worth the $60 price tag or not.","February 14, 2015","false","3.6"," 791 of 1,178 people (67%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","67","791","1","28","18"

A small number of hunters, monsters, and game modes. Of those game modes, only one is supported, Hunt, the rest of poorly designed and balanced filler. Even Hunt itself, even after a year of updates, is still an unbalanced mess.\n\nThe game is also plagued with game breaking bugs that they wait months to fix. Right now, the newest monster, has a bug that keeps him stuck poucing on a hunter. It's completely game breaking, yet they'll happily put out more paid content instead of fixing things they actually charge money for.\n\nThe game is completely multiplayer focused, yet doesn't have the player base to support adecuate ranked matchmaking and queue times.\n\nOverall, the game doesn't have very good support, gives you little for it's price point, and can be daunting for newer players.\n\nIt's a sad tale, because the actual gameplay is fun. The idea is sound, it's the execution that's flawed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Underdrill/recommended/273350/","Underdrill","Underdrill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Underdrill/","248 products in account","EDIT: This game is officially the first game in history to have not one, but TWO season passes!  4 hunters for £20 is an absolute joke and the monster price is over half of what the pass costs. The game was fun while it lasted, but it seems Turtle Rock/2K are trying to milk the game till it's dry now. Free content wise you get an arena mode which I bet didn't take them more than a month to make.\nSorry, but 2K and Turtle Rock haven't fixed their DLC policy but instead breaking a world record: Most season passes in a video game. If you want the full experience, it's going to cost you bucketloads. The game is not bad as you will see, but I'd wait until a massive discount comes along.\n\nEvolve is a 4v1 asymmetrical First/Third person multiplayer game. There really is nothing like it.\n\nIn the game, you can take control of 12 different hunters, split into 4 classes (Assault, Trapper, Medic, Support) with 3 in each class, or you can be 3 different types of monster.\n\nThe assault is what you would expect. They deal the most damage with their arsenal of things like the Lightning Gun and the Flamethrower.\n\nThe trapper is unique to this game. It's job is to trap the monster with the mobile arena and various ways of slowing its movement.\n\nThe medic is, again, what you would expect. Surprisingly, each of them play very differently from each other. You can heal 1 hunter, multiple at once, or you can bring them back when they are incapped.\n\nThe support class can deal heavy damage and help its team find and trap the monster easier. You can play an offensive or defensive role with them, or a mixture between the two.\n\nAll of these classes are great to play as. However, as in any co-op game, the hunters may not always be great to play with. The trapper and medic are the most important on your team, and if they don't play well enough, they will most certainly die. They can also troll much easier by using the arena anywhere the monster isn't and stopping the teams progress. I would highly recommend you play this with friends as you can still earn progression through it and you will have a better experience. The public experience is not terrible though. I've encountered only a couple of trolls in my playtime.\n\nThe monster is probably going to be what sells this game for most people. Instead of a first person view, you view and control the monster in third person. Instead of hunting the monster, you need to avoid the hunters long enough to stage up. Before every game, you can put 3 points into your 4 abilities in various different ways for different playstyles. The monsters also play very differently: One is your classic big brute, another is your flying "cthulu" menace and the final is your sneaky deciever.\n\nWhat I really like about this game is that there is thousands and thousands of ways a single game can go. The main gamemode is Hunt and that can play out very differently each time. You could spawn and find it almost instantly, or you may never find it until it hits full power. The other game modes, Rescue, Nest and Defend, offer even more possibilties. These three appear more often in the Evacuation campaign which is made up of 5 matches across all of the different modes and maps. Depending on who wins the match (Or if the monster destroys the power relay of the map in Hunt) a modifier will be applied to the next game which will make it easier for one side and harder for the other.\n\nThe games progression system is what will decide the game for most people. You start with 4 hunters and 1 monster. The other charactesr in the class can be unlocked by playing with the previous hunter in the class. You need to deal a certain amount of damage or heal a certain amount of points to complete the mastery challenge for that character. There are 3 tiers and they get harder as you go further down the line. You will unlock rewards like badges and at the end, an elite skin, which I think looks awesome (Blue and Gold).  However, some of the situations are really rare and it is better to farm them offline. It dosen't always feel boring offline though, but it really depends on what you are trying to complete.\n\nThere is also a level system that goes from 1-40 (This will be increased later down the line). Every level you will unlock new badges and perks or improvements on the existing perks you have.\n\nThere are 16 maps (4 only found in Defend) and they all feel quite varied despite the fact the game is set on 1 planet. There are 4 different biomes and different wildlife can be found in each. The maps of the same biome do feel a bit similiar, but not by much.\n\nThe creatures are really unique and the universe in whole (shown through some of the characters conversations) is really interesting and I hope more is added. Because the game is mainly a multiplayer game, it is not all that well explained outside of the voice acting (Which is brilliant and occasionally quite funny). It reminds me of Titanfall; the story can be completely ignored and you won't be missing out at all.\n\nOverall, I don't really think the game is worth my purchase.(£30). It is unique and you will not find another game like it, but I'd recommend you wait for at least a 75% off sale before jumping in. 7.5/10.\n\nNow I will give my opinion on its DLC. The day one DLC is skins; get over it (They don't even look that good in my opinion). Characters and Monster will be paid while gamemodes and maps will be free. I really like this model because the community is not split and you will still be able to play with and agains the new characters. I do agree that it is expensive. £12 for 1 monster when it should be more like £8 and £20 for 4 hunters which, when compared to the decreased monster price, is more reasonable. The Hunting Season pass dosen't even include all of the upcoming hunters, and I also think that is wrong. To conclude, the way the DLC is structered is perfect but its pricing is not.","June 18, 2015","false","85.9"," 197 of 280 people (70%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","70","197","280","15","26"

Horrendoulsy boring game, once you put so much time into it.\n-Advertised as being extremely replayable with OVER 800.000 combinations. Needless to say that if it was so, it  would not be so extremely repetitive 95% of the time, each time. 95% of the time I played through the same instances, with little to NO changes. In 41 hours (I don't count skirmsh of course, which I played very little, for it sucks big time after a while), I had maybe around 16 changes. Some people made it up to this same number. If the game had nearly 1 million combinations then the game would have very slim chance to be repetitive right from the start.\n-There are 3 versions of the game: base game = 60$, deluxe (around 10-20$ more) and Monster Race edition, originally selling for 99-100$. I got Monster Race edition with HIGH HOPES that I would get everything in the game. What did I get?! FIRST FEW HOURS AFTER RELEASE, I start playing  game and witness COUNTLESS DLCs FOR SALE. Needless to say, each one is overpriced at least 3 times of what it has to be sold for.\n-Very few game mods.\n-Very few monsters. Might be no longer a cons, when there will be AT LEAST 5 to choose from.\n-Not enough wildlife, too many same species.\n-All maps are pretty much alike. Nothing special about them at all, thus no favorite maps.\n-As a monster, you often feel yourself incredibly weak in the beginning, until you at least reach the last stage-stage 3 and that takes quite a bit of time to run and hide from hunters. Expect around 15 minutes and more for that.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Good cinematics.\n-AI is not bad.\n-Had 3 not game-breaking bugs (like disappearing cursor problem) in the solo (offline) game and mp. And that is good considering how buggy games get to be on release date.\n-No crashes, no errors, no other technical problems. Plays butter-smooth most of the time.\n-A lot of interesting hunters.\n-You can overtake available bots in mp.\n-You can take a break and let the AI play for you.\n-You can leave the game and there still will be 4 vs 1 players.\n-Monsters are not hard to move/play around with.\n\nVerdict:\n\nFalsely advertised and EXTREMELY overpriced game. 100% COW-MILKING. 120% disrespect towards its consumers. 200% BS.\n\nP.S.: Usually as I buy a game, I either come back to it within 1 or max 2 days! It's been nearly a week since I last launched the game and I still am not sure that I want to come back to all this repetitive stuff.\nGood games don't make you regret wasting your life on them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DynoAK/recommended/273350/","DynoAK","RenTu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DynoAK/","220 products in account","Evolve is the recent game to be added to Turtle Rock Studio's small collection of games. Most known for their development of Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, they have yet again tried something new with the development of Evolve. This game carries a lot of controversy mainly in regards to the price range. I agree with the concerns of the price point of this game and the amount of content you get for such a price. Do I believe the game is worth $60.00? No. Plus the additional editions which can raise the price up to 20 dollars or even an additional 40 dollars? No. You might be wondering what Turtle Rock Studios is offering you for such a price. Let me go ahead and tell you what you get.\n\nFor $60.00, you'll get the base game, nothing less, nothing more. 12 characters, four game modes, and three monsters. Pre-ordering the game gave you a copy of Left 4 Dead and magma skins for the monsters.\n\n$80.00 got you the Evolve Digital Deluxe edition. This includes the base game plus the Evolve Hunting Season Pass which includes four new hunters at a future date.\n\n$100.00 gets you the Evolve PC Monster Race edition. This includes the base game, the season pass, a fifth playable monster called the Behemoth at a future date, the magma skins as well as the four new characters. I do not believe that this comes with all of the optional skins, it may or may not.\n\nWhether or not you're willing to spend that much for the items I just listed is up to you. For me, it isn't enough. I believe that the behemoth is a ploy to keep you from trading away the game.\n\nGameplay-wise, how is the game? Well, the gameplay of Evolve is tense and very smooth. The characters are very easy to control as well as use. Although some of the characters are harder to use than others, everyone has the skills necessary to learn and perfect a class with a little time and effort. The game does come with a tutorial for every hunter and monster that you unlock. This makes it easier for you to understand how to play a match with your characters. The AI has been drastically increased from that of Left 4 Dead. When playing Evacuation mode you have the option to play with a group of four other players against an AI controlled monster. Or four players against a human controlled monster. The AI controlled monster is pretty much hard mode as it does target those important hunters first making the coordination of your team crucial.\n\nWithout communication in this game, you're doomed to fail. By default, you can ping with the q button. This will make a ping noise and mark in the area where your crosshair is pointed. A necessary tool for those with and without communication. Although microphones are always best. This game is better played with a group of friends as opposed to random players.\n\nBut what about the actual hunters and monsters? Is there any point to upgrading? Yes. As stated earlier, the base game gives you 12 hunters and 3 monsters listed below. Each of the hunters have flaws and unique abilities that make them special.\n\nMedic Class:\nVal - First\nLazarus - Second\nCaira - Third\n\nSupport Class:\nHank - First\nBucket - Second\nCabot - Third\n\nTrapper Class:\nMaggie & Daisy - First\nGriffin - Second\nAbe - Third\n\nAssault Class:\nMarkov - First\nHyde - Second\nParnell - Third\n\nMonster Class:\nGoliath - First\nKraken - Second\nWraith - Third\n\nThe game modes consist of the regular hunt mode, survivor rescue, defend, and Nest.\n\nHunt - Goal: Hunters vs Monster, monster must reach level 3 in order to destroy the relay or kill the hunters. Hunters must kill the monster.\nRescue - Goal: Hunters must rescue and escort the survivors to an extraction point. The monster must kill a certain amount of survivors or kill the hunters.\nNest - Goal: Hunters must destroy a certain amount of eggs before the monster is able to hatch or kill the hunters.\nDefend - Goal: The monster must destroy all three of the hunter's generators before the time reaches 0. The hunters must defend their generator until the time limit is up or kill the monster.\n\nMy personal feelings for the modes are below.\n\nHunt - Fun, fair, cat and mouse mode.\nNest - Hunter-sided if you have a team that knows what they're doing.\nRescue - Fair as long as the monster isn't an idiot.\nDefend - Monster-sided, the monster has respawning minons every 30 seconds, and the hunter's generators cannot regenerate power.\n\nWhat about the gameplay? What can this game possibly offer to make you continously interested? Well, people are right to have fears about being bored of this game after several hours of gameplay. It really is the same thing over and over again and it does get boring. I didn't expect to get bored of this game so soon, but I did.\n\nThere are several mechanics in this game that just make me believe this game is a cash-in from Turtle Rock Studios.\n\nDay one DLC, skins. Why? For a game that is 60 dollars there must be some sort of replayability right? Wrong. The replayability that comes with this game eventually turns into a grind to get "elite" status for a character. This begins a series of questions for the terrible matchmaking. Here are a series of issues I have with the game to sum up this review.\n\n#1. Why are we restricted from filtering out certain monsters from a "server"? Not everyone wants to play against a certain type of monster, in my scenario and almost anyone else's, wraith. It's such a lame monster. High damage, and high evading capabilities. It's also a real ♥♥♥♥♥ to track making the match a grind and forcing people to resort to abandoning a server if they are just not in the mood to go through the process.\n\n#2. Why are we restricted from having a party member be allowed to be the monster? If your worries pertain to something along the lines of "well, you can sit there and grind elites with your friends and cheat experience", then that's invalid. You're able to create a customized match and set the map settings to pretty in depth settings. The thing about these customized servers that only your party can join is that you can still gain regular experience and character progression. So if you need 900 direct hits with Parnell's rocket launcher to reach your elite skin, no worries! Just grab a buddy, set the game to monster favored, set the strikes to 0, and have him kill your AI partners. Once done, feel free to hammer away and exploit the game's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ elite skin game design.\n\n#3. Why is our only means of customization through the elite skins? Yes, I get that you can purchase weapon skins and a couple skins for the monsters but why? Why isn't something like that already in the game? For Turtle Rock Studios to hold the Behemoth and extra four hunters until a later date, you'd want to be continously interested in the game. You wouldn't want to get bored so fast into to the game. Sure, there are perks that you unlock as you get further into levels, you can also customize a badge with little pieces and different colors as you progress through levels. But that kind of stuff doesn't give me something to work for. I don't log into a game and say "yes, I can't wait to play all day and unlock this particular badge piece." I'd want to sit there and randomly stumble upon different skins and such.\n\n#4. Why do the characters feel so limited as to what they could do? They should at least have different loadouts in which you can fool around with. It really makes the game feel empty. Val only gets this and that, Markov only gets that and that. There's no mixing up their weapons with other class specific items. I'm not saying have Markov have the ability to use Parnell's super soldier or shotgun. Give each hunter unique skills that they can reassign and fool around with.\n\n#5. What is so hard about making an efficient matchmaking system? Many other game devs have been able to pull off a decent matchmaking server. I'm tired of having monster so far away from first place and the game constantly makes me the monster.\n\n","February 17, 2015","false","169.6"," 176 of 253 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","176","253","0","12"

There is one way every Hunt match plays out. The monster tries to avoid combat until it evolves to level 3. The hunters try to find the monster before it can evolve. This is the game. Unlike other games that allow for perhaps an early sneak attack (Zerg rush!) or unorthodox strategies, Evolve only allows for one way of play. You will conform or you will lose.\n\nApart from the signature Hunt mode, the "campaign" mode takes about a hour to finish. This mode could have been pretty interesting, with a real story and meaningful choices. Rather, it is just a string of 5 matches in a row with lip service to story. Think Titanfall's campaign but somehow worse.\n\nThe other game modes are very slight variations on Hunt that clearly were thrown together without much thought. Rescue in particular is so very poorly balanced with the Monster given competing goals of trying to evolve but also forced to immediately attack the Hunters.\n\nThis game could have been so much more. There is so much potential in the concept. It took Turtle Rock years just to come up with a barebones experience with formulaic matches. The unlock progression system is also of the extremely grindy variant that gives mathematical advantages to obsessive players and discourages new players.\n\nThen there's the day one DLC and in-game DLC store despite asking full price up front. An abomination.\n\nIn conclusion, when Call of Duty has the decency to give us a full 10 hour SP campaign, a distinct Coop mode, and a full-fledged MP mode, Evolve's one gimmick game design just doesn't stand up to the competition. But hey, those first two hours were fun!","February 12, 2015","false","3.5"," 701 of 1,083 people (65%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","65","701","1","17","5"

This game should be either a 50$ tops or a free to play game.\n\nHowever the price of the game does not define if its good or not.....as much as I would love to say everyone come buy this game they really shouldn’t, here is why:\n\n~ GUI bug's: while these are not game breaking it is a royal pain in the ♥♥♥ as you will face having a mouse cursor while you run around as a hunter and no mouse at all when you are in menus making it hard to change classes and perks.\n\n~Monsters: Although it is clear that Monsters are supposed to be powerful, the biggest issue is that two of them (Wraith and Kraken) have such an easy time running away from the hunters so that they can ignore stealth almost altogether in favour of simply running away so unless your trapper is A class and you have a team with great teamwork (In a public game what are the chances of that?)  You simply wont catch them or catch them long enough until they are rank3 and have no issue taking out your party\n\n~Humans: A couple of hunters have issues that should have been picked up in Beta but for some reason they got ignored\nfor example Cabot (main character I play) his rail gun is supposed to shoot through walls to hit the monster yet what they dont say is that it only seems to work if the monster is pressed up against the wall you are shooting into, not only that but for a rail gun you would assume that the weapon would have no range limitations however it seems that it does making it frustrating. Hyde for some reason was given a  grenade that is supposed to cause a puff of toxic smoke to hurt the monster if it stays in place not only does it do such a little amount of damage its a pain to rank up, other plays will hate you for it because the visibility issues it gives the other hunters makes it more of a disadvantage then advantage (There are more but I am trying to save on boring anyone kind enough to read this).\n\n\nLong and the short of it...this game would be good fun with a group of friends playing with Mic's having a few beers making it worth the bugs and the oddities with the game but in random public games it just isn’t worth your time or your money until they fix what they should have fixed in the Beta.\n","February 12, 2015","false","25.4"," 529 of 817 people (65%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","65","529","817","13","1"

I'm going to start off with what's great about the game:\n\n-It's easy to learn, but there's room for mastery. This has its costs and benefits, the obvious benefit is that the game is accessible to newer players, but this isn't to disparage other games with massive skill curves, initial hurdles like that can allow for beautifully complex gameplay, but thankfully Evolve doesn't shoehorn in complexity where none is necessary or enjoyable. The monster and hunters each have a short set of weapons that fulfill unique roles, instead of a multitude of tools that are largely redundant, instead of trying to learn a massive list of rock-papers-scissors you just need to figure out how to appropriately use the tools you have.\n-It's got variety. People take this for granted, but the developers actually did a great job of varying the abilities of monsters, the weapons and aesthetics of hunters, and so on. People don't complain about every hunter being the same, or having the same kind of weapon, or every monster having the exact same abilities, but you can bet they would (and rightfully so) if the devs had neglected this aspect of the game.\n-Maps, and this goes back to the previous point to some extent, Evolve actually has quite a few maps- enough that you'll get tired of the gameplay before you ever get tired of the setpiece for that gameplay.\n-It looks pretty good, graphics aren't a dealbreaker but I can appreciate the immense effort that went into modelling, texturing, etc. to make this game look good without requiring a super computer to run it. Just from examining the environment, equipment, wildlife, hunters, or monsters, you won't conclude that the devs cut corners, no, to reach that conclusion you'll have to actually play the game.\n\n\nSo, why is the game a disappointment? Two reasons: balance and community. The latter problem, the community, is not technically a problem with the game itself, but this is a multiplayer game and matchmaking can take quite some time, so I hope you've got something to do while the game looks for a match (especially if you prefer to play monster.) Balance, what's wrong with balance? Well, all of the maps are understandably somewhat small, if they were significantly larger it would essentially mean that if a monster broke line of sight long enough it'd be able to escape the hunters for the whole round, some maps however are extremely small (Broken Hill Foundry) and are nearly unwinnable for the monster- if you take Wraith whose whole build is predicated on stealth and you get stuck in a ♥♥♥♥ map like that you are screwed, sure, there's some difficult choke points for the hunters, but that doesn't really matter if you're a level 1 Wraith with no survivability and unimpressive damage dealing abilities. When I played about a year ago (less than that, but not by much) the semi-competent monsters would usually stomp pubs, but any competent team of hunters would win the vast majority of games against even competent monsters. At this point, it seems like any team of pubs can just stomp the monster, at least the Wraith at this point which has been nerfed quite significantly since I last played. This is ridiculous considering the fact that competent hunters were already favored in a head to head match, because if they used their abilities like sound spikes and sending track darts into prey the monster will likely eat there's no chance the monster can sneak around until they get to max strength like I sometimes used to get away with. Maybe the players are much better now (certainly doesn't seem that way,) but I think monsters have been nerfed into the ground, the basic reasoning by the devs being that it's better to have 4 medicore players hunting the monster leave satisfied than to have 1 competent monster beat out 4 mediocre hunters who can't work together. I think the problem with the devs attempts at balancing is they base their attempts at balancing off of win rates and statistics, but not from actually watching gameplay. If competent hunters beat competent monsters 80% of the time, this would suggest to me that the game is unbalanced (hypothetically.) If comptent monsters beat incompetent teams of hunters 80% of the time, this suggests to me the obvious fact that when you have two equally powerful machines (a monster/vs a 4 man team of hunters) and the latter "machine" (hunters) has 4 "moving parts" (players) that can fail, it stands to reason that if the game is actually balanced, the monster should win the majority of the time because it's far more likely that one of the "moving parts" is faulty in the hunter's team- yet, the devs aim towards a 50% win rate, which means they're aiming towards having monsters lose 50% of the time to a team of hunters which is 4 times more likely to contain an incompetent player- the target they consider balance will be biased against the monster because they fail to recognize that a fair match between 1 monster and 4 hunters should naturally favor the 1 monster- a monster doesn't need to worry about communicating with teammates or relying on them for success. Balancing the game off of win rates and shooting for 50% win rates will lead towards a bias against the monster, random teams of hunters that don't coordinate should not have a good chance against a competent monster. Imagine that in online chess one side consisted of one player, the other of four players who were not allowed to communicate at all- the one player is naturally going to be favored; now instead imagine that the four players have the option of communicating by microphone if they plan in advance, even then there's a good chance one of the four players will screw it up, meaning that although the game is balanced the single player will win more often; this line of thinking apparently has not crossed the minds of the developers, or they simply do not care to examine extensive amounts of gameplay at various skill levels to get a view of game balance that is more grounded in reality.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game unless you have 5 seriously interested friends with VERY consistent schedules, otherwise this will (almost certainly) be a waste of money, especially this late into the game's life.","March 13","false","13.0"," 73 of 95 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","73","95","2","1"

You'd have to really like the base game to go through all that, and there isn't much variety of game modes or maps to do so with.

This game is really solid all around.\n\nThe hunter classes are all great, and do a great job to contribute teamwork if played correctly. The three hunters for each class that the base game gives you are all pretty unique on how they work so changing up your technique with your team has options. The three monsters (Goliath, Kraken, and Wraith) you get are all very challenging, and that's one of the best features this game has.\n\nIf you can play the monster right, you can wreck face all the time, but if the team of hunters can cooperate effectively they can turn the tides easily at the start, or put up a fight towards the end. THIS GAME REQUIRES PLENTY OF COOPERATION BETWEEN HUNTERS TO TRULY ENJOY YOUR EXPERIENCE PLAYING THIS GAME AS A HUNTER. A lot of games say this, but this one really takes the cake. You just can't have two hunters on one side of the map, and the other two split up doing their own thing. You will get ♥♥♥♥ on. Do yourself a favor, and try to get some friends to play this game with. Playing solo can be underwhelming due to not having anyone to really communicate with if you're playing as a hunter, but of course you might just get into a lobby where people communicate. Try, and stick with 'em! If you like playing as the monster, by all mean, go solo.\n\nOther nice stuff are the graphics, audio, and its tight gameplay. The graphics are pretty damn good, and they don't break my computer. I'd say you can get a smooth 60fps on high to very high settings on mid to high end computers. I'm not entirely sure on this, but I've heard this from others, and their rigs. The audio for this game is pretty spot on. Wildlife animals, monsters, and the atmosphere of Shear really bring this game to life. The hunters voice acting is also damn good. They did a good job making all of 'em unique with different accents, personality traits, and unique dialogue between one another. Gameplay controls are pretty standard for FPS players. You'll pick 'em up pretty easy like most FPS games, and the mechanics of the game very fitting.\n\nNow why am I not recommending this game?! It's honestly because if I didn't get the PC Monster Race for half the cost, I would not have got this game. The direction 2K & TRS are taking this game in terms of DLC & pricing is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing bonkers. They are gonna charge people 60 bucks for a game with two game modes, a handful of hunters and three monsters? They are gonna charge people a hunting season pass for 25 bucks that only has 4 of the 6 upcoming hunters you got planned out? So, wait a minute.\n\n60 (base game) +25 (season pass) +15 (monster) +15 (monster) +7.50 (hunter) + 7.50 (hunter) = 130\n\nThere is already 70 bucks worth of content priced out as DLC right off the bat on release not adding the cosmetic shop. That's some kind of ♥♥♥♥. I can really understand all the hate the game is getting due to this business practice. You just don't get anywhere near the amount of content for 60 bucks off the base game. If this game was around the 40 buck area it would be way more appealing to everyone, but it isn't. It's simple; buy the base game for 60, and you will be left out later on if you play this game a lot, or buy the PC Monster Race edition for 100, and be set for the current stated content. It's a super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ move that will hurt the future appeal of this game. But I guess since 2K did this with Borderlands 2 (not as extreme though), and games like PAYDAY 2 can get away with it without a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brewing, they'll try it out.\n\nIt really is a great game, and I'm having a blast playing it, but what 2K & TRS are asking from its audience is too much. If the cost is ridiculous, and it's turning you away. It's understandable, but if you really wanna buy it & play it. Wait for a Steam sale, a definitive/complete/GOTY/whatever version with all the content, or search the internet for good deals like GMG, ♥♥♥, or something. But if none of this bothers you, and you wanna pick it up. You'll have fun once you're in.\n\nTL:DR~\n\nPros:\n+ Paid half the cost for PC Monster Race edition (pro for me at least)\n+ Solid gameplay\n+ Great controls\n+ Graphics are great\n+ Audio & dialogue are spot on\n+ Monsters are terrifying\n+ Hunters are badass\n\nCons:\n- Two game modes, very limited\n- Playing by yourself can get boring (unless you like playing as the monster)\n- DLC\n- DLC\n- DLC\n- DLC\n- DLC\n- and DLC\n\nGame is seriously fun playing with friends. Looks, sounds, plays, and feels great. The pricing for DLC is ridiculous. Try and get it cheap elsewhere, or wait for a sale.\n\n7/10\n\nHappy hunting, or not.","February 12, 2015","false","36.0"," 212 of 325 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","212","325","5","1"

First of all it's difficult to see them properly and I have a full HD resolution on a 25,5" display. So when I say it's difficult to tell them apart then something is seriously wrong. As a hunter on the other hand it's so easy to lose track of what is happening around you because when the monster hits you your screen is all shaking around. If someone wants to play this with Occulus be prepared for nausea attacks.\n\nI just can't find any redeeming qualities in this game.

You get a few seconds of jet fuel before it runs out, and when it does, you are done, unless tour team is willing to spend all their time healing and protecting you, which is never the case. It is understandable, that the game is about team effort, but it is extreme. However, the biggest problem I have with this game is that the movements / controls feel slow and clunky.

First, it has potential. Second, there are moments when it is very fun and exciting.\n\nNevertheless do not buy this game. It is not worth $60, as there is almost no content, and after a few rounds its overly repetitive. Moreover, the little content that is included is extremely buggy. For instance, several of my friends had their sound cutting on and off during combat. Randomly your mouse cursor will appear on the screen, which is not in line with your centered cross hairs, making aiming and navigation confusing and difficult. There are at least a half dozen loading screens before a game starts, many of which just seem superfluous and unnecessary. Oftentimes one player will get stuck between loading screens while everyone else moves onto the next one, requiring you to either abort the player or restart the game. Randomly a friend will get booted from a game, when their internet service is working fine. Overall, this is an unfinished game, that should not have been released. But even if it WAS finished, it does not contain $60 worth of content at all. Not to mention there is $130 worth of DLC, which should be included in the game as is, since the game itself is not complete, functioning well, nor does it contain close to $60 worth of stuff.

Monster needs to kill all hunters or destroy Power Relay in order to win the game. Hunter's need to kill the monster in order to win the game. Gameplay might seem familiar to some people who have played "Nosgoth" or "Primal Carnage" which also have similar concept.\n\n\nHunters\nHunter's have four classes, each class has multiple characters with different playstyles:\n\nMedic Heals teammates, Slows and marks the Monster. Hitting the marked points using assault weapon results in huge damage.\n\nAssaulter Main damage dealer. Has weapons like rifle, flamethrower etc. with utility abilities like grenades and mines and a self shield.\n\nTrapper Traps the monster within a certain radius and helps tracking the monster using pet, sound trackers etc. Also has an ability to pin the monster in place for a short time.\n\nSupportNegats the damage done to allies, Stealths allies and has the ability to Air Strike the monster dealing huge damage.\n\n\nMonsters\nThere are currently three monsters in  the game Goliath, Wraith and Kraken both having different playstyles.\nGeneral gameplay of the monster:\n\n- Relies on stealth early because of weaker early game.\n- Requires feeding on neutral monsters in order to get stronger to face the Hunters in an upfront battle.\n- Once reaches level 3 can steamroll the hunters 1v4 or destroy the power relay to win the game.\n\n\nGOLIATH\nMelee  monster who destroys hunters 1v4 once level 3. Fun to play once you learn to use the stealth and feeding to level up. Weak at level 1, Too hard to take down once it hits level 3 so patience and stealth is the key early game. Never won a game against a level 3 Goliath or lost a game as a level 3 Goliath.\n\n\nKRAKEN\nRanged monster with sniping abilities and can destroy hunter level 1. (Needs balancing) Fun to play with skillshot abilities and brings in a totally different playstyle. Needs to be nerfed and should have lower health/armor compared to Goliath.\n\nWRAITH\nWraith is the stealthy assassin. She’s a space alien Monster who warps around the battlefield, ripping into her enemies with her blade-claws. She can hit – then run – before you even see her coming.\nThe Wraith has considerably less health and armour than other monsters but makes up for it in agility and surprise element, favoring a stealthy gameplay style.\n\n\nPositives\n- Hunter classes are fun to play and evolves as you gain experience with different characters unlocking with each class.\n- Fun to play as the monster and destroy faces 1v4 after levelling up.\n- Nicely designed map.\n- Amazing monster design.\n- Good sense of progression as you put in hours.\n- Competitive gameplay since co-ordination is required at a very high level.\n\nNegatives\n- Some hunters are totally useless against certain monsters. For example: Maggie's traps are useless against Kraken.\n-Pay to win inclined model since you must have certain hunters in order to deal with a particular monster and new Hunters are shipped as purchasable DLCs.\n- Balancing issues. (cant complain due to Alpha)\n- Monsters are hard to play compared to Hunters in terms of overall effort required.\n- Sometimes you have nothing to do as a hunter if Monster is playing super stealth mode, need more activities for Hunters.\n\n\nBeta Changes\n-New Game modes.\n-Kraken got nerfed but still pretty strong mainly because you need certain Hunters to counter his a ss.\n-Improved Performance.\n-New Hunters and a new monster.

A prime example of when greed kills a game. If they had made it F2P this game wouldn't have been surrounded with controversy. It also wouldn't have a dying playerbase. Unless it goes F2P or cheap, I'd say to save your money.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFSpDjRMC8s&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nPlayed as Jumanji replica of Van Pelt named; "Griffin," jumped out of dropship, was hot on monsters trail the moment I hit the ground, shot cool wildlife while character shouted what a badass he was, Medic stepped on venus human trap and no one noticed, got eaten, huge toad monster played with Assault; then ate him, Support fought random animal instead of flying past it. Caught up to monster, monster cimbed rock face and got his face 1 inch away from mine, breathed fire, slammed me against ground and threw me at rockface fifty meters away, ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped Support and watched him fly thirty feet away. Breathed fire on me. Slammed me back into rockface when I lit him up and downed me, Monster wondered why the game wasn't over. Saw Support Cloak reviving me with a sliver of health left. Monster euthanized Hank with a boulder; cigar never left Hank's dead mouth.\n\n11/10 Should've stuck to hunting Robin Williams. (R.I.P. You fantastic F***ing actor.)\n\nEvolve is a Sci Fi shooter trying to surpass the cooperation concept of the Left 4 Dead franchise. Following a Merc-Hunter crew that chases huge monsters and underlines the "Hunters become the hunted."\n\nCHARACTERS/ROLES: Something that must be said, is that this game is very brutal and unforgiving for newcomers, if you are one of those competitive people who stuff video games into their life, prepare for a red forehead from facepalming and a lot of leadership and teaching (and raging), microphone is a must. Being that its a role based team of hunters, when new players pick a role that is crucial, such as Trapper or Medic, they will sabotage your game and pull you down with them. In order of importance, in MY opinion, it goes like this.\n\nTrapper > Medic > Assault > Support\n\nTrapper is the most important because skilled monster players will avoid you like ninjas, tracking has a sharp learning curve and involves more then just chasing big blue footprints; Daisy cuts you some slack if you are new to the role and will let you contribute to the team, without actually contributing to the team; meaning if you suck and cant track a poodle. Daisy will at least revive teammates on your behalf.\n\nMedic is more than just self explanatory; Val, the tier one medic, has a crucial ability of tranqing the monster, allowing the medic to make up for a mediocre trapper. And of course is crucial to keeping the crew alive.\n\nAssault is the main damage dealer, but is more forgiving because a badass Trapper or a good Support can compensate for him.\n\nSupport is the least important, but still essential to the team, aerial strikes and counteracting monster rushes on the Medic and Trapper so the team can keep up the good fight. And catching the team when they are losing makes the Support essentially a fallback role.\n\nThere is some witty banter and situational shout outs which make the characters interesting and alive, you won't hunt the monster in absolute silence, tactical callouts and jokes from superb voice actors make the crew likeable. The character tier system in the game make it self explanatory that Tier 2 characters require a much better skill level to play the second character effectively, Tier 3 in comparison to Tier 2 is still easier, as the abilities are so fluid, that you can both attack and support your team.\n\nThe Tier 3 characters are absolutely boss, Abe is by far my favorite character. Characters are set up in tiers of their typical teams, easily summed up with\n\nTier 1: Team Cohesion and selfless abilities. Focus of drawing out fight and countering with precise attacks. (Orbital strikes, Energy shield, Med gun, Mines, Harpoon traps)\n\nTier 2: Survivalist and DPS abilities, synchronized attacks and harrassing the monster. (Lazarus Device, Harpoon Gun, UAV, Sentry turrets)\n\nTier 3: 100% Combat oriented Team, 90% of abilities are intended for use during engagements and hot pursuits. (Healing grenades, Tracking Darts, Adrenaline rush, Stasis Grenades)\n\nGAMEPLAY: The maps are very big and very alive, wildlife will hunt and flee as well as feed and migrate, the game is visually stunning and very immersive. Gunplay is fun and satisfying. Good Monster players can make the Monster role seem insanely easy. Noobs will get caught by hostile wildlife and ignore you when it catches you after you free them. Noobs will also successfully trap a whole four players; all of them your teammates! Playing your role effectively will give you tense moments of action and fun, adreniboners will be common in this game, there is an obvious balancing issue that needs to be addressed with the Tier 2 monster the Kraken, or "Cthulu" Tier 3 monster the "Wraith," as it can spam the decoy ability too effectively whilst taking no damage and delivering full damage to Hunters, not only that, but any HUD icon signaling the monsters whereabouts that the Trapper placed on it with Griffin or Abe is directly on the Decoy. However, the Monster is the most important player in the game being that unskilled players won't even make it fun for the Hunters.\n\nMONSTER: This needs it's own section because I can't compliment the monsters voice acting or background. I must say it is very worthwhile to go hard out into the role of monster. Stealthing isn't the only way to eliminate Hunters, rather than stealth I prefer to leave my tracks deliberately, going right through dens of hostile wildlife and jumping over rivers with Tyrants (Alien Alligators) sitting at the bottom, without a competent Medic or Trapper as I stated above, as the Monster you will absolutely stomp the Hunters. knowing how to outrun and trick the Hunters is key, at one point without even engaging them until stage 3; I killed two hunters with two Tyrants. Daisy is like a pumpil on your butt and makes Monster challenging, as she will make sure to avoid you and not plunge herself into danger to revive teammates, you will find Hunters using every strike they have after you stomp the Trapper and Medic.\n\nVal is a solid 10/10; absolutely delicous, Markov is a tough 7/10; but the vodka adds nice flavor to the meat, I am a fan of delicous dark meat Maggie with a Daisy side was a good 8/10, Hank's beard gets stuck in your teeth; 5/10.\n\nThe Wraith, is an absolute badass; between it's stalking and strategic attacks, it's a serious change of pace from the Goliath, the most accurate way to sum it up is it's basically a floating ninja that teleports. My very first game as Wraith was way easier then the Goliath or the Kraken, rather then accurate ranged attacks or just rampaging through a hail of gunfire you instead trick the hunters into leaving a huge opening. I did so using a decoy while attacking the relay, my decoy went left after the lone support, the Hunters grouped up on the opposite side of the room firing at it, the Support jetpack dodged into his team, one supernova attack forcing them into the corner, and they all died at the same time. I win.\n\n\n10/10\n\n+ Characters well written with superb voice actors\n+ World well designed with a living environment\n+ Core concept of Teamwork surpasses Left 4 Dead\n+ Monster gameplay is tense and fun\n+ Satisfying gunplay and action\n+ PVE rewards Hunters and Monsters\n\nUnforgiving for new players, brief tutorial, no chance to practice\nMatchmaking system matches new players with veterans\nBalancing issues\n\nSHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!","November 3, 2014","true","50.5"," 422 of 673 people (63%) found this review helpful 84 people found this review funny","63","422","673","84","12"

This is primarily a multiplayer game and single player is just a copy of it but with bots, a welcome way of play/practice, but it has nothing single-playerish in it story wise. And pricing for this product is bloated. Fair price would be around 30-35 €/$ (as these currencies for some reason seem to be of same value in gaming world). With season pass and some extras being 50 at the highest. Alot of vanity DLC (skins) inside the game besides the already expensive game.\n\nAs I have not encountered any technical issues whatsoever, my suggestion is if you can afford it and spending this amount doesn't grind your gears - get it. If you cannot - wait for discount or look for a cheaper variant elsewhere besides Steam.\n\nAs creating review requires an "up" or "down" vote, I had to go with not recommended for now since game has bad business model (being too expensive and probably even greedy).\n\nRight now I would put 7/10 due to accessibility/pricing of product.","February 10, 2015","false","18.0"," 68 of 95 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","68","95","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJenssen/recommended/273350/","MrJenssen","MrJenssen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJenssen/","520 products in account","NOTICE: I see that my total playtime for Evolve is listed as 0.0. This is an error, I am not sure why it has occurred. I played the game for approximately 6-8 hours before I wrote this review.\n\n\nEvolve is a pretty simple game, at its core. You and three other hunters team up to defeat an enormous monster controlled by a fifth player. Or, you control the monster yourself, starting off relatively weak but through eating local wildlife and staying out of the hunters’ path, you evolve to two more powerful stages. Reach the third one, and you become a nigh unstoppable killing machine. Though there are multiple game modes and each of the four hunter classes have three different characters with a unique loadout, every round of the game plays pretty much exactly the same. And that’s where the problems start to pile up. You see, Evolve is a bare bones experience to put it mildly. There are only a few maps, and all play the same. There are only two modes of play. The main mode is Hunt, which has the hunters searching for the monster which tries to evolve to a powerful enough stage so that it can kill the hunters or destroy an important building. And then there’s the “campaign” mode called Evacuation, which is five random matches loosely tied together by some well-produced but hollow and meaningless cinematics. The matches themselves are played in three different game modes - all of which are slight modifications to the Hunt-mode, all playing the same.\n\nAfter some time, you’ll come to realize that you had seen the entire game already within the first few hours of play. Sure, playing with a different hunter or monster gives you other abilities, but you still do the exact same thing every match; escape and evolve as the monster, search and hunt as the hunter. And the way you do it isn’t even altered either. Every match either ends within a couple of minutes in which the monster player is trapped and killed early - and likely rage-quits as a result - or the monster eventually reaches stage three. By this point, the hunters have been running around the entire map for fifteen minutes, uneventfully sniffing at tracks and looking at birds. It might sound like some sort of intense “quiet before the storm” build-up, but it really only is exciting like that the first few rounds. After that, the distinct feeling of monotony sets in. Evolve is extremely repetitive, and the flawed progression system that’s supposed to have you coming back for more, does a ♥♥♥♥ poor job at doing so. It even goes so far as to force players to use ineffective methods that can lead to a match loss, just so that you can level up and unlock the next character for a class. And if you don’t have any friends who play the game - or God forbid, you live in Europe where nobody uses voice chat in public play - then you are out of luck. Playing Evolve will feel like playing the lottery. You’ll rarely find a match where people talk in a friendly manner, work together and try to enjoy the game without ruining everybody else’s day.\n\nEvolve is, if anything, a solid backbone to what could’ve been an amazing game. Evolve would have been an amazing free-to-play shooter. The groundwork is there, and it’s solid. The controls are responsive and the mechanics are streamlined to the max. It’s a concept that is clearly thought out, and apart from a few frustrating bugs and balancing issues, the overall impression is extremely polished. But with the lackluster amount of content that you get for the asking price, the inherent monotony of the gameplay and the downright offensive DLC strategy that asks $15 - the equivalent of an overpriced map pack - just for a single new monster-character, I doubt that a couple of paid DLCs offering new monsters and hunters will be enough to keep the player count strong for more than a couple of months at best. And that is just sad because it’s evident that the developers knew what they were doing, but it seems the publisher got in their way at every junction. Cut this out, save it for later. DLC this, DLC that. When you pay this much from the get-go, and then are expected to keep paying in order to actually get a slight semblance of variety out of the damn thing, then it honestly isn’t worth it in my book. If you’re going to get Evolve, then get it cheap. Very cheap. And because there aren’t any dedicated servers, you’ll be wise to check if the game actually has an actively playing community at all when you first decide to plunk down the dough.","February 25, 2015","false","0.0"," 216 of 345 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","216","345","6","15"

Good game if you maybe are lucky enough to have a team of people you know in real life. Extremely unbalanced despite what every official review says. I have yet to lose a match to a monster when I have 3 human teammates, no matter the handicap on evac. I also have yet to win as the monster against 4 human controlled hunters, again despite the handicap. The maps are too small. Being the moster is boring and sadly lonely. There are a ton of little things missing that most any dev should have been able to do, 2 examples being:\nCan't play a custom match with only 1 friend and still chose bots\nExtremely hard to just quickly look at your character progression goals from any screen other than after match reports\n\nAgain, would be an amazing party/lan game if you had enough people to fill the slots. Would also be a great game if I didn't have a life so I could build up a friend list of people I've only met online who play this game so I wouldn't have to Q alone and be the monster 99% of the time in online PvP. But unfortunately, I have to work and stuff.\n\nLastly, I agree with everyone, the pricing for this game sucks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gerafin/recommended/273350/","gerafin","Firewall Jackson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gerafin/","534 products in account","Disclaimer - This review was based on the Alpha Weekend and Closed Beta builds of the game. I have not had a chance to play the new game modes or the new characters included in the final version. My "Not Recommended" rating was meant to dissuade people from pre-purchasing what I consider to be a 'wait-and-see' quality game, and as such the review is less applicable now. If I ever purchase the game, I will update with my final thoughts. I will leave it up for now becaue 1) the comments are hella amusing and 2) I think some of my criticism still applies to the final product, if the professional reviews coming out are any indication. Thanks for reading!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW(S) -\n\nA QUICK CLOSED BETA UPDATE:\n(Also, note that my hours in closed beta aren't reflected in the 4.8 above)\n\nPlayed some more in the closed beta. I realized that a lot of the people saying "you're playing the game wrong" in the comments are nicely outlining one of my issues with the game. There's a specific, pre-defined way you're 'supposed' to play, and the challenge is in sticking to that script. In multiplayer games, the human element allows incredible breadth of strategy and personal style - but Evolve is constantly trying to get you to play it on its terms. By so rigidly structuring each match, Evolve is severely limiting its own replayability. This is reflected in the current pricing situation: it seems to me like they are trying to set themselves up to make most of their profits in pre-orders by bundling content in different ways, because interest in this title isn't going to last very long.\n\nI hate being so negative, because I really wanted this game to succeed. I hope Turtle Rock rediscovers the spark that brought us Left 4 Dead with their next title.\n\nALPHA WEEKEND REVIEW:\n\nThis game ticks all of my boxes: it's a unique, asymmetrical, jetpack-fueled FPS that relies heavily on teamwork (or being a sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, in the case of the monster). Sounds great, right? Game of the year material, yeah?\n\nNot really.\n\nIt's in alpha, so you have to take the following complaints with a grain of salt. I do feel, however, that my issues with the game are deeply rooted in the current design and won't be fixed with more content or polish. I would be very surprised if any major changes are made this far along in development, and I think it would take some major changes to fix the issues with Evolve.\n\nFirst off: GRAPHICS. It's very pretty. It's running off of Crytek, so this is to be expected. Great textures, models, and monster animations. But the visual design is terrible. Everything is a muddy grey color, and they've got the 'dark and moody' dial cranked up to 11. It gives all the levels a very samey feeling. And it doesn't help that the  -\n\nLEVEL DESIGN is homogenous. The maps are all fairly small, mostly open, with a fantastic amount of verticality. There are places to hide as the monster, and good chokepoints for the hunters. The levels are decent, but at this point too similar (hopefully the new maps will spice things up a little). The issue is the size of the monster prevents the level design from influencing the mechanics of the game in any meaningful way. Whenever you encounter the monster (outside of the final defense), the battle will play out similarly no matter where you threw down the 'mobile arena,' with little influence from your environment. And it doesn't help that the -\n\nHUNTERS have few meaningful decisions in combat and otherwise. Your class defines pretty strictly what you will be doing in combat. Use lightning gun until its cooldown kicks in, switch to assault rifle until cooldown is up, switch back, place mines, repeat. The classes DO interact in interesting ways, with the support providing temporary invincibility to one player, the medic healing, and the REALLY interesting ability to tag spots on the monster with a sniper rifle to create vulnerabilities. The problem is that these abilities are so specialized, and you have such a small repertoire, that sometimes it feels like the battles are playing themselves. It only takes a few encounters with the monster before things start to feel repetitive. This wouldn't be an issue if the gunplay itself was interesting, but aside from the jetpacks, it's some of the most uninspired, unsatisfying, console-esque 'hold button while reticle is in vicinity of enemy'. It probably feels great for console owners, but for PC shooter fans, this is some mediocre combat.\n\nThe hunting itself is lackluster. For the most part, you bumble around, sort of following the monster's path, sort of just hoping you'll run into him. I suppose this could be better with a more skilled group, or a group of friends who communicate well - but relying on friends for fun is really lazy design. The idea of 'hunting' is so central to this title that it really needs to FEEL like you're tracking down a monster, which it rarely does. It mostly just feels like you're chasing something much faster than you. That's not a super gratifying experience. There are environmental hazards that insta-kill you if you teammates don't rescue you quickly enough, which is frustrating. I guess they're there to spice up the combat, but I've never seen them act as more than a nuisance. Luckily, it's much better as the -\n\nMONSTER: the best times I've had playing Evolve were as the monster. Knowing when to engage, the constant feel of being hunted, the tense moments of vulnerability as you evolve into the next stage, the terror as you're surrounded by a dome of light and can no longer run away... It's good stuff. I can see myself putting a lot of hours into this game in the hopes that I can play as the monster.\n\nCONCLUSION: This feels like the developers plucked an interesting boss fight from a larger game, and then tried to duct tape a bunch of stuff on in order to justify selling it as a standalone experience. If there are major changes made in the next few months, they might make that duct-taped mess interesting enough for this game to have staying power. But I'm not holding my breath.\n\nEDIT: I've thought a bit more about Evolve, and I've come to the conclusion that another reason (and perhaps the main reason) it fell flat for me is the pacing. Every form of entertainment has an ebb and flow of action that keeps the audience engaged, and I feel Evolve was sorely lacking in this department. Even when you're hot on the heels of the monster, hunting has little tension as the hunters, but as soon as the mobile arena comes down tension is immediately ratcheted sky-high. There's no natural ebb and flow, there's just periods of mild disinterest with the occasional intense battle. I sort of feel like the 'mobile arena' is too contrived of a concept, and that there should be objectives during the match to force confrontation. This would allow the designers to control the interest curve and keep people engaged at the same level for the length of the match.","November 2, 2014","false","4.8"," 1,255 of 2,121 people (59%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","59","255","2","55","82"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mudkipdr/recommended/273350/","mudkipdr","It Was At Least This Loud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mudkipdr/","146 products in account","I was extremely excited about this game. I played in both of the betas, and I have to say, I was so hyped for the release. My main complaint is with the masses and the day 1 DLC etc. The biggest problem with this is that unlike other games, where you pay for skins, they are a big change. Looking at LoL for an example, you pay 5 bucks for a skin, and it completely changes how the character looks. Maybe not different particle effects, but it gives your character a fresh look. In Evolve, you pay 3$ for a "skin", and you get slightly different textures on a your guns, and the character models stay EXACTLY the same. The only skin you can obtain in game is the Elite skin for each individual character, which is a joke. Once you level up one character to get the elite skin, there is absolutely no incentive to play that character again unless you just enjoy playing that character. Skins being out since DAY ONE, where they are nothing special and dont deserve to be paid for and should be able to be earned in game is such a slap in the face to the player.\n\nMy other complaint is more of a petty one, and this has to do with the monster choices. During the first couple days when people where still unlocking mosters, I got to experience a good variety of monsters. However, when people had the game for a few days, and got to acquire all of their unlocks, the monster picks became very easy to expect. Monsters, if they have it, will almost always play Wraith. In about 75% of the games I have played in, they have been against wraith, with Kraken being the next, and Goliath is almost never seen. I believe this is more of a blance issue than anything, but something that really makes this stand out, is that Wraiths are just NOT fun to play against. Every mechanic they have is just antifun for the hunters, and really doesnt promote hunting it down, becuase it can just escape so easily, making you want to just wait until stage 3, and bet it all on the fight at the power relay.\n\nI don't recommend this game for these two reasons: DLCDLCDLCDLCDLC, and the plague of the Wraith. I would definitely not buy this at full price and I would suggest waiting for a GotY edition.","February 18, 2015","false","30.1"," 143 of 229 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","143","229","2","0"

I enjoy the game modes that they  implemented into the game (Hunt, Rescue, Nest, & Defend) and then Evacuation (combining the 4 modes into an interesting 'plot' over 5 days). The 12 hunters all have their own personality and kits/weapon loadouts making each of their gameplay different from the other (from Markov and his lightning gun to Parnell with his rapid fire shotgun). There are all sorts of playstyles mixing up the hunters. A fun game in my opinion though I do not know if I would charge $60 for a multiplayer only game (yes even the 'solo' campaign mode is the same as multiplayer, just with bots instead of other players). I felt thats the bots both fellow hunter bots and the monster bot are really well done in the game (though they can bug out occasionally). The game maps are interesting though some feel a bit simialr to others, though all in all the 12 different maps make for interesting and varying gameplay. To add onto the game, future maps and game mode will be free, making the base game amazing\n\n\nNow for the cons. While the game itself is fun, there are some parts of the game, or parts to be added that drag it down. The first would be the three ways of obtaining the game. A flat $60 for Evolve, the $80 delux edition, and the $100 PC Monster race all three do not include the day one DLC. Given it is JUST COSMETIC, so it isn't that big of a loss though trying to sell the season pass or the 100 dollar order without the added DLC leaves a few questions to be asked. On top of the DLC, future monsters as well as hunters will be an added cost so while the player gets new maps and modes, the new characters are locked less you pay. Given they are fun, Hunt, Rescue, Nest & Defend get stale after a while.\n\nAll in all, if you can find the game with everything included (all they have to offer in one package) then jump all over it. Outside of that, either just get the game and enjoy it for what it is and try to ignore 2K trying to sell you DLC which merits the negative review","February 14, 2015","false","22.7"," 270 of 450 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","270","450","8","0"

I will not using pitiful excuses you're seeing on most reviews either and will be straightforwards.\n\nThis game is certainly not worth £35, but I trust you know how to axe £10 off of that, winkwink, then I would argue that it is, but spending cash is partially relative to the customer. There is no reason to buy any other variations of the game that promise things such as unlocked hunters given that all unlockables are incredibly easy to achieve, and can be done against bots/solo. You have a right to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the idea that there is going to be another monster that MUST be purchased, and is not unlockable. (Obviously, these bundles are more expensive too, but essentially offer, nothing).\n\nCurrently there are severe balancing issues with the Wraith, who still keeps a skewered win rate, who I trust will be nerfed to the ground, (6 second decoy with 50% cooldown reduction, it's a smart idea I swear, lets put it on a mammoth bird, not a sloth, lets put it on something that dies in two hits) but the Goliath and Kraken are balanced additions to the game. As are the majority of hunters. However, certain hunters dramatically outperform others.\n\nFor example, Abe can track the monster nearly indefinately with correct movement and a near guarentee trap if he pays\nattention to the map and monster movement, as well as stasis grenades that ground the kraken and severely slow monsters. He diminishes Val and Bucket.\n\nFurthermore, with characters like Lazarus, Bucket, or Hyde on the team, the monster has a near certified win if performed correctly,\n\n-Lazarus's healing ability is pathetic, he has a niche role to ressurect the dead, a dead anything should not be happening in the first place, it's like losing your legs to attach a gun to your forehead. You make sure things do not die, period. You place yourself, as Lazarus, in a position where you can get singled out and destroyed in a matter of seconds because you have to approach a corpse which the monster knows is there, and seeing how you shimmer, leave footprints, and leave jet smoke, you're hardly invisible are you?\n\n-Bucket is by far the most useless character in the game with a gimmicky turret system, all of which break with ease or unintentionally under hails of AoE and smashing, he provides zero support aspects to the team, and his UAV is outclassed by Abe's tracking. Hank and Cabot genuinely provide support by buffing the team, even Caira does this and she's the ♥♥♥♥ing medic. Hank is especially good seeing how you can provide a shield to someone in distress, and wipe over 1/3 of a monsters health with a splendid airstrike combined with stasis/tranq/harpoon/cabot's damage boost.\n\n-As for Hyde, he's more 'in your face' then the rest of the assaults, whilst Markov can safely pick away with his L.gun and has access to mines that do impressive damage, making him useful in all modes, and Parnell's ability to not only deal good damage from far away, but skyrocket his damage with the S.gun + rage combo, Hyde is left in the dust, he can only huge a goliath with a flamer and get torn to pieces.\n\nIf you are not concerned with balance or other semantics, you just wanna buy a game and shoot a monster and be a big monster, go nuts, seriously, because it's exactly that, but it certainly isn't worth the price on Steam.\n\nTL;DR I recommend you wait for a few months before trying this, the price will go down if you're getting this on Steam (why) and things will be more balanced.\n\nEDIT: I will further add that the line of "This is the complete game with things you can choose to buy" with "You get the entire game if you pay more money" is very, very thin and suspicous with this, especially considering you must pay for a monster that is not far from launch.","February 14, 2015","false","49.0"," 250 of 416 people (60%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","60","250","416","54","5"

When I started my first game I was shaking. When I had my first encounter with the monster I became distraught. I did everything I could as a trapper to keep the beast down. Placed a perfect dome multiple harpoon traps as magie and multiple shots with the harpoon gun as Griffin. Although i succeeded with Griffin to keep a monster from jumping away. All the monster needed to do was melee the harpoon cable off (makes sense) then countinued jumping. I was reloading my harpoon and when i was ready for another shot the monster is on the other side of the map (litterally). This game is beyond one sided (in favor to the monsters). Hunters helplessly chase down monsters with no sprinting abilities and a jetback with a horrible recharge rate and jumping (do not even try to dodge a massive aoe knockback from a monster will hit you any way). In the few games I have won with hunters were lucky wins. I was lucky that the monster didnt even try to eat and fought the team at stage one (still downed two people). Won a defense game barely with generator close to being one hit away from destruction (The monster entered the lobby and said "They need to make this mode easier".). Do not get me started on the Wraith.

Let me address some issues I see people complaining about when they talk about Evolve:\n\nGame price: I bought the game two weeks after launch for 22 Euros that included the 4th monster (Behemoth). If you buy games off Steam at launch and complain about prices, you aren't doing it right. Brick and mortar shops are still cheaper (at least in EU) and game code websites will probably give you the best prices. Learn to find good deals people.\n\nDLC: There are only two real DLCs - 4 additional Hunters and the 4th monster (the latter you can get for 2 euros more when you buy the Monster edition of the game). They aren't pay to win, other Hunters are at least just as good, if not better and Behemoth is by far the weakest monster in the game right now. Granted, the price for the Hunters is a little steep, but other games charge for maps, instant max levels etc. All Evolve has other than those two real DLCs are skins. You don't need them to enjoy the game.\n\n"It's a running simulator": No, it's not. You're just playing with random groups against a good monster. Play with friends. Don't have friends who play the game? That's alright, neither did I when I started. Evolve added about 40 people to my friends list, some of who are now my best online buds I play other games with as well. Here's a simple guide for finding good players to play with: 1) Go solo with randoms 2) Listen for people using a microphone and watch how they play 3) If they're good, consider asking after the match "Hey, can I add you on Steam?". Took me no time at all to find an established group I still play with most of the time which makes the game (like any multiplayer game really) a lot more fun. Or, if you like playing solo, play the Monster and get good at it, no friends or communication required.\n\nBugs/glitches: Not very many left of them in the game. Most of the big ones got sorted out very soon after launch, there's mostly just some minor ones left and they hardly drag the game down. Hell, Steam itself crashed more on me than this game ever did.\n\nBalance issues: Aside from some Hunters being less useful (which is honestly debatable unless you're playing the game at a tournament level), the balance is pretty awesomely handled, especially for an asymmetrical game like this. Devs have been balancing the game constantly and for the most part, it's been pretty well done. Yes, there were some flavour of the month issues, but those exist in any multiplayer game and they weren't even as egregious as some of the FotMs I've seen in other games.\n\nSo what are the real issues of the game?\nThe issue of the game was terrible marketing. The launch was plagued by several releases of the game that made the process of buying the version with everything you wanted (if you wanted to get the new hunters, the new monster etc.) confusing as hell and it lead to all the DLC complaining since it just left the players looking at the store with a ton of skins.\n\nOther than that, the only issue in the game right now is the small playerbase. All this game needs really is more players and even my experience so far, from the launch has been a blast, definitely one of the best games I've ever played and still do.\n\nThe experience is unlike any other, hunting the monster with a couple friends is hands down the best co-op experience I've had in any game and that includes L4D. There's plenty of diversity between the classes and within them, different characters play different ways and it takes a long time to get tired of even a single character, especially as you can just switch them around if you want a rest from one as they're pretty much all viable (the offensive Supports are the ones most often looked down upon, but they have their uses as well).\n\nPlaying the monster is amazingly fun as well, though I have less experience with this side (I play it occasionally, but I'm more of a team co-op kind of guy). It does truly feel incredibly powerful and there's a feeling of progression when you play it every single game (Stage 1 is made to run, Stage 2 to fight and Stage 3 to annihilate). Even after more than 400 hours in the game, playing the Monster still gets my blood pumping every single time because you're constantly on your toes - Hunters have to work together, but they can also rely on one another. As a Monster, you're alone and have only your own skill to work with.\n\nThe game as a whole is a true joy when you get that perfect balance of a really good monster player and a really good hunter team; which, as long as you're not just sitting silently behind a monitor, never engaging with other players, is not even that hard to arrange. As I've said above, it's easy to make friends as a Hunter and even playing from the Monster side, you're gonna make some friends who'll want to play against you (or even with you, if you play the Hunters as well) if you just talk to them between the games.","May 29, 2015","true","295.6"," 225 of 382 people (59%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","59","225","382","19","11"

A lot of people compare it to Left 4 Dead, but I think it's way better. Gameplay is fast and fun. Controls are decent for the most part, a few glitches here and there, but those will most likely be fixed. I guess there's a story in it, but it doesn't need one, 'There's a monster in the woods, go kill it' is good enough for me. The characters are actually well devoloped for the most part, in terms of personality and gameplay. The graphics look great, but not so great that you can't stay focused on the objective, which is neat. The monsters are also well designed, despite a few over-powered abilities that SOME monster has (  wraith ), but all in all, the teams are fairly balanced. One of it's major flaws is that it has a matchmaking system out of hell. The networking needs to be improved dramatically.\n\nThe biggest issue with this game is the price. While the game is fun as all hell, it does not have the necessary amount of content to be worth $60. It has singleplayer and multiplayer, but they're essentially the same thing. The characters are fun and interesting, but there are so few of them, and putting a pricetag on the rest of them is a bit low. Not saying it doesn't have a high replay value; it really does, but for the price it's at now, you're not getting a fair deal.\n\nIn conclusion, unless you have a lot of money and wondering where to dump it all, I wouldn't bother getting this game until the price drops significantly. It's fun as all hell, and doesn't present many gameplay issues, but it's not worth what's on the current price-tag.","February 13, 2015","false","13.2"," 48 of 72 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","48","72","0","3"

Hide and sneak is impossible at higher levels of play, it's a mad dash to catch the monster, and a mad dash to eat/level up as the monster.   The main issue with the game is it has no variety, Even with the modes, and characters provided.\n\nThis doesn't bode well for the future of asymetric games.","February 28, 2015","false","130.3"," 272 of 468 people (58%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","58","272","468","10","39"

The game is crazy fun; TRS had lightning in a bottle, and they have screwed up in every conceivable fashion.\n\nIf a game is any good, hardcore competition will Evolve naturally.  The devs tried to bill the game like this from the very start, to the detriment of the majority playerbase.  The focus on competition at the expense of casual has lead to the community as we see it today; the remaining playerbase is elitist, salty, and generally all-around jerks.\n\nPros:\n-The characters & story are genuninely engaging and fun.  Credit where credit is due, the universe of Evolve extremely entertaining.  The official forums has a writing section where the lead writer posts canon backstory & events.\n\n-The customization options for a match are numerous and fun, but are virtually inaccessible (see Cons).\n\n-Hunting, the thrill of the chase.  When both Monster & Hunters have the mindset of providing a good fight (as opposed to soley winning or stomping), Hunt is adrenaline-packed good time.\n\n-Community challenge every 2 weeks awards a skin or set thereof.  I have like 50 in total now, and never spent a dime.\n\nCons:\n-Complete lack of options for pub matches (non-Ranked).  You can't choose map or game mode, nevermind all of the really cool map effects and other fun options (extra critters for Monster, bonus Turrets for Hunters, adjust Strikes & Timer, etc.).  These things are exclusively available in private matches (solo or with friends).\n\n-Ranked mode is the only way to consistently play Hunt.  Again, focus on competition at the expense of everyone else.\n\n-Most Hunter skins are literally a single color change on the weapon.  A few Hunter skins are stand-out, and Monster ones range from 'decent' to 'lulz awesome'.\n\nSummary:\nThe game is dead, and has been for quite some time now.  I'm just glad I got to enjoy the ride down.  At this point, nothing can save it short of the devs acknowledging their mistakes and directly all efforts to improving public gameplay.","February 1","false","751.0"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","28","38","4","1"

Even more fun when you're playing with a full party of your friends. The action is intense, and though I intend on playing this game far more, it isn't a game I can sit and play for an entire day. The graphics are beautiful, even if you can't play it maxed. Unfortunately though, a good portion of the matches you play turn into a game of chasey-chasey catchey-catchey kissy-kissy where you run around the outside of the map Benny Hill style for ten minutes until the monster finally evolves and you head for the power relay. This gets old very quick. The other side of that coin are the battles you win by the skin of your teeth that get your heart racing. These are especially enjoyable.\n\nNow for the reason I can't recommend this game. The pricing model. Marketing the game at $100 ($120 on consoles) for full content is insulting and a massive affront to the people who were excited for it in the first place. If it were a fremium game with a cash shop to purchase additional characters or skins, I would 100% recommend this game. And if I hadn't made a promise to my friends that I would buy it when it came out (I don't preorder games. Ever.) I would not have bought it. My recommendation to you, is to wait until it inevitably goes on sale for a more fair price. A $120 price tag on an arena shooter is outrageous. Vote with your dollar (If you wish to call me a hypocrite I understand). 2K chose this pricing in fear of Evolve not generating enough revenue. Show them they're doing it wrong.\n\n(2-14-15) I finally had an opportunity to play Evacuation, and this is actually a very fun mode. It changes up the gameplay a noticeable amount and keeps things fresh. I certainly intend on spending more time playing this mode. Some fights include Nest, where the monster starts out at stage 3 and you have to destroy it's eggs. This completely does away with the Benny Hill chase and is one of my preferred modes to play. There are also others where you have to save soldiers and bring them back to the dropship while the monster tries to kill them. Why these modes haven't been advertised as much is completely beyond me. The same "Left 4 Dead tank battle" comparison is still accurate in these gamemodes, but to a somewhat lesser degree. Evacuation is definitely a highlight of Evolve.\n\nThere is slightly more content than I originally thought, though a $60 price tag is still questionable. My recommendation shall remain No for the time being, but it is slightly less harsh of a no. I will update this review in the future if my opinion changes but still, the biggest problem I have with the game is the focus on DLC. Not so much the DLC itself (it's just aesthetics), but the fact that it is clearly 2K's biggest concern at the moment, which I still view as a poor move.","February 10, 2015","false","16.2"," 53 of 83 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","53","83","0","1"

Don't buy into the half-a-game-plus-DLC business model. It's ridiculous that we allow developers to build a game that is functionally incomplete at day one, and charge us $60 for the intentionally limited honor. Vote with your wallet.\n\nThe company didn't even care, in their now publically regocnized mistake, to allow preorders to upgrade to the packages that were later released. Gave them money when they were griping about delays? Not only will they treat you as second-rate to second-comers, that extra time was used to make DLC. They are and will only ever be interested in minimum input to maximum profit. I'm still in shock that they delayed this game just for the purposes of shoving additional day one DLC down our throats. It's unbelievable that they would ever think it was acceptable to take our money, and use it to delay the game just to charge us more!\n\nIn the abstract the idea of the game is great, but purchasing the game and its current content just can't be rationalized.

Prime Example, Torvald was released with MORTORS that the damage capacity to nukes entire ARMOR + HALF HEALTH of monster in matches. Took TRS to 5 Weeks to fix this issue(Very BAD trend to do balance updates from collected matches and continues today).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeAWmHKNgCk\n\nUPDATES - Updates in General supposed to fix and nuke any form of hidderence a game has, EVOLVE does not seem to have that effect. In fact it the opposite, every update that brings fixes or balances, brings new forms of bugs or old bugs that was patched in prevous UPDATES. Prime example, Wraith abilties use to have the abilitiy to STUN lock a attacking hunter from doing anything, Basically use 3 Wraith ABILITIES back to back to prevent that specific hunter from moving or doing any form of action. This wraith issue was patched but was brought back with a update.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKzJ-FMmZc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw8fMlI9BDE\n\nCOMMUNITY PC - Majority of the community believes that balance are fine and arnt exploitable on maps, said combo hunters or monster depending on updates. Turth is the community knows very well that update always is bricking something and they want these bricking updates to stay because they want to win all the time and not have good fair matches. TOXIC COMMUNITY!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=532301833\n\nDLC SKINS - DLC for skins are overpriced as hell and arnt really worth while except for MAGGIE or the MONSTERS skin's because those skins has the most noticiable changes. While other skins are just changing the color of your weapons and hardly noticble.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/341842/\n\nDLC CHARACTERS - While some DLC characters have been release they always had a negative impact on the game more than postive. Mainly due to how broken by underwhelming or overpowering features each character has. PRIME examples would be Torvald again which is MORTORS nuking monsters to nothing in seconds. Sunny's insane Jetpack boost which give hunters insane movement and jetpack refuel is another prime example plus the exploitation to put drones out of monsters range to destroy it. Last and finaly.... Behemoth was released broken as hell with his abiltiies being to slow to perform that hunters can basically just dodge easy as hel. Rock wall as the name stands for rock wall never worked for months on ends. Perform a rock wall ability and the skill would never form and it did it would have huge holes. Even those behemoth has been patched multiple times rock wall is better but still has holes, small ones.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=524072031\n\nDRM - For some reason TRS/2K decided to use a 2 system DRM control, Evolve requires steam to play and play online. Second DRM is MY2K account(2k DRM) and for some reason if they goes down theres no chance to play online. Added noted, if you purchase DLC and register to steam it will say OWNED. However.... 2k DRM will some times read DLC not own and unable to use that SAID skin or DLC character(2k went full blown ♥♥♥♥♥♥, never go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥!).\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=534380855\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=540065163\n\nNetworking - Because there is such low amount of players PING status will be EVERYWHERE from 10s to 300s+ pings, mainly due to players changing their steam region download to more areas that is being played(dead games in parts of the world) like here in the US. However... those pings can drasticially call the out come of the game(DMG wont register or be seen til 2-4 seconds during fight and DMG taken can wildly insta kill you due to slow rate being processed.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520625413\n\nGAMEPLAY - The game itself is original and fun to play how ever, there is always a trend based on Updates/Balance patches to determine what is currently Strong in the game. Meaning, what ever update/balance didnt break one of the monsters or hunter characters will always be strong based on those patches. Game is ment to be competitive gameplay like COUNTER-STRIKE franchise but I do not see that in this game. Players will always use Specific Hunter combos to exploit certains skills or land enviroment to fight against monsters. Anti-Cheats in this game is none-existing and that can mean alot of things, from Crashing Matches because some one is about to loose, Aimbots that never misses, Wall hacks that are constantly up, Weird gimicks that Delay Abilties to players, and soo much more. Game population is declining to 150ish @ late nights and peaks are 500-600 prime time, which makes finding matchs near 10-30min wait times or never.\nhttp://steamcharts.com/app/273350\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg_-jfu-72M\n\nPERFORMANCE - When the game was launched and Beta round #3 I used to be able to play this game @ MAX SETTINGS with no issues. However with all the addition to new Characters and updates that MAX settings is now @ LOW settings. I even swap to WIN10 to gain the performance I wanted and I did.... However, those performance gains, I get with other PC games like DYING LIGHT or BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT(Says alot because game launched broken as hell). I do not get those performance GAINS with EVOLVE and continues to be the same performance even with WIN7 or WIN10.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=532102573\n\nSHADY TACTICS - Not only does TRS/2K acknowledge how bad EVOLVE is failing they will only show whats need to be shown on the steam GAME COMMUNITY HUB. In otherwords, they will show guides or gifs that have funny or positive ups. I had no idea that they can pick and remove subjects on the COMMUNITY HUB page. talk about SHADY TACTICS.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=532520010\n\nTHESE ARE THE REAL REASON WHY EVOLVE IS FAILING - SLOW UPDATES, NO ANTI-CHEAT, BUGS BUGS BUGS, EXPLOITS.\n\nDo yourself a Favor, dont buy any products from TURTLE ROCK STUDIOS.

I love the concept of this game but I just dont see myself continue playing this game with how TURTLE ROCK STUDIOS continues to how crappy support its been given.(LEFT4DEAD 1=TRS / L4D2=VALVE, amazing trend.)\nhttp://steamcharts.com/search/?q=left+4+dead\nhttps://www.turtlerockstudios.com/games/\n\nGame went FREE TO PLAY for a weekend and the sales did not revive this game except for a peak of 1k players for a week or two after the TRIAL period.

Instead of it being a 'hunt' style of game for the hunters..

You had so much potential with this game!!! You just threw it away!!!\nLet me just say, I am a fan of this game... Or I was... It was so unique to me, and it had this charm that most games now a days don't. It's assymetrical 4v1 style was perfect. I enjoyed every minute of it, even on the losing side, it was fun.\n\nThe game is divided into two perspectives, a first person view of the four hunters hunting a third person monster. The four hunters must use teamwork to defeat the monster, and the monster must use his skills and wit to destroy the hunters. The hunters have four classes, Assault: Damges the monster, Support: Buffs the hunters, Medic: Heals the hunters, Trapper: Traps the monster. There are many game types, but the most often game type is the default hunt mode. I'll go over that and a couple more.\n\nIn hunt mode, The hunters must find and kill the monster, before he can reach stage three and destroy the power relay, or, alternatively, the monster can win by killing the hunters at any time. You basically go out and hunt the monster. When people can't find a skilled monster, by calling it a "Running simulation" there's a flaw with that... It's a HUNT. You aren't supposed to find the monster instantly, and he can attack at anytime. Also when you finally do catch the monster, it's a burst of adrenaline. The hunters know they have to do as much damage as possible, and the monster knows he has to last until the dome goes out, or incap the trapper. This makes the game intense. This complaint brought us the worst game type... Arena mode. Arena mode was half ♥♥♥♥♥ attempt by the developers, to bring back people to the game, it failed horribly and the people who loved the game in clinging to the hope that something would change to make it better, were let down hard from this. Including me and my friends.\n\nThe other mode I will talk about, is evacuation. Evacuation was a consecutive five match "campaign" mode, and the fifth mission is a defend game type that has the hunters defending the evacuation ship, and the monster attacking it at stage 3. Defend is considered to be the most boring game type by the majority of fans, but they quickly change their opinion to arena mode, which shows how bad it is. I put campaign in quotations becaue I can't really call it a campaign, but it did convey a story. Basically, Evacuation was put into the game for the map effects, which changed the maps greatly by benefitting the hunters or monster. It basically works like this. Let's say you are on the map fusion plant. If the monster destroys the fusion plant, radioactive clouds will be released into the next map. If the hunters defend it, it will activate sentry guns to defend the power relay next map. Basically like that, and it was rather fun. But this is the problem of evacuation mode. Nobody plays it. Why? Because no one plays EVOLVE anymore.\n\nLet me explain what the developers did to screw up the game to make everyone leave. You are going to think that I'm going to say dlc right? Well. Sort of. They should of waited to release skins until a few days after launch, because everyone was off put by the Day One DLC controversy. But none of the dlc effects gameplay except for cosmetically. For day one. You can't prove me wrong on that. Also it's sort of over priced... But they should of not of emphasized DLC! DLC! so much. If they'd just make a better game, patching it, and putting more effort into the main game. People would of asked for dlc, and accepted it. They wouldn't of had to push out dlc, to fix it. Another screw up Turtle Rock did, was them patching the wrong things. They fixed some issues, like the decoy supernova damage stack up. But then they nerfed things like the warp blast radius for wraith. Why? Keep in mind, Wraith was already nerfed from that supernova and decoy damage stack up. And they kept nerfing her, until she went useless. There is literally nothing wraith can do now. When she used to be a viable pick. People complained that she was overpowered, because they didn't know how to deal with her. But over time, you learn tactics to counter each monster. Which was part of the fun. But now she is so useless, that you don't even need to use teamwork to beat her. An example of this, is when I played with my friend. He choose wraith, because he liked the gameplay style of a hit and run tactic type monster focused on deception. Usually, when I fought against my friend and he went wraith. He was a master at it, I say this without exaggerating, I stood no change against him when he went wraith. Because it was meant for a team against a monster, not a single player against 3 ai and a player. Then the nerfs came, and we decided to fight each other again. I went the support known as bucket, who can throw down sentry guns. He fought me against three AI on my team. Which are terrible by the way, I don't understand why people say they are good. I did nothing but throw down sentry guns, and nearly beat him. When it should of not even been a problem for him. Because if I can nearly beat him with 3 dumb AI? Which don't use teamwork, imagine if he went against a full team of human players, who did use teamwork. He'd get destroyed, that isn't how you are supposed to balance the game. You aren't supposed to patch the game to make the AI have an easier time against the monster, it's the player that should be there concern. It's like they already set up there game to fail, before it actually failed.\n\nIf I can say something good about evolve, it's the world and the lore in it. I love how the monsters look, and I love how each hunter has a defined personallity. There is actually a good amount of story that they could of expanded on. You hear it through conversations in game and in the dropship. And as well as looking at the game itself to see the story. It's kind of like left 4 dead when you looked at the writtings on the wall in the safe room. It gave you lore, but you didn't have to look at them. I liked that. But when you fail at making people look at the game in depthly, because you failed to keep it fun, you won't get to share that story and lore. Another good thing was the map design, and the hunter and monster design, as in gameplay terms. It was fun playing with each hunter and monster. Well, They screwed up with Griffin, but that's the only one in my opinion who wasn't as useful. Every other person was good at a certain thing, and was fun to play as.\n\nTo sum it up, this game had plenty of potential... But they failed so hard.. Which saddens me so much. I can't recommend this game to anyone. Because the developers have screwed it over.","June 8, 2015","false","234.0"," 34 of 51 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","34","51","2","0"

Or more precise: Running behind the monster to get some average fight. Footsteps are glowing and swarms of birds are marked in the hud. And thats still not enough easy so Daisy (some dog like NPC creature of your team) is chasing the monster for you automatically as well. Unfortunately that seems necessary because the fighters or let's call them "hunters" are really slow. You run, empty your jetpack and run and run until you see the monster. At this time the trapper is dropping some arena shield so the monster could not run away forever and it's getting into some chaotic shooting and flying/running phase.\n\nTeamplay:\nYes the medic have to heal but the requirement of teamplay still feels weak compared to the strong requirement in teamplay to L4D.\n\nGraphics / world / atmosphere:\nGraphic is ok. It looks better than some exclusive PC titles and runs still smoother - but compared to Crysis 1 (which was created years ago) it does not really impress me. Maybe because the world gets into background soon. The world (as well the NPCs) feels pretty insignificant. You could take the beautiful painted arena like world and replace it with a tetris block like world and it would not matter that much gameplay wise because you run and run and run and try to follow the flashy stuff and init the (most time empty) jetpack again and again anyway.\n\n4 vs 1 (and yet another one):\nBalancing feels ok but monsters feels pretty much the same... flying and shooting something or running and throwing rocks on your head surprisingly does not differ that much: It's huge, stronger than one fighter but more important it's fast (away).\n\nConclusion:\nI would not say it's a completely bad game and since I've paid lots of money for it I think I would continue playing from time to time. But I hoped to get a real hunting game. And I caught myself that I already started another game until few hours of testing. We already have lots of "arena shooting" games that are way cheaper (and you get your fight without running somebody behind without fuel). This is somewhat more asynchrone (4 vs 1) than traditional arena shooters but it still does not feel like something completely new to me.\n\nIf you could purchase it sometimes in sale for 10€ (including all DLCs) and if you like some arena shooter then get it.","February 10, 2015","false","4.0"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","31","46","0","0"

Also, buying the Season Pass does not get you all the DLC, only some of it.\n\nFirst, Leveling in the game is required if you want to gain access to the more useful hunters or more potent monsters.  If you jump into this game late, and you play with people who have been playing for a while, expect to get your butt handed to you perpetually until you level up (which might take a long while because your XP is dependent on whether you win).  Playing the monster as a new-comer against people who have played for a while is a brutal course in futility: the hunters will find you and kill you quickly and relentlessly, and there is nothing you can do about it.  If you play a hunter as a n00b, you'll generally be riding the coat-tails of your more experienced companions, unless the more experienced monster finds you, in which case you'll just be killed in short order (and possibly eaten).  I think the game would be better if, like so may other games out there that require leveling, you could create a private game that was completely unlocked for everyone and pick the hunters/monsters you wanted, but sadly that is not an option in this game.\n\nAnd then there are Balancing issues; if you join a group of players that have 6 or more levels on you, be prepared to be at a significant disadvantage.  It seems that everything you do is at a noticeable degradation compared to the other more experienced players: you seem to run slower, have less jet pack energy, weapons do less damage, healing takes longer, etc.  Because you'll die a lot, you can spend time spectating the bots and see what your abilities will be like once you do level, but when you take that bot over your abilities will degrade and you'll be forced into fighting an uphill battle to get little scraps of XP so you can level.  The leveling also seems to take forever when you try to level with groups that have a lot of experience on you because they will pick the best of their class (whether that is a hunter or monster) and you'll be stuck with the starter class.  I think the game would be better if the various playable classes (both monsters and hunters) were more equally balanced; because there's a huge disparity between the various classes gainable by leveling, as a new player, you end up on the receiving end of an exponentially longer and harder row to hoe to get to where those that have gone before you are.  My advice if your new: only play as a hunter in groups of experienced people; only play solo as the monster until you get the wraith monster; otherwise, only play solo until you get leveled.\n\nUntil some of these issues are fixed, or the price goes down, save your cash.","February 21, 2015","false","5.8"," 186 of 326 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","186","326","6","7"

However it has huge issues that really hold it back from being something great which makes it hard to recommend.\n\nOne of my biggest issues with the game is the unnecessary grind to unlock hunters and monsters. You are forced to level up each skill/weapon to rank 1 before you can unlock the next hunter or monster, if something is rank 1 already it can not gain experience until every other skill/weapon is rank 1. You will feel forced playing certain characters and focusing on using a weapon or ability you don't like or that doesn't suit the situation. It took me 14 hours to unlock all the hunters and monsters.\n\nNext is the issue where you don't get to play what you want and most often then not you'll be forced to play a hunter or a monster you don't like, over and over and over again. The game makes you preference the 5 roles in order, however it does very little to match you with the role you want which also makes the grind more annoying. People get pigeon holed into playing monster and usually leave the lobby. The game will also place you in matches that have already begone, this sucks because you don't get to play the character you want that match and if you're monster then you're probably losing.\n\nThe game doesn't offer very much variation and their isn't any interesting single player campaign. The game has bots but they aren't entertaining enough and all they do is follow you around. This is a purely multiplayer title where all the game modes feel a little to similar.\n\nLastly the greedy DLC model they decided to use for this title really sucks and only makes you feel like you got the "cheap" version of the game because you didn't shell out the extra money for the fancy edition. There is nothing worse then paying full price and feeling like you got the cheap version.\n\nI don't recommend this game now at full price and I don't recommend this game in the future when its on sale! By then the multiplayer scene will be on its last legs, its already hard enough to find matches. I don't think the games crazy DLC plans will breathe new life into this title 6 to 12 months down the line because extra characters and maps wont fix the annoying grind, repetitive gameplay and down right silly match making.","February 16, 2015","false","14.7"," 48 of 77 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","48","77","2","0"

Asymmetric gameplay is a big undiscovered world with much potential and as a former dedicated L4D2 player I was hyped for this game.\n\nUnfortunately this excitement vanished with the beta. To me the game feels empty and pointless. Arbitrary character progression is in place to give you a reason to play but the upgrades and perks you achieve do not make much of a difference. As some content is only unlocked by said progression, the system acts as a feature block, forcing you into a grind.\nThat would be okayish - L4D has no progression at all - the problem is, that most battles are very linear, one sided and just not as deep as one would wish, making the grind a chore.\nI do not see Evolve being fun for a long time.. it's an okay game for in between.\n\nThat said I am very surprised by the insane price model the publisher is pushing here. Evolve really has not enough to offer, to justify a price point of $60 - let alone a package of DLC ramping the whole thing up to $120. This approach is not only priced without any regard to the market or the quality of your product, it's also confusing for anyone who just wants to enjoy a game.\n\nEdit:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/273350/discussions/0/611698195154157706/\nSome people just realised that the so called Hunting Season Pass actually is not a season pass.

Awful loading times and lack of players make the game experience tedious.\n\nThe overhaul replay value goes out the window the minute you get to the max level in this game (Which is 40 and you can get it in 4 to 5 days np) and when you unlock all characters, not even going to mention A.I in this game which is a pure broken mess when you play alone with bots. Gameplay wise the game delivers and it is asymmetrical throughout the experience becoming the only great factor about this title. Difficulty does not matter in multiplayer and firepower variate between characters you select, most of the times the game will make that choice for you when you join a Lobby or a Match. (Which turns to be annoying as hell since you can not focus on evolving just one specific class you are good or interested at)\n\nImportant factors.\nFor hunters? Team work is important. Thus the friends or team you need play with as well as having good communication throughout a game session.\nFor monster? Perks.\n\nTHAT`S IT! That´s the only thing that takes to win each match.

The concept was good; however, from the Big Alpha I could see there were going to be big problems with the balance of the game.  Anyone playing as the monster going against 4 humans will lose; people were already cheating, which has been corrected, I believe with the addition of some patches/updates.   The leveling system is disappointing, the game itself is extremely repetitive, the maps are really, really small.  Losing isn't fun (monster), and winning isn't fun when it happens all the time (all human hunters).   The DLC, as everyone already portrays, is really out of this world.  We paid a ton of money for this game; more than any other selling game, and now we need to pay it all over again for a little variety.  That's insane.   I thought it might be a descent replacement for LFD/LFD2; but in no way is this game anymore entertaining.  It's more frustrating than anything, which has already steered me away from it.

Every other game previous to this that used the term "season pass" meant that you are prepurchasing future content. This is unture for Evolve.\n\nI spent 99.99 on the Monster Edition and I think spending $40 past the normal price for a game is enough but Turtle Rock thinks not. They think it is moral and respectful to their customers to charge 7, 8, 9, etc... dollars for "DLC" ...skins. Then in the future the 2 hunters unreleased and any past that will cost extra for those of us who spent $40 additional dollars already. The concept of purcahsing a character is solid I am okay with this.....not happy about it as I gre up in an age that you purcahsed a game and that was that. All updates are based in the previous price.\n\nThis new age "partial game releases" then charging the customer to FINISH the game really stinks and has always been annoying.\n\nEvolve is really fun but this micro transaction model is wrong.

Evolve is a game that has awesome graphics, you could literally see the terror of monsters, the movements are so smooth that you normally don't see from any other games, the monster's captured animations are also beautiful, it's been made out like although they were captured by the wires of the trapper, you can feel their desperation or calmness (depends on how the player acts with the monster) in the captured monster, whether it goes wild or remains calm and collected, trying to find a way out.\n2. Unlike other games where you are a team of four, where you have to hunt a npc boss that's programmed for obvious combos and settings, this is a game where you face an OP monster player with 4 hunter players, not to mention team work for the 4 is needed, it is also absolutely important to stay aware of everything around you, the monster has the element of surprise if it knows how to use it to his advantage, it has better detection and higher mobility (depends which monster), the monster has to beware of scaring away birds and avoid strong jungle monsters in it's early stage or health and armor would be wasted on spots where you should be keeping yourself safe until you're ready.\n3. All of the monsters and hunters have their specialities, there's 4 members of hunters and 4 different roles, assault, support, trapper and medic, not to mention each of the hunter characters are different, they have different game performances and so do the monsters, with their different specialities, you have to beware of the map whether it's to your favour or it's to the monsters, different landscapes might effect the entire game play since some monsters rely heavily on surprises.\n4. This is a new game published last year and updates are still coming up!\n\nNegativities :\n1. The game itself was too expensive and the DLC's too, it would be fairly nice to buy the game when it's on sale, but the DLC's are too expensive to buy for entertainment only.\n2. There's barely anymore players on the game, the servers are isolated since the game is too expensive, you might have to wait for a long time until you get a multiplayer match.\n\nOverall, it's now a pretty weird game, although the game play and designs were awesome, it's not popular due to it being overpriced and still hoping that players would pay more for the extra DLC's that should've been included in the game for free >.<\nTake your own risk on buying this game, it's only worth it if you buy it during sales and for fun, I'm already regretting it a bit though ;-;","March 22","false","5.3"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

Evolve is that lovechild. The game uses first person shooting as you hunt down an alien monster with your teammates or third person hacking and slashing as the alien itself.

There is fun to be had here, but it is very limited and you will be spending a lot of time grinding to get the items and unlocks you want. Also, each match follows a similar pattern where you just run around following an NPC which leads you to the monster before it flees, then you repeat this over and over, fighting the monster occasionally until the match ends. Maps are huge and this can often go on for 30 or 40 minutes.\n\nThere are a few balancing issues which should be ironed out with updates and the performance is actually pretty good for a PC game.

The 4 are the Hunters, they work together to track, trap and kill the 1. The 1 is a big ♥♥♥ super-monster that can kill an unprepared team of Hunters effortlessly.\n\nGameplay for the Hunters is like a cross between Left 4 Dead, Monster Hunter (google it) and Borderlands (each class has unique class-abilities). You can play as a Medic, Assault, Support or Trapper. Each role has a couple of unlockable Hunters with varying abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Everyone has jetpacks, but there is a bit of a learning curve in using them efficiently (which is a good thing). As long as one Hunter lives, the rest can respawn and dropship in again (this is on a fairly long cooldown, if you die after the dropship has launched, enjoy your wait).\n\nPlaying the Monster is also like Left 4 Dead, except that you are alone as the 'special infected' while being much much stronger. You can get around the map much faster than the Hunters, and generally mess with their heads/annihilate them if you have the right mindset and cunning.\nThe typical Monster game consists of things like ♥♥♥♥♥hit♥♥♥♥♥hitshitnomnonomnomOW♥♥♥♥♥hit♥♥♥♥♥hitnomnomRAAAGH! I win? weee\nCurrently you can pick from the firebreathing Tank/Fighter, the Teleporting/stealth Rogue, or the ranged/lightning flying tentacle-face dude.\n\n\nMY THOUGHTS:\nI played the various Alpha and Beta releases and initially found the game to be too similar to Left 4 Dead (far too simple); but after playing the full release for a few days, and the Evacuation mode (multiplayer campaign), I've come to realise that the game is ridiculously well-balanced and really deep - personal experience as a player is a lot more valuable than progression experience (just like Monster Hunter), the maps are big and open enough that you can't predict exactly how the match is going to play out. There's real 'meat' to this game.\n\nWhoever you end up playing, it's easy to pick up the basics, but difficult to master them. The tactics you employ for each match vary wildly depending on your class(es), the environment, and the Hunt type. The maps are awesomely varied (heh, acid maps), and the wildlife is a lot of fun to deal with (fun). The autobalancing is probably the best I've ever seen, even if people drop out, lose a few games in a row, etc, the game stays fun for all involved. Matchmaking is solid, and usually lets you play your favourite role (if you insist on having one) without any trouble.\n\nI'm always impressed by how much work the devs must have put into building up the game world, giving it a unique character all it's own. The Hunter dialogues are pretty good to listen to, especially once you get a good mix of the rarer Hunters together in the dropship.\n\n\nSUMMARY:\nBasically this is shaping up to be one of the best Coop games I've played since Left 4 Dead. All I need now is a regular crew and some Teamspeak tactics :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTILL WORRYING OVER DLC?The (overpriced) skins are optional, and the addtional Hunters and Monsters are not available yet (if the devs pay the same attention to balancing as they have done with the rest of the player characters, the DLC PCs won't confer any particular advantage either).\nIt's easy to underestimate the effort and production values the devs have put into game balancing (it's amazing)  and cutscenes/interactions. I suspect the Season Pass (overpriced) will make more sense as players mature with unlocks and progression - new Hunters and Monsters will affect both game balance and the various cutscenes and player character dialogues, probably a lot of work involved in that.","February 22, 2015","true","27.0"," 138 of 245 people (56%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","56","138","245","11","19"

And for such a high price, it's not at all worth it.\n\nI highly urge everyone to check this out, there's a YouTube user by the name of Chris Ashton, (link will be at the bottom of this rant) who shows early footage from Evolves prototype / development. Such things like the earlier models of what Kraken could have looked like, and other monster concepts that were scrapped. It's such a shame because a lot of these ideas were actually really good ones and this game lacks content.

(And not making skins for Behemoth, like come on, seriously?) invest the time in rethinking your concepts from development and use them! They don't have to be what you intend, such as the Titan concept, THAT COULD BE A MONSTER, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOME RANDOM EVENT THING IN THE WORLD!!!...

"Wow, I've never seen anything like this!" The graphics were great, the gameplay was different.\nThen came the realisation that basically every single game was the same. Playing as a squad - 15 minutes running from one end of the map to the other with barely any action what so ever, then 30 seconds of terror as the person playing the monster kills us all because it's fully levelled up. Rinse, repeat.\nPlaying as the monster - 15 minutes of stealthily avoiding contact, eating as fast as you can, then wallop, game over. Rinse, repeat. To be honest I wasn't good at playing the monster so it was more like 3 minutes trying to eat and get stronger - trapped - die. Rinse, repeat.\nThe nail in the games coffin for me was the frustration of the walking around for 15 minutes at a time, then being dead before I could even shoot my gun. It happened about 5 times in a row, and that was it. I'd had enough to last a lifetime. Doubt I'll ever play it again. Besides, the game is dead now anyway. Don't believe me? Check the steam statistics for the number of players each day. It's a tiny number of people. Add to that completely over priced DLC and lack of any variety over all and it's a disaster. Such a shame. I really thought I'd love this game for a long time, but it stopped being fun very quickly. I stuck with it for hours after I should have stopped, hoping that it would show me that I'd just been playing it wrong and that it actually had hidden depths. It didn't, it doesn't.

He started babbling about how 59.90 USD is too expensive for any game and that he will get it if it falls below 50 or so. A couple of days later, he came to me saying that he found local retailers who are selling the game for around 45 USD. He's going to give it a try and stuff.\n\nThen I was thinking, why not?\n\nGot the game, opened the box, dumped the CD-Key into Steam, you know, the usual ritual, I was kind of busy then so I let the game download overnight while my friend got a headstart. I woke up to find my friend leaving me offline messages on steam：\n\n“lost"\n"lost again, lol"\n"so many noobs"\n"finally, one win"\n\nAfter finishing my work and squeezing out some spare time, I've set my mind to validating what my friend has said, considering that he should be playing co-op in normal mode. When I tried to join my friend, he blurted:\n\n"Finish the tutorial first, you'll need to learn the game mechanism"\n\nThink about it now after 10 or so hours of game play, yes, he's right in a sense. This game takes co-op game-play to another level. There are 4 different classes, and each class has a different role to play. The trapper has to find and cage the monster (monster being the tank-like boss which basically is the target of almost every game), the assault has the guns, the support for the buffs and the med to make sure you don't end up as monster food. It's kind of natural that, upon release, most players have no idea how to utilize the classes to their full potentials. It's easy to run in as an assault and lay your load out, but locating and trapping the monster, or ensuring that all your teammates don't kick the bucket is not something that can be acheived with a flick of hand.\n\nNo doubt, the graphcis, game mechanism and all of Evolve is great, though I will agree with those who said that 59.90 is a rip-off price. I'll say this game's worth anything below 30 USD, but not any more due to the repetitious round-based gameplay, lack of any major storyline and complicated gaming mechanism. So, don't grab it unless it's going for half price in the next sales.","February 19, 2015","false","23.0"," 48 of 80 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","48","80","0","11"

Outside of that though, it's a crapshoot.\n\nThe single player AI is maddening in that if you're playing the Monster, the Hunters are relentless BMFs.  If you're playing as the Hunters though, it's like they're all rejects from the Keystone Cops and if you're taking that monster down, it's basically all up to you.  The Monster AI is also aggravatingly canny at determining which hunter YOU are playing, and pounding on you EXCLUSIVELY until there's nothing left but a red jelly smashed into the dirt.\n\nYou can mitigate the AI ineptitude somewhat by customizing the settings, but that kind of feels like cheating to me for some reason, and thus any victories earned that way seem hollow.\n\nThe maps I've played so far have been interesting to play on, though as the monster I wish there were more places to hide/lurk for an ambush.\n\nI also wish there was a way to move into a 1st-person view as the monster because all-too-often in tighter terrain the camera goes completely wonky and you can't see anything but your own backside, making it impossible to target the hunters with attacks.  I know the 3rd person view gives a better sense of scale to the monster, but when I'm getting shot up and the camera blinds me, it's frustrating to the point of just wanting to quit the game.\n\nSo overall I'm giving this game a "No" vote, but with the proviso that if you play with friends (not just random people who won't coordinate), it can actually be a good time.","March 6, 2015","false","18.2"," 100 of 176 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","100","176","7","1"

Due to it being OVERPRICED on selling cosmetic DLCs, "pay to UNLOCK EVERYTHING" with its abominable pay options, new monsters if you buy the premium options instead of the basics, and season pass. Also why the developers and market directors at 2K Games and Turtle Rock did not make the Day-One DLCs be in-game unlockables is beyond hindsight.\n\nDLCs should be the afterthought for games to enhance the experience of the players and the prolong its longevity(i.e. Smash Bros Melee. and its fanbase of over 10+ years) and NOT use to extort gamers of their money because publishers believe that they are dealing with feeble-minded consumers with a lot of money.\n\n*GOOD NEWS: You can play single-player in this one. You take the role of either the Hunters or the Monsters and it's your job to f*** the opposition up. That's it. Don't expect an grand epic saga or a tear jerking story, just to let you know.\n\nYour mission as the hunters: Save the survivors and help them escape as you and your squad fight against the behemoths that tries to reclaim their homeworld from human colonization.\n\nYour mission as the monsters: KILL EVERY HUMAN ALIVE!\n\nBut in reality, it's a grind fest to level up your characters. Oh, and the hunter dies. *spoilers*\n\nOn a lighter note, the AIs are not dumb. It actually controls the rest of your squad members well. But even with that, I get the feeling this was pretty much tacked on so the reviewers don't need to add the fact that without internet, there is no game. Especially if you paid for everything this game has to offer and if you are on Xbox Live, PSN, or if you have a crappy internet and the connection goes down. Live with thought for a moment when you pay for this game.\n\nAlso Wraith OP. Just pick it.\n\nSo again, I recommend to NOT pay for this game unless there is a STEEP discount and also if all DLCs are included. Roughly around $10-$15 all together.\n\n*Edited: Just adjusting the sentences a bit for more clarity.\n*Edited: Did more research. I had experience in the alpha so I didn't know about the single player and other changes later on.

And that's key to a lot of the fun in Evolve. Because the absolute best thing about Evolve is the unexpected. Not just in loadout, but in how fast the momentum can change.\n\nNot only does the choice of hunter and monster affect the kind of match you can have, but monsters can eat wildlife to armor themselves from damage, and evolve into more punishing versions of themselves. That means the difficulty and the balance of play are constantly changing, and one smart move (or one silly one) can cost a side the whole game.\n\nThe mechanic of teammates hunting a large boss monster down may not be totally unique. But in Turtle Rock's case, the prototype this game was developed from has been slowly cooking for 5 years or so, letting them make balance the top priority. The additional wildlife that helps point the direction of the monster, or give players on both sides ability buffs, acts as a wildcard for the continuing gameplay.\n\nThe end result is sometimes you have game-winning players, who know when to do things to keep disaster from striking, and other times you have a one-sided shutout, because the hunters or the monster simply has more experience in the game. The important thing to remember if you get this game is that the deck is never stacked.\n\nThis game is great for fans of Co-op games, who value tactics and communication.\nBut it's also great for fans of playing opposite a group of humans, and trying your hardest to ruin their day.\n\nThe class makeup will likely change almost every round, but even if it doesn't, you can play this game and get the same set of hunters, with the same monster, even on the same map, and have an entirely different result. It's got incredible replayability.\n\nI won't go into detail on the DLC controversy, but speaking personally, I enjoy the vastly different experiences that each hunter (and monster) provides. I think it will take me a long time to get bored of what comes in the box. But I can't wait to see what they bring to the table when they arrive.","February 21, 2015","true","109.0"," 99 of 176 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","99","176","10","1"

Rest In Peace Evolve 2015-2015\n\nBack when it came out, and a few months following, it was an amazing gaming experience. An awesome blend of cooperative tactical action, and a lone wolf position all blended into one. It was Monster hunter in the future where you could be the monster. Awesome\n\nRecently, I fired up the game again to relive some good memories and have some fun. but after a stifling 20 minute wait for a monster to be found, i realized that this game isnt populated anymore. The implimented "Ranking system" that works the matchmaking requires some absurd amount of games played to even place you. It's only absurd because you can't get games to play.

It had torn through his suit and his stomach, but one hand was enough to hold his gun as he used the other to stop his innards from spilling out onto the ground.  They had weakened it, but it fled from him, and he just needed to find it and put it down to avenge his friends.\n\nIt was only when he heard the growls behind him that he realized he didn't have to find the beast.  It had already found him.\n\nMarkov screamed, "Goliath!  I will hang your head on my wall!" and pulled the trigger on his assault rifle.\n\nAs the bullets plinked harmlessly against the bleeding beast's thick skin Markov realized with horror that he hadn't paid the extra $20 for the "Damage-dealing-ammunition" DLC.\n\nThe monster swung its powerful arm, thick as a tree-trunk, into Markov and sent him flying through the air, where he glitched out and started breakdancing for no particular reason as his mouse cursor suddenly appeared on his screen.

At a certain point, this game turns from fun, into an XP grind afair (which I am not a fan of)\n- PRICE TAG. $70 CAD FOR THIS GAME? That is so unjustified. Just because a game looks good, doesn't mean it's worth a $70 price-tag. This game does not have enough maps, different guns, or different playstyle for it be justified at $70, in my opinion\n\nThoughts\nI would buy this game on sale, but at a pre-release price of $70 I know that I won't be playing this game anytime soon; (even a 50% off sale still puts this game @ $35, which imo, is still high. I'd value this game at $45, and would likely get it on sale if a few things were added/fixed)\n\nSuggestions:\n\n- increase the number of playstyles for hunters. At the moment, all you really do is hunt, shoot, retreat/push. You can't really set up an ambush, or have one player take the high ground with a sniper rifle and harass the monster while calling out positions for your companions (but make it so that the sniper would be SUPER vulnerable if he didn't move/hide)\n\n- explosive barrels/stuff; having an environment that you can use against the monster, I feel, would help a lot of the Hunters (as a good monster makes himself (or herself) scarce for much of the early part of the game)\n\n- pick-up-able items; make some of the explosive barrels pick-up-able so that hunters can carry them and set up traps and ambushes, or block off a certain area to the Monster (without it taking serious damage). Even adding things like an insta medpac, or 2x jetpack fuel. (I would also suggest allowing the monster to throw certain things back, increasing the amount of ways to play, and changing situations)\n\n- ranking (not sure if this is a thing, but i'd like it to be. 4 of us 1st game guys went up against a 4th level monster in our second game, and he destroyed us. half of the game he hid, then when he was strong enough, he just charged us and destroyed us. Wasn't a very fun experience)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSecond edit, more pondering\n\nAMMUNITION; the lack of there being ANY ammunition SEVERLY OVERPOWERS THE HUNTERS EARLY. I understand that it' sort of necessary for the FINAL fight, but for the whole game having to NEVER re-supply is a bit silly. It would add another meta level to the game: ammo awareness. So you can just spam shots willy nilly hoping to hit the monster and do a little damage to it. Additionally, if you instantly find the monster, and run out of ammo, it gives the monster a chance to escape and hopefully evolve a little bit, or even heal if anything. But having the Hunters literally have no consequences for just spamming their weapons seems a little unbalanced to me. If the Relay had like, crates of ammo that you needed to return to to restock, or call in a dropship to drop of a crate on the fly, I think THAT would add a whole nother dimension to the game.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOVERALL RECOMMENDATION: This game is extremely good, satisfying and tense, but I feel that it is NOT justified by it's price-tag. I would pick this game up for anything under $35. There is no single player for you to practice on, learn maps, creatures, playstyles, etc, and I feel that that limits the game somewhat. I think a simple "TEST MAP" or practice arena would help many people, ESPECIALLY FIRST TIME MONSTERS. I look forward to picking this game up upon a sale, but as of now (Nov 1st), the $70 price-tag is extremely off-putting.\n\n------- PICK UP ON SALE!!!!!!!!!!!!! --------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCOMMENT SECTION EDIT: (too big to be a comment)\n\nAs I stated initially, this was a review of the game AS OF THE ALPHA TEST.\n\nThis game has no singleplayer (which sucks for people who have poor internet connections), so that earned it minus points,\n\nThe game is priced @ $70CAD (CAD is Canadian Dollars, for those of you who don't know), which I think is roaringly offensive; I understand that this will not be the full game, but there is almost no character customization (if skins were added for guns/player models/monstahs/creatures, for some diversification, I think this game would probably be a $50 game). But from what I have seen thus far, there isn't really much customization, which I feel seriously detracts from investing into any class or repeated play.\n\nThis game is missing heart. Odd to explain, but what I mean by that is, after a certain point in a game it's just chase and shoot. The ONLY time it has felt different is when you play with people with mics, and they actually TALK AND HAVE FUN. Playing a 4v1 when nobody else talks is soooooo very boring, I can't even explain. This game is somewhat reliant on players making it fun, and that hugely detracts from the games rating, again.\n\nI didn't say it in the review, but the NOT RECOMMENDED comes from the price-tag. I can't find a way to justify this being a $70 game. Borderlands 2 had a ton more characterization options, was a $60 game, and it fell short; I didn't think it was worth the $60 + tax I payed for it.\n\nI will likely buy this game (not on sale, if I can afford it) and probably play the heck out of it, but with all the flashiness the game has (which I can't really use to the max as I have both a somewhat outdated computer and a poor internet connection), it seriously needs more features; hopefully, more game modes, skins, customization options, and most importantly a single player training arena (I wanted to try monster, so I did. I was lvl 1 against lvl 10+'s, and I got reamed in like 2 minutes. I had no idea what to do, didn't really know how to play, and these guys did. It made it no fun, and I expect I won't play the monster again unless a ranking system is implimented or a singleplayer mode is. That was so hugely not fun.\n\n@Davchip, thank you :)\n\n@The_Reaper95, hopefully this helps somewhat\n\n@Narcissus, thank you :)\n\nAlso, I would like to point out I am not a professional game critic, I just thought I'd give my two-cents and see if it helped anyone, or if anyone agreed with me. I am sorry if I offended anyone with my thoughts.

However there is different gamemodes atm there is Hunt and Evacuation both brings different challanges and unique things into the game.\n\nAs you play you unlock new hunters or monster types and perks that will help you with either survival or killing whatever you prefer. Personally I´ve fallen in love with beeing a monster sneaking around and picking people off one by one soooo much fun hearing them rage in the map change screens ^_^\n\nCommunity this game is top of the line too, there is build in voice chat, however unlike a LOT of other games, people here seems to in fact only talk and use it for game related things, even the games I´ve played with completely random people they have been good at team play, nice, polite well minus one guy who I`m sure was fapping ><\n\nAll in all this game is great and one of those games I will keep returning to for sure as more content gets added with DLC´s and we know it will as it is published by 2K who is masters of DLC´s (Check borderlands 2) but honestly I cannot wait.\n\nIf the price is scaring you a bit then wait for a sale, but if you like online FPS team play do NOT miss out on this title!","February 17, 2015","true","18.9"," 321 of 589 people (54%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","54","321","589","19","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tylerturner/recommended/273350/","tylerturner","LUCID-TYPE-A","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tylerturner/","115 products in account","This is a game clearly designed for multiplayer. There's little if any competitive scene as far as I'm aware, so it's pubs all the way. If you have a good mic, are comfortable communication intentions/tactics with a team, and you can work past the fact that alone, you're nothing more than a quick meal to the beasts you'll encounter, you'll love hunting giant monsters as the hunters of Shear! If you're new, have no fear - there are short (skippable) video tutorials on the basics and advanced tactics of all the monsters and hunters should you feel overwhelmed.\n\nIf you're more of a solo player, who dreams of getting the chance to outplay and outwit a group of four other players as you don the role of the boss battle of the map, you'll love being a deadly monster, though be careful - the game is balance such that the level of your evolution dramatically effects your odds against intelligent players.\n\nStage 1 - The odds are against the monster.\nStage 2 - The odds between you and the hunters are even.\nStage 3 - The odds are stacked against the hunters.\n\nStealth, good movement, situational awareness, a good understanding of the game mechanics, and patience will be necessary to succeed as the highly adept apex predators of Shear.\n\nYou can group up with friends, or play with strangers. You CAN play solo against bots, though beyond familiarizing yourself with mechanics/characters/monsters and maybe grinding out achievements, the AI quickly becomes repetitive and the thrill is lost quickly without the element of human creativity.\n\nI DO NOT recommend this game if you're looking for a fun game to play alone, for storyline, if you don't like to talk while you game, or if you're easily frustrated by failure. No doubt, you will fail a great deal as you're coming to terms with how to play the game. I also do not recommend this game if you are looking for non-stop action, as a great deal of the game revolves around the "hunt" of the monster. It's quite possible in some matches that you'll spend ten minutes before you even find the monster. On that note, while there are AI controlled native beasts and hazards aside from the primary monster to fight against along the way, there's little incentive to pick fights with every animal you find. Another thing to note is that TTK is rather high in this game - monsters won't be crushing humans into the dust in one or two hits in many circumstances, and at early stages you might feel like your goliath arms as the monster are hitting the hunters more like wet noodles than terrifying claws. Likewise, combined fire is a big part of taking down the monster and it's very rare that one person alone will have even a remote chance of meaningfully damaging the monster. Fights take a long time.\n\nGraphically, the game is quite good looking. It runs smoothly on my system, though there is some minor complexity to altering some gameplay effects, like your FOV and eliminating mouse acceleration. There are guides around to help you do it, but frankly it's disappointing that it's necessary and not in the in-game menus.\n\nThere is a season pass - no actual gameplay-related DLC has been released as of this review. The season pass will include access to new monsters and new hunters. New maps and other content may be released as free updates. The "Skin Packs" in the game aren't anything to be excited or worked up about and the game is more or less perfectly fine without them - they consist of palette swaps for monsters (shades of grey/red/green/blue) that are mostly difficult to distinguish from one another in gameplay, and weapon reskins for hunters which are almost unnoticeable and in some cases violently clash with the rest of the uniform (there are no armor/clothing reskins for hunters). Their only purpose seems to be to make your character slightly unique, but the options are limited, there are almost no unlockable cosmetics, and they're generally not worth the price-tag (5-7 dollars for a set of skins. Getting every single one could run you around 60 dollars).\n\nA lot of people get worked up about these skins being withheld unless people purchase them, but honestly the skins are so useless and minor that they're barely worth buying, much less getting upset about. But the topic of day-one DLC is one I'm not getting into in this review.\n\nAll and all, this game is an excellently crafted multiplayer game and it shows a great deal of potential to last for a long time, so long as Turtle Rock/2K are willing and able to effectively support the game as time passes. The game is mostly balanced (there are a few issues, though given the youth of the game I'd say the balance is very very good), though the price tag is a bit heavy. I do sincerely believe that the game is worth the price tag of 60 dollars - consider getting just the base game to try out, and maybe get the season pass later on if you're really liking the game and you're looking forward to playing new classes.","February 18, 2015","true","191.3"," 57 of 99 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","57","99","3","0"

It seems all the top reviews are negative and may not accuretly reflect how good this game is. I returned from a year overseas in June and I was excited to play this game. As soon as i got on steam I saw it had mixed reviewes and all the top reviews aere negative. After reading them I decided to pass on the game.\n\nWell 3 months later the game went on sale and I bought the Monster hunter pack and all the dlc for something like $40. I have not been disapointed. There has been a major update since most of the reviews so anything prior to Hunt 2.0 is nearly irrevelent. Just like any MP game out there, your experience may vary based on your team or the team your playing against. This is a game that is easy to get into but takes some time to really become good at it. Unfortunetly many people treat the classes as if they are playing COD and when they pick and how they play it only effects them. By that I mean if you pick support, your job is to buff teamates or debuff the monster. Its also your main goal on a team wipe to be the last person alive to allow your team to respawn in. You are not the assault and damage to the monster is not your main priority. This is the main problem with randoms in MP.... every class wants to be DPS when it is simply not there job. Once you play with players who realize this, the game become amazing, challenging, and just a blast to play.\n\nI would highly recomend finding at least one other person to play with but if you cant, remember that the MIC is your friend. The game has built in voice chat that works flawlessly and youd be suprised how many game i was certain id loose only to turn it around with the use of communication.\n\nI urge you that if this is a game youve been considering, go for it. It may have its frustrations (mainly as a hunter with randoms) but it also has some of the most fun gameplay ive played in a while. I would also recomend going to the official forums (https://talk.turtlerockstudios.com/) if you want more information about the game. Dont let all these negative reviews keep you from a great game.\n\n","September 22, 2015","true","125.7"," 36 of 60 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","36","60","0","1"

It’s tactically deep, bursting with character, and once you get past its mildly obtrusive progression system, it offers a level of nuance rarely found in multiplayer shooters.Turtle Rock extends that “easy to learn, hard to master” virtue across most of the experience and Evolve benefits immensely from it.\n\n-The monster needs to move quickly and carefully, balancing the need to put distance between itself and the hunters with the need to find food to level up. It’s ahigh-stakes tightrope act that requires good map knowledge, and a strong grasp of the monster’s surprising number of non-combat abilities like climbing, sneaking, and sniffing around. For as effectively as they exude an intimidating physical presence, playing the monster successfully requires patience and skill. Overpowering the hunters is really just your reward for outsmarting them, which makes ripping them to shreds as a max-level monster feel just as satisfying as it looks and sounds.\n\n-As the hunters, the continually interesting challenge is to find a cunning monster that doesn’t want to be found amidst the sprawling and beautifully realized planet of Shear. Fresh tracks and startled birds are among the more obvious clues, but following them like a bread crumb trail is rarely enough. You need to reason out where the monster is headed, and make effective use of your team’s amusing sci-fi gadgets. You might tag tempting wildlife with a tracking dart, so that when the monster eats it you can get a bead on its location, or pursue a monster with an unmanned drone to relay his position to your teammates. Since every second that passes without the monster in your crosshairs is another step closer to it becoming nigh-unstoppable, hunts are every bit as thrilling as they are nuanced. Though it’s hard to take it all in when you’re embroiled in an intense monster fight, Evolve looks and sounds remarkably good. The ground rumbles deeply with Goliath’s every step,  Kraken’s Lightning Strikes light up the screen, Wraith's extraordinary agility, and Behemoth the "tank of a monster" who can morph into a massive, sending Hunters tumbling in every which direction while startled wildlife scatter in fear.\n\n-Each individual element is well executed, but combined as whole during a match’s most pitched moments, the complete picture really is a sight to behold.\nThe true beauty of Evolve, though, is in the subtle details that flesh out its world, its characters, and its mechanics.\n\nVery high reccommended.\n9/10","June 27, 2015","true","50.7"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

I'm a bad monster player) after more than 12 months of playing...\n\nWell, i obviously love this game. not for any other reason than: IT'S GREAT!\n\nPeople new to this game should be aware of a few points though:\n\n1]\nIt's a sharp learning curve when you first start. Join quick play and everyone will be yelling at you to do this or do that. It really can be rough but hang on in there. Find a character class that you enjoy playing and stick to it for a while.\n2]\nAs you get better at playing and win a few games you will start to understand the characters and how they work together OR NOT!\n3]\nYou gain a few hundred hours play time and think you're a boss but get stuck beating higher level opponents. At this stage do some research: for example. it took me months to learn the sound of the 'spotter'. It's call tells you in which direction the monster is. Google it.\n4]\nBy this stage you will have found a group a friends who you will regularly play with. This part is tricky. Some you will want to go 'ranked hunting' with (usually because they are better than you) and some who you don't want to go 'ranked hunting' with (usually because they are not as good as you and will drop your rank... a lot).\n5]\nMy best tip is to watch some streamers to see what they do. Watch youtube videos on 'feeding routes' if you play monster or hunter you will need to be aware of where the food spawns on the maps.\n6]\nA big point at this level is dodging and keeping in 'line of sight' of your support, so that they can shield you when the monster attacks. Dodging takes time and practise. I'm still rubbish at both!\n7]\nFinally, work as a team. Communicate. The best way to kill a monster is to get a good early dome, IN A GOOD LOCATION. This means with no loops that the monster can run around/ get out of sight. No aggressive wildlife that will take down half the teams health and perhaps a nice big tree or small rock to run around. This will allow the assault player to do more damage.\n\nI don't care about the DLC buy it if you want. You don't need it.\n","March 23","true","016.6"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","30","49","0","2"

DLC for Evolve consists of cosmetic enhancements to monsters or hunters, a new monster and t4 hunters that have just been introduced (it's not pay to win). You can still fully enjoy this game without any DLC!\n\nThis is the first FPS game since Half Life 2 that has had me hooked for over 500 hours and even now at 'high level play' it has plenty more to offer. It's the first of it's kind and a breath of fresh air in the FPS market. It's not for teen CoD fan boys who think they can just point and shoot at a monster and expect immediate glory... These players have left in their thousands as they're are incapable of working coherently as a team when the odds are so often stacked against you. In this respect there is a steep learning curve but it's with persevering with if you're more mature.\n\nThe premise of the game is as follows: 4 Hunters/players with their own distinct roles track and chase a monster (1 player) on the run, who has to feed on wildlife to evolve to a more powerful beast! At the start of each game the odds are stacked in favour of the hunters, when the monster evolves to stage 2 or 3 things become more interesting and rely heavily on good hunter team play to survive against a monster who is now capable of destroying a power relay or hunt the hunters to win.\n\nIt's hard not to be impressed by what Turtle Rock have achieved here, the detail and variety in maps based on the alien world Shear is exceptional. A great deal of effort and thought has gone into each map and the wildlife, which adds another dimension to Evolve.\n\nOverall I feel this is one of the best games I have ever played. It has unparalleled depth and is truly unique. My only concern is once you have played with an experienced team you'll never want to play this in a pick up group.... The margin for error on the hunter side is very small and you will find yourself getting very frustrated in PUGs. I started with PUG's, but very quickly found a good core of players through steam to play with. Don't be put off, worth every penny!\n\n10/10","May 8, 2015","true","051.2"," 84 of 150 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","84","150","4","9"

Or I should say I loved it, with the repeated 'balancing' from TRS its not fun to play as either the hunter OR the monster due to ridiculous over/underpoweredness. If you play as the monster you either spend hours smashing bronze randoms or getting absolutely destroyed by premade groups of hunters that know exactly how to take down the monster. Which is easy if you have either Lazarus as the healers (completely broken and overpowered with a premade group) or if you play on one of the five maps that are so completely unbalanced for the hunters to win its ridiculous. Along with TRS shoving expensive DLC down our throats they made the game pay to win on the hunter side, with each new hunter completely breaking any strategy the monster may have to win.  The game was decently balanced before the new Hunt Season updates were released, it was insanely fun as the monster to be pit up against teams of premades that made it difficult, but not improbable to win. Now due to the monster nerfs its incredibly improbable to win a game against premade hunters unless you have 100% of everything going for you (which is impossible due to the new 'balancing') Honestly if you play a game that relies on one side making mistake after mistake in order to make it winable then whats the point of playing by yourself as the Monster (which isnt fun anymore) or playing by yourself as the Hunters (which is nearly impossible to win against even the worst of Monster players). Seriously this game is only being pushed for a larger playerbase because they want more money from all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DLC they keep shoving down our throats.\n\nI mean, come the ♥♥♥♥ on, 5 dollars for a skin? Why not make it a ♥♥♥♥ing unlockable? The only unlockable skins are those gained from gaining elite status on a character, which is another reason the game is broken.\n\nIn a game where a Monster with elite status vs a team of Hunters with elite status, the Hunters will win almost all of the time, especially if you are playing with a premade group of try hards. This game just has almost nothing going for it except the first few hours of fun it has once you break into it. Its not worth the full price, its barely worth half price, and I shelled 100 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars for the ultimate pack and got basically nothing from it.\n\nThe new matchmaking system is terrible as well. If you play as the monster you spend half the time completely overwhelming bronze hunters and getting completley thwomped against silver hunters. There is no middle ground.\n\nThis game is supposed to be DECENTLY CHALLENGING, yet STILL FUN. Even if you don't care about winning its not even fun. Its a boring grind fest while waiting for the new season of hunters/monsters while playing against the same four hunters over and over again.\n\nSeriously. I have played the same premade group of four hunters five times in a row. Five ♥♥♥♥ing times. And their strategy never changed because its ridiculously underpowered as the Monster at the moment, but its over powered for the Hunters if they are playing with three of their 'friends' and do the right thing everytime.\n\nTL;DR Don't buy this unless you like playing a game with a shrinking playerbase and extreme balance issues. And love shelling out ridiculous amounts of money for needless ♥♥♥♥.","September 17, 2015","false","551.7"," 36 of 61 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","36","61","2","1"

It felt awfully grindy to play this game after the first few rounds after fighting the same old monster with the same old tactics.\n\nPlaying as the monster, while it was REALLY fun at first, became a massive snooze fest of just running in circles, criss crossing chasms, throwing them for a loop, until I ate what I required to take on the hunters, as it was impossible for them to catch up to me without splitting up, which you can then clearly exploit with extreme prejudice.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is very gimmicky, and with games only lasting about 5-15 minutes on average. Especially, with only two game modes and the linear progression system This game gets dull rather quickly and is best played in small bursts.\nAnd the ability for 4 friends to play as the hunter, and not have a fifth as the monster seems like it is a feature that is really needed. I felt that I would've loved to taunt my friends as a monster, especially with the gimmicks at hand, it would only be improved further by adding mind games.\n\nAs for the games Options, the poor optimization for PC really shows, with no customizable options beyond Low, Medium, High, AA , V-sync and Tessellation. And even on the lowest settings my fairly compotent rig was struggling to chug along as a hunter, despite the game not even looking that good graphically. As a monster, it was fine for some reason and after some messing around the game runs smooth on high as the monster. I'm unsure of the reason for this at this moment in time.\n\nOverall, with the way this is looking the game is rather amusing and entertaining, but I wouldn't warrent it worthy of the price tag it will be asking for.\n$20-$30 would seem more reasonable with what has currently been shown.\nI seriously wish steam had a third option for "Meh", instead of a Yes, or a no.\n\nI'm going to be giving it a no on the grounds that it should hoopefully show that some improvments need to be made for this title to shine.","November 1, 2014","false","13.0"," 288 of 533 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","288","533","7","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/273350/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","So, I finally got round to playing a fairly new release AAA game, and I went with Evolve. I was rather sceptical with purchasing it at full price on launch, however I was able to get a key fairly cheap from another site so decided it was worth a try.\n\nI'll start off with the graphics; this is one of the best looking games I've ever seen. Played on full settings and the environments just look stunning. The lighting looks spectacular as well.\n\nThe games main aim revolves around a group of four hunters chasing after a monster. There are four different classes available, assault, trapper, support and medic. Each of these classes are well balanced and gives you all sorts of different weapons and abilities. My personal favourite is the support class.\n\nAudio in Evolve is very important, at times you have to rely on it a lot to try and listen out for the monster when you are trying to find it. Every single sound effect is done to perfection.\n\nThere are two different game modes that I have found, regular skirmishes and Evacuations. I have been putting a lot of time in Evacuations which is essentially five different games; each having different objectives, but each game is different depending on how you have done in the rest of the maps. For instance, if the monster manages to destroy a power plant in on map, the next will have toxic gas floating around. Apparently there are around 800,000 different combinations of scenarios available through this mechanic, which can only be a good thing if you ask me.\n\nThe difficulty of Evolve can vary. My first match I was playing as the humans, and obviously the monster was a more experience player with a lot of skill as it completely wiped the floor of our team, but sometimes you can get matched up with a lesser skilled monster and it be the complete opposite.  The game entirely depends on how good the monster player is to be honest.\n\nI have been playing for about seven hours now and I don't see myself giving up any time soon, I still feel as if I have barely scratched the surface in terms of content to see and experience. I have been playing with a friend the past few hours which has also added to the fun, I think it would be perfect if you had a full team of people you know on voice chat.\n\nFrom what I have seen so far, there doesn't seem to be an underlying story, just each game offers you a little story in its own right.\n\nI only encountered one technical issue, and it wasn't exactly game breaking, just more of an annoyance, my mouse cursor was showing on screen as well as the cross-hair of my gun, not a major issue, one that was fixed by quickly restarting the client.\n\nDo I recommend Evolve? Sure - I am having an absolute blast playing it. The only complaints I see in reviews are from people who say it has no replay ability, but they have poured 50+ hours into it already....to me that sounds like you have had plenty of replay ability out of it. Another complaint people seem to have is that there isn't anyone playing... well at the time of writing this, there is ~1200 people playing. That's a pretty large number considering you only need 4 other people to get a game going. Evolve is certainly one of my favourite games of the year so far, and one that I will be continuing to dip into to play with friends, I'd seriously recommend this, maybe wait for the sales to start if you were sceptical like me, but it is worth it.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

One players plays as the monster while the other team of 4 are tasked to bring it down. The concept is unique and fun. The weapons for each hunter are interesting and result in a variety of play styles - enough to keep interesting but simple enough to not be overwhelming. You will find three types of monsters. They fall into the main archetypes - warrior (Goliath), mage (Kraken) and rogue (Wraith).\n\nMechanically, this game is a console to PC port. It still plays well, there have been no issues with online play, and there are a variety of available resolutions. Just don't expect this game to justify a PC upgrade or anything.\n\nThe game currenlty suffers from severe balance issues that were not really present during the open beta. Why the devs decided to change so much in the wrong direction is an interesting question. Many of the hunters offer no advantage to the more popular picks, some of poor to the point where they will set your team at a severe disadvantage. Decent monster players are capable of killing your entire team at level 2 in one go without great difficulty, which they really shouldn't be.\n\nThis game would be great but the above issues really hold it back. Hopefully a patch or new DLC may bring this game back to the hype that it should have had.\n\nIf the game were 30.00 dollars versus 60.00 then we would have a good buy. But considering the balance issues and lack of content currently I would recommend a pass. However, it is good enough that if you have already purchased it, or have a group of friends to play with, it is still worth your time. Future patches or expansions may make this game from a average game to a great game.","March 2, 2015","false","9.1"," 80 of 144 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","80","144","0","0"

Four hunters chasing down a lone monster in an epic fight to the death. Unfortunatly this game ultimately just turns into a very long game of tag. The monster barely hides. It is more efficient to just run from the hunters and feed little by little until you hit stage 3 and just turn on them. Hunters in the mean time simple follow along at a slow pace contantly needing to recharge their jets, due to the overwhelming number of cliffs that require traversing, slowly dying to all the wildlife they encounter along the way. Unlike the zombies from the Left 4 Dead series, which dealt overall minor damage to most players except when utilized properly by the infected, the creatures in this game seem dead set on seeing you.... well dead. Too much of the wildlife perma-traps hunters, until they get rescued by a teammate, and kill them. This mechanic, along with the monsters sneak attack on hunters, restricts players from doing anykind of real 'split and corner' strategy efficiently. If you have a full team of five people to play with this game might be a bit more fun but for $60 a person just doesn't seem to be worth it. Not to mention the fact that the season pass doesn't include any of the optional skins that they sell in the shop. Actually the season pass doesn't even mention, at the time of writing this review, what it actually includes at all.","February 21, 2015","false","19.3"," 123 of 225 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","123","225","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrandMenace/recommended/273350/","GrandMenace","Grand Menace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrandMenace/","182 products in account","Most of the game play for this game takes place with a group of uncoordinated hunters chasing down a monster that does laps around the map for about 10 minuets in order to get level 3 to ensure victory. The matches seem very one sided 99% of the time.\nIf your looking to play with just one other friend this is not the game for you. When it is just you and a friend in a party neither of you are eligible to be the monster, and you will probably end up with two other players that will throw the game for you in one way or another, or spend 10 minuets without ever seeing the monster until he is strong enough to crush you in one encounter. The only semi-fun part about this game is playing solo monster due to the fact that evading/leveling is at least doing something unlike the hunters constant mundane chase of blue flashing footprints. Even though I say being the monster is semi-fun it is also difficult with a steep learning curve that will turn average players away making them suffer though the endless chase of being a hunter.\nIn conclusion this game is either a solo play or a four player on coms type of game. I don’t see this game having a lasting community due to the "one person has fun while four people get frustrated" style. There are way better single player games out there, and there are way better four player games out there. If this is the game for you, be prepared to shell out some serious money to stay on top with their free-to-play inspired micro transaction DLC pricing model. With that said, I do not recommend this game","February 14, 2015","false","43.2"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","25","41","0","1"

People say it is just doing the same thing over and over again, and basically that is true, but for me it changes drastically depending on which character I have chose, and what characters the other players have picked.\nI feel like the developers went for a game that was not supposed to be won by the hunters unless they were actually trying to do it right.

Just look at the toxic LoL game...\n\nIt's a shame they want so much money for what this is, the content that is there is fun but very limited. How many times can you rinse and repeat the same thing over and over before you get bored? I would say that new maps, game modes, hunters and monsters is something to look forward too and could definately make this game even better but we all know that those additions will cost as much as another premium AAA game itself which is dissapointing.\n\nIt's sad what is happening to games these days. They release with bugs that devs knew about, simple online modes fail, or in Evolves case, they want cash for every upgrade and not only that but they want A LOT of cash for these upgrades. Skins for a single hunter should not be $7 especially because it's only for weapons.\n\nTLDR: I would recommend playing this but honestly I hope people wait until either the price drops, (If that ever happens with these greedy game dev's and publisher,) or just buy the standard game if this is really something you think you will enjoy without having to dish out another $100 for the cool kid stuff.","February 14, 2015","false","15.2"," 72 of 130 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","72","130","0","0"

It's also a $30 dollar game at best masquerading as a $60 dollar game because it's a new IP. Unless you have money to burn it's just not worth it.\n\nThe Good\nA fresh new take on asymetrical combat\nWell created world\nThe character designs really come to life with their banter\nGenuinely solid shooting as the hunters with some cool individual abilities\nA well matched game where everyone is of equal skill feels truly epic\nThe Meh\nThe game is drowning in a sea of DLC most of which is aesthetic but when your game is pretty much a hand full of modes with the same implimentation it could have used these useless skins as unlocks to at least make the game have more going for it towards replayability\nThe Ugly\nFeels like a console port\nOften times games are incredibly one sided and very boring (either the hunters end it in a few minutes or you don't see the monster for 15 minutes and they they destroy you)\nLoad times\nStill very buggy\nWhen all else fails use Wraith\nThe emphasis on just getting people in games as opposed to letting them choose the quality of their play time\nLack of content\nThe part where I ramble:\nI played in both the alpha and the beta and the experience is much the same. Good close matches are incredibly rare at maybe 1 in 10 games. The rescue, nest, and defense modes add new elements but not enough to keep it fresh for long.\n\nThe developers odd choice to remove player control is one of the things that I think is the greatest sin of Evolve. Not allowing the player to choose basic things like starting at character select, the begining of a map rotation, or choosing to play a single class is just basic game design. Yes it may take them longer to get in the game but for some people it's not about the quantity of play time but the quality of it.","February 15, 2015","false","8.8"," 44 of 78 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","44","78","4","0"

Proper teamwork is required to take down a stage 3 monster but it is tough. There is no excuse to be taken down by stage 1 monsters yet I do it to teams all the time.\n\nMuch like the issue with L4D the players are what's wrong with this game.\n\nMonster mechanics and the smoothness of the game (save for some bugs here and there, disappearing creature corpses, can't eat, laggy skills) are fantastic, playing as the monster is super fun and when I played with 2 other friends playing as the hunters is great too.\n\nMost people playing this ATM have no concept of how to play. Yes a tutorial would be handy, yet every time you play a class it gives you a tutorial movie on how every single skill works and should be used. The only learning curve I can see in the game that needs to be explained better are the random creatures in game.\n\nBut for those that don't know here ya go. As a monster, if the creature is yellow it's food and will not attack unless hit. Orange, will attack if provked E.G. get up in it's personal space. Creatures with icons above their heads give buffs when eaten, E.G. Faster movement, faster eating, shorter skill cooldowns etc. Red monsters are those actively aggressive towards you and will chase you.\n\nAs humans, icons above creature heads also gives you buffs. Most creatures will not attack you unless provoked and some will attack you as you walk by. In most cases it's a waste of time and HP to attack creatures as it leaves carcasses for the Monster to eat and evolve and you gain nothing.\n\nThat's it.","November 4, 2014","true","15.7"," 245 of 459 people (53%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","53","245","459","14","12"

It's been a looked forward to game for awhile made by the same people that made Left 4 Dead. With somewhat the same concept in mind, in this game its 4v1 with really level playing grounds on all fronts. A game that can be competetive or just fun, you can play it with friends or by yourself with randoms all being really fun at least through my eyes.\n\nThe Pros:\n-Really balanced classes on all sides. Which in a game like this it's a must need otherwise it can end up a tilted game.\n-Short games, typically these games run between 10-20 minutes on average(depends on the team and the person playing the monster)making it easy access for people that can't play games for too long\n-The community, the community in any game is pretty important and sense it's a game primarily run on its community for match ups its important to have a decent one. From my experience this game has a pretty decent community\n-The updates often balance things that my seem a little off in classes the Devs stay close to this game they didn't just release it and leave it to build a new game. They take in account how many people play the game etc.\n-Classes you play in the game take a bit of time to find the right one that suits you but once you do. It's just extremely fun to be able to play a game where you can pick it up and say "Yep this is mine" to a class.\n\nThe Cons:\n-Games that last over 20 minutes seem to feel too much like a drag to play past the point when a team won't co-operate\n-Matching is kinda wonky getting paired up with a team at your first level and going against someone that has maxed out all his abilities\n-There is much room for improvements on weapons i feel like a bit of customization to make a class truely feel unique to your playstyle needs to be incorporated\n\nNow this isn't some game you have to enjoy a story or anything, so if your looking for that try something like Skyrim or an RPG because this game doesnt have it. This game is a primary multiplayer game its meant to be played with a team/friends which isnt bad just know that you are buying a multiplayer game not anything else.

Note : I pre-purchased Monster Race edition\n\nHey! Finally this game is out. After years of hype it's out! I got a little worried because a few hours before release I was watching streams of other regions and it was discovered that the game shipped with some kind of "mouse bug" where sometimes the UI mouse would stay visable while "in action" (while you're moving around and aiming your gun you would see your mouse crusor dancing across the screen which was pretty distracting/annoying, also the mouse would not be visable in game menus, making selection difficult).\n\nBut, I held fast. I figured it was just a bug and would be fixed.\nI got into the game and after some technical difficulties was finally able to play. And I will say it was refreshing. This is definatly not another "Call of Duty, shoot em up". This game requires strategy and teamwork on BOTH sides(well i guess minus the teamwork part for the monster).\n\nI have to say I had a blast. I played solo, co-op and PvP. My only complaint was the poor matchmaking system. I absolutly HATE joining games that are already in progress, but you'll find yourself in this situation a few times with no option to filter "games in progress" out.\n\nI am seeing the repition in maps already though. And the Nest/Rescue modes are practically only mirror opposites to eachother, and matches where nobody uses a mic are kinda dull.\n\nNow the main bit everyone is biting on right now : the pricing and DLC. I do have to say. It has become CLEAR that the decision to announce day one DLC along with some extreame pre-order options has hurt the game's affiliation with the community. I do kinda agree now after playing that, the game really doesn't have enough content to support $60+ purchase. Imagine Left 4 Dead 2, with more survivors, less zombies, and much much shorter maps. I'm notcing average HUNT games are lasting 10-15 minutes, and it's either just Golaith running until he gets cornered, or Kraken dominating a team from Stage 2.\n\nI will keep playing. But..do I reccomend for this price in current state? Probably not.\n\nOne more dissapointing note : The monster skins., If you purchase them with the idea of League of Legends champion skins in mind. Just think of every Monster skin in the game as a Riot Girl Tristana. Just a very small recolor of a bit of patches of skin. Nothing worth the money....\n\nAll in all : It's a good game. But the price tag with future content being DLC is where 90% of the let down is at.","February 10, 2015","false","81.7"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

A shame for a FPS.\n- Lack of pace in tracking phases. The monster has all the tools to give the tempo of the game and have fun. On Hunter side we systematically walk with our asthmatic jet-pack, even when we know well the map. Rather painful. Especially, excluding some stalking skills, there is not much to do other than to press Z and space. The universe is really nice but seems unnecessary, it soon ignored.\n- Fights are too oriented MOBA : bad players impact more than good players. Each character is incomplete (lack of damage / can't capture / can't heal / can't survive well), so no question of fun if you are a lonewolf or hope raise the level of a team with a solid skill like in a conventional team-based FPS. The team will always be pulled down by the worst player. This guy will regularly kills the game by failing his class action, leaving others as spectators of the downfall of the team. Really frustrating.\n\nI pass over the horrible interface (5 min of loadings for 10 minutes of gaming) and the disgusting marketing (Day one DLC, microtransactions, uncomplet season pass), I advise you to wait for a sale.\n\n6/10\n\n------------------------\n\nPas un mauvais jeu, mais pas non plus un hit en puissance comme l'a été L4D.\n\nJ'ai surtout joué chasseur et bien qu'Evolve propose une ambiance de dingue et parfois de bonnes parties, je lui trouve 3 défauts majeurs :\n\n- Un setting console : la plupart des armes/outils ne demande aucune précision à la visée. Un peu dommage pour un FPS.\n- Manque de rythme dans les phases de traque. Le monstre possède tous les outils pour donner le tempo de la partie de la partie et s'amuser. Côté chasseur on se fait systématiquement balader avec nos jet-pack asthmatiques, même quand on connait bien la map. Assez pénible. Surtout, hors certaines compétences de traque, il n'y a pas grand chose à faire d'autre que d'appuyer sur Z et espace. L'univers, pourtant réussi, semble inutile, on l'ignore rapidement.\n- Des combats coop trop orientés MOBA : les mauvais joueurs impactent plus la partie que les bons joueurs. Chaque perso est incomplet (manque de dégâts/impossibilité de capturer/impossibilité de soigner/difficulté à survivre), donc pas question de s'amuser en lonewolf ou espérer relever le niveau d'une équipe avec un skill solide comme dans un FPS multi classique. L'équipe sera toujours tirée vers le bas par le joueur le plus mauvais. Celui-ci flinguera régulièrement la partie en échouant son action de classe, nous laissant impuissants, spectateurs de la déchéance de l'équipe. Vraiment très frustrant.\n\nJe passe sur l'interface horrible (5 min de loadings pour 10 minutes de partie) et le marketing dégeulasse (DLC Day one, microtransactions, season pass qui contient peu de choses), je vous conseille d'attendre une solde.\n\n6/10","February 15, 2015","false","93.5"," 27 of 46 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","27","46","2","0"

Then, I heard about the upcoming DLCs and how they were going to be additional monsters and hunters. That alone turned me off (and I'm going to explain why), so I asked for a refund. I played the Beta and suddenly the game was unplayable, stuck at 10FPS constantly when during the Alpha I played comfortably at 60FPS. What went wrong?\n\nRegarding DLCs:\n-A DLC has to be an addendum to a finished product. It ads a dessert to someone who finished the meal and would like some more.\n- In any case it is not mashed potatoes, rice or veggies to try out instead of pasta. When the menu is set, it doesn't get changed!\n\nWhat Evolve's DLC offer:\n-They're not mappacks as not to split community. That is commendable, but I wouldn't mind AT ALL paying for that kind of DLC, as it adds a new playground to a fixed gameplay.\n-The DLC offer different monsters/hunters, i.e. it offers different gameplay mechanics. How come is this not chipping away at the core game?\n\nTurtle Rock's answer:\nThe DLC content is going to be completely new and has not been thought of in the base game, we're not removing any content from the base game (or something in those lines).\n\nMe:\nSo you're saying that, for an assymetrical multiplayer game, you're going to be releasing a stream of gameplay changing content that will inevitably mess the fragile equilibrium of the game and not even give access to that content to the entire comunity?\nAlso, as advantages are bound to happen, I'm sure you will not nerf down DLC characters too much, I mean: it's realistic for you to want DLC's to have a selling argument. Right? If so, isn't your game turning out to be a pay-2-win, although I have to pay for the base game?\n\nTR:\nBut you get to play against and with the people who have that content, you're not going to be separated from the comunity, even if you don't purchase the DLCs.\n\nMe:\nSo you're telling me that the code for all the DLC content is going to be downloaded to my PC as well, as I need to see it in action on other players, and that I will have to pay for it to unlock? Well thanks for adding every so months a few gigabites of DLC download that I won't be even able to use unless I give you some money...\n\n\nIn the end this is my point of view:\n\nI would have gladly payed the pre purchasing price and even a season pass/game combo if the DLC's wouldn't have been gameplay related, but this setup is a recipe for disaster and I don't want to be caught up in the mess that is going to be balancing the game at each new character addition. Plus in a year or even less there is going to be a deluxe package for 30 euros where I can get all the content at once with most of the bugs fixed as well.\n\nSo in the end, don't buy this game as long as the gameplay balancing hasn't been achieved, and this will last as long as they're adding characters...","February 11, 2015","false","8.4"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","19","31","0","0"

It's a great 4v1 game with a really cool spin and a welcome change to a lot of the same ol FPS that are out there. However, all this said it has got stagnant.....I think the game while very simple needs to be a bit broader in its offer particulary given the cost. It's also a real shame so many people have stopped playing this game and therefore has lead to even more people quitting (including myself) because it's impossible to get a full player lobby these days. Let's hope the developers act to bring people back because this game has a lot to offer.

This game is Redundent, boring, good graphics though! Way over priced game should be maybe 20 dollars. NOT a full game. All of the maps feel identical. I appreciate the level of detail that went into designing the terrain and fine details in plants, buildings, rocks etc, but they should have focused on making a full game that is fun to play, then add details in later. I like having a nice well polished game to look at, but I want to be entertained more then just a pretty face. I have forced my self to play this after the first match just trying to get my moneys worth out of it. I am truly disappointed that we have gone from fun entertaining GAMES to this cartoonish simulator and games like it. I'm also disapointed that review channels are taking money or favors from developers to say this is "9 out of 10".

As many have pointed out on release there is a significant lack of content.  All maps are played in similar environments and at night time.\n\nThe other significant disappointing factor is it heavy reliance on hunters having headsets and a strong grasp of their team mates classes and their abilities. Your weakest player for whatever reason will be made painfully apparent very quickly.  This in turn puts the spotlight on the casual gamer significantly hindering its accessibility to the masses.  Even a competent random hunter teams are clinging on to be coherent and effective against a seasoned Monster.\n\nSadly many are walking away from the game after only 5-10 hours leaving the player base already dwindling.\n\nLastly in order for the Monsters to gain the upper hand against the hunters, they must evade them till they can reach stage 3.  Another words when your Hunter group isn't top notch you will spend 90% of the round trying to catch the monster.\n\nIn this games defence however,  if you have 5 mates all with headsets and online at the same time,  this game is fantastic,  with the 5th person being rotated to be the monster.","February 16, 2015","false","9.9"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","23","39","0","5"

Too Repetitive. Too Expensive. Too Boring.\n\nAny of these four traits, even individually, break games.\n\nEvolve has the misfortune of having them all wrapped in one lackluster package.\n\nToo Linear;\n\nThere's not much variety in this game. TRS will try to sell it to you in the form of "huge amounts of possibilities" with their Evacuation mode. But at the end of the day these are just variables that barely affect gameplay on the same maps.\n\nToo Repetive;\n\nYou're going to be doing the exact same thing nearly every damn game. Running, or chasing. As the monster this admittedly can be a lot of fun. You'll get a rush here and there with close escapes or near death encounters with the hunters but eventually the shine will wear off and those once fun scenarios will only frustrate you. As the hunters? Hah. The early game of cat and mouse is about as exciting as running in circles while your team of randos stand idly by waiting for ♥♥♥♥ing birds to tell you which direction you need to wandering in.\n\nToo Expensive;\n\nIf this game was 30 USD I'd accept the huge costs on DLC. But it's not. And it's going to be a damn shame when this game is dead because of it. Left 4 Dead 2 has a larger monthly playerbase than this over priced moneygrab.  If you're considering buying this wait until it goes on sale in 2016 for 5 ♥♥♥♥in dollars like Titanfall did.\n\nToo Boring;\n\nIn case I didn't make it clear before; THERE IS ABSOLUTLY NOTHING FUN about chasing something faster than you, that knows where you are, and can move perfectly silently and leave zero tracks when it needs to. 70% of the match against a sneaky monster player is a good long stare at the gray, oversaturated scenery. The other 10% is you dying to a stage 2-3 monster. And the last 20% is the ♥♥♥♥ing post game porgression system that does nothing but hide content from you.\n\nI had hope for this game. I really did. But it died when I realized the devs had no ♥♥♥♥ing sway over the games future. You can thank 2K for that.","March 1, 2015","false","48.8"," 76 of 140 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","76","140","6","0"

I'll give you the point-form reasons I don't recommend Evolve to any player. You can find my reasoning repeated in post after post in the forums and in these reviews.\n\n- DLC setup intentionally manipulative, relying on normal DLC structure expectations. See "hunting season pass" debates. To say they have been clear about the additions is a innacurate simplification of their deception.\n- Upon release, there were many bugs, which is normal. One I couldn't forgive was the mouse cursor being present the whole time.\n- Forum moderation isn't a part of the game, but check out their tactics. If the word "moderator" is mentioned in any context, thread immediately locked. If you're talking about how the season pass problem was unfair and/or manipulative: "We told you about it in this post before, your complaint is invalid, thread locked". If they can lock a forum, they'll do it without hesitation.\n- DLC content overpriced, for little reward. Evolve sometimes just feels like a big DLC shop.\n- Experience and unlocking system is strange and unbalanced. You are expected to repeat using items to level the class, but these requirements are often arbitrary at best and force you to adopt tactics that don't work in order to use more characters.\n- Finally, here's a post from a moderator that pretty much sums up 2K/TR's entire defense strategy. Note how they lost almost 90% of their intial players, who were evidentally *all trolls*.\n\n"OP,\n\nYou will lose your bet since the post you've made isn't against the rules. What was the bet again? Did I win anything? (reviewer's note: this was in response to the OP assuming he would be locked or banned, because in several cases near-identical complaints were locked immediately...)\n\nBack to the topic.\n\nWhat 2K has learnt is that, if you want to make a good game, you don't have to be heartbroken because of all the trolls saying your game sucks. As a gamer, I don't really care about what the trolls say for Evolve or any other game.\n\nIf publisher and developer is happy about the product they have made, then how about making this product get better without listening to all this trolls saying "your game is dead", "rip evolve" and many more.\n\nI've been watching developers trying to tell the trolls that if they want to support the game they can always purchase it. Saying "omg this game sucks" without playing the game is really a shame.\n\nI've pre-ordered Evolve myself, and even if I've not played the game as other veterans did, I always enjoy a match or two I once in a while play.\n\n\nWhat I'm mad about is that, if we take games as an art then Evolve has to be one of the best art ever created. Evolve achieved something the other games couldn't, but none of the trolls understands it.\n\nWhat also sucks is that in current day if you make a Call of Duty you'll earn a lot of money, but if you create a game such as Evolve you will be spammed with hate emails every day.\n\nIf you want to discuss the game, then please purchase it, give it some try and come back to us. But if you will only stick around and discuss how the forums are managed, then sorry but this discussion forum only cover the game. Plus the discussion of moderation isn't allowed, as it creates spam topics which really achieve nothing.\n\nIf you want to talk Evolve, come to talk.turtlerockstudios.com, where the community will be the one answering your questions and not just a single dude trying to "make Evolve look good" with a star next to his name."\n\nGot a complaint? You're a troll. Think there are problems with the game? Evolve is a new style of game and therefore art. Thread locked. Want to discuss why you think the season pass idea was intentionally misleading?

It was fun the first 2 or 3 times but quickly became down right frustrating, given that you spend a bulk of the match trying to find the monster with little else to do, and it just runs away until stage 3.  You do this over.... and over.... and over.  Now, I'm not the best player but even if I could play this game with my eyes shut, I'd just keep them closed and sleep.\n\nThere needs to be more game modes.  To make "Hunt" actually fun, Turtle Rock should of had 2 teams fighting it out to take down the monster for a bounty, all while the monster does what it does now.\n\nThe game does look good and it plays decent.  There just isn't enough there and what is there is just flat out boring.","February 10, 2015","false","4.7"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

Don't waste your money, just wait for a significant price drop. My new rule of thumb is not to buy a game that launches with a season pass on day one, there all just unfinished games in which the devs plan on pulling more cash from you in the future to complete your experience.

It is not your standard FPS game and I think that is what catches many people out. Forget all the rubbish people spouted about DLC and the initial release marketing as this actually has zero impact on the game itself. All DLC is either cosmetic in nature (skins) or simply added content that plays within the same world as you. Far from hindering your experience or making it easier for one side or another, the only impact it has is add more variety of opponents and teammates, and that is only a good thing. Nothing is required to be bought other than the base game.\n\nIf you are not sure what to believe after reading things online, I can understand. The fact is that this game has a surprisingly steep learning curve and not everyone was ready for it when they made their first gameplay impressions. It has a lot more subtlety and nuance than you might think but it takes time to work these things out.  It’s not a game you can jump in, guns blazing, expecting an easy win. You really need to learn the strategy, but when you do, it can be an awesome experience.\n\nSome things to remember are that the old lone wolf style of play just doesn’t work here unless you are keen to give the Monster a go. It is imperative as a Hunter to work as a team as the characters and classes are all very good at what they do, but cannot win the day by themselves. If you learn the roles each class needs to fill and support your teammates while they do their jobs then you’ll really enjoy yourself here. Definitely a game for people that enjoy teamwork.\n\nI love real time strategy games like the Total War and Command & Conquer series. This game incorporates some of the strategy of these types of games and puts it into a first person shooter scenario. It’s hard to explain but if you can think strategy as well as point and shoot, then this game is perfect for you. Give it a go, try the different classes, see what you think and figure out what class gels with you the most.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to make your own opinion. I can tell that it’s built by a developer that actually listens and actively involves its community. It continues to grow the content and add value at every turn, most of which is for free. Ignore the negative hype, and if you’re not sure then simply jump on the Turtle Rock Forums (https://www.turtlerockstudios.com/) and I'm sure you’ll figure it out for yourself. It is a great game to play, the community is open and passionate, and if you’re willing to put a bit of effort in to learning how to play your chosen role properly, then you will have a fantastic time. This game is definitely worth it.\n","September 6, 2015","true","653.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I love this game to death. The concept and the gameplay are just the most awesome thing.\nI love this so much...\n\nBut...\n\nIt makes me uncontrollably sad how the community keeps saying that the game "is dead". If those players would just play without complaining, maybe we would regain at least 100 players. But the problem isn't only them. This game is just simply too expensive. I thought about this and maybe you could make the game free and then let people buy the 45€ worth of DLCs. Or other way. Make the game 50€ again but make the Seasonpasses free, but the skins can keep the price.\nThe other problem is that this game is somewhat unbalanced but they are working on it. Sure it's a lot harder to find 4 good players instead of only one good monster. (This isn't a problem if you have 4 friends to play the game with) vAlso there aren't too many people playing this game so if we got more, this game would be so much more fun!\nI love this game to death, and I haven't gone through the other pros and cons because I don't want to be "that guy".\n\nThis game is just awesome and I will not give up on it.

Will update when I feel like it.\n\nThanks to Daniel my pocket buddy for introducing me to the game, and Rohan from 2K Games in Singapore for giving us the chance to play it at the office.\n\n----\n\nAfter preview testing, Big Alpha, Closed Beta, the Monster Race retail edition... this game has not let me down yet. The graphics are as magnificent as any CryEngine product tends to do, although three stages of testing still leaves a few bugs around.\n\nThe most intense shooter I've played, where every game is completely different and can go either way - monster technique and hunter cooperation are a must if you want to stand a chance. No playable class is inferior, everyone is equally important, and I say that to the greatest extent that words allow. Engaging the hunters as a stage one monster is no guarantee of a loss, and neither is a stage three a win.\n\nGameplay is brutal for newcomers and there is no notable tutorial for each class; videos are token effort at best and grossly misleading at worst. Strongly recommended to play with at least one friend, preferably with three others in a full party with voice comms. If you do not work together, I assure you that you will lose to a monster of your peer. (In that vein, there is in fact a solo mode but with an AI monster and absolutely atrocious AI teammates I hope you are prepared to play it just for the mastery.)\n\n----\n\nI have not played in three months and have only just come back to semi-serious playtime since interest has been piqued over this weekend's 40%-off sale.\n\nMost of the criticism the game has received comprises accusations of a high price point and "day-one downloadable content", conveniently omitting the fact that the overwhelming majority of said price consists of cosmetic skins for the hunters and monsters.\n\nStraight out of the box the vanilla game is playable and many meta teams - if that is your flavour of shooter - do not require additional hunters .Sure, you have to pay for a monster here and a hunter tier there but I haven't heard of anyone complain about non-essential content sold later in any other game either. And those are not day-one either, as anything after the first three tiers was released at least a month later and/or tied to pre-order bonuses and season pass.\n\nI will not even give the point about the state of the playerbase, since most out there are impressionable and ignorant, and would have been influenced by equally ignorant and scathing reviews of a game they barely put any hours into.\n\nWhat I will give is the state of the game: an extremely steep learning curve and a 100% mission-critical need for teamwork and decent level of skill. Good monsters will play by themselves and dunk on matchmade hunters; good hunters who inevitably have to solo queue will likely get a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates and have to face off against aforementioned monster plus dunking. (This will demoralise anyone faint of heart, and to find these people you just have to look at every other negative review aside from those already mentioned who ignore the cosmetic nature of DLC.)\n\nOn that note, competitive play is still going strong, with a proper ESL showing and Go4Evolve every weekend. Tune in to those tourneys to get a look at what you're missing.","February 13, 2015","true","303.6"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonmyr/recommended/273350/","dragonmyr","Myr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonmyr/","72 products in account","UPDATED Sept 2015============================================\nI have played every available test and free weekend of this game. Here are my opinions:\n\nCons:\n- Progression system with weapon and ability leveling (mastery) that provides performance buffs\n- No mods, modding support, or modding tools\n- Unlockable hunters and monsters\n- Unlockable gameplay-affecting perks\n- Repetitive in gameplay and level design\n- Post-game progression is so convoluted and lengthy it takes 5 minutes just to get through the endless parade of accolades\n- Limited content\n- Matchmaking has major problems with parties\n- Slow matchmaking\n- Competitive-only, no casual matchmaking\n- 3 different ranking systems (mastery output stars, numbered XP ranks, and metal point categorization)\n- Major balance problems with some characters and combinations\n- Repeated audio cues that lack explanation as to what they mean\n- Cannot play monster with your friends\n- No dedicated servers\n- Hunters and monsters are sold as DLC\n- A lot of DLC for sale at high prices\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful\n+ Play as a big boss monster\n+ Singleplayer in addition to multiplayer\n+ Well developed lore, environments, and people\n+ Developer is still supporting the game\n+ Characters have different things to contribute\n\nConclusion:\nEvolve isn't going in the right direction. The developer is focusing on making their game an e-sport while ignoring fairness and variety. If you're the type of gamer who wants to see a badge or ribbon awarded every 15 seconds plus get stat bonuses over time then this is for you. If you prefer gameplay variety and a level-playing field this game is not for you.\n\nTurtle Rock Studios and 2K could win my purchase by getting rid of the mastery system buffs and unlocking all hunters and monsters right from the start. They could also win my purchase by allowing mods so we can make our own maps, monsters, and hunters. These issues are why I have not purchased the game despite being hyped for it in the past.\n\nORIGINAL Feb 2015 Review=======================================\nAvoid.\n\nHas something called "mastery stars" in which buff hunter weapons and tools as well as monster abilities. The buffs go up to 10% and must be unlocked through a Battlefield-like progression system. The mastery stars stack on top of perks and wildlife bonuses. This is not a skills-based competition -- it's an unlock-based competition. Those who have grinded out unlocks are given advantages. Mastery stars can also be acquired through a mobile companion app. You can play a match-3 game or purchase shortcuts.\n\nAlso has an unlock system that blocks 8 hunters and 2 monsters from players. You must complete challenges with the initial slate of 4 hunters and 1 monster to unlock other ones. Challenges are as typical as "do damage with the assault rifle" to tedious as "follow the AI dog, Daisy, around." If you have a job and a life outside of gaming you will very quickly fall behind.\n\nFinally, be aware the DLC is very expensive for this game. Monsters are $15 and individual hunters are $7.50. The Hunting Season Pass is just a bundle of tier 5 hunters. It does not include tier 6 so I don't think it's what most people think of when they see the term "season pass" used. Skins are $3 each or up to $7 for a bundle. There is a significant amount of day-1 DLC. This is a $60, $80, or $100 game with free-2-play content pricing. I have a feeling this game might go free-2-play down the road.\n\nI fell compelled to post this review as early as possible because I hyped up this game to friends last year before the above 3 paragraphs were put into the game. I have played all 3 public tests for this game and am very disappointed with how it has turned out. I don't think this is a game worth your time or money.","February 9, 2015","false","24.7"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","26","46","3","0"

The unlock system that encourages you to just play each character for a game or two before unlocking the next one is good. The gameplay is good.

Part of me feels bad for the developers because they put out a fun game that I could see myself buying if it weren't for this ridiculous amount of DLC being torn from the main game and released seperately at exorbitant prices.\n\nIf you spend $60 on the base game, you're getting MAYBE a quarter of the content.

I bought this game with 2 of my friends and I am the only one that can play it. One friend as everytime the protocol error , so he wasn't able to play a single match and the other gets kick out game 50% of time and has lag issue.\n\nOn my end, when playing the monster I get lag spike randomly (not sure if it's network or graphics) but its a pain in the *ss.\n\nThe game as been out for 3 weeks now, all their focus was on bugs for Xbox-One, with no news for the PC version.\nThis game was meant to play with friends and establish strategies, thus if you are a solo player go with the monster otherwise you will get in groups that most of the time don't have any strategies and just run around the map.\nThis game was made to communicate and create tactics, but with strangers on your team it become more complexe.\n\nSo after 43hours of gameplay in Pug, running around to find the monster in the same jungle look & feel, I just get bored.

The BETTER question would be "If evolve a good game for YOU".\n\nEvolve is very difficult with a high skill ceiling, and a STEEP learning curve that revolves around a lot of mechanics that are simply "new" to general gamers. To play the game well you really need to have a firm grasp on the game as a whole- From mechanics, to techniques, to knowing each and every character and how they "work".  Changing one character in a match, be it monster or hunter- Changes the strategy completely for everyone involved. The same group of 4 specific hunters hunting 1 monster will change if theyre hunting a different monster.  Likewise as a monster, 1 hunter being different can change the entire mindset and tactics on how to defeat them.\n\nThe end result is a highly competitive game from start to finish.  And this is where evolve will or wont break down for you.  There is very, VERY little "Casual" gamer support.  Matches range from 5 to 25 minutes. A match can swing from a sure victory, to utter defeat with a single BAD mistake, on either teams part.\n\nIf that bothers you, no- Evolve is a *terrible* game for you. If that all sounds good to you, evolve may be a great game for you.  The community IS small online- But for the most part youll never have trouble finding a full and revolving match online.  The only trouble can be finding a match as monster in "ranked" mode- But this is because theres a disproportionate amount of monsters to hunter players.  You need 1 monster for ever 4 hunters in this mode- Theres simply more monsters than this ratio, so you end up waiting.  Even during free weekends when theres 5-10,000 people online at once, monsters can see long lines.\n\nDLC- Its worth pointing out that yes, there are 2 "tiers" or "packages" of DLC characters you can buy, each package contains 1 character for each class (4 hunters, 1 monster).\n\nBUT\n\nTo go with this DLC, it should be noted theyve ALSO given out, and will CONTINUE to give out free modes, free maps, free skins all the time, and FREE CHARACTERS.  Theyve started releasing what they call "Adaptation" characers- At first glance they look like simply "reskinned" pre-existing characters.  But in play these characters *completely* change the dynamics of the game, despite being similar at first glance.  The abilities they have are completely reworked, and basically 180 how to play that character.  Theyve got 4 of these characters out already (1 monster, and 3 hunters), with a 4th hunter and 2nd monster coming out just around the corner (January 2016).  They will continue to keep releasing these free characters, at a minimum until theyve gone through all the base characters.\n\nIts also worth stating that no matter what DLC you do or dont have, it will never divide you from the community.  You will always be allowed to play with anyone and everyone, no matter what DLC they have, and are using.\n\nIts got its ups, and its down. Due to its lack of casual support and highly competitive nature with a steep learning curve- Evolve is a VERY niche game and will NOT be a game for everyone.  If youre after a competitive game with a lot of unique and -very- dynamic mechanics, evolve is a great game.","December 24, 2015","true","952.8"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","16","27","0","0"

There is a variety of different things I can come up with to spoil this game's reputation due to the fact it won all those awards at E3 BEFORE being released.Turtle Rock Studios and 2K need to learn how to economies: you don't just say you will include a season pass -Access to each DLC becomes available as it is released. Some Season Passes have unique names, such as the "Rockstar Pass" for L.A. Noire (2011) and Max Payne 3 (2012)- and then say "No, we're not giving you all these DLC weapon skins! Are you mad fam? Go grind" which penultimately is a ♥♥♥♥ing middle finger to all gamers who bought the season pass... It doesn't even matter if you give them a "special offer" for them or if you will "Include a new monster and hunters 12 months later". Turtle Rock Studios and 2K burnt my £20 and many other gamer around the GLOBE as they did a trollface and was going all-Rick Astley like "NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU (Money) UP".\nOnto the second topic of importance: Gameplay. I suddenly realized that we were classed in what levels we are when going on Skirmish or Evacuation... Something I got to hand over to Evolve, yes, but it really doesn't negate the very bad parts. Evolve: Hunter's Quest, a mobile game which you can play and can benefit you in Evolve. Really innovative of 2K studios, the only time I seen this was on Far Cry 3 and the farm for weapon skins for mulltiplayer which boosts damage for you  Similarily, Evolve Hunter's Quest can help your hunters in Evolve level up faster gaining more characters and perks and so on. But up until recently, I have been experiencing really long wait times to start a game which occasionally bugs out meaning I have to use Task Manager to shut the game and reopen it on Steam. I didn't mind this at first but it just started to keep getting buggier and slower and even more buggier and it's not something to be proud of. Rumours were that Evolve would've had a 3GB update to slow down loading times... Well what on earth happened to it because only God Knows that Evolve could need it more than ever.\nI'm not that good of a writer so I guess this will be a Coup de Grace: 2k, Turtle Rock Studios, are your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s not satisfied enough by your money-d*****?","February 21, 2015","false","49.1"," 124 of 235 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","124","235","7","4"

I pre-ordered the game a long time before it came out and forgot about it. If I had remembered, I would have canceled it. The gameplay is just alright, but it's definitely not worth $60. From my experience, matches as a human are mostly just running around with sporadic bouts of shooting. As a monster, you mostly run away. You also lose more often than not. Maybe it's because the starting monster is terrible. I did manage to join a game where I got to play as the Wraith and it was way more fun than the Goliath. Unfortunately, I don't think I want to play enough of this game in order to unlock the Wraith.\n\nThen there's the DLC. I can't believe that a $60 Multiplayer only game has this much DLC, it's ridiculous.

Evolve was essentially designed to be a co-op game but upon its release a solo campaign was added (I have not try it as yet).\n\nAs soon as you enter the game, you will be pointed to the monster tutorial. It is a good idea to go through it as you will find out soon enough into the game, being the monster is not as easy as it seems.\n\nThe multiplayer setup is very similar to the Call of Duty series where you will be directed to a game with an open slot if you do not setup your own game.\n\nYou can choose to be the monster or the hunters. Whatever characters you choose before starting a game, you will have an allocation of 3 points and you will be able to distribute them to your character skills.   Hunters are divided into 4 categories. You can be Assault, Medic, Support or Trapper and each have their own specific weapons and gizmos. It is quite fun to play the hunters but the best part in this game for me is playing the monster without a doubt. I like the fact that if it’s the first time you use one of the characters you will have a quick and details video on their equipments (weapons) and skills before the game starts.\n\nThe controls are very good, mind you if you play the monster it will take you time to master them but boy it is fun!\n\nThe game is visually splendid and runs very well.\n\nMaps are waste and well laid out but in my opinion their look all very similar. In each map you will find animals and not all of them are scared of you. They will attack you pretty much on the spot if they see you. Being the monster, “KILL” them “EAT” them and EVOLVE!  If you are the hunters “KILL” them and be “HEAL”!\n\nI enjoy this game. However, I can’t get pass the fact that EVOLVE in my opinion is a polished version of TF2 (minus the cart) set in another world with a monster and without a 32 slots server.\n\nIt is fun but not a ground breaking game that it was supposed to be. It might Evolve and become one!\n\nGames like this one have a big marketing budget and that unfortunately affects the pricing. I think the price is slightly too high.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great Graphics\n-	Large Maps\n-	Different Monsters with they own characteristics\n-	Playing the monster is challenging\n-	Achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Maps look similar\n-	Price point slightly too high\n\nOverall, I enjoy the game. It is fun playing the monster!\n\n7.9 / 10\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE","February 16, 2015","true","4.2"," 165 of 314 people (53%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","53","165","314","13","6"

Evolve!\nIt was a great game for the first 50 hours I played it, but then I realised I got bored. The games atmosphere is great, the sounds and the surround option is really awesome with a great headset. I really enjoyed being in the role of a hunter. I feel like the monster role needs a bit more skill and stealthiness in the begining. Now the game came to it's first dlc releases... When I saw the prices at the first blink I wasn't sure i saw them right. For a really pricey game I don't think dlc's should cost this much. And the lack of new content is horrible for a price around 25 dolla$ MAYBE I would recommend it, but it would still get pretty boring for many people!

I was very happily rebuffed by a fantastically fun game. The issues regarding finding matches, or matches that had already started, were non-existent (with the latest update[s]?). The gameplay seemed to be wonderfully balanced between good teamwork on the side of the hunters and solid, intelligent play on the side of the monster.\n\nThere are absolutely certain maps which 'favor' specific monsters -- giving the monster an edge in certain ways -- but this in no way keeps the game from being fair or playable. Often hunter losses are caused by a team that's not communicating and, surprisingly, I ran into a lot of PUGs that were actively using their mics and communicating. Only a handful of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s soured that, and often they had a degree of poignance to their asshatiness (non-mic'd player totally ignoring everyone and legitimately helping the monster).\n\nUnlike Titanfall which very, very loosely had a storyline stuck around its matches Evolve actually FEELS fleshed out and leaves you asking questions in good ways (e.g., who is CIG9? What happened on Shear? Is your preferred Hunter actually a good guy... or is he just doing it for fun?).\n\nOf course, I can't support the tons and tons of DLC, but it's honestly cool. Each character in each class feels unique and fun and, I dare say, is worth the cash for them.\n\nOverall, I'd totally recommend the game, especially at $19.99.","September 8, 2015","true","7.5"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","0"

I've put about thirty hours into the game since release, plus another 15-20 from the alpha/beta phase.  The concept is sound.  The visual design is pretty rad.\n\nThis.  Game.  Is.  Not.  Worth.  Sixty.  Bucks.\n\nDon't think I'm somebody who insists that every game MUST have a singleplayer mode; I'm entirely fine with a game being multiplayer only.  IF it has the content and balance to justify it.  And Evolve doesn't, on either score.\n\nExcept for the Goliath, the Monsters are unbalanced.  The way to counter that imbalance is use the Lazarus character, which is one of the most phenomenally moronic design choices I've ever seen in a game.  Monsters can down players, which puts strikes on them and drops their max health when revived.  Lazarus COMPLETELY negates this core element with a fast-recharging ability that takes less than a second to resurrect downed players.  And DEAD players.  And he can turn invisible.  And he has a fast-firing sniper rifle that generates weak points on the Monster.  Oh, and that rez ability?  Using it means a rezzed player doesn't get a strike for being downed, or even COMPLETELY DEAD.  Once you get into the higher levels, the gameplay basically just centers around teams keeping Lazarus alive and protected.\n\nThis makes every fight a total chore for the Monster, as the strike system is negated and only the Monster is the one losing health.\n\nOn top of that, the content is just not there to justify the cost.  And then the devs have the balls to have an overpriced season pass on top of THAT.\n\nSave your money.  Buy something where the devs prioritized balance over "unique" abilities and can also understand that it's pretty moronic to charge full retail price for a somewhat barebones game AND sell a DLC pass as well.","February 24, 2015","false","29.7"," 34 of 62 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","34","62","0","0"

I really do. I find the playstyle extremely fun, teamwork necessary, and the thrill of the hunt. While it is repetative, some people, such as I, enjoy games like that. I paid full price for this game, and got the dlc I figured necessary at the time (Season Pass) Which at the time just mentioned it would include four hunters and a monster. I said to myself, maybe they will add more hunters and monsters and modes into that purchased season pass as time goes so it's a one time fee. Nope. While the maps being free and game modes being free is wonderful, we have recieved one game mode, which I can't really say is "new" but that's aside, and a total of two maps. Then they go and announce that the first season pass is free for those after a certain date.

I really do. I find the playstyle extremely fun, teamwork necessary, and the thrill of the hunt. While it is repetative, some people, such as I, enjoy games like that. I paid full price for this game, and got the dlc I figured necessary at the time (Season Pass) Which at the time just mentioned it would include four hunters and a monster. I said to myself, maybe they will add more hunters and monsters and modes into that purchased season pass as time goes so it's a one time fee. Nope. While the maps being free and game modes being free is wonderful, we have recieved one game mode, which I can't really say is "new" but that's aside, and a total of two maps.

Ultimately the experience is one of a lack of trust!  I can't  trust myself to enjoy this game due to it's numerous bugs and its exploiting nature.  What I mean is the questionable cheating, the crashes to desktop, the amount of lag that appears out of nowhere when a turning point of the battle takes place, the system that bills this game as a casual 4v1, where it is actually highly competitive and requires competence and communications, but no system is in play to encourage it.  The numbers on the PC platform speak for itself.  This game was supposed to be the game that I convince my friends to jump into the PC platform for!  This is a true next gen game, in regards to both graphics and gameplay.  Yet, with the before mentioned, this is exactly WHY none of my buddies wants to invest in the PC platform.

I enjoyed it in the beginning and most of that time was logged during the Alpha and Beta weekends. Since there was a timeframe I played as much as I could in that time.\nI purchased the $100 PC monster race edition, I was excited! So excited! Only to be let down...\nThe new modes they talked about before release seemed better than they really are. They're all garbage and just distractions to the main mode. The real mode that is different is Defend but it only exists after complete 4 rounds on evacuation. How lame, the only mode that is actually different requires you to play other games to even start.\n\nWhat happens with the game and why it isn't good is because the normal mode gets repetitive, sure it was fun and I did grind a lot of hours but that was just to unlock the other Hunters. Wowie, after unlocking everyone there was no reason to play and I realised how empty it really was. Unfortunately they added DLC and it just wasn't worth it. Yeah more Hunters and another monster?! Still same boring gameplay that I've done already. Also the balance isn't there. Literally all the Medics are worthless aside from Lazerus. Why? You get beat down to death and die. Lazerus can cloak and escape.\n\nThey added a new Arena mode, I think it was a very welcomed addition and actually gets rid of the repetitive nature of hunting the monster. I just feel like they need something new. Something more. 5 v 5 monster brawls. 8 hunters vs 2 monsters. 8 v 8 hunters or just 4 v 4. Sure some items will be obsolete, but they can just swap them out!\n\nAll the content is being shoved into the DLC and not the core game. It is very sad, I cry.

And with the community shrinking insanely fast, I was happy with my choice. But I still wanted to try Evolve, because the game mechanics and style really intrigued me. I wanted to try, and as if by magic, a free weekend [no doubt in an attempt to try and bolster the game's small playerbase] came round and I quickly jumped on it, to give it a go. Because let's be honest, it's free for the weekend, doesn't matter what the DLC prices were like- it's free.\n\nSo I only played it for one day so far [was out today]. All my hours into the game so far were all put in, in one big go. I very quickly found that the game's design, people's co-operation and general flow of the game was really desirable. I got excited when the team played well, and the monster was also a good player. A lot of my games in the 7+ hour period I played resulted in 1 person living, spraying every last bullet against a stage 3 monster who was on less than 5% life, trying to kill it before going down in a spectacular state of 'going down with a fight'. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYIjbHidB08 Was just one of mine, and it felt amazing to play, and as you can hear by the other person in game, to play around as well.\n\nYes, the DLC method isn't too desirable, and the game cost too much for what it was, but hey- until the 15th of september, I can get the game, and ALL the DLC for less than the game is first hand on Steam, which is already cheap enough at £25. So after selling off lots of steam badges and unneeded items, yes. I'm buying this game. And I intend on playing this game a lot more, because the last time I felt this type of excitement from an FPS...I was picking up CoD4 for the first time, as an FPS-hater 15 year old boy back in 2008.","September 5, 2015","true","11.1"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","22","39","0","0"

We all thought the Hunt Mode was cool, and even though it was repetitive quickly, the advertised evacuation mode seemed like the game would offer loads of additional content once released.\nSadly, Evolve is nothing but a cash-grab, a huge disappointment and not worth your money. Evacuation-mode was nothing but five matches of other game-modes in a row (all pretty boring compared to the already quickly boring Hunt-mode). The in-game shop was already riddled with DLC. The lack of a campaign is the worst, since the characters themselves hint in some of the dialogue they speak of the rich lore this universe of hunters has. You will never learn anything else about it though (Maybe in future DLC ? -_-).

It was great fun, nothing bad to say about it at that point.\nThen the Alpha and later the Beta got me and my friend playing it for hours, trying to unlock new hunters over the Alpha/Beta-weekend. Still we had great fun.But in Beta the Game got a strange feel to it according to the content it offers to the players. Since not very much changed since Alpha, I was wondering how much content the game is going to offer.\nNow that I played for like a week I decided to list some points for everyone and give a brief feedback:\n\nPRO\n-Great fun when playing with your friends\n-The Maps look great\n-Controlling the monster or hunters is pretty easy when you play for the first time, but mastering every single character is a challenge\n->Even Beginners can quickly jump into it\n-Custom games can lead to crazy matches\n\nCONS:\n-Not so much fun when playing alone\n-->sometimes voice chat bugs, when playing with random people in matchmaking\n-After some hours, you get the feeling like playing the same game all over and over again\n-Matchmaking System "unfair". A Elo/Ranking would be better,since the lvl does not represent skill\n-Balanced on high lvl ---> Unbalanced on lower skill levels\n-No story mode\n-It is like Cs:go --> play against other people, because bots/Ai are to bad..... -> not fun\n-You can unlock and level up in custom games against the computer-> People unlock stuff and get lvl up, but do not improve->Matchmaking puts together player of same lvl but not the same skilllevel :(\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nAfter all I had great fun with the game when playing with my friends,BUT\nEvolve is not worth the money you pay for. For 50 Bucks you get 12 hunters and 3 Monster and 12 Maps, and some gamemodes, that don't differ from one another. Therefore the amount of content is just to low. When i look over to some Indie-games that cost 10 Bucks, but offer the same amount of Content(-< time  spent, since it does not have a story you will only play multiplayer until it gets boring)I feel sad for the potential lost right here. The rest of the game will be coming out via DLC for the publisher to get even more money for little content. Like in "The Sims" you get a game that is fun to play, but to experience every part of it you are forced to buy a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of DLC, once you are hooked.\nIf you did not buy it yet, think twice before buying it.\n","February 16, 2015","false","38.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

After those 60 mins I managed to get into a game, I thought to myself "actually, this is pretty good" then the dreaded disconnection from host error was printed to the screen.\n\nI told myself, "hey it's early access it will get better, just give it a few moments and I'm sure the game will rectify the matchmaking issue, synchronise with the matchmaking service and work as normal" right?\n\nNope . . . Well I kidded myself into buying this game thinking I would feel good for taking the dive (I Didn't) and now all I can honestly say is that I feel nothing but remorse.\n\nI managed to get into one game, and I do mean one game. The results are as follows, join, crash, reconnect, load level, gpu kernel error, reconnect, play for 15mins . . .  yes 15mins at 15-40 fps on a top tier system (rated by system requirements lab) inevitably the application hangs again, event viewer shows wmi error, (obviously connected with either memory management in windows 8.1 or heap management in cry engine 3), breaks my desktop and my wallet for 15 mins of actual gameplay which resulted in essential getting wrecked while playing as the goliath due to not being able to rank up as I am barely able to play the game.\n\nThe worst part about this?\n\nAs if to add insult to the already finacially hemorrhaging injury that is early access titles, to which I am a huge supporter of and will always chip in and extra few pounds here and there to support an upcoming studio or game idea providing it meets the criteria that suits my needs as a gamer or would benefit the community by bringing fresh new content to the genre and this game I thought would be worth my 24.99 initial investment.\n\nOne of the strangest bugs this game has caused is to change my keyboard localisation on crash "WHAT!??" how does that even happen?\n\nIn this current dissapointing state of affiars in my honest opinion and like many others, do not buy this.\n\nUntil this developer can overcome fundemental game development flaws and hitches, poor hardware utilisation (you managed to build a binary that runs badly on cry engine? *claps*) I will only be seeking enjoyment from other, better priced, optimised, actually fun, compelling, immersive and passionately crafted titles, Like Killing floor 2 Where the development team focus on building a solid and enjoyable core game loop that just works, surround by amazing effects, map design and gunplay, releasing maps as soon as they are done and tested, additional extra are truely additional and do not affect the game in any way shape or form, there is no constant "buy here" option or things would be better with this item from our store that you can buy for just a few dollars.\n\nFor me, I was excited about this game on my own terms, without watching any kind of sales or marketing or any hype of any kind, just facts and content and so far I could not feel any further from satisfied if you tried.\n\n\nI hope this title can improve in future, I would like to feel compelled to purchase this again, I don't honestly feel as though trust is not going to easily be regained from me or other memebers of the early access community that have the same or similar feelings as me. nor do I think that the development team or even pr will care enough to bother to read this post, however I do hope that any prospective buys of this game can learn something from this.\n\n\nChoose your development studio well if you are going to buy an early access title.\n\nChoose a studio that would want nothing more than for you to really enjoy their artwork and play their title and all it's content.\n\nTell the developers where they are going wrong, early access feedback is important and if the development studio cares they will make the changes to their game to suit their players.\n\nLast but not least . . .\n\n. . . Understand that not all of these games are going to make it to launch and some of these titles will be prematurely released to suit the needs of the publisher, this is not the development teams fault, they are at the mercy of their paycheck and in order to keep it they must obey their masters.","July 12, 2015","false","1.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I really like what they tried to do with it but Evolve just comes up short most of the times.\n\nHardly any players means you'll be playing with either the same people with a very varied skillrange or maybe even no players at all.\n\nPeople keep disconnecting in fear that their stats on the leaderboards might fall. This is EXTREMELY common in Evolve public games. People also disconnect randomly anyway.\n\nThere's a huge discussion on balance in the game and in my experience it favors monsters most of the time. If you get an inexperienced player in your public game you're probably going to end up losing for as long as he's there.\n\nSmall glitches everywhere. Just today i was line of sighting a goliath hoping to escape the flames and it killed me through the wall.\n\nWhat i really, really like about this game is the setting and lore. Every short story you get through the dialogue of the characters right before dropping onto Shear are amazing.\n\nIn the end, every single game turns into running around the same maps over and over while trying to get monster. Every single hunt-gamemode game feels exactly the same. There's really no mixing it up. Play another gamemode? Well, have fun playing alone because the only gamemode played is hunt.\n\nOverall Evolve is just a bad experience.\n\nEDIT: This doesn't mean i'm not going to go back to the game every now and then as i sort of like it and sort of don't.

The engine is not conducive to high fps. The stutter and lag at +100 fps makes the game broken. (its not a spec issue as my highest CPU core of 4790K is at 40% and my GTX 980 Isnt Maxed Either). Lower graphics settings don't help either. Its a frametime variance issue. The engine simply cannot keep up.\n\nI actually like the game and at 60 fps maxed out it is smooth and performs like a dream. I guess the argument could be made that at least its not the 30 fps of consoles but for a FPS the blur at 60 compared to 120 is a minor annoyance. (but not near as much as the hitching from the frame variance at high FPS). Again not a bad game, albeit quite repetitive.\n\nJust wanted high FPS enthusiasts to know that their multi-thousand dollar rig simply cannot be fully utilized by this game.","February 16, 2015","false","9.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

There was zero training in the game, and you were immediately thrown at other players and died because you didn't know how to play yet. Once you did figure out how to play, there was such significant balance problems between the teams that most matches were over in less than a minute.\n\nI really like teamwork games, so I had high hopes for this title, but everything I know about it says this is one that I should skip out on.\n\nThe game at release time is almost certainly much better than the beta experience, but that's not what my review is about.\n\nI am not going to address gameplay here in my review at all.\n\nThe problems I have with this game are about juvenility, racism, DLC, and other stupid marketing and management a$$hattery.\n\nUnfortunately, I know too much about the world we live in and it's history. I can't find "Glorious PC Gaming Master Race" meme stuff funny. The people who do think it's funny don't believe they are being hurtful or malicious; they are just juveniles who don't know any better.\n\nTurtle Rock has decided that it's okay to use race-based themes and terminology in their marketing of Evolve. I don't approve of the kind of people who thinks that's okay.\n\nThis game has day-1 DLC. That's a pretty serious game-publishing offense right there.\n\n3GB patch on launch day isn't a good sign either.\n\nThe way Turtle Rock is selling their DLC also makes me seriously concerned. Other people have done a much better job of articulating the problems with their DLC, so I'll defer to the many news and opinion articles already out there on that subject.\n\nIn all, Turtle Rock and 2K did a great job of sinking this game before it even got our of port.\n\nHold off. Just wait a month or two and see what happens. Don't ride the Hype Train. Let other people get burned if this title tanks, and if it doesn't then players will still be playing in another month or two when it goes on sale.\n\nAt this point, I don't see how Turtle Rock/2K is going to get people to play this title without a major sale.","February 10, 2015","false","0.2"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

The biggest pitfall excluding team mates thinking they are Rambo that is, is running in a circle for 20 minutes chasing the monster. Teamwork is key here. Worried that the game could get repetitive quickly but definitely well-polished, balanced and thought out. The DLC is another matter though. Way too much too soon, at least half of this should have been game content. $60 is a lot of money but $99 is just too much, I can’t justify this for a game.

Short and sweet, do not get this game unless it's on sale for 19.99-24.99 that's the value I can give it.\n\nIt feels lackluster in content at launch and launch DLC should never be the answer for that void.\n\nThe matchmaking is nothing more then a headache, often times waiting and stuck on waiting for a player to load. So you back out and get penalized. You wait minutes before you finally get into a game only to hope your team isn't useless.\n\nThe other issue is I can't even find a full team multiple times searching, this game is brand new and I can't get a full game. Then when you back out because you only have 2 players total, you're stuck with a leave penalty!\n\nI can't help but feel so blah over this game. I have no drive to play it for a length of time, no drive to log in. It's a game I log in to play a match or two when I need a chane of pace from other games. Again, not worth the $70 for a time filler.\n\nThe game looks and sounds great but this should have been a micro transaction, free to play model or a properly done full game (which it's not).\n\nShame on the company/developers for this half baked junk.\n\nI will say once you get a good group of people going, it can be a lot of fun but that cocktail of luck is far and too few between.","February 16, 2015","false","64.7"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

I love the hide and sneak genre. For the price you get a polished product, but not much on game modes and single player content. I dont know if its just me, but i never connected with the hunters and end up half the time just jet packing around the arena, and that gets old, but i guess sometimes especially when i started playing in the beginning the hunt was a lot of fun, chasing down a monster. Playing the monster is even better trying to stay hidden in the first few minutes of the game takes skill and nerves of steal trying to outwit 4 other players, same reason i bought Watch Dogs with the hacking multiplayer and look how long that lasted. Same with Titanfall, it was a big bohaa in the beginning but also died a quick death after a short few months.\n\nBut here is the big reason I am not recommending the game, this is 95% mostly a multiplayer game and the servers are terrible. I had to much lag to really play decent games as the monster, though its more forgiving when you play a hunter. I have a 4mb line. So when the servers are bad i play single player, and well, playing with bots gets old very very quickly. I am bored, with no story or just the same stuff over and over, without multiplayer this game is boring, i'd rather play besieged. This is a game you totally have to play with your friends and you will have a good time, but this is a game i personally will play and then uninstall and never play again, same thing i did  with Watch Dogs. There is nothing that pulls me back, unless my friends wants to play and well, no one wants to buy it, i am blaming them so i am freeing up some 28gigs on my harddrive.\n\nMaybe you have better friends or internet connection! Then buy it, i don't see any issues with the dlc packs, its mostly just cosmetic and doesn't add any real content, but if you didn't preorder like i did then to get all the extra stuff you will have to fork out a lot of cash, and well i dont think its worth it but if you are like me on the other stuff also, stay far far away.","February 15, 2015","false","12.4"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","18","32","2","3"

In the base game, there is a total of 12 hunters and 3 monsters available to choose from. The game offers no customisation aside from a selection of skins, of which only 1 per hunter/monster are not DLC. The progression system is purely linear and makes for a very unbalanced experience. Hunters/monsters work in tiers, where the next hunter/monster is better than the last, and only the same level of hunter/monster can have a good chance against other hunters/monsters. For example, four tier 1 hunters will find it near-impossible to take down the tier 3 monster, and vice-versa.\n\nAs well as balancing issues, the game is plagued with people of varying skill so it's always a game of chance as to whether or not your team will actually work as a team.\n\nThe game offers very little replayability due to the sheer lack of proper progression and customisation, and the lack of content, most of which is cut to be sold as DLC.\n\nSpeaking of DLC, this game is chock-a-block full of it. The game itself costs $60. From launch, 12 items of DLC are available to purchase, one of which is a season pass that includes none of the other content available to purchase. You can buy skin packs which offer 1 new skin for each 3 hunters in a class, that's 3 skins in total, for the low low price of $6. Or, you can buy one skin for each of the 3 monsters at the low low price of $10. The season pass itself is $25-30 depending on your region, and includes 4 new hunters (when they release). New monsters will also be available to buy for the grand total of $15-20.\n\nYou'd think for all the money they're charging, they'd at least release a game relatively bug-free and well polished. But no, that sadly is not the case. The game still has issues that were around in both alpha and beta. On top of this, the graphics are console quality, and the few CGI cutscenes are so badly compressed, my toaster could render a higher quality image.\n\nThe game is a total rip-off, and that itself is enough for me to not recommend this game. However, DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aside, the game's lack of serious progression and replayability is once again not enough for me to recommend a purchase. Maybe a year from now when the complete pack is $15-20, then you should pick it up. However at that point the game will be dead MP wise, and as SP isn't even worth mentioning, what's the point?","February 20, 2015","false","15.3"," 56 of 106 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","56","106","0","3"

From what I have seen, Evolve's release has been pretty much average so far. People make a good concept for the game, then. They ♥♥♥♥ you in the ♥♥♥ with Day one/Week one DLC.

However that is the end of the story. Evolve ends up being more boring than it should be for both sides and doesn't do enough to keep the blood pumping in your ears except in really good match ups.\n\nLong gone are the tense matches of LFD and LFD2 with one man limping to the safe room with the horde closing in...\n\nEvolve is fun to an extent, but it is not worth $30-$60 US. Catch it on a special for $15-25 and you can have some fun (if people are still playing it by then) for a few matches every now and then.\n\nP.S.

I actually didn't buy the game, I played the Alpha.\n\n\nEvolve is a 4 V 1 multiplayer game by 2K games and turtle rock studios. During the alpha it was kinda okay. I mean, nothing completely special. Just seemed like a more violent Tom & Jerry, except with 4 Toms and one Jerry. Like a lot of the games lately it's a great concept, but just poorly executed. From what I have seen, Evolve's release has been pretty much average so far. People make a good concept for the game, then. They ♥♥♥♥ you in the ♥♥♥ with Day one/Week one DLC. The game even in alpha seemed lacking. But, day one DLC that's almost a third of the full game's price? Which isn't even a fair price for what you're giving them. Why keep something as a DLC? You're literally making customers, people who have played games for years. To spend 100+ on one game, just to get the full experience. That's cheap. And honey, we don't buy in.\n\n1/10 would bend over for you ;D","February 10, 2015","false","0.6"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","22","40","6","3"

Throughout my game time I have noticed a few things : Goliath is fun to face against, no one complains about them. If a Kraken player knows how to play they are unstoppable (Im talking a very good kraken player) And there are so many damn bugs and glitches in this game that the damn exterminator wouldnt know what to do with it. There are so many games where we lost due to a bug. Did the goliath throw a boulder at you while you where at full hp with no strikes? Well there is a glitch that causes it to one shot you. Laz on the team as the medic? Better hope bodies dont fall through the level or teleport accross the map. This game has so many bugs that each game you play you will always find a bug. Playing Parnell and have your shield on and then supersolder? Sometimes the supersolder activates but doesnt work if you do that. This game was in development for so long that i hate how many bugs it has. I do not recommend this game, its far more enjoyable to just watch someone on twitch play the monster or go play something else. Turtle rock you had my hopes up for this game.

It’s a team of 4 soldiers against a Boss monster. It looks beautiful and as a rule plays very well with the right system. I did have a program on my computer that caused a lot of crashes (AVG Tuneup), but as soon as I uninstalled it Evolve has been solid!\n\nThere's been a lot of negativity around this game, mainly because of the DLC. Negativity has bred at a very fast pace around the game and the sad part is that most of it is just silly skin DLC that people are crying about, a lot of people have a need to buy every new skin that comes out which would prove to be an expensive addiction?  Personally, I only have the free skins I have earned in challenge weekends and haven't spent an extra penny on new skins at all.\n\nYou also need to buy new monsters and hunters too if you want them? If someone else has them you can still play with them though, so it's not a game changer if you don't have the characters yourself. Turtle Rock and 2K have learned a good lesson with pricing structure and as of late June 2015, you can buy the new characters ALOT cheaper than when Evolve was first relased. They've even included the latest monster in with hunting season 2, making it a very attractive addition to the game if like me you love it!\n\nThey are balancing the game constantly to try and make it as nice as possible for the players. There are bugs but the game is complex has been out for about 5 months (as of writing this review), they are working on them. There are different bugs for different people that make it harder to put right, perhaps like me different systems software is having an effect?\n\nTo me, I absolutely love the game and have neglected all other games in my library in favour of it....

Fun to play but the monsters are too weak. In a fight, the hunters have a huge advantage when the monster is level one. If the monster is caught at either level one or two, it's a definite game over.

Disappointed. What can I say... I was really looking forward to this release and it just didnt live up to the expectation. The whole cat and mouse chasing the monster from one end of the map to the other thing gets boring really fast as a hunter and just rotating through the 4 moves you get as a monster makes for boring gameplay as well. At this point I feel like this is sorta one of those 'use your imagination' kinda games. They do a cool job of creating the environments and I really like the feel of the game (ie. chasing down a monster and engaging in combat and sorta the hulking feel of the monsters) but after a few rounds.. yeah, I dont feel compelled to keep playing. And if they gonna turn it into a big pay to play scheme that gonna suck too. Like, I see they are releasing a new hunter/monster pack but has anything changed about the gameplay?? Last I checked, no. So why am I gonna want to keep investing in this franchise? Just so I can get bored with new characters? Anyway, I'd really like to see them take what they have here and phrase it in terms of a new Rampage or King of Monsters type of game, that would be badass.","June 23, 2015","false","35.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Played with a couple friends, we had such a great time. Then, after launch, I never bought it nor heard much about it. I guess after launch they did something that really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ people off?\n\nNow, around 7 months later, i purchased this game. Honestly, It's not worth to buy on steam. and, if you're wanting to keep interested, I would get the PC Monster Race edition... (BUT WHO WANTS TO PAY $80?) (I recommend getting it from somewhere else that sells it.)    This game can be tons of fun, but only if you have some good friends to play it with. I met some really nice and cool people while playing this game, so maybe you can do the same :D.\n\nJUST REMEMBER:  Some people can be HUGE jerks on this game. if you screw up once, they will do whatever they can to make sure you feel terrible about it xD. Another type of person on this game:   I was queued with a group, and our medic (I was already mad at him as I Main a medic {Have all of them unlocked, LOVE the gameplay}) never could keep up with us. He was always around 150m away, and didnt even heal us during the entire game. I questioned him and he said, " Oh, i dont like healing or doing the medic stuff, i just want to play as a medic." He was like... 7?\n\n\nOVERALL:\nIf you can get this game at a cheap price and either want to meet new people or have some friends to play it with, then GET THIS GAME.\n\n\nThanks guys :)\nZander","September 7, 2015","true","41.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

So you should know already that it depends heavily on the player population remaining high enough. Honestly? I don't see that happening.\n\nAsymetric gameplay is fine, but not when one side's ability to compete is locked behind a needless progression system. This throws any kind of balance the game would have out the window, especially when the matchmaking pits noobs against vets regularly, often to the frustration of all involved. Assuming you connect in the first place.\nThere just isn't enough meat here to hold anyone's interest. Much like Titanfall, the game has a few interesting ideas that just ended up falling back into standard multiplayer fare.\n\nClosest recommendation I could offer instead with the same basic premise would be a source mod The Hidden. At least it's free if you own Half-Life2 (which using Steam, you should). Same basic idea as Evolve, and you'd have to play it with friends just to get a game going like you would with Evolve anyway. Really when you get down to the classes and the weapons and even the monsters, there just isn't enough incentive to play the same boring chase and occasional fight over and over.

After 2 hours clocked into the game - finishing the tutorial as the monster and the assault and played some quick games, I've basically given up.\n\nThe concept was interesting - yet poorly executed.  Gameplay - this looks like a concept ripped out from other famous games out there - Left 4 Dead (Special Infected like the Tank against the other 4 survivors), Team Fortress 2 (where the 4 human players are of different classes), Diablo  (if you're playing as the monster it's like hack and slash and pick up the loot but in this case - EAT).  But for me, this feels like an overblown - PAC-MAN!!!  Being a monster at level 1 and 2 your are almost utterly worthless from the 4 human hunters so you must....RUN AWAY....chomp and at some point eat a power pellet (level up by evolving).  Then at level 3 you can now chase the other 4.  Where you deal each other damage until your armor goes down (Power-pellet ran out) and then you run-away again.  Chomping on those power pellets...errr...wildlife until you grow your armor back.  Then go after them again.  Rinse and repeat.  Being one of the 4 human hunters I felt a bit more fun, but it's more like Team Fortress 2 with a bit more jazz.\n\nI can understand some reviewers' point of no one choosing to be the monster in this game.  It's utterly boring.  The human players are more than 20 times smaller than you.  You can't see their faces, it's like hacking some rag doll around but with overblown cheesy weapons.  Not like being the "Tank" in Left 4 Dead where you can still see the brutality of plummetting your adversary to the ground and smashing their faces and enjoying every bit of it.\n\nTo be honest - this game would rather make me play Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 again - I've played both throughout these years and enjoyed them.  And I won't mind playing them again with my friends.  Will I play this game again even if my friends bought this? - Yes, as a human player.  But we'll all just be standing there staring at the wall - since no one would want to play as the monster.","September 5, 2015","false","2.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Though lacking on a story mode, this game does have a great story. We colonize Shear and the planet fights back. So they hire specific people to take care of the job. Each character has their own backstory and they interact differently with each other. Each character, though seperated into four different classes, are unique and aren't similar, though their classes are. The monsters are all unique too, they excel at certain things and they have their own flaws. The quality is here, but I can't recoment this game unless you have four more friends willing to buy it themselves with the player base slowly going away. This is a great game now, but when it launched, people stayed away because of the price and multiple purchasing ways. $60 for the base game, a deluxe version, a PC monster race version, the second season pass, it just alienated itself from everyone. I was confused, which one should I buy? Which one's worth it? though I got it on a steam sale, I still need to buy more for the game.

So bear with me.\n\nYes, I have had prejudiced thoughts about this game when I read the reviews.\nYes, I had thought it was overpriced for just a multiplayer game.\nYes, after playing this game for a while, everything I thought about the game had been turned around.\nI strongly urge all of you who are thinking about getting this game to get it.\nYou will not regret it. If you already own it and gave up on it, then give it another try. Whatever the game's problems were at the start, I cannot seem to find any.\n(Nothing that major, but i'll go into details later.)\n\n~So, without further delay, Let us go into those aforementioned details.~\n\nMy thoughts.\nThe characters have chemistry together, they have personality, respond to whats going on around them. From the little -pre- game chats between characters to throwing Stasis grenades as Abe, and having him shout "Have some of Abe's special little F*ck you's".\nIts those nice little details that make the game more alive\n\nEasy to learn, hard to master. I only have about ~30 hours into this game at the time of writing, and i think i'm pretty good at my role(Trapper), But even now i'm finding out new tricks, new ways to cut off monsters. And i'm happy to say that i have seen far from everything yet. Diversity is plenty,\neven when playing the same role over, and over.\n\nThe price and DLC. This is a big pickle for most people. Yes. 59.99 Euro (or USD depending on your currency) is allot, for just a multiplayer game.\nBut can we please try to look past it. The pricing doesn't make this game any better or worse. If you think the price is too high, thats that. But don't go writing reviews about this game, saying its bad, just because you don't agree with the price. For what i paid (40 euro + 20 for the season pass) i am definatly getting my money out of it. The DLC, is just optional bling bling, which you don't even need, since you can master a character in its role, and unlock elite skins that way, I am far from done with this game.\n\n"LASER CUTTER IS ONLINE!" - Had to put this in here for a friend of mine.\n\nGameplay. The gameplay is, and this is as simple as i can explain it. A cat and mouse game, where, after enough cheese. The mouse can eat the cat. But thats not enough. It is true that a Stage 3 monster is very strong, but with teamwork, solid class knowledge and a little bit of luck, you can take down any creature, big or small.\n\nGraphics. This game has some amazing visuals, i myself run it maxed out, and i am loving every second i breeze trough the Fauna & Flora. (Abe + Sunny's Jetpack boost.) The weapons look satisfying, the impact feels amazing, and it all just looks so good.\n\nTo conclude, so far i have played every single monster, (And hunter) and here is where i bring up my only negative point. In their own respects, every single monster or hunter is balanced to my feel. You have equal chance of winning, every single game. It really depends on your own individuel skill, a lone Lazarus can revive his entire team and press on the fight, but in the same respect, a Goliath can obliterate an entire team in a few seconds. But, and here comes the but, that mentioned Lazarus can only do such things, if his team just communicates to any degree. Yet instead, all i get from most people when i try to talk to them is this, "i don't speak to gays" and it really makes me sad.\nAnd that concludes my view on this game.\n\nDo i think this game is worth playing? Yes, 100% Yes, try it.\n-Disclaimer. I'm not natively English, and this is me trying my best to type this on the go. No google or anything, and this is not a professional review or anything, so please keep spelling and grammar comments to yourself.

I myself have witnessed games where feeding was perposely glitched out.  Place those games along side games where balance is way off and you get the .5 reasoning.

Considering some of the other reviews (Gamespot, Escapist, Polygon) I had high hopes for something like this. Now that I've paid for the game, 11,000 people playing the game with a peak amount of 19,953 is pathetic, and should be reflective of the type of game this is.\n\nI love the concept of it, but the reality of it is so far detached.\nIf you're after this sort of game play, L4D & L4D2 are much, much better games.\n\nThe $60~ price point doesn't really meet the standards of many other gamers, and in my opinion, this game doesn't offer more content than the range of free games on the market currently.

Game started out alright and one could have a blast. However trainers and certain programs hinder the overall experience.  I know of a lot a fair ammount of people whose Win/loss ratios went from a 2.6 to nearly .5 or less once trainers were developped that allowed clipping, unlimited jetpack usage, monster instantly showing on hud/map/target area. I myself have witnessed games where feeding was perposely glitched out.  Place those games along side games where balance is way off and you get the .5 reasoning.  The average win/loss should hover at 1.2 to 1.0 for both sides. So far, its either horrible good or horribly bad. no goldielocks medium.  Like more thoughtout and tested games.

I recommend to all to stay away from this cash hord of a crap game. This game will influence how games in the future will be made and then juiced out of every penny it can get from these "Tripple A" games. I for one have put a little time into it when the Beta was released for a short weekend and couldn't get the game to work quite as it was intended, thats why I have very little time into it. But after trying to have a good time with it i learned a little more about the game. Did you know that the game was preset with DLC before the game even had any gameplay released or even a picture of what to expect? This to me is an eye opener on how some companies (not all) treat us. As for me I am sick of being promised "Tripple A" titles and then being forced to buy more of the game in peices to actually get my moneys worth. And after all those DLC who even knows if the game was actually worth playing and purchasing in the first place. Please save your money from this hole of a game and put it to something more your moneys worth, hopfully a game that is at least to its completion point and not to a money scam.","February 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Really good in fact. But I have a few issues with the game just like most others do.\n\nA: This game costs too much for what it offers. I've gotten more content out of much, much cheaper games and on top of that we have to buy even more DLC lol what? I already paid quite a bit why do I need to pay more? It's already expensive just to buy the game itself.\n\nB: Currently not enough players mostly because of the reaosn above\n\nC: Major balancing issues. Wraith is pretty damn strong. Kraken was far too strong when I played and I rarely beat the thing because a ranged monster should be weaker than the others in terms of how many hits it can take but it simply wasn't.\n\nD: First monster is pretty damn weak compared to the other 2. I never even see people use it. Needs buffs.\n\nE: Another problem I had with the game was how biased this was towards the monster. The monster has no control over which maps get picked. The monster also has no way of really escaping the players becauseoo it's literally set up so that just when you run out of abilities to escape with their fuel runs out. Their tracking skills are also borderline broken. Make one wrong move and you probably are not going to escape their sights. So if you've had it easy as the monster it's because the players weren't working as a team or they were playing inccorectly. A good team of players can easily dominate the monster mostly because of the movement capabilities of both the monsters and the players being identical but the monster should have the advantage there but it just really doesn't.\n\nF: The player revive mechnic is broken. I'm sorry but if I put in that much work to take someone out and they just get revived that takes all the fun out of the game for the monster and the will to even fight the players. If a player dies they should be punished and forced to respawn when the ship arrives. If the ship gets a shorter spawn time or the res time for players gets cut down or they take longer to revive I would be okay with that but um, I really get tired of having to stand on a dude and hope that the enemy is too stupid to attack me properly to make sure that he/she is dead. I don't mind the mechanic too much but at this point the game is so biased towards the monster it's just not even fair which may also be why they are so overpowered to an extent.\n\nWell those are my problems with the game. It's a great game but it was ruined by the company sadly. If they shape up and fix the issues with the game then it will improve and get more players but right now it's not worth your time.","June 24, 2015","false","21.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Every player has it's own role and one mission. Every time the fight begins it was so much adrenaline.\n\nGame seems well balanced, I may be wrong, only played for a day. Though, that damn Wraith monster seems too powerfull! :)\n\nAnyway, I liked playing as a monster, I liked playing as an assault and other hunters. If a team knows what they're doing, then the game will be great. If you're not so much a team player, then go for a monster.\n\nBeing a monster is all about running away, escaping from hunters to find food at the beginning. Cause there's no point to fight at stage 1. After you evolVe to stage 2, you can try to fight those little humans. But again, if there is an opportunity to escape, do it. At stage 3, nothing can stop you.\n\nWhen you are a hunter, you have a lot of characters to choose from. Honestly, I have not played all of them. I only played as an assault, and a little bit as a medic.\n\nThere are 4 roles:\nAssault - damage\nMedic - healer\nSupport - buffer\nTraper - traper\nEvery role has 4 or 5 different characters. So you can spend a lot of time playing as a hunter.\n\nEvery time you choose a character that you haven't played yet, you'll get a short brief on that character before match starts. It will explain special features of that character, and give a little tip on tactics.\n\nI liked the overall graphics (GTX 750 Ti), the Dropship looks very good, the dialogs between teammates are hilarious, especially in the Dropship at the beginning :) Locations are some mix of jungle and technologically advanced stations.\n\nThe price tag... well it seems a bit high for me. But with 50% off now, it looks better(of course :)). A big bunch of DLCs looks confusing, feels like in a market. I just want to pay and play, is that too much to ask?\n\nAnyway I recommend this game, it is fresh and fun!\n\n","September 7, 2015","true","10.6"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","26","48","0","1"

A developer can tip their hat about what's in their game - and show all the inner workings entirely free. It's pretty good if the game has some substantial core content, too. For example, I couldn't download it because my internet was too slow, but I remember Arma 3 had a Free Weekend, which I utilized by downloading the game and also buying it at the great sale price. But you could see from the content on display, there was some great bang for buck to be had, and there still is.\n\nAnd now I see Evolve in the firing seat. I'd obviously heard the mixed reviews - all the DLC being thrown up for sale on release, the pricing structure etc - all very controversial stuff. So as I've downloaded it (which is already pretty big download and time spender) and have spent 40 minutes with the game, I'm not going to defend it. Evolve doesn't really know what to do with itself. The concept and idea are great - asymmetrical multiplayer. An example I highly recommend is Depth, which has 2 sharks against 4 divers. Unfortunately, in Evolve's case, I just find a lack of enjoyment. Killing Floor 2 also has a free weekend going, and I've spent an hour more in that than I have on this, purely because there was some enjoyment to be had. But for Evolve, I just don't see why you would buy it.\n\nYou download the game, get forced an obnoxious intro (I understand why it's there, but not why I can't quit it.) Still, 5 minutes later and I am in a game. I spawned as the AI in a current match and my character was getting pummeled by the 'Monster'. I spend the next 10 minutes watching the rest of them frantically run around before also meeting their fate to the monster. Apparently, just from reading some reviews, spawning as the dead guy happens a lot, which isn't good.\n\nI fired up a second game. I choose the default Soldier, hunter, whatever. The guy with the lightening gun. And, 10 minutes of the match, what are we doing? Following some footprints. I liked the atmosphere - that whole 'where is it? it could come out any second - but because we were following, we got the jump on him. Still get pummeled. COmpletely annihilated. Is the game really this badly balanced?\n\nI can't even remember if we did a third game. Must have because there was another Monster. Wraith, this time. Same thing happens - following, dying, but this time respawning. Yes, backup was en route, after another minute of an obnoxious 'lets not open the ship and jump out, lets just stand here crouched waiting for the hatch to jump out of opens. I feel like they caught an idea, and this thing whizzed through development. I really was expecting some, like, 'woah!' or 'hot damn!' moments from all the press coverage. Alas, seven months down the line, and it's already at 1/4 of the RRP. I kinda feel sorry for the developers - an attempted cash cow after getting too confident from the reception of L4D and L4D2. I think the Free Weekend and very, very cheap price is to inject a bigger playerbase into a dying game, but it looks like it went six feet under on release. Shame.\n\nA good example of how to do asymmetrical multiplayer is Depth - tension, speed, action - brilliant stuff. I'd say it's also well balanced, considering if you're bad as shark or diver you'll easily die. The content I'd say is slightly shallow - only a handful of maps - but in my books, it's written how to do asymmetrical. Evolve simply isn't it. A good shot, but it's not what you're looking for.","September 5, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

I had been interested in this game when it was released, but not at $60 and not with all the money grubbing DLC.  Playing it this free weekend confirmed that I made a good choice.  It was ruined for me by, in no particular order:\n\n1) Many of the weapons/tools were bland and similar.  They looked different, but felt the same or filled the same role in slighty different ways.  The ones that were different were usually terrible.\n2) Matchmaking was poor.  Stomp the monster in 30 seconds or be destroyed.  Didn't like that person?  Enjoy playing with them again because there is no one else.\n3) The time to get into a game is just out of control.  Wait for a player.  Wait for map to load.  Wait to pick role.  Wait to start match.  Wait to jump in and start playing.  It takes 3-4 minutes after the match fills to start playing.  Combine this with bad matchmaking and it is painful.\n4) Dialogue repeats constantly.  If you didn't know what a beret is you will.\n5) Random bugs.  Badges copied to everyone.  Party members randomly being kicked on load.  Nothing game breaking, but so far past release it lacks polish.\n6) lul Wraith.\n\nWhile the concept is cool, it plays like a beta and has the content of a bad free to play despite costing an uncomfortable amount of money (with DLC especially).

Set aside the longest waiting screens I have ever endured, waiting over 15 minutes just to join a game to get our asses handed to us, facing the monster is nearly impossible. Obviously as new players there is a learning curve so no we aren't the best at the game but the same should be true for the monster, yet it destroys us nearly every time. It's almost impossible to catch up with it by tracking it around the map (even with Daisy) and even if we do catch up to it and engage in battle, its too fast to even comprehend where it is or it just runs away. After it reaches stage 3 we set up shop at the power station and it just comes in and steamrolls us. It might be us but it sure as hell seems the monsters are way unbalanced.","September 5, 2015","false","5.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

I was really turned off by all the DLC and all the negative reviews and all that normal stuff that seems to be bothering people. This game goes on sale a lot, if you don't want to pay full price, just wait and it will go on sale. and the DLC isn't too expensive and you don't even need it to have a good time really. I started the game with none then slowly got it all.\n\nAs for gameplay actually goes I think the game is made really well. Being a monster is really fun. Sometimes it's easy because the hunters are bad, and sometimes it's hard becuase the hunters are good. Maps are pretty balanced and so are the hunters. Sometimes you will be hunted by a team that is a really good comp and you will lose and feel like they were to powerful, but that's kinda one of the point as hunters, to build a good team to hunt with, so that's just the game working or you not being good.\n\nAs the hunters the game can be frustrating, because if one hunter isn't preforming their role correctly, it really messes up the team. But it is still really fun. As long as you put in a bit of time to learn the maps, the monsters, and the hunters. Once you figure out things like that, which you can do in a solo mode that is just like the online mode but is easier cause the bots aren't very smart in this game, being a good hunter isn't hard. If you have trouble finding good teams, you should probably friend people that you play with that do well, so you can party up. And honestly if you think your team isn't doing well, you should just get a headset and talk to them, as long as you aren't a jerk, people will usually work together, which is what this game is about.\n\nthis isn't a game that you are going to turn on, and start winning, unless you are pretty smart and already understand most of the game mechanics. It takes a while to know the maps and know how to fight each monster. But that's the same for most shooter games. you start off bad not knowing anything, then you learn the maps and how you like to play.\n\nsome PROS:\nchallenging gameplay that takes skill to learn.\n\nSo many hunters and monsters have been released that most matches are very different.\n\nDifferent from almost every other online shooter.\n\nWhen the game goes on sale, being the monster is easy cause all the noob hunters.\n\nsome CONS:\nthe match making system is kinda annoying. hopefully they will update it someday.\n\nranking system is difficult to ascend.\n\nsometimes players are stupid and don't listen","December 25, 2015","true","265.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Evolve makes an entire game out of that concept, even allowing you to play as the monster. And it's competitively balanced!\n\nThe hunters all have jetpacks and infinite ammo, and have to hunt the monster before it can eat enough to stage up. By stage 2, the monster is said to be on equal ground. By stage 3, it turns into a generator defense where the mosnter hast he advantage. At this point, a good amount of teamwork is needed by the hunters to win. Tricky in public games, but very satisfying when you can finally take out the monster.\n\nAnd the game looks beautiful, being built on Cryengine. All of the plants and creatures in the game (some very hostile) fit seamlessly into the game world, making it easy to immerse yourself in.\n\nAnd the DLC hunter releases are very high quality. They look stunning, are really fun to play, and have a surprising amount of lore brought with each release as well.\n\nMost of people's complaints from release have basically been addressed. The only prominent issue right now is the size of the player base, making queue times for ranked extremely long. One can generally find a game pretty quickly in Quick Play, though.\n\nI would highly recommend buying this.

I was really turned off by all the DLC and all the negative reviews and all that normal stuff that seems to be bothering people. This game goes on sale a lot, if you don't want to pay full price, just wait and it will go on sale. and the DLC isn't too expensive and you don't even need it to have a good time really. I started the game with none then slowly got it all.\n\nAs for gameplay actually goes I think the game is made really well. Being a monster is really fun. Sometimes it's easy because the hunters are bad, and sometimes it's hard becuase the hunters are good. Maps are pretty balanced and so are the hunters. Sometimes you will be hunted by a team that is a really good comp and you will lose and feel like they were to powerful, but that's kinda one of the point as hunters, to build a good team to hunt with, so that's just the game working or you not being good.\n\nAs the hunters the game can be frustrating, because if one hunter isn't preforming their role correctly, it really messes up the team. But it is still really fun. As long as you put in a bit of time to learn the maps, the monsters, and the hunters. Once you figure out things like that, which you can do in a solo mode that is just like the online mode but is easier cause the bots aren't very smart in this game, being a good hunter isn't hard. If you have trouble finding good teams, you should probably friend people that you play with that do well, so you can party up. And honestly if you think your team isn't doing well, you should just get a headset and talk to them, as long as you aren't a jerk, people will usually work together, which is what this game is about.\n\nthis isn't a game that you are going to turn on, and start winning, unless you are pretty smart and already understand most of the game mechanics. It takes a while to know the maps and know how to fight each monster. But that's the same for most shooter games. you start off bad not knowing anything, then you learn the maps and how you like to play.\n\nsome PROS:\nchallenging gameplay that takes skill to learn.\n\nSo many hunters and monsters have been released that most matches are very different.\n\nDifferent from almost every other online shooter.\n\nWhen the game goes on sale, being the monster is easy cause all the noob hunters.\n\nsome CONS:\nthe match making system is kinda annoying. hopefully they will update it someday.\n\nranking system is difficult to ascend.\n\nsometimes players are stupid and don't listen","December 25, 2015","true","265.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Its one of those games in my opinion where you can boot it up, have a few games and happily log out.\n\nThe characters are fantastic and all have their own personality, I play the Medic class most of the time and all of them are unique in their playstyle. My favourites being Slim, Caira and the brand new one E.M.E.T (psycho robot that heals people? Yes please! XD)\nThe monsters are all very unique in playstyle and require tactic to get down. For example, do not expose yourself to a Wraith, otherwise she'll abduct you. Don't clump together against a Behemoth or Kraken, otherwise their AoEs will knock you all down.\n\nSure people are a bit miffed that they have to buy the new hunters, but IF you don't want to, then don't buy them its that simple. They do competitions pretty much every week to unlock unique (FREE) skins for your favourite hunter, or monster :D mine by far is the Voodoo Goliath (Goliath in black with skeletal patterns all over it looks neat!) that i achived by just playing one game (you don't even need to play the Goliath, just get in a game with one in it) and hit the Rock Throw at hunters. The same with hunter contests, you don't have to play the hunter that gets the skin, just have one on your team! I have so many for Maggie and I barely play her, but its awesome to see Daisy in different skins <3\n\nI would say the look of the game is very stunning. Fire effects especially :) The Wraiths teleportation trails look awesome and Kraken's lightning looks great too, even though it is a little strong, but that's my opinion of course.\nIf you're wanting a game that looks nice when played and just to casually play an extreme game of hide and seek, I would recommend this game :)\n\nAny of you wanna play?

I expected it to be really fun and interesing,\nand after playing for about 10 hours during the Free Weekend i can say that the game met my expectations almost perfectly!\n\nEvery match was exciting and fun. Despite the seemingly repetetive nature of the gameplay, every match felt different. Different characters really felt unique, and every monster had it's own feel as well. One match would feel like an exciting chase. Another would become a tence hunt where the hunters have no idea where the monster is, and the monster had an awesome stealth experience lurking around and confusing the hunters. Another match might burst into action in the first 2 minutes and become a long, continuous epic battle.\n\nIt's true that it's hard to actually find a match with people to play, but the reason for that is the overwhelming and often unjustified negative feedback on the game...\nEverything you read about the dlc pricing, for example, is as relevant to the base game's review as saying that the steak wasn't tasty because the icecream was too expensive...\n\nBut even if you don't find a multiplayer game, you can just as well play solo with bots, which have surprisingly good AI, that will 95% of the time act like an actual person, employing different tactics with different characters, and being more effective with those characters then the avarage person, creating a more interesting gameplay experience.\n\nIs it worth the full price? I think it does though you could always wait for it to be on sale.\n\nIs the dlc overpriced? Maybe, but you don't have to buy it. The base game has 15 unique characters (including the\nmonsters), that will probably give you 20-30 hours of enjoyment at least.\n\nAre there balancing issues? Maybe. I didn't notice and didn't care. I won some games and lost some games and it was fun.\n\nIs this game for everyone? Probably not. You should check some gameplay videos to see the variety and depth of the game and decide for yourself if you like it.\n\nOverall, i had fun with this game and want to play more, so i recommend it to you as well.","September 7, 2015","true","36.1"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","27","50","4","0"

So when it was on sale for steam I thought "why not?" Man was I wrong. After not playing the game for the last 4 months, I can say this game turned to complete crap! Here are the issues i've seen blow out of control since release (thus why its not worth playing).\n\n1. This game caters to the NON Monster players BADLY. What that means is if your new or re-starting out as the Monster, you're 600% hosed. Don't bother, you most likely won't get points either as the team is so overpowered these days you're trapped, slowed, damage lowered to nothing, immobilized, and destroyed while the oposing team has 120% mobility, health regen, shield regen, and lol endlessly for their kill. The only exeption to this rule is IF you grinded through weeks of miserably losing to max out a Monster. Then you have a chance, but only certain monsters. The rest are so underpowered these days they're a complete waste, or a 50/50 1 chance gimmick win (Kraken).\n\n2. If you're a NON Monster player you will enjoy it more. However, the online community has completely abandoned this game due to jaded monster players sabotaging teams in frustration/anger. Players sabotaging teams to help pad their "buddy's score" as a Monster, Trolling, or botting. Basically whats left of the community is either uber top tier elitists that will NEVER play with you or anyone not on their specific team, OR trolls, bots, & people sabotaging.\n\n3. A discraceful cash grab. Yeah you bought the game for 15.99 (60% off right now) but guess what? to play all of the other hunters & monsters you end up paying twice the price of the game for the DLC. So to get all the super fun characters, monsters, & weapons you will be paying a TON of money. Hope you REALLY enjoy playing just 4 monsters and a few hunters.\n\n4. If you can get past the first 3 issues AND you have a dedicated group of friends that will play with you (I.E 5 friends to play and 1 of you guys take turn rotating as the monster) if can still be fun. The game is actually fun, its just the horrible community right now, the unashamed cash grab to unlock content that should've been included or not sold at a 400% premium, and the horrible imbalanced catering towards Hunter players.","November 26, 2015","false","3.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarKastlez/recommended/273350/","DarKastlez","DarKastlez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarKastlez/","54 products in account","Hi,\n\nI'll explain the game as it is. You either hate it or love it.\nI am a FPS fan. I play CoD and I find (in my experience) that this game is way better that any multiplayer game I've played so far.\n\nLet me explain why.\n\n1) NO hacking or cheating, ever. Like period. This game is TurtleRock's baby and believe me, they want this to be the most fun game there is.\n\n2) The whole TurtleRock development team LISTENS to you. You don't like the game? Why don't all the haters out there just tell it to them directly on their forums: https://talk.turtlerockstudios.com/. Every issue you have in-game, may it be bugs, balance issues, they WANT to know. They post what they are currently working on and are more than eager to listen what you have to say.\n\n3) This is a game where you need to have SKILLS. I lost a couple of matches as the Monster, then I won a few. I do find that the more I play, the more I know how to deal with situations that increase my chance of winning. This is a game that really rewards you for being good and even has a leaderboard to show for it.\n\n4) Free skins. Wait, let me repeat that again, FREE SKINS. TurtleRock does (almost) every weekend a challenge where, if you complete the goal (either as a community or in person), you get the free skin added in-game.\n\nHonestly, the base game is all you need and most definetely will keep you playing for a long long time before you should even consider buying the extra DLC. This because people should wait with playing with the 4th and 5th tier hunters until they have more than enough experience to put them to good use. If you mad cause you lost, I challenge you to play the tutorial first under the time limit of 6 minutes and THEN start playing some SOLO games before going multiplayer.\n\nSUMMARY: This is for all the haters out there with 0.5h of gameplay bashing the game. Cosmetics cost too much? No worries, you get FREE skins when participating in Challenge Weekends. DLC cost too much? Really? The base game is all you need and if you find the price is still too high, just wait for a Steam sale. For the rest, this is such a good and diverse multiplayer game that deserves the praise that TurtleRock deserves. Try it, take your time to learn the mechanics and most importantly, enjoy it.","September 6, 2015","true","398.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

"nobody knows": roll credits.\noveral the game is great and does what it is supposed to do, but to pay full prize for this and also having to pay extra for the additional upcoming characters just hurts when the replay factor is so extremely low. (Then again, you can notice that turtle rock knew this, considering this huge amount of rushed dlc content that costs money)\n\nwhat the game needs right new is the following:\n-New, unique maps (which we can hope for in the upcoming free maps dlc)\n-New game modes: and not just some stupid sh*t like rescue or nest, bring is something fun. Like 4 hunters and 1 monsters vs 4 hunters and 1 monster\n-A CAMPAIGN: seriously, nothing is explained about these monsters in the game! nothing at all! and please do not claim in any way that evacuation is a campaign because it is not in any way. it is 5 game modes with some dumb cutscene's depending on who won. make something awesome, answer questions of the evolve universe, just try something ;(\n\nso in conclusion: Evolve is an extremely innovative and awesome idea that is simply incomplete.\n\nI do not recommend it for the moment, first wait for the new maps at the least to see how the game changes over time.\nStill a fun game to play, but it should have been free 2 play because it's just not worth the full prize right now.\n","February 24, 2015","false","50.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

As of 08April2015, it is $34.00 on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥\n\nI enjoy the game play, even the running around portion which other reviews may disagree with. Match making doesn't take very long and usually it is not a full party, however players are quick to join once the match starts  and matches typically end with a full party. Graphics are wonderful and the characters are fun.\n\nMy biggest complaint and the reasons I gave this a negative review are...\n1.) Current DLC content for new characters are $15 for the 4th monster and about $7 or $8 for each 4th tier hunter; I feel like what I currently purchased is all that I'll ever have for this game, and I'll never experience new hunters or monster game play. I will not buy these new characters unless they go for $2 on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which I don't expect for year. To me updates for new content will not happen\n\n2.) If you play in a party with a friend, you cannot be the monster unless you play in a custom game; this is to prevent players throwing the game to help level their friend's character or to help them in the leader boards. My friend and I do not play customs because there is no way to include other players except by invites - that leads us playing with bots, an extremely inferior mode for us compared to playing with real people. When playing with others in normal match making, it becomes boring only playing as the hunters and incredibly frustrating knowing that this game could be much more fun without this feature.\nThe game would deserve the 9/10 scores I see on the big name sites if these issues were fixed imo.","April 8, 2015","false","81.3"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

I played the game because I wanted fun, but since the patch you get thrown right in a Ranked system, with no chance of casual gaming. The Ranking System is now the Casual gaming. And serously, that's no fun at all.\n\nThe active player community is pretty low. Before the patch it was about 1000 active ingame players, after a statement in the forums alot of Ignorant people started jelling with: "Wait what, noob? It goes even beter with it". You are still wrong. Check the community-hub active ingame geograpfhy. Ther are just 500 active ingame players left.\n\nLet's make it clear. 500players # 4 Divisions : Unranked ; bronze ; Silver ; Gold # EU:West ; NA ; Australia ; South regions\n...\nYou got it? Right! The community splittet up through the ranked, and it takes now more than 500% than before, finding a match. Just because he trys to search for same strong players... that sucks. Also you only find players in you region, I never not connected with an Australian or NA players through matchmaking. Only when I joined them casual through private lobby, but then the ping's was over 150+ and that sucks.\n\nNext are prizes and baits.\nYou pay 30€ for the normal game, it's fine at all, but when you get forward and enjoy you stay, you want more. And you pay for a season 20€ up to 25€ more. And all you get most of the time is a Season that isn't done yet, but you pay already 25€ for content that is done next year first. And then Season 3 starts, and all starts over again, they take another 25€ for "easy - slow - overprized" content.\nThey baiting players every week with Community challenges like: "Play on this weekend as community 100.000" matches, or other ridiculous challenges. And all you get is a useless skin for a Hunter. And remember, when you dont win the challenge, it was useless. They bait players to force to play on the weekend to win it, because you have to play at least one match to even win the skin then.\nBut you can also buy skins too, but previously 5€ - 8€ now 3€ - 6€ for a weapon pack is too overprized, because nobody looks at them. Monster skins are more worth, because they are the middle point, but they cost more than 50% than hunter weapon skins.\n\nTRS (TurtleRockStudios) focus very hard on ESL , MLG or other LEAGUE players, so I got very fast a competitive player.\nBut looking every week the Finals and the team named "Ninja Penguins" wins every time, getting bored too. Ther are only 3 - 4 top gear teams, the rest is just decoration for entertainment (no offense against the teams).\n\nBut TRS shall know, they can't lead a game just because of competitive players, they need to harmony with the community. But they don't will, they say alltimes... "Yea the community" "Yaya community" but serously, they give a ♥♥♥♥ about the community.","August 23, 2015","false","530.6"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","6"

Before I get into this review I will state that while I like the core concept of DLC it has been poorly implemented into games in the past few years, this game is no different.\n\nTL;DR- At it's best, this game is a blaze of glory and fun that maybe even rivals L4D's co op central idea. At it's worst though...It is a drab and has tedious stretches of nothing happening. This game went SUPER aggressive on the DLC front and while the dlc is currently harmless considering it's simply skins(Which are usually made AFTER the game is done and is waiting to be shipped, and the artists need something to do. A fact that many people forget)  It is just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid for the monsters to be priced at 15$ a pop, and hunters 7.50$ a pop. Buy this if it is on sale for sure, it really is worth 30$ to maybe even 35$ 60$ is just too hard to swallow. ♥♥♥♥ing great with friends, poor with solo.\n\nStory (5/10)\n\nChaos! A planet named Shear has become overrun with giant monsters and it is up to 12(currently) of the galaxies best hunters to help evacuate the planet of it's colonist. Nothing special here, no real plot really just a few back stories on each of the characters. Much like L4D and L4D2 in fact, only in those games there were writings on the wall and many conversations between the survivors to make the story seem fleshed out. This game lacks many of those boosters.\n\nGraphics (No rating)\n\nThe game looks good, then again it is not hard to make a game look good anymore, you have to TRY to make a game look bad now.\n\nGameplay (7/10)\n\nIt's fun! Mostly anyway. You can either play as one of the 12 hunters which divide up into 4 classes(3 per role) Trapper, who aptly traps the monster. Medic, who you know, heals the team, assault who does the most damage to the monster or the support who can do a multitude of things such as shield allies or bomb the living ♥♥♥♥ out of the monster with an orbital strike. Then there is also the famed monster role, you can either be the severely underpowered goliath who breathes fire and can't run away for ♥♥♥♥. The kraken, who reigns death from above while looking like the president of the Cthulu fan club. He seems to be the most balanced of the 3 monsters. Or the wraith, who will supernova your ♥♥♥ into next week. Below i will go into each class and monster in a bit more detail.\n\nAssault- As stated above, the main damage dealer of the group is this guy, He has a personal shield when he gets up close and personal and can very from having a gun that shoot lighting to a flamethrower. This class is pretty fun to play and as for the people who complain that they can't use the mines on the kraken, that is why you have Val Abe or Griffin, your team must be well prepared for ANYTHING.\n\nTrapper- My personal favorite class. This class can use harpoons or stasis grenades to impedes the monsters movement, they can bring down the thunderdome where the monster is forced to fight, and use medium damaging guns. The class is pretty well balanced and feels the newest out of all the class types.\n\nSupport- I honestly don't know how to describe this class because they do all sorts of ♥♥♥♥ and feel like the most versatile of the group. The class is okay i suppose. Hank's beard is magnificent.\n\nMedic- Do I really need to explain in detail what a medic does? THEY HEAL ♥♥♥♥. Minus Laz who just watches his team die so he can res spam.\n\nGoliath- Really underpowered, this monster is meant to be the "brawler" of the bunch but I always found myself getting stomped. Where the other two monsters can run away at stage 1 this guy CAN'T get away due to his slow movement. Stage 2 tends to solve this somewhat. His whole moveset should be able to do more damage, NONE of his moves feel like they pack a punch. This is a shame that even at level 3 he doesn't feel powerful because if they patched him he would probably be the funnest.\n\nKraken- My personal favorite. Certainly the most balanced of the bunch, between have mostly skillshot abillities that have good payoffs and the flying abillity he is certainly the most refreshing of the bunch\n\nWraith- SUPERNOVA ALL DAY EVERY DAY. Seriously though, after the post beta patch the wraith feels much more balanced and feels like a hit and run character now, they still have not justified taking abduction though. It just simply isn't as potent as decoy supernova and warp blast.\n\nOh wait, there are game modes too. Yea it's basic 4v1 and variations of 4v1.  Evacutaion adds refreshing things with map effects that depends on who wins.  It's fun but it will get stale fast unless they add some more FREE content.\n\nDLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T- there is something like 100$ worth of dlc already. ALREADY. Now while 95% of it is skins there is no way to unlock the skins in game which is kinda bull. there is also the 7.50$ per new hunter and the absolutely ludicrous pricing of 15$ for a single monster. 2K NEEDS to lower the pricing. Now one nice thing though is that even if you don't buy the monsters or hunters you can still fight them just not play as them. All maps and game modes will be free which is nice to.\n\nWhy the game will die in a few weeks- Simple, mod support. The main reason(or one of them) why L4D is still kicking around today is because of the insane mod support for the games and how much they freshing it up even with them being 5 years or older. Evolve, will not have this. The devs have stated that there will be no releasing of the engine to make maps and what not. this is not a good thing.","February 15, 2015","false","215.3"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","16","29","0","0"

It keeps the same multiplayer co-op "story driven" feel as L4D. Playing as the hunters requires a good amount of coordination or luck to effectively take down monsters while playing as a monster can be very rewarding when you beat down 4 hunters in an onlsaught of rock throws, lightning or many other special ablities. The game offers solo, multiplayer 4 vs bot monster (the bots are actually competent and can wreck face), or 4 players vs 1 player. Controls are handled very well in how the monsters or hunters move and operate, the only complaint I have is at times trying to climb something either hunter or monster can be hit or miss especially when depleted of stamina or jet pack fuel leaving you trapped in corners trying to avoid the enemy. Graphics look great as its built using the CryEngine so cranking up your settings can be very visually rewarding. Sounds are definitely great also ranging from the distance thumps of the monster, rushing water, birds, gun blasts, and etc. The most common complaint I've seen on the reviews have been from the price or DLC. The only one that applies to the actual review of the game is the DLC which is NOT day 1 DLC or hidden until release, they have specific dates further down the line which include other hunters, monsters and etc. If a player doesn't want to buy skins...which yes you have to pay for (they do run a business and to run a business you need someone to pay for your product even if people think its "mundane"). All in all I've been having a great experience either with friends or randoms, and if you are on the fence about this game check out review from gaming sites and I dont remember seeing anything below an 8. I also purchased the Master Race Edition as I felt for the game, dlc and other included stuff it would be welll worth it as I previously enjoyed the developer's games and you know this is going to be a heavly modded game just like L4D! All in all I would give this game a 9/10 with the faults being minor control "errors" and woutd like to see more varied environments such as urban, deserts, plains, snow areas (does have small areas with snow). See you in the forest and Happy Hunting!","February 17, 2015","true","96.6"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","18","33","0","0"

Here is a list of reasons why I LOVE the game, and a list of reasons why I HATE the game:\n\nLove:\n-Insanely good graphics\n-The concept is original\n-Playing as the monster OR the hunters, awesome\n-You can play with, or against your friends\n-Create your own custom game with friends, do solo, with a partner, etc.\n-Character Commentary is funny and highly interesting\n-The wild life can make or break a match\n-Wraith's abduction: Awesome\n-The 3 stars for each character for each item takes a long time. Makes you play it more. I like that about the game.\n\nHate:\n-Jet Pack is a joke. The Jet Pack was actually better in the Alpha and Beta than in the actual game\n-So many things are over-powered (Example: Wraith's Clone, The Kraken, Minions, etc)\n-Speaking of minions, they have automatic targeting (it feels like) for rock throw. Nearly impossible to dodge. Also, they go after the medic first, ALWAYS.\n-The A.I. in Rescue is a joke. They often times take the loooooong way around, or they won't stand by the extraction point\n-The Wraith and Kraken in Rescue almost ALWAYS win, because the survivors are always placed the furthest distance from you, with little chance for you to successfully save them; especially since Lazarus isn't able to revive them after they die\n-Basically, Rescue is completely broken. Good concept, poor execution\n-The "stikes" you receive after you are revived from being knocked down are ridiculous. Once the monster hits stage 3, and you have 2 strikes, you survive MAYBE one hit. What's the point? Might as well give up if your whole team has strikes. Lazarus is the ONLY medic that is able to remove strikes, but you have to go down or die completely first.\n-Speaking of Lazarus, he really has little advantage to him. His Lazarus device takes too long to recharge, and his cloak lasts maybe a tenth of the length of the Support's cloak. Also, if you're lit on fire by the Goliath, as Lazarus, the cloak doesn't do you any good regardless.\n-Daisy is only good for tracking and reviving. She does NOTHING to aggressive wild life, nor does she assist you against the monster. Although, in the game, her species attack you. This makes NO sense.\n-Bucket is highly under-powered. He is the least effective character in the game. He is really only good for Nest. His rockets do very little damage.\n-Abe's stasis grenades have little to no effect on the wraith, since the wraith can warp straight through them.\n-Griffin's harpoon only stops the creature until it breaks free. All other traps either drastically slow down the monster, or bring them to earth. The harpoon should be able to bring down the monster, especially Kraken.\n-Hyde's toxic grenades slow your run speed down drastically. Why? What's the logic?\n-Kraken's Lightening Strike has WAY too wide of a radius. I have been a good amount of distance away, and still have 25% of my health reduced. It's a lightening strike, why is there so much damage outside the point of impact?\n-Kraken's Aftershock serves very little purpose. No hunter will go near the Kraken, so why does the Kraken require a close-up attack? Besides, the radius of the after shock is extremely small to be effective; it isn't hard to get away from, nor does it do much damage\n-The game crashes at least once every time I start it up\n-The game window minimizes in the middle of battles. EXTREMELY frustrating\n-I never had an issue with Steam disconnecting so much, until Evolve came out\n-The Skins are incredibly expensive, and are not very appealing for hunters\n-Speaking of skins, the Hunter's skins are only on the weapons. It's boring, you never look at the weapons! Why not change the look of the characters, like you do with the monsters? A lot of missed logic in this game, and missed opportunities\n-The game was rushed to be released, that's all you can say about it\n-There were 3 events for P.C. for the game to be tested and have ample feedback. It feels like the feedback went straight into the recycling bin.\n-Game freezes, sometimes, after Evacuation is over\n-Level 40 is way too easy to achieve; therefore, evacuation feels half as interesting once you reach level 40.\n-You can't play just rescue, nest, or defend like you can with hunt on PVP\n-In the opening trailer of the game, you can't sit in mid-air with your jetpack like you do in the opening sequence, nor can do you those fun maneauvers.\n-The pounce from the monster can get you from mid air, or even if you're not directly in front of it. It's easier to pounce a hunter than it is to pounce wild life\n-You cannot vote to kick players out of your lobby for a game.\n-When you drop back into the battle area, from the drop ship after dying, it takes FOREVER. By this time, the monster has enough time to eat, evolve, and eat more; OR the monster has time to do whatever it wants, including kill the other hunters. You would think that you would hurry up to try and save your fellow hunters. Instead, they casually sit in the drop ship, waiting to drop. The bay doors casually open.\n-The monster can "rage quit" a game if they appear to be losing, not costing them an actual loss. This is unfair on the leaderboards, as the monster is not subject to a loss via leaving mid game. Same with hunters.\n-Weapons are not modifiable: You can't add scopes, attachments, etc.\n-In the hints, it is mentioned that the weapons are so advanced, that they reload themselves if you switch to another item. Yet, the jetpack barely gives you any fuel, nor can you actually just sit in mid air. Speaking of which, when you're getting attacked by the monster, it is nearly impossible to jetback up a cliff because the delay is way too long. Also, climbing a cliff doesn't always guarantee you will successfully get to the top without fuel, like the game specifically states you can do. Overall, the jetpack is the ONE thing that needs to be fixed above all other things.","March 8, 2015","true","258.4"," 41 of 78 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","41","78","3","3"

First, I really liked this game. Second, I will not be purchasing it. In the time I've tried this game for the free weekend, I've had a great time. It suffers from all the things any game with online features suffers from; abhorent online community, annoying voice chat system that does more harm than good, and not so cooperative coop system. But those things generally were few and far in between. When things went right, and they often did, the game was amazing. The vast array of diverse options in terms of classes to pick from is amazing. And even within those classes for the Hunters, each class has a up to 5 unique characters with abilities unique for that character and class combination, making the different team combinations a very fluid and unque experience. Mind you, there are some combinations that are rather obviously better than others for certain situations. Bucket's Support ability to lay down turrets for example is amazing for defense games, but no so great for hunting.\n\nAll that aside, I still won't be buying the game, because all those great aspects of the game I just described like the diverse roster and combinations of classes are not readily available in the full game. They've been sectioned off as separately paid content. Mind you, I'm still recommending this game because it is still an all around solid game. But I'm certainly not going to pay $80 full price to condone the marketing practice of splitting content that should have came with a game to begin with.\n\nBut if money is no issue for you, and a company's business practices are of no consequence to your conscience, then look no further.

And the odds of getting that kind of teamwork with 3 other random players is pretty low. Couple that with a brutal learning curve no matter what hunter/monster you're playing as, and you can expect to lose a LOT during your first 8+ hours of play. For me, there just wasn't enough reward, enough fun factor to balance how punishing it was to get into. I bought the all-inclusive package at a deeply discounted price during a steam sale (circumventing the MASSIVE issue I had with this game in regard to day 1 dlc and the blatant money-grab that was going on at launch) and I still regret my purchase.

Now for a moment, close your eyes and forget about all the DLC's they have put out in the first week of it's release (Let's stop the Hate for a second). Now my review is based solely on the Base game that they have released.\n\nLet's be honest - The idea when it was first shown really interested me and I am definitely sure that like me, many gamers were waiting for this game eagerly. I for one constantly kept tracking the Game's news, video reveals of the monsters, gameplays shown at game conferences. It really got me hyped, plus I was happy that Turtle Rock Studios got a good Game at their hands - A game which was getting positive reviews. Now that the game released, what's my reaction? Read on to know.\n\nGAME MODES - [8.5/10] Evacuation, Hunt, Rescue, Nest and Defend <- Individually all these game modes are fun, at least for me it was fun and I am enjoying it. Hunt - The Hunters must kill the Monster before it can destroy the power relay located in the map. The Monster must reach stage 3 in order to destroy the relay, though it can also opt to kill all of the Hunters. Nest - Six Monster eggs are located in random locations on the map. The Monster must protect them from the Hunters for 18 minutes, and can hatch one of the eggs to spawn a minion to help it. The Hunters must destroy all six eggs, as well as any minions, within the time limit to win. Rescue - Injured colonists trying to escape the Monsters are placed randomly on the map. Hunters need to locate, revive and protect them as they make their escape. The monster needs to kill as many of these colonists as possible and keep them from getting away. Whoever saves—or kills—five colonists first wins. Defend - A starship's refueling station comes under the assault of a player-controlled fully evolved monster and smaller Goliath minions. The hunters must stop the monster from causing a catastrophic accident by protecting the power generators until the ship is fully powered, while the monster must destroy two generators to reach the ship's power source. These are the 4 Base game modes available in the game and Evacuation is an interesting concept which boasts about having more than 800,000 different outcomes - Evacuation is a short Campaign style game where all these 4 game modes may be included. Average time for an Evacuation campaign is around 45-60 mins.\n\nGAMEPLAY - [8.5/10] I will keep the Game Play part short as it is quite easy to get a hold off. Once you go through the tutorial and watch the videos provided, you will be ready to tackle the game head on. Controls are okay, controlling the hunters feels like the usual FPS style and controlling the monster is a whole different ball game but it is quite fun in the end.\n\nSTORY - [6/10] Who said the game had any story? jokes aside, Evolve is set on Shear, a distant planet located in the "Far Arm" of space, that humanity has traveled to in the distant future. The established colonies, considered the most valuable in this region of space, are soon attacked by malevolent alien Monsters (Where did I hear this before?). As the Monsters destroy the colonies on Shear, a former planet tamer named William Cabot is brought out of retirement to deal with the threat, in order to evacuate the remaining colonists from Shear. In response, Cabot assembles a team of Hunters—consisting of war veterans, psychopaths, professionals, and expendables—to eliminate the Monsters, setting the main conflict of Evolve\n\nSOUND - [9/10] The Ambient sound is beautiful - the environment really gets you in. The Voice acting has been done pretty good and it really makes you care a little about the characters that you are playing. (You usually hear them talking throughout the game and usually at the start - it's quite neat). Now the Monster part - When it Roars and it keeps running around in the distance, an uncertain fear gets inside your heart - you wait in uncertainty as to when you're gonna find him. Whether you will win or die? If he gets to Stage 3, than find a place to die :) No seriously.\n\nMULTIPLAYER - [?/10] This Review will be updated shortly, specially the Multiplayer part - I need to play a little bit more to decide what verdict I have on the Multiplayer part of this game. Stay Tuned.\n\nDLC - [?/10] I will update this part along with the Multiplayer part. So Stay tuned and read the Base Game review.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION - [7.5/10] Now I am not sure if I should recommend it but it is something you must decide, I don't regret getting this game as I am quite enjoying this and I am thinking of getting the Season Pass as well. It's a great game that you can play with your friends but don't think that this game will keep you interested in the long run unless of course - they keep adding new Game Modes, Hunters & Monsters.\n\nSIDE NOTE (FOR FUN) - Invite 3 friends and 1 Frenemy. Let the 3 of you be the hunter including yourself and let the frenemy be the monster and than have fun killing him x) (Now which frenemy should I invite over today)","February 16, 2015","true","47.8"," 71 of 137 people (52%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","52","71","137","8","5"

And it will kill your entire hunter team off by the time it even gets to stage 2. (less than 8 minutes)\n\nThe matches vary by player skill and motivation. If even one person isn't playing or backs out, the entire game becomes broken and one sided. This is a horrid game mechanic flaw and it is not worth 60$ for the amount of frustration (a game that is made to entertain you) gives.\n\n1-20 games will be interesting and worth your while. (This means that everyone is at fair skill level and nobdy leaves the match) Timewise; you will spend on average playing 400 minutes and only 20 mintues will be a balanced and potentially enjoyable game. I have spent many hours trying to make this a game I can be content with, every one of my "friends" has stopped playing due to the reasons I've stated. That is roughly 12 players I knew that moved on to something else before rank 25.\n\nBoring as hell, also this game is riddled with micro transactions. Wraith is OP (one of the in-game monsters) Unabalnced and a grindfest without any inticing gameplay mechanics. Jetspacks for the Hunters are a tidious component in movement; especially when coming from a game like Titanfall. This game is worth about 15$ and that is it. Do not buy at full price, you will be disapointed in the long run.","May 10, 2015","false","113.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's for you to decide. Can I recommend this game? Unfortunately, I cannot.\n\nSome Goodies:\nImpressive art.\nDiverse dialogue depending on party selection and other situations.\nDifferent game play in a 4 v 1 setting.\nA whole slew of pallets and backgrounds for the badges to customize your profile.\n\nSome Issues:\nNo opportunity (even if a small one) to rejoin a disconnected game. Perhaps pausing the game briefly like in MOBAs like Dota or LOL.\nThe ranking system has no validity. People on the top with zero deaths/losses just leave the match if they are about to lose. Because of this really, being topped ranked means little to nothing.\nNo unranked matches for players to just play (and not against bots in solo). Plenty of games have this.\n\nSome facts:\nThe community is shrinking and shrinking. Price is the eliminating factor. The view count on twitch has decreased ever since the announcement that the game will be pay2play. It will cost gamers $15 a monster and for the new four hunters it is $25. Already it's $100. And it's still rising.  Sadly, I fear that the companies greed is going to make this already small community diminish.\n\n\nSome Opinions:\nSpawn locations for wildlife appears to be static. If it were randomized it would change every match.\n\nThe disregard for the ranking system by the developers is just dumb. Other games have safeguards to prevent this. A simple safeguard so that disconnecting counts as a loss/death would help. Though I do think there should be more to the ranking system, as the players you face are random.\n\nIt is my hope that the developers absorb the criticism from those who want to make this game better and more accessible.","February 23, 2015","false","169.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In my last 2 sessions, 2 months apart, playing 5 games in each setting, I was forced to play as the monster 9 of the 10 times, with the monster as the least preference.  Apparently, there is a major shortage in monster players, and at the VERY LEAST, this should be changed to where Hunter-Preferred players are not forced to play as the Monster, and empty monster spots are filled with A.I.  All of my steam friends that bought Evolve have quit for this sole reason.  Secondly, after the massive failure to gain/retain players, your first major content update is arena mode.  Seriously?  You take the least popular element of the game and make it a "feature".  Hunter Class is now useless, and any potential excitement is squashed upon playing a few games, leaving many changing back to the standard hunt mode.  Add a NEW feature, not a re-hash of an existing one.  An 8 Hunter vs 2 Monster CTF would have been more fun than arena mode!

With that out of the way, I'd like to say I really, really enjoy Evolve. It's a unique concept that has great gameplay and team mechanics for the Hunters and useful tools for survival as the Monster.\n\nPros:\n\nGameplay: B+ This game is a lot of fun with friends and also playing solo. You can't play online leaderboards as the Monster if you are with friends, but that's okay since people would just boost themselves to the top of the leaderboards. Very well thought out characters and unique abilities to choose from.\n\nTeamwork: B- (A+ with the right team, but we'll get to that)\n\nMonster Playability/Replayability: C+(also will get to this later)\n\nGraphics: A (I use low settings and I'm still satisfied)\n\nDiversity of Levels: A+ Every map/level has the feel of being an alien planet yet each level has a signficicant difference from the rest.\n\nCons:\n\nSingleplayer Campaign: F----        There is no singleplayer campaign that is different from the multiplayer aspect of the game. (F is for "For real, Turtle Rock?")\n\nMonster Playability/Replayability: C+ I play mainly as the Hunters because I tend to stay with friends. This is not a problem. The problem is that the majority of Monsters we fight are either Wraith or Meteor Goliath. Wraith is a sneaky little prick that is so overplayed it isn't even fun (also, they are just annoying to play against; seriously, any noob could pick up a Wraith and do half decent against a decent team). Meteor Goliath is also overplayed because it has all the same basic attributes of the vanilla Goliath and on top of that lights everyone on fire with every ability, which the original Goliath can only do with Fire Breath*. *Edit: Meteor Goliath has an increased cooldown time so he can't use his abilities as often? Don't quote me on that, just something I heard.* I could whine about Wraith and Meteor Goliath for a decade, but I will say that the Goliath, Kraken, and Behemoth are very fun to play as and play against. Turtle Rock has done a great job balancing those Monsters.\n\nLeaderboards: D-\nI can't really convey the WTF factor through an explanation, so I will make an example.\nI am a "Bronze Destroyer" according to the leaderboards. I am the top tier of the lowest (I think) league. How come, Turtle Rock, when I win against a Silver Skilled (one higher than my rank, but damn near impossible to get to) I only receive about 6 rank up points, yet when I lose to a Silver Skilled I get -38 rank points?! Using that example there, it would take me approximately SIX VICTORIES to make up for JUST ONE LOSS! This is very difficult to attain at Bronze League because this is when we get stuck with all the noobs that DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME... Please give the people with skill a little bit more umph to the their victories. A lack of this just creates a vicious cycle of 4 wins in a row and one loss sets you behind where you were.\n\nThank you for reading :) questions and comments will be answered below. Also, this review is expected to change as the game progresses.","September 23, 2015","true","15.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Wraith also has a bit lower health to balance out its escape and damage.   Also once you get to stage 3 with any monster, you are really hard to kill, not just with wraith.\n\nso yeh, super fun game not pay to win,  but it is not one payment for all content which is why the need to reduce the game price, or have everything unlocked with one purchase.  if you are willing to deal with the money, then this game will reward you with an amazing experience like no other","September 7, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Each player fully into their class, and supporting each other. It's really the players that make the game.\n\nOr when you are a monster, and provided you don't get caught near the edge of the map it can also be really tense and exciting. The same heart pumping thrill you get from playing Alien Isolation, when you are running to save your life.\nAnd the power, when you are fully evolved is great. Although you never really feel  empowered like you do in say the game "prototype". I guess it's a kind of lack of connection between the monster and the hunters during combat. You never really feel like you are throwing them around like toys. You just keep plugging away until their health bars reach zero.\n\nBut when it's bad... it's horrid.\nWaiting,... waiting waiting for a game. Waiting for fellow players. Waiting for the three countdowns before you can play again. Seriously. Countdown at the end of the game. Wait for players to rejoin. Countdown to selection of classes. Countdown to selection of character in your class.... Then waiting for loading, then waiting for the terrible unnecessaryily sweary cutscene to finish. There are more countdowns than the tv show of the same name.\n\nThen, you start the game only for one of your team to quit, or the monster to quit, leaving you facing all those countdowns again.\nAnd if you get an incoherent team, that splits up, or doesn't communicate, you get torn to pieces, and it's back to that waiting again.\nAnd as the monster, it is a bit lonely to be honest.\n\nI think it's worth it. I enjoyed playing the free weekend. I didn't want to stop when I was in a good team, it was addictive.\nBut I'm looking at it now, now that the free weekend is over, and Im wondering how empty the severs will be, and what the waiting time will be like. And I'm still wondering whether it is worth buying, even at 50% off. After all, I have seen everything within a few hours of play. Only the cameraderie of your team and the tactics of the human monster can save it in terms of re-play value.\n\nAnd then there is my pet hate, health bars. Grrr. I hate health bars. Seriously. Can't we have a damage model for the monster that is different from health bars. Like a limp? Like a severred arm? Damage to individual limbs. Maybe bleeding. I'd love to see it working like the Kaiju from the film pacific rim neon blood spirting everywhere, rather than damn health bars.\nAnd the same goes for the hunters. Shields and health bars. Grrr. I think we should move on from mechanics that are 20+ years old. We need them, because we can't visually tell what condition we are in. Despite the 46Gb of data that went into this game.

The extremely low population of this game will ♥♥♥♥ you off too.  When half the matches are overseas your ping will be 150-300.  Lag always favors the hunters, so if you’re the monster your dead.  Multiple massive hits, no damage.  It makes this game totally worthless.\n\nJust an FYI buying the most expensive one does not give you everything unlocked like it shows in steam.  EA will screw you and not unlock some stuff because their EA page has some fine print that IS NOT on steam.  So take your money and spend it on coke and hookers, it would be a much better option.\n","July 28, 2015","false","82.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"
