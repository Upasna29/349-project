I saw some fantasy characters, and "free to play" and figured it would be worth at least an attempt.  Here's what happened.\n\nTried to login for a few hours - finally did\nThree classes if you can call them that.  Splinter Cell looking guy seems cool\nEntered a city with half English half German wording everywhere.\nClick the treasure chest in the bottom right to enter a menu.  Hit esc, game crash.  Excusable.. its EA right?\n\nLogin again\nNo access for a few more hours\n\nGet in again.\nHave to remake character.. ok?\nI find a "dungeon" or rather a "field" with some enemies.\nMy game lags but my movement/dmg doesn't.\nAt this point I realize that everything is clientside.\n\nFire up CE to check what vulnerabilities there are.\n\nEdit XP to level up?  Works\nEdit speed to speedhack?  Works\nEdit currency to goldhack?  Works\n\nOk, now that I know this game is fatally flawed, I might as well fight a little bit.\n\nkilled about 10 enemies.  The game says "killed them" and warps me to town at what\npoint I have lost 1000xp.  Beautiful.\n\nI click the sword/shield in the corner to try PvP.  Granted, there is nobody else in the game.\n\nI join blue team and drop into a zone.  I walk up the wall and out of the map.\n\nI thank the free to play gods that I didn't pay a cent for this game, say goodbye via chat to nobody and ALT-F4.\n\nI suggest that you spend 10-15 minutes with a good cup of coffee and maybe petting the dog instead of playing Garlock Online.","May 31","false","5.1"," 78 of 80 people (98%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","98","78","80","25","0"

ESC does the trick.\nHitting 'ESC' brings up a popup shortly (like 2 seconds), so you can't access neither the options nor the disconnect button.\nHitting 'M' trying to open the map just brings up a small picture saving 'PvP' and then it tries to load something but game crashes\nEven if you chose to play in German, the short help still is in English.\nUnbelievable amount of grammar and spelling mistakes\nIngame button of the community link to the forum (or wherever) directs you to www.garlock-online.com which isn't registered anymore.\nOh, and don't forget those WAY overpriced DLCs!\n\nAfter the 3rd crash I didn't bother to restart the game and will wait for some patches.\n\nStrange thing is that the game mostly seems to consist of store bough unity assets and still the jokster claims copyright on the game, not mentioning those assets made by other people.\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/5806\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/8000\n\nObviously he missed some legal lessons too trying to become a businessman as the initial EULA was a joke and after advising him to have it checked by an expert he changed it to the present EULA (IMO still a joke but IANAL).\nOf course, after pointing out a few more mismatches my posts were deleted and he banned me even I could prove my points.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/mUU0N\n\nSo this dev seems like he wants to silence negative critics.","May 30","false","0.4"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","36","42","4","6"

This game will tug at your heart strings when it presents fascinating quests such as 'Get cake from dealer' and follows it up with 'Find flowers' but the high point of it really is when you finally discover an empty dungeon that reminds you of your fathers disappointment in everything you have ever done.","June 2","true","0.6"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","50","16","32","30","1"

It was a classic! I liked the part where I got stuck in a PVP hellhole and couldn't see textures. The stolen Nukacola machine was a nice touch too.  10/10 Would be a cybot ranger again.","June 2","true","0.6"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","27","4","15","4","0"
