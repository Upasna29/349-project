I say runner, because even though you're riding a skateboard, you can't stop. You're always moving to the right. Its an original take on the genre and a fresh skateboarder. I'm not sure this game is for everyone because of the genre and control scheme.\n\nThe goal is simple, make it to the end of each level without falling off your board. You'll grind, jump and ride your board to the end. Just you. Getting to the end unlocks the next level. Each career level has five optional goals. Things like get X score or X combo. Jump gaps, collect spray cans, do a kick flip, only use one push or grind everything that needs girding. When you accomplish all five goals in an amateur level, it unlocks a pro level. Not only do the goals keep you in the relatively short levels, but you're rewarded for playing completing them. Outside of the career half of the game there is a "spot" half, with 25 more armature levels. These spots require you to do one long trick combination to the end of the level. There are 25 pro spot levels to compliment the amateurs.\n\nThe challenge isn't avoiding obstacles, its the unique control scheme. To get speed, you need to push with the simple tap of a button. Two taps gets you up to top speed. Now for the tricky part. Instead of having a jump button, you use the analog stick to hold in one direction to charge the jump and release. So you flick the stick to jump. The direction you flick the stick determines the trick in the jump. There is a trictionary if you're looking for a specific trip, but I don't think it matters what trick you do. Your momentum determines the distance of the jump. You can even do quarter circles, half circles and so on to perform bigger tricks. Its elegant and simple yet complex and difficult to time because of how unique it is.\n\nWhen you are about to land the jump, you need to hit the land button, which is the same as the push button. If you don't push the land button, you'll land a "sloppy" which briefly stuns your rider by making him unbalanced. Getting stunned makes you vulnerable to falling off your board because you can't jump. Hitting obstacles or falling down a flight of stairs sends your rider tumbling a comical distance. In a way its a funny bit to tell you that you've failed, but in another way its a time wasting punishment. There are several grades to your landing depending how close to the ground you hit the button. A sloppy landing can make 20 trick combination worthless for point value. The grade of your landing not only determines the score you get for the combination, but it changes your momentum. A sloppy landing slows you down while a perfect landing will make you speed up.\n\nOutside of pushes, jumps and landings, there are grinds and twists. Twisting in air requires you to hold the button before you jump so your rider gets into position. I didn't find these necessary, but if you want a bigger score, you'll twist like its the 1950s. Twists are true risks and rewards, because you can fail the level if you mess up. Grinds are much easier. If there's a wall, railing or rooftop, just push the analog stick and hold it. Releasing it makes the rider jump as he normally would. Getting big combos relies on your ability to grind. Like with landings, you can score perfect grinds too, depending on how late you time your grind. Some of the later levels rely on your ability to make perfect grinds, because they keep your momentum going. Just know this is what you're getting yourself into.\n\nThere is an easy to use, optional tutorial that explains all the controls. Everything gets explained one by one before the game makes you do them.\n\nThere are five themes in OlliOlli each has its own color pallet. A grey urban, a brown pallet junkyard, a blue port, a snowy white base reminiscent of Rush'n Attack and finally the bright neon city. They are all beautiful, but they go by in an unnoticeable blur. I couldn't pay attention to anything other than was there a grind or a landing coming? As the levels get higher, the challenge grows. The base has safe pavement to land on, but a lot of it is snow that sends you tumbling. Its fun to grind over helicopter blades and statues instead of simple railings and walls. Neon city is mostly rooftops and railings to grind on, because the ground is either pink spikes or wide stairways.\n\nTo keep you in the game there are daily challenges that let you practice as much as you want, but you only have one real attempt. Each level has its own leader boards after every attempt.  The game keeps track of your high score of each level and your best trick combination for that run. Truth be told, the game did freeze and twice crash in four hours after some completed runs. I assume because it was loading leader board standings and couldn't.\n\nThe soundtrack is also a real standout. The lo fi electronic beats fit the art style. For the most part it felt like all mellow songs, but there is an eclectic mix of tunes. No matter what the beat, nothing got in the way and just added to the feeling of zoning out that I had while playing. The game became all timing with no thought. I just knew from playing that was the millisecond I needed to do something. After spending 20 - 30 minutes on some of the later levels of the amateur career, I could might be able to do them blindfolded.\n\nIn the future I'd like to see different riders to unlock. Not that the rider was anything bad, but it was just him for the 4 hours I played. I am thankful for him having a red hat, otherwise he may have gotten lost in the blur of the background.\n\nIn conclusion, its a fantastic presentation and a test of skill, but I'm not sure how fun the game actually is. I found my mind not as engaged as my reflexes were. I wasn't having any joy going through the motions. Although I did get a few laughs seeing my rider tumble down flights of staircases and seeing just how many meters he could go. Its still a good game, but after going through the armature career and spots, I'm just not that willing to unlock all the pro levels.","February 2, 2015","true","4.6"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

This learning curve might also be tough for some players, because it involves practicing many combos (flick movement on the left stick) and learning which of them score bigger than others. But this is really the key to high scores, know what to do, with enough variety and safety (and just doing ollies all along a level is not half the fun)\n\nOn the downside, the Vita sticks are perfect for this game, small and short so flicks are super fast todo. While on the Xbox360 controller, the physical movement is longer (so slower to perform), and in my case as it is wireless it adds some lag, so have to press buttons earlier than on the Vita.\n","July 24, 2014","true","25.7"," 35 of 46 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","35","46","0","0"

I haven't tried playing with my keyboard, but with the controller you use your analog stick to do tricks, so it involves a lot of spinning it around in multiple ways and pressing buttons along to do all the complex stunts you need without really having to think too much about it. Simple to learn, challenging (in a fun way!) to master, as it offers a fulfilling variety of stunts of different levels that you can perform.\n\nIs this another one of those endless running / distance games?It involves distance, but it isn't endless. The game is comprised of "stages" with a number of goals you can accomplish in each of those. Each stage has a certain distance, to go to the next one, usually all you need to do is finish the stage in one piece. However, you also have the option of completing one or more of those multiple goals that each stage offers. Completing all goals in a level unlocks a new difficulty of that level, with even more challenges. So it's a bit different of the boring endless distance games that have been crowding the game market lately.\n\nIs there a story?Sorry, not really, but even though I love games with stories, I didn't miss in this case because the game mechanics keep you hooked init. It's actually very easy to completely forget about your goals even, just because you got so excited that you got like 10 perfects in a row and you want to see how far you can go.\n\nWhat else can you say about this game?As you're playing, you learn with your mistakes, so even when you fail it doesn't get frustrating, because you get that feeling that in just a few more tries you'll get it right. Some times you'll have to stop doing the stunts you tend to overuse, and pull different strategies and combos to get the objects in the field that you need to collect to complete a challenge. There's also a big variety of stunts you can perform, as well as the techniques you need to develop to get perfect landings, nosegrinds, to get better speed without having to put your foot on the ground to push your skate faster, etc.\n\nYeah, it's a casual game, but I tell you, it's addictive. (I just spent 2 hours playing it nonstop, and had to stop myself because I had work to do, otherwise I would've kept going - even just writing this review makes me want to go back and play it a bit more!) My only sadness so far? I wish it had more steam achievs, I feel like this game has a lot of cool achievement possibilities, but sadly that wasn't well explored. At least we get cool in-game coals to achieve, though!","November 1, 2014","true","1.9"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

There are many ways I can fall off that board, and I imagine all of them have to do with something like falling onto a turd or a water hydrant or onto a set of figurines that are participating in a heated battle of Warhammer 40,000 on the sidewalk, where I will pierce one of my internal organs on a Tyranid and have to explain to God when I get to the pearly gates why I am such an ultra-wuss.\n\nOlliOlli captures some of that terror because it has a difficulty curve that's steep as hell, like learning how to ride an actual skateboard. The tutorial could have been better (for some reason I couldn't actually figure out how to do Perfect Grinds until I just said '♥♥♥♥ this' and played an actual level, where I slowly figured it out on my own, but I think that's more of my blatant inattentiveness than the tutorial's fault), but the real learning experience is pretty much about getting better and faster at the game, and learning how to squeeze in more tricks between grinds for higher scores or for unlocking bigger, better levels. If you want to unlock those "Pro" levels, you gotta ♥♥♥♥ing earn your keep. Once you get in the groove of actually starting to pull off sweet moves and getting in the habit of varying what moves you pull off, the game opens up dramatically and challenges you even more.\n\nDespite OlliOlli's semi-'thrown in the deep end' type of tutorial, it gets its vibe right. The soundtrack is the perfect thing to grind to, and the controls are a bit finicky but the way they are built allows for effortless cool stunts between jumps. It looks cool and I bet you will not be called a nerd if you show people how you can do a 1080 Backside Flip-It to people on the bus without losing. It's Super Meat Boy hard - you will break your knees and ankles so many times before you can finally pull off that grind-flip-grind-twist-grind-perfect landing combo, and it will feel glorious. If you can beat all the Rad levels, I bet you can show someone at the interview for your next job and you will get that job.\n\nPersonally (oh no! Personally, the verboten word in video game reviews), I'm not a fan of these endless hardcore trek-up-Death-Mountain challenges, and OlliOlli didn't change my mind. But I like what it's doing enough to recommend it.","June 9, 2015","true","3.5"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","19","25","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/274250/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","OlliOlli strips trick-based skateboarding down to its most exhilarating, addicting elements.\n\nIt’s the practice and lead up to a perfect run; the repeated failure and experimentation over and over until finally you nail that perfect combo and the multipliers go crazy. OlliOlli takes that key moment and feeling that was pioneered, refined, and then beaten into the ground by Tony Hawk Pro-Skater, and removes all the fluff and needless bloat that began to weigh the series down the further it went on.\n\nSome of this is accomplished inherently by moving from a 3D sandbox to an always moving sidescroller, which immediately gives OlliOlli a great deal of originality. But developer Roll7 clearly knows and loves the games that built (and subsequently largely destroyed) the extreme sports genre, and borrows liberally the pieces that worked best from them to make a new, disturbingly addictive blend of mechanics.\n\nIt’s Tony Hawk’s eccentricity, Skate’s organic trick system, and a whole lot of intelligent endless runner progression design. Performing tricks is as simple as flicking the analogue stick, but having to time your landings adds a considerable amount of risk versus reward to performing longer tricks when your movement speed is largely out of your control and it’s not always easy to predict what’s going to meet you later on in the level.\n\nOlliOlli can be absurdly difficult at parts, but it’s a challenge that I always felt prepared for. The goals for each level gradually introduce new moves into your skillset, and then gave me the perfect area to learn them. There’s a feeling of constant growth as you clear each level and the gradually climbs to counteract it, but also an understanding that for some players certain challenges will be out of their reach. OlliOlli never forced me to clear a goal or spend more time on a certain level than I wanted to, but it was so successful at instilling confidence in my ability to overcome whatever it threw at me that I rarely had any desire to move on before showing the game how capable I was.\n\nI did eventually abandon some levels, surrendering that I wasn’t quite as skilled as I pretended to be, but unlike a lot of games my experience wasn’t tarnished in any way for doing so. OlliOlli seems designed from the ground up to be as much as you want to put into it, and providing an awesome time whatever that is. The short levels are perfect for picking off in small bursts, and the addition of a daily grind which changes daily and gives a you only one chance to hit your best score, gave even more reason to return to the game instead of trying to plow through it all at once.\n\nMy biggest frustration with OlliOlli actually doesn’t have anything to do with what’s here, but the disappointing absence of a convenient leaderboard. You can track your score and compare it with others in any level you choose, but instead of being prominently displayed it’s put on a separate screen completely removed from gameplay. For a game so perfectly designed for chasing high scores (you even unlock score focused “spots” after clearing each level once), having something like Geometry Wars 2’s immediate tracking of leaderboard positioning and your next score to beat would have been far more compelling a motivator for me to chase my friend’s best scores.\n\nThat may matter more or not at all depending on your feelings toward competing on leaderboards, but it’s at least telling that my only major issue with OlliOlli is in something it lacks (and even then, it’s more the implementation than complete absence of a feature). It’s a game so precisely tuned and refined that I found myself becoming lost for hours at a time repeating levels attempting to best my prior run. It gave me a sense of accomplishment and elation at expertly executing a sequence of tricks I haven’t felt in a decade, and reminded me why I’m so sad games of this nature were killed off by their own insistence on flooding the market and deluding themselves with features nobody wanted. OlliOlli suffers from none of that. It’s pure, sublime skating perfection.\n\nOn the PC version:\nWhile the PC version of OlliOlli is content complete to its Playstation 4 and Vita counterparts, the port has sadly suffered a great deal in the transition. I experience a significant amount of technical issues, from dropped frames, persistent slowdown, leaderboards crashing the game, and a generally lower level of responsiveness than a game so reliant on timing needs. It wasn’t so bad I was unable to enjoy the game or play it successfully, but if you have the ability to play it on another platform it might be advisable to do so.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 9, 2015","true","5.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Timing-based scoring system (Perfect! Sick! Sloppy! Sketchy!) makes for a solid "perfectionist" type of challenge, yet one not exactly punishing at early levels. Animations are pretty choppy and the character art (while often charming, such as the bails) is unrefined and downright ugly at times. Kickflips and heelflips for example, are visually indistinguishable, and for a 2D game, good sprite work and animation seems like a pretty important thing.

This is true-- but OlliOlli's difficulty is fair, fun, and rewarding. Landing tricks is legitimately difficult and feels great. After a few play sessions, you should really start to feel yourself improving.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple-- left analog stick to line up a trick, 'A' button to push against the ground or land the end of a trick combo. Tricks are controlled by the directions you push the left analog stick. Releasing the stick causes your character to jump in the air and attempt the trick. Sweeping the stick around in a circle will line up a more complicated trick, based on the distance and direction you sweeped it. The only way to get credit for a trick or a combo is to tap the 'A'button quickly just before you hit the ground. The closer to the ground, the better multiplier you get.\n\nOverall, the system is simple and rewards practice. Chaining together a long combo is quite difficult, and you'll have to chain some pretty ridiculous ones to complete all the objectives in each campaign level.\n\nSpeaking of levels-- the "Career" campaign has several "acts" with eight tracks each-- four easy, four hard. Each act has its own art style. There's also a "Spots" mode, where you get to execute precisely one combo before the level ends. Extending that combo gets you more points and a better spot on the leaderboards. The final game mode is the "Daily Grind." It provides a single randomly-generated track that you only get one chance to set a score on. So far, the Daily Grind I've tried has been quite hard.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys twitchy, timing-based platformers or arcadey, combo-centric skill games. Not for the weak of heart, but ultimately accessible to anyone with a gamepad and the will to improve.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the soundtrack is excellent.","July 24, 2014","true","5.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

If you like challenging games that get you try and re-try until perfection, this is it. The tricks are easy to start, but developing skill is an entirely different thing. This is a game where you're going to have to practice and become skilled at what you're doing, which is something I understood the moment I completed the tutorial and tried the first level. It's satisfying when you finally do what you wanted to do or clear the goal you've been trying to clear for the past several minutes. I definitely recommend a game pad with this, as it brings that EA Skate stick control to the game and you can get a better feel for doing the tricks. The music is fantastic. It's a nice blend of mellow Hip Hop (sampled or synth) and it helps take the edge off when playing.\nIf you like skateboarding, you'll like this. If you like challenge, you'll like this. If a rage quit is something you're fond of, you'll like this game.\n\nMy only hope is the developer considers adding character customization to the game.","July 22, 2014","true","4.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IStayPuft/recommended/274250/","IStayPuft","I Stay Puft","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IStayPuft/","552 products in account","OlliOlli is a 2d skateboarding game that bares similarities to the gameplay of now defunct developer Black Box skateboarding game "Skate". The basic control scheme is all there, you have your left analog stick quarter circles, full circles and point analog at said direction to pull off a variety of combo skateboarding tricks and grinds. Sure it doesn't have any of the crazy stunts of a Tony Hawk like 720 shove it-to -superman-heelflip-whatever but pulling off chain combo in OlliOlli has just the degree of difficult and requires just the amount of skill that pulling them off will give players an equal amount of gratification when done properly. Players progress in challenge latened levels where either collecting, pulling off x amount of combos, or reaching a certain amount of score will progress you to the next level and ultimately to more difficult challenges.\n\nWhen it comes to presentation OlliOlli 2d pixelated art style helps sets it apart from the more well known 3D skateboarding franchises by giving the game a indie feel very reminiscent of underground skateboarding back in the day. This feeling is reinforced by the music that not only helps set the tone but remind players the variety and diversity skateboarding is. There's a level of cool brought to this game simply by choosing these aesthetics.\n\nA few issues I had with this game was primarily on the mechanics side where the initial timing for the landing of tricks require players to press a button at the right time to pull it off perfectly. This window to press the button is fairly short and requires you to pay attention to how far your board is to the ground. This can prove an issue because like other 2d endless runners before it if you aren't paying attention to the screen correctly your character may blend into the background which can prove troublesome.  Failing to pull off the perfect landing on a trick can be the difference between getting 100k score on a perfectly run level to 20k score on a poorly runned one.\n\nOverall if you ever had an interest in skateboarding games or were interested in this game when it initally came out on Playstation Vita but didn't have the hardware to play it, I think this is a game worth picking up.","August 9, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Also, OlliOlli is a quite diffcult game, especially if you want to break some highscores. Everything is happening quite fast and if you're bailing you'll have to start again.\nAlso, you'll have to learn how the tricks are executed, because some challenges require certain tricks. OlliOlli will challenge your reactions and your hand-eye coordination!\nWhat I like about it is, that there are lots of different flip and grind tricks, but in my opinion they should have included grabs, lateflips, more grinds/slides and more fliptricks, because it still has space for more tricks and there are some buttons with no function (for example on the xbox 360 controller.) A gamepad is recommended! The leaderboard function and the daily grind feature makes this game highly replayable, although there aren't that much levels. But still, it will take some time if you want to beat all levels with 5 stars plus the pro levels.\nI think it would have been awesome to be able to costumize your skater and skateboard, sadly this isn't possible.\nGraphics are typical arcade 2d style, but it still looks nice and stylish.\nAlthough it does  lack a little bit of content in my opinion  (ok, it costs only 11 €), it is an absolute fun game to play.\n\nIf you're into arcade/Indie and skate games, you definitely should check this one out!\n\nRating:\n83/100","September 28, 2014","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The glorious times when Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS) games were the shizzle. It has that charm of chaining together obscenely long combos, demand for extreme precision and OCD inducing goals. The game is what happened after a night of heavy drinking where broken down and sad THPS caught the eye of Super Meat Boy, what we got from this mash up is devilishly difficult but at the same addictive skating game.\nWhat makes OlliOlli hard to put down are the systems under the hood. On the surface it is rather simple, moving left stick to do tricks and grinds with the shoulder buttons that double as spin and modifier buttons. But once the game reveals that you can do perfect landings, perfect grinds that all give you score and speed boosts that is the moment where OlliOlli really got me hooked. Now I knew I could demolish the target score, now the 50x combo didn't seem as impossible. And in the same way as in the old THPS games you learn the individual levels by heart, knowing when to jump, grind, spin or land just by muscle memory. OlliOlli is a very good and fun little game, that thanks to its editor will last you a long time so the price tag is totally reasonable.","September 6, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your objective is skating as far as you can along short, but somewhat demanding levels featuring stairs, grinds, vehicles, obstacles. Along the level you get scores for tricks, grinds and combos.\n\nWith 8 key controls the game seems to be easy, but it is relatively unforgiving, which makes you wanna beat it. I mean, how many times can you smash your face into the floor just after landing an epic 20x combo?! After a few minutes you can play the game and after 1-2 hours you get to know more tricks and are able to get quite impressive scores.\n\nThe game features classic 8-bit arcade graphics style and urban music floating between trance, hip-hop and dubstep (no vocals).\n\nIs it fun? Yes it is. You want to win the level. You want to land the combo. You want to beat your friends' score online (there are leaderboards). The graphics is retro-cool (but at times too simplistic and repetitive) and the music creates right skateboarding mood. At the same time it is a little annoying, especially after multiple failures. Despite easy controls I tend to mix up the keys in the heat of the moment. Music is good, but it just runs in the background, isn't related to levels or your activity/performance. Some levels are repetive, but the in-game achievements vary from level to level. There are multiple themes including city, port and junkyard. Some are better than others, for example in port the lack of detail on the floor makes it difficult to estimate your current speed. There are some bugs. The game crashed for me once.\n\nIt is a nice little game definitely worth getting in some bundle. Depending on how much you like arcade games you will have 5-20 hours of fun until it gets a little boring.\n\nGRAPHICS: 6/10\nAUDIO: 7/10\nGAMEPLAY: 7/10","November 18, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Originally developed for the PS Vita by Roll7 – the windows port up-scales the game whilst offering a similar experience. But does it grind past its contemporaries or face-plant into failure?\n\nThe games primary feature is a single player career mode. This is split across 5 distinct areas each divided into 5 courses. Your tasked with completing each course to unlock the next with increasing difficulty as you progress.\nThere are also a list of 5 objectives within each course, and if completed you unlock a 'Pro' variation of the same course. Each run is fairly short and can be successfully completed within a few minutes.\n\nTo supplement this once you've unlocked a course, they can then be revisited as skating 'spots', allowing you to compete on a score board, ranking players across the globe.\nThe final mode is a challenge variant called 'Daily Grind' which challenges the player to grind the entirety of a run. You can practice as many times as you want but you can only compete once. Your score is also ranked, however this resets with a new course every day.\n\nAlthough OlliOlli is a fairly compact game – the polish and refinement to the gameplay and mechanics makes it easy to jump in and out of. Its highly satisfying to pull off a series of tricks and slide down a rail to 100% a course, and although it can be frustrating when your stuck on a run at times, its easy to step away for a few hours and pick up where you left off later. There is also the option to skip through the levels.\n\nThe gradual increase in difficulty is the perfect means to encourage players to perfect their timing. It also encourages the revisit of past levels, as new skills are picked up that will allow previously impossible objectives to be overcome. The game can feel intimidating at first but through familiarising yourself with the tutorials and the 'tricktionary' the player can steadily progresses through the game – never becoming too hard or too easy.\n\nAlthough the game is primarily single player there is a thrill with trying to out-do players on the scoreboards, and its easy to go back to a run that you've had much success and find you've been out done. The daily grind is also another great incentive to try boast you timing and trick combinations.\n\nThe games biggest weakness is perhaps its controls, as a handheld port – the instant response of controller buttons is required. A keyboard can hinder the players timing and weakens the core mechanics of the game. There were also occasions where the keys would not register a move resulting in a sloppy landing or bail. However a controller solved all these problems. On the rare occasion the game suffered from glitches that allowed us to grind through obstacles or bail on a perfect landing.\n\nAlthough there isn't anything particularly impressive about the aesthetics of the game the art style is very charming. Particularly the animated background environments, and the skater himself, who has unique animations for each trick which can be viewed within the 'tricktionary'. However the contrast between the slow background and fast character can sometimes be disorientating, drawing focus away from the speed of the foreground.\n\nOlliOlli has a subtle electronic score which really suits the retro feel of the game. Although you hear the same tracks multiple times, they can come in at just the right moment to spur you on to victory.\n\nThe game manages to avoid feeling repetitive through remaining a challenge. Rather than testing the patient of the player, there is the ability to restart at any point in a run and progressively improve over an individual course. OlliOlli is a great example of when less is more,  but with a sequel announced for next year promising to expand on its successes, we can't wait to get back on ours board.\n\n\nVideo Review at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPhFlNsKTbo&list=UUxz-iPSjsZAsGhFY7zLfi9g","November 26, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

An immense emphasis on the joystick offers a myriad of tricks to try out for players but I've only been able to try out a handfull of them by the time I even finished all the levels. Trying out more tricks makes sense because your score depends on what trick you perform but given the dexterity requirement, it's gonna take more than a hand full of tries to remember and make use of them in the game. That is my only complaint but then again, I can only spare so much time for gaming these days, that's just me.\n\nThat is paired with terrific levels designed to offer the most glorious skateboarding experience. Seriously, don't watch a walkthrough to see how the game is, this is something you must experience, it's a sham there is no demo available. Some of the levels gave this sense of euphoria which very few platformers(I played) have managed to offer and that my friend, is the mark of a great platformer.\n\nNot to mention, an amazing sound track to which I've lost myself listening to during gameplay and it is in no way a bad thing. On the contrary, I bumped up the music volume and turned down the in-game sound effects for a more engaging experience. I'm pretty sure I would not have gone back to playing and finishing it by the time I did if it were not for the sound track. It's that good and really enhances the experience.\n\nI haven't played THPS but always wanted to play a skateboarding game and boy am I satisfied. It's worth mentioning that I loved this so much I bought it on PS Vita as well and played through most of it again :) I'm certainly looking forward to more of Roll7's works, already pre-ordered NOT A HERO and it certainly looks promising.\n\nIt's pretty evident that I am recommending this excellent skateboarding game and it is something you should try and not just watch or read. Go ahead and buy (full price or half price or whatever) and if you think you're not up for the dexterity challenge, try it out at least and be your own judge.\n","May 3, 2015","true","8.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinheim3/recommended/274250/","vinheim3","Prinny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinheim3/","352 products in account","Already beat the game fully on vita, but had to buy it again because of how quality and polished it is. The basic premise is that it's a runner game similar to Bit.Trip runner except you have a wide variety of tricks you can pull off the ground and a variety of grinds you can pull off on rails you find on the stage.\n\nThe game has a strong focus on timing as you gain maximum speed by pressing a button just as you land on the ground or on a rail for a perfect landing and harder stages have huge gaps after a series of rails that require you to perfect land on one, off it and perfect land onto another.\n\nThe trick/grind system can also be compared to moves in ARPGs like DMC. There is a wide variety of them and in order to build up a good score, you have to use a variety of each throughout the stage.\n\nIn order to unlock stages, you just have to beat the previous, but there are optional objectives in each one that you can shoot for for 100% completion. Usually there's 1 for achieving at least a certain high score for the whole stage, 1 for achieving at least a certain high score for a combo, and the other 3 involve a variety of objects like collecting hard to reach collectibles in the stage, reaching high places in the stage which requires a set of perfect grinds, pulling off a certain move or a combination of trick/grind, restrictions like not pushing for more speed on ground, no grinding, etc. They're all fun to get.\n\nWhen you've beaten the initial 25 stages which will take you a hell of a long time especially starting out, there are 25 additional harder stages. After that, there is rad mode where you have to beat all 50 stages with only perfect landings, and while you can get used to it, some stages are incredibly brutal because some gaps seem only passable if you slow down and not perfect land to hit a closer platform before a huge gap.\n\nThere is a lot to do in this small, high skill ceiling game, and if you like runner games like Bit.Trip runner, I would reccomend this ♥♥♥♥ with the force of a thousand suns. The aesthetics are varied and simple enough to focus on gameplay, and the music is beautiful and fitting that you'll have no problems with it while you 100% it.\n\nI'd give it at least an 8 out of 10, and it probably deserves higher than that.","July 26, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also this game has controller support (I used Xbox One Controller) the game is extremely fun if you can learn how to play, but it does have a tutorial so you can learn how to do tricks, land, and grind! Of which is a nice feature. The menus/HUD are also wonderful, they have a cool Metro feeling to them, of which I feel anyone can like, I have to say, this game is one of my favorite skating games, other than Tony Hawks, of which this game does remind me of, but instead it is in a 2D world. I love the art style, of the game, as it is simplistic, also the size of the game is very compact, for the amount of things stored in the game, I am proud of the Developers for fitting so much into such a little game.\n\nConsThis is the part where I abuse a game I have just played... The game seems to just have re-occurring maps on different stages, say the first stage, it has rails and stairs, throughout the levels on each stage, of which is a bit weird, as you are trying to improve score, so why wouldn't you give the player a different map per level instead of stage, I know they may take some time to make, but it would add a lot more variation. As I said before I used a controller as this game is easier to play with one, but say I didn't run the tutorial, I would have no clue about the controls, as in settings it says nothing, about controller controls\n\nOverall reviewThis game is unique, I have never played something like it, and the style is brilliant, the maps are ok, but improvements could be made, The controls may be hard to learn, but when you learn to play the game it is brilliant, I have saw videos, and a friend of mine said he enjoyed playing it also, I would recommend this game to someone who enjoys pixelated, skating games, and also could go under the Indie genre, but I feel the developers have done a wonderful job!\n\nExtra InformationDeveloper(s): Roll7, General Arcade\nPublisher(s): Devolver Digital\nPlatform(s): Windows, SteamOS, Mac\nRelease Date: July 22nd 2014\n\nWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group","February 16","true","0.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The fun you derive from this game is by creating a smooth flow throughout a level. Obstacles and incorrect timing are what interrupt the flow in a 3d game. In a 2D game, you'll find it's more often the confusing controls and what you can't see emerging from the right side of the screen that will interrupt your flow, and thus, your fun.\n\nThe primary problem is that it has a very strange control layout that doesn't quite translate from Tony Hawk's 3D world well enough to a 2D world. I wish jumping was just bound to a single button, instead of having you pull back on the left stick of the controller to "charge" a jump (which is more time consuming - which, in a reaction based game like this, can be killer). And while pressing a button to stick a landing is all well and good, it's extremely hard to time it well enough to get a smooth flow going.  It's almost like they ripped touch controls from a mobile game, and tried to emulate them on a gamepad.\n\nAnd this is the problem, really: Is this game a complicated endless runner, or is it a watered-down skating game? It doesn't quite know, and it simultaneously fails at both.\n\nI've spent about 15 minutes on this title, and I can't honestly see myself being bothered to try and master it, which is a shame because I like the music and aesthetic.\n\nHow this game because an indie darling, I'll never know. And I generally like what Devolver publishes.","May 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/274250/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","OlliOlli is a good example of a clever game idea executed poorly. The concept is simple: you control a skateboarder through various 2d levels and perform tricks based off of jumps and rails, racking up points through carefully executed combos and landings. The controls are fairly straightforward and the levels aren’t too hard to pick up….at least until later on when the difficulty curve goes through a sudden spike.\n\nIn the last two areas of the game the developers seemed to want to punish the player as much as possible by requiring absolute perfection on every single jump and grind. This would be alright by me except the timing for a perfect landing or grind seems to differentiate between parts of a level and hitting the directional or landing button before contact at a certain pixel distance will net a different result when it should be exactly the same every time. This made the second level of the final area absolutely impossible for me and earlier parts extremely difficult to pass.\n\nIt doesn’t help that for the hard levels, the developers thought putting the most brutal part near the beginning was a good idea. Forcing the player to die over and over again before they even make it 10 seconds into the level is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ IMO and just results in a lot of frustration for when you finally get past it and then die another few seconds later, only to return to struggling with that first 10 seconds. Finally, I had stability issues with the game whenever my connection to steam servers wasn’t so good and it would crash to desktop several times.\n\nI won’t be getting the sequel to this one unless the engine and level design get a serious overhaul.\n","August 24, 2015","false","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Too many levels feature insta-death obstacles almost right at the start of the stage, which is as much fun as being thrown three live grenades and being asked to judge which one weighs the least.\n\nAs the game goes on, more and more levels become reliant on grinding your whole way through, which quickly becomes tiresome and very same-y. Said same levels often REQUIRE that you're playing perfectly, otherwise you will move too slow and not be able to make a gap. The second level of the last world requires dozens of perfect grinds. If you fail almost any of them, you have to restart.\n\nI'm assuming, in part, that the reason why there is so much grinding is because you are unable to Manual between tricks, If the game was more flatland/street scape then the opportunities for combos would be greatly lessened. But you know what else stops your combo meter? Lamely falling into a gigantic pit full of ♥♥♥♥ing spikes. Nothing de-hypes you quite like pulling off fiften perfect grinds in a row to look like a chump because you only landed the Salad Grind on top of the neon dinosaur, but you didn't land it "Perfect", so now you're dead.\n\nWhat I desperately want in this game is a level where I can ♥♥♥♥ around and practice without flying into hells ♥♥♥♥ing teeth every twenty seconds.

First of all, the trick list seems incomplete, a lot of the movement of the left stick just end up doing ollies, and having to let the stick go back to neutral position feels like a really unnecessary step. Secondly, the most important thing to keep a run going is perfect landings, and all my video gaming instincts lead me to try hitting the landing button at the point of impact with the ground. However, it seems you have to hit the button quite a bit of time BEFORE you land, and HOLD IT until the point of landing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmology27/recommended/274250/","cosmology27","Jon.Topps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmology27/","616 products in account","It's a good concept, and has good music. It is fun. However, it has some serious flaws that make it a terribly annoying game to play.\n\n1 = The game is actually broken. You'll just get a black screen of death if you don't disable Steam overlay. I know it's a small problem, but they've released a game that DOESN'T WORK and then people pay for it. This should be illegal, no matter how easy the fix is.\n\n2 = The controls are unresponsive. You push the buttons to do a certain trick, and you just ollie. You want to do a spin trick, and do EXACTLY what you're supposed to do, and yet you don't spin. It's really annoying to just keep doing ollies and flying through the air doing absolutely nothing, just because the game sucks at reading your controller. The game is built to use a controller, and yet they don't work properly.\n\n3 = Sometimes the game breaks your computer. I've had a couple of times now where it will do the old NES thing where the screen freezes and makes a hum. It's also worse than normal crashes, because you can't force quit. You have to manually power down your computer.... I haven't had to do that in years...\n\n4 = There are times when your skater crashes for no good reason. Like, I'll flick the stick to jump, and he doesn't jump, he just crashes... And no, I don't suck at the game, I've almost beaten everything in this, and yet I still have these stupid things happening, which shouldn't even be possible. Like, I can't even replicate this if I'm trying to. It's just a flat out bug that happens often, and ruins the game.\n\n5 = The whole game is a pretty good pace, good achievments that are fun to get, except for the very last one... rad mode... It's incredibly frustrating, and takes an extremely long time. It's not even fun. You have to do every level over again, but flawlessly. I'm decent at the game, and I can play one level for half an hour before I get it flawless. It makes the game not even worth playing, and I honestly don't even want to play it anymore, even though there's only this one achievement left. Terrible design.\n\nIt could be a fun little game, and even if you look past the brokeness and crashings, the controls are still very unresponsive, making the game terribly annoying rather than fun.\n\nEDIT: As I play more, the non-responsive controls just get worse and worse. There are parts in levels that just will not accept a jump command. You'll flick the stick to jump, way before the edge, and the guy will just stop crouching (which means it KNOWS you released the stick), and yet he won't jump. So you fall and crash and have to start over. Get to that spot again, same thing happens. I'm playing a level right now that has TWO spots like this, in the same level... It's honestly one of the most frustrating games I've ever played, which is too bad, because it's a great concept.","January 9, 2015","false","24.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/recommended/274250/","dmstewart","DMStewart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/","267 products in account","Leave it to Devolver to take another great, simple concept, with run-away potential and screw it up. The controls in this game are so stupidly done it almost seems as if they made a bet with the staff to see who could create the most counter-intuitive operations possible for a fast-paced action/sports game. Last Devolver game I buy. After Hotline Miami I said the same thing and I honestly didnt even see that this was Devolver when I bought it on sale. When I saw the logo pop up when I started the game I said "&$#@, cant believe I missed that".\n\nSince they wanted to rely so heavily on the analog sticks (which I totally approve) they shouldve never made a requirement of using "A" to land every single trick. Since "A" is also used to pump for speed it should only be used for transitioning between rails...if even that. Setting up for tricks and activating them didnt need to be dependant on 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, etc rotations and then releasing when using the D-pad is much more precise and you can get a longer trick list if you incorporate the diagonals as a defined direction.\n\nThyeve made blasting out tricks between grinds unecessarily difficult...even on the first levels. The tutorial will tell you to grind everything because that wil give you more speed. Except for when it doesnt and it stops you dead, causes you to fall, and you have to restart your run. Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb\n\nAnyway, trick execution is abnormally stupid. And I know how this happens. One person came up with the control scheme. It felt natural to them and they implemented it (this is someone who was just mediocre at the original Tony Hawk games and was mad that their friends were able to score higher than them). The rest of the staff thought that since the game itself wouldnt really be challenging or fun, they could just roll with the control scheme being counter-intuitive and that would suffice for a game that was well thought out. Using "A" to land is so wildly stupid that I cant even fathom how that stayed in for the final version. First of all, landing your tricks in real life is totally dependant on your prior execution. They couldve easily done one of two things to incorprate a skill/timing based landing function. Either use "down" on the analog stick or make your landing dependant on your execution. Too little speed and you may land wobbly, too much and you may not be able to set up for the next execution. Their levels are laid out perfectly for the latter.\n\nIts amazing how well Devolver is getting at taking something that is different, fresh, and has tons of potential and just smashing it into pieces and then taking a hot steaming dump right on top of it. Thank god I only paid $6 for this. Uninstalled!\n\nIf anyone is hell bent on getting this game please respond here first and I'll put up even more reasons why you should save your money. I think I accidentally encouraged one friend to get it so now I have to buy them a game to replace this piece of crap\n\n1/10 - Because music isnt bad and the idea WAS great.","January 1, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Lets get that straight first. The game is fun, in a phone-game kind of way - but a *good* phone game. This idea has a lot of potential for expansion and overall more depth. I have been playing for about 2 hours now, and will certainly play more with a controller.\n\nPros:\n1. Addicting twich-style 2D Tony Hawkish gameplay\n2. Fast restarting, and it is overall fairly easy (no rage quitting for me so far)\n\nCons:\n1. It is sometimes hard to tell what is the background and what is interactable - this really matters since you will lose unfairly due to these issues\n2. No customization for the skater or skateboards\n3. Grinds and jump styles are SUPER SIMPLE - we need way more room for improvisation ala Tony Hawk\n4. Graphics are meh.

One negative thing i have to say about the game is i think the pirce point is a bit to high, if it were selling for aroun 5-6 bucks then i would say this game is worth every penny. There are not a whole lot of skateboarding games out there on PC so if you are a fan of skateboarding and need to get your fix i would have no problem reccommending this game to you. Just don't think your getting some huge open world game with stat upgrades and a store to purchase more equipment and clothes at. It would have been awesome if the devs added all that stuff then i would say the current price is a steal. But when it comes down to it this is a fun little game and depending on how badly you want to play you could pick it up right away or if you can manage to hold off wait till it goes on sale.","July 31, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack sets the tone for the taste level in this game, very high.  The actual range of tricks are cool, but rarely seem that important. Tight controls, fun fun fun!  Gets to that spot in skate games like THPS2 and skate, where the game just felt good, and grinding to complete tasks was a blast!  Great rrange in levels... highly recommend to fans of the genre....","July 31, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finger killing hard, Sentence ruining hard. At the time of writing, I am stuck on the level set before the final level set of the five level sets of the base game. And I thought OilliOilli was gonna be short. There are the 25 base levels, the 25 pro versions of those levels, then the can’t touch the ground versions of the base levels then the pro versions of those. OilliOilli isn’t a game I will finish anytime soon, I tried. I tried to get all the individal challeges on every individual level but mt fingers said, “Nah Bra”, and went numb from masterb……., Pain.I wish I could play OilliOilli all day but it hurts to play if for long periods of time, it’s like Guitar Hero all over again.\n\nPlot:\n\nThe story of a man-boy with no face who is indebt to Comcast and must skateboard for Mountain Dew Commcials in increasely dangerous areas all to badass music.- JK\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is easy to learn but hard to master like a broom or sex. The gameplay consists of your character permanently moving right from the start of the level into jumps, tricks, and grinds. The skill theat comes into play is the timing aspect. You have to time every landing and grind with corresponding butten pressing or stick flick right before you hit the ground or rail. This not only affects your overall score but your speed which might umped you from finishing the level.\n\nControls:\n\nIf you watched the review( watch it I’ll wait ), I went on and on about the controls. They are fin but I wish there was a switch for to not have trick stick and for the LB button on the 360 controller not to hunt my left index finger.\n\nGraphics:\n\nTheir Pixel, There Awesome, That’s it.\n\nSound:\n\nStop Google OilliOilli Soundtrack too late I did it for you. I usually don’t care for music in my video games. I mute it and forget about it. This game remimds me of when I first heard the music in Tony Hawk Pro Skater, being a Black person only exposed to rap music it opened my eyes to other genres of music. OilliOilli did it again. Also, the sound effects sound good too.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nAs i said in the Video Review, OilliOilli is a solid game for five dollars but at it’s current price, kinda of a hard sell. I recommend this game if you are one of the five people with a PS Vita. My PC people wait for a sell, if you just need it now, you won’t be disappointed as was I.","August 1, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't even think I will ever write one, but this game is too amazing to not do it. I've played it around 10h now and it was definitly worth all the money. I can recommend it strongly to anyone who is either interested in skill-games, skating and/or has played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater back in the days. Something about the feel is very similar.\n\n\n+ Great overall feeling (with controller)\n+ The spot and level design is very dynamic, multi-faceted and balanced. You never feel treated unfair, even though you suck 1000000 times at the same ♥♥♥♥.\n+ Sound effects are perfectly suited to the game dynamics\n+ I sometimes feels like I can just close my eyes and play the slides through by sound.\n+ The atmosphere totally soaks one in. Time and space fade into each other so there is only OlliOlli left in the universe.\n+ Lots of motivation behind the daily grinds.\n\n- Sometimes (when triggering fast) the controller sensivity doesn't react properly to the landings and I fail the tricks (mostly at the same spots over and over again). Is it only my controller?\n- Somehow I still don't 100% get how to achieve these extreme highscores. When I do a lot of combinations there is no significant difference in points (sometimes even worse) to when I just use whatever flips and slides to go through the level. Most likely I am just stupid, but still there should have been a better explaination of what makes scores go high.\n- Editor would have been nice. Maybe even a MOD-Kit to implement own graphics, obstacles, mutators, etc.\n\nTo say that clear: The negative points are in no comparison to the positive ones, just didn't want to miss them out.\n\nI highly recommend that game!","August 4, 2014","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You remember everything you loved about Tony Hawks Pro Skater on the playstation 1? What Thrasher: Skate and Destroy made you feel as you aced trick after trick in a huge combo?\n\nWell it's not quite on the par with those games, obviously, because they are 3d and kinda open world... but in a way, this is something of a purer experience. OlliOlli is two dimentional, and ... well basically combine Canabalt with THPS and you pretty much have what the game is gameplay wise. You are always moving forwards, you can't go back and redo a trick without restarting entirely. The course is always to the right and there's no going back.\n\nBecause it's a "simpler" control system, where your left stick controls what trick you're doing and timing that landing button (A on your controller) perfectly is key to getting huge combos, you will quickly find yourself struggling a little. It's a hard game to control! Especially when grinds come into the mixture because it seems the devs, to increase challenge and keep you on your toes, deliberately made sure that landing a grind perfectly means using the Left Stick instead of the A button. Honestly though, I don't mind. The cognitive dissonance it causes is a little frustrating, but it's possible to overcome it.\n\nGraphics wise, it's full of wonderful, colourful pixels. I'm pretty early on into the game so the game isn't hugely detailed yet, the trailer seems to imply that later levels will be bigger, grander, more complex and more exciting though, which is nice. It's not hugely graphically intensive, so the game runs at a fantastic speed regardless of your rig, so it's got that going for it, but the pixel style really isn't going to be for everyone. Pixelly graphics is something that appeals to a particular niche... granted a fairly LARGE niche but still a niche none the less. I am part of said niche but I recognise the validity of the opinions of people who prefer more graphical fidelity than chunky low-res sprites. That's fair. Not everything needs to be pixel graphics, or low-poly chunky-ness, or mired in nostalgia.\n\nMusic? Incredible. I love it. A fantasic mix of techno-hiphop-trance and a bunch of other electronic styles. It's very listenable and very very good to get you in the mood for the game. It mixes perfectly. My only gripe is that I can't get the soundtrack as one package, which is a terrible shame but understandable because, just like the old THPS games, the soundtrack is a collection of various tracks from various artists, each of which were released not specifically for this game, but as part of said artists' own albums and record labels. So yeah. Gotta go get the tracks individually. THANKFULLY the devs put in a tracklist in the credits, which is nice!\n\nThe price of this game is £9.99 or regional equivalent, and I think personally that it's very reasonably priced. A lot of work has gone into making this game playable and fun, and not overly frustrating, the soundtrack's great, the mechanics are rock solid, so yes, £9.99 is a great price for this game and well worth it. You'll get well over 10 hours of gameplay from this and will most likely keep coming back to it, so that's totally worth the price.\n\nOkay so, in summary, here's the good and bad parts of this little gem:\n\nGOOD:\nSolid, engaging and fun mechanics\nGreat soundtrack\nVery well tuned twitch gameplay\nVery reasonable price\n\nBAD:\nMissing manuals! But that's coming in the sequel\nGraphical style MAY NOT appeal to everyone (again though the sequel is not pixelly by the looks of things!)\nChalllenging control system may frustrate people to begin with.\nFor those wanting the complexity and depth of THPS, this game may well disappoint.\n\nOverall rating:\n\nA good solid 8/10\nI'm not a huge fan of skating games but this is great fun and a joy to play. Totally worth the money!","October 30, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kinda like a 2D Jet Set Radio. There's way less emphasis on ollying and grinding seems to be the key feature, this is pretty much all you do in the later levels. The camera angle is way too high, it's hard to see what's below you 80% of the time. You're going at high speed, you ollie and then you roll the dice whether it's something you can grind on or if it's something you need to press A to land. This is especially annoying when you're chaining together a combo and the game screws you over.\n\nOne thing that bothers me the most is that it feels kinda clunky, it might be something you have to get used to, but it throws me off every time. Every trick you do your feet have to be on your board first. Heelflip >land on board >land trick, laserflip >land on board >land trick etc. The speed that you go added with the pixel art also doesn't help as it's hard to tell if you're on the board and/or if you're close to the ground.\n\nIt's also got good things going for it. Chaining together combos perfectly is really satisfying, when you screw up you can press select to instantly restart giving it a "just one more go" kinda feel. There are quite a few tricks too, the tutorial doesn't do a great job of explaining some of it but you can do a lot of crazy stuff. I also like that you got to "press A" to land your moves, while it can be frustrating it's also to the games benefit as it feels really good when you land something complicated perfectly.\n\nOverall I recommend it, but buy it knowing that there are a few issues that need to be fixed.","August 29, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it may only span two dimensions, the depth of this sick trick-busting simulator is considerable. The simple combination of a mere four buttons, joystick included, can land you over 120 different moves, grinds, and spins across an expansive series of levels.\n\nOlliOlli is also able to delicately balance between “fun-difficult” and “♥♥♥♥this-difficult” without ever falling on its face. You’re not going to want to fall on your face either, as that will mean the end of your run. It’s up to you to groove and flip your way each course at breakneck speed without smashing your skull and getting sent back to the starting gate. Think Bit Trip Runner meets Tony Hawk.

If you're into other skating games (Tony Hawk) or side-scrolling platformers, then this may be a game for you.\n\nThe controls, while a bit counter-intuitive at first, become second nature quickly, and they are tight and snappy, as any good fast-paced platformer should have. Very rarely does a death feel like the game's fault, and this is one of the core strengths of the game.\n\nAs well, the level design seems well-planned and intelligent, forcing players into situations where they have to adapt using only the small control set they have. It just feels, I dunno, smart.\n\nThere's a lot of replay value to this game, too. Besides the Daily Grind (a daily course, as the name suggests), there are many optional objectives throughout single-player.\n\nThe music, above all, is to be recommended. Not only is all of it good, or at least listenable, it seems to fit the vibe of the game very well, contributing to the overall feel.\n\nVisual style is very minimalistic, which is sort of good in a game like this: everything stands out distinctly, grind rails are obviously not obstacles, stuff like that. It also keeps a relatively clean, neutral palette, and this is soothing to the eyes, at least for me.\n\nOverall, if I had to put it on a 10 scale, I'd go 8. I'd like to see more games like this in the future. Play it, if you haven't already.","September 13, 2014","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is somewhat a mix between skate and tony hawk's pro skater. The tricks are done by flicking the left stick in a specifc direction i.e. skate but unlike skate you have to press A to stick your landing(a perfect timing will get you more points).\nAt first the challenge is to finish the stages but once you master the control scheme the stages become fairly easy and then you have challenges to complete on each level. Like in the pro skater games you have to complete the challenge within the run. There are 25 amateur levels and a pro variant on each level (completing all challenges will unlock the pro level) and also includes a daily generated level for you to compete for the best score. This game has a lot for the price if you want a challenge and/or like to score chase then this game is for you.","August 23, 2014","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/274250/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","I love the idea, and as someone who was pretty damn good at chaining together combos of grinds w/ manuals for tons of points in tony hawk games, I was excited about this game. Sadly it is very rough around the edges. Let’s first talk about some of the worst controls I’ve ever seen. To jump you hold down, and to do tricks you hold down and make arc motions on the analog stick. Yes, you actually CAN’T use a/x to jump, the uniform jumping game button. You don’t even press up on analog like most games, you press DOWN! Then if you want to land a trick you have to press JUMP (durr duurrr), but if you want to land on rails with grinds, you use down for that. See how confusing and pointlessly dumb it is. You also can’t rebind the controls to A to jump as I tried. So good luck dying 200 times because you press A to jump or press down on analog to land, unlearning everything you have from gaming the past how-ever many years, just so this game can have “a steep learning curve”.\n\nIf the controls don’t hurt the fun, there’s the game mechanics. Tons of times when I would press A at the exact right time it would say I completely missed it and will screw up the trick, and because that makes you unable to do anything for 5 seconds I would inevitable fall down and die. Other times I would press it when I did before and it would say perfect/sick, showing how inconsistent the landing feature feels. Then there is grinding. Countless times I would press the grind button above a rail only to fall past it without grinding and lose. Other times you will be unable to tell if you can make it or not because of how the stuff looks to be in the background, and if you try sometimes you get it and other times you don’t leading to frustration at the lack of clarity of the game. The worst part is the grind button makes you go flying down, so even if you should grind and the game for some reason doesn’t let you, it will compound the problem by rocketing you to the ground (super realistic skating feature) so you don’t have enough time to press the land button, meaning you’ll probably die even if you land on pavement. Also the items being in the background means you will hit things you didn’t know were part of the course. Also I had bugs where I would just suddenly fall while grinding as if I got hit, but I hadn’t. Another time it said I was grinding but also made the sound counting me as falling, so I ended up grinding for 3 seconds before the game decided I had fallen. Also there will be times where you don’t know what’s coming up and you jump and land and there isn’t enough room to land and then jump again, meaning you must lose once more because you couldn’t see what was ahead and it was out of your control and already decided, which is dumb.\n\nThen there is the camera. For some inexplicable reason, the camera is towards the top of the screen. I would constantly be falling and not able to see the ground, to see if there is steps, a rail, or ground. I died tons of times just because the game wouldn’t let me know what to expect till I was there and it was too late. It also doesn’t help that every time you land it takes 20 seconds to absorb a landing before you can jump again, leading to parts where you just don’t have enough room to jump again before you auto die. Also in levels with snow where the sidewalk is missing, it will count as hitting you while you are still on the walkway, which makes no sense. Snow in place of a sidewalk is lower and basic physics means that shouldn’t hit you before you get there. What SHOULD happen is if you don’t jump beforehand you fall into it, or if you land on it, but not the way it is currently terribly done.   Also the game won’t register jumps sometimes when you press them. Same goes for tricks like 60% of the time. I would swoop the analog only to have it just jump me, and right after that I’d do the same thing and the game would actually count it. There are times when everything in the game actually works together and you’re grinding and flying through the air at high speeds and making a huge combo. The environments also look pretty drab and same-y, leading to all levels of a given area to look the exact same, with only a little different layout of the rails/steps. It sucks that at least 50% of the time you fall or die or miss a trick or don’t grind or don’t do a trick, that it seems to be the game’s fault and nothing you did incorrectly, which is opposite of what I can say for tony hawk games. I get that they want to facilitate people playing the levels over tons of times but poor game design/mechanics/control is not the way. This one needed more time in the oven to fix things.

Well this is something different. Mostly because it's 2D. The control scheme is pretty confusing if you like kb+m, so I would recommend using a controller. If you use a keyboard you have to do tricks with WSAD and the arrow keys, which is really hard to do as fast as the game requires you to.\nAlso I had some problems running the game. It always showed a blackscreen on startup, but changing the steam overlay-\nsettings fixed it. So, if you have a controller, definetly give OlliOlli a try.

The animations are lazy, the stages are lazy, the challenges are lazy, and the mode selection is lazy. For being so simple, it takes a lot out of your computer. The game constantly crashes and one of the achievements is impossible to get without exploiting some stuff in-game because it leads you to a point that freezes the game. Other causes of crashes include holding a stick in a direction too long, flicking too fast (also often doesn't read the movement), falling through the ground (something that also happens every so often), and sometimes, getting an achievement. Speaking of achievements. you never know when you get them because the game requires you to turn off the steam window completely to work at all. It's also buggy when tabbing ou tof the game as this can sometimes cause the game to not load back up. The game has save glitches wherein sometimes you will play for hours and realize it did not save anything next time you boot it up.\n\nAll that said, pretty fun game. 8/10","November 5, 2014","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything from the intensity of keeping a combo alive, collecting the pickups and just finishing the damn level can be a challenge. I love how it makes you time your landing for that extra challenge.\n\nThe menus can be a bit clunky but nothing unmanageable.\n\nMy biggest disappointment is the lack of Steam Cloud support. As a multi-platform game, I expect to be able to play on whatever platform I have in front of me. Sadly, my save data is stuck on one machine so I can't play Olli Olli as often as I would like. First world problems, huh.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this for Tony Hawks fans. The challenges will drive you insane and you'll swear you'll try just once more only to find yourself still trying an hour later. Great, old school gameplay.\n\nI'm Rodney Mullen, again.","November 7, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is somewhat a mix between skate and tony hawk's pro skater. The tricks are done by flicking the left stick in a specifc direction i.e. skate but unlike skate you have to press A to stick your landing(a perfect timing will get you more points).\nAt first the challenge is to finish the stages but once you master the control scheme the stages become fairly easy and then you have challenges to complete on each level. Like in the pro skater games you have to complete the challenge within the run. There are 25 amateur levels and a pro variant on each level (completing all challenges will unlock the pro level) and also includes a daily generated level for you to compete for the best score. This game has a lot for the price if you want a challenge and/or like to score chase then this game is for you.","August 23, 2014","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those guys totally sold me on the game within a few seconds of them playing it.\n\nSo, the game, as stated before, is fantastic. That is helped by a few amazing key features. One of them being the really simple to learn, takes forever to master tricks. They're all a ton of fun to try and pull off, and you could spend hours just learning how to pull one of perfectly in a ton of different ways. Another one is that the game actually has some legs. Given that you can play the game all the way through in a couple of hours is deceptive, because once you nail five stars in a stage, it opens up a second tier stage for you to play on that takes more skill to pass. And then there's a whole other set of stages and game modes to play after that, that is just a blast to play. The soundtrack is a ton of fun, and as is usual with Devolver Digital games, as soon as you fail, it's a simple press of a button and you're right back at the start of the stage. No long loading screens or even a moment to wait, just right back into the game.\n\nOn the negative side, it would be nicer to have a few different modes to play, especially in a multiplayer sense, maybe actually playing with other people on a stage at once, maybe throw in a way that you could trip up the other people in the stage while you're all playing it. Also, it would be helpful if there was a better indicator, at least at the start of the game, as to when is best to land a trick, either on the rail or on the ground.\n\nBut, these negative points are more nitpicks than anything. The only real negative point that I could think of is that the price is just a couple dollars too high. If it were $10, I'd have NO PROBLEM telling everyone to buy this game. And even at its price, you should pick it up.","September 7, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is insanely hard and unforgiving, the "amateur" mode is the basic mode you will play, and I'm scared to even attempt the extra mode, the main levels start out relatively fun but the game soon jumps drastically in difficulty. This is not a skateboarding game, this is a game all about speed and timing, I used a controller to play and the game only uses the left stick and the A button, it requires you to push up on the stick to perform an Ollie, you can try pushing different directions to pull off better tricks but most of the time I find that you don't have the time between jumps to actually land any of them and if you mess up even slightly it will ruin your entire run forcing you to start all over again, also whenever you come down to the ground you are required to "land" your trick by pressing the A button at the correct time before you hit the ground, missing that perfect moment will result in a "Sloppy" or "Sketchy" landing which will completely ruin any momentum you have gained if it doesn't cause you to bail immediately. This game would be much more fun with some sort of free skate or casual mode but instead I found it insanely frustrating just trying to get through the basic levels, I was ready to throw my controller through the wall several times. Most levels pretty much require you to grind the entire way and if you miss even slightly you will lose all speed and bail, trust me this will happen A LOT, I had several times where even though I know I hit the button at the right time it didn't register and gave me a sloppy landing resulting in me failing several levels in a row I eventually gave up once I hit level 5 because it requires such perfect timing yet like I said it sometimes does not register so even if you think you're getting good at this game it can still get glitchy and you will fail due to no fault of your own. I eventually gave it another try after a few months and finally got past level 5. If you like insanely challenging and unforgiving games and playing the same levels over and over and over until you get it right then go for it but if you get frustrated easily don't even touch this game unless you have an unlimited supply of extra controllers.\n\nIt can be a fun game, but it is def not a casual skateboarding game like most would expect and having to perfectly time a button press just to land your tricks takes a lot of the fun away and just causes more frustration.\n\nP.S.

The only issue I had with the games visuals was that the gray colour palette in a couple of the areas in the game. The areas that didn't have a gray colour palette were bright and colourful, and had an overall pleasing look to them.\n\n\nSound: 7/10\nThere aren't that many sound effects in the game that matter, but the background music is good. The background music  sounds like som mix between a hip-hop beat and chiptune. The music is lovely and gives you a chilled out feeling while playing the game.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nNote: Keyboard controls are utter horse manure. Xbox 360 gamepad recommended.\n\nOlliOlli is a side-scrolling skating game, where you try to get as good of a score as possible. There isn't alot of gameplay variation so I don't have too much to say about it, however there is a daily grind mode. In the daily grind mode they add a new level everyday, which gives you some more gametime if you enjoy climbing up scoreboards.\n\n\nMoney/Time: 7/10\nThis game is extremely enjoyable, but there is a sequel (OlliOlli 2: Welcome To Olliwood.) that vastly improves the gameplay. The sole reason why I haven't played alot of OlliOlli is because I got it a week or so before the release of the sequel (which I got for free on ps+.), so I played that instead. This game is good fun, but I think you should get OlliOlli 2 first.","May 9, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an arcade-styled game that focuses on stringing together combos of skateboard tricks to grab the high score, and knockout different objectives. Levels become progressively more challenging, as do the objectives. There are several game modes including a "Daily Grind" to compete for global high scores each day, and multiple versions of each level that can be unlocked by completing all that levels objectives. There's no lack of content, for sure. The game play is entertaining and challenging - landing a long combo of crazy tricks perfectly is so satisfying, and ♥♥♥♥ing up can be terribly frustrating. Personally, I find the frustration and fun to be equally balanced in a way that makes the game addicting, but in short bursts. It's the kind of game I play for half an hour at a time because of a spontaneous desire to beat a high score or try one of the Daily Grinds. The only two negatives I can come up with are the keyboard controls are a kinda wonky (although the game clearly states it was designed for controller play) and the price tag is a little steep. But overall, I'd recommend OlliOlli.\n","May 21, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll pretty much play any skateboarding game since the EA skate games aren't on PC (thanks EA) but I was pleasantly surprised by how great the controls of Olli Olli are. The tricks feel very similar to their real life counterparts. For example, kickflips in real life are a flick off of your backside front of the nose, and in olli olli it's a flick to the right on the analog stick (which would be your backside if you ride goofy).\n\nThat and the variety of tricks are what keep me coming back. The courses are fun, but if feels a lot less like skating in the later levels. The first world is still my favorite.\n\nThe one possible con I've had so far is in the quality of the port. The game occasionally will have a runtime error and die on me for no real reason, and it's the only game I play that does it.

The levels are broken up and focus more on getting high scores and achievements, so it does offer some replayability there if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n- The learning curve -- bit of a learning curve to get into it.

Definitely looking forward to OlliOlli 2.\n\nThe Good:\nThis game has both the charm and challenge of the old Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, distilled down into a 2D sidescroller / platformer. Moment-to-moment gameplay is absolutely solid. Aside from a handful of cases (due to unfriendly camerawork), all failures are truly your own, making success that much more gratifying. The controls are pretty unconventional, but are by no means bad. Once you get comfortable with them, pulling off elaborate combos is incredibly satisfying. There's definitely at least 10 hours of wonderfully crafted content aside from the eternal leaderboard climb & daily challenges.\n\n\nThe Bad:\nThe first thing that is likely to irk new players is the controls. There are very few analogues for players to draw from, and the gameplay is pretty unforgiving, which results in a fairly frustrating introduction if you elect to skip the tutorial. The camera is fairly static, centered on the player at all times, leading to some frustrating conflicts with the level design. In the junkyard stage especially, you'll be pitched against obstacles that you will have to have anticipated in advance because the camera placement does not offer you enough information to act before it is too late. This results in a fair bit of trial and error based play as you get a better feel for the levels, which is pretty poor design. Although all stages have a distinct visual style, the minimalist mechanics force their design to feel very same-y. The largest difference between stages is increasing obstacle density and slimming the margin for error, which works OK, but leaves the overal experience feel somewhat bland.\n\nThe Ugly:\nFairly bug-ridden. Not to the point where it's unplayable, but if you're not completely taken with the game early on, it'll be frustrating enough for this to sit in your library relatively untouched.","December 2, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/274250/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A relatively arcadey 2D sidescrolling skateboard game where each level doesn't stop until you wipeout or get to the end.\n\nIt's essentially all about trying to complete various challenges in each level while also trying to dish out the highest score doing various tricks & grinds before you reach the end mark or eat pavement. Many of the challenges require multiple runs of the same level and the more challenging ones may become a marathon of trial & errors mainly because the map will likely have to be memorized to an extent so as not to miss certain rails to grind on or gaps to jump and such. Each level has 5 challenges each and as soon as you finish one then that one challenge is completed for the rest of the game. To get the highest scores you have to combo up grinds & tricks as much as you can before landing back on the ground.\nWhile all levels are relatively short most have an absurdly extensive amount of rails and other objects for you to grind on to keep combos going. Some levels allow going from start to finish without even hitting the pavement until the very end which can be a pretty cool challenge of its own. There are no checkpoints but because the game's made for trial & error restarting a level after failure goes by pretty fast.\n\nThe game is designed to be played with a controller in mind and although playing with the keyboard is allowed it's unrecommended. The game is played out using only the joystick (WASD) for performing tricks & ollies and the shoulder buttons (left & right arrow keys) for performing spins midair or doing other various tricks & grinds when combined with joystick moves.\nWhatever combo that's been made aren't fully counted for unless a PERFECT landing to the ground has been made which can be done by pressing A (down key) just right before making contact with the ground. Grinds can be landed at a PERFECT as well though the penalty is much more minimal if not timed well enough as opposed to missing landings on the ground.\nThe skater moves on his own so you're really only in control of his score spewing moves and speed while at the same time avoiding wipeouts. Trying to perform various tricks & grinds felt a bit complicated early on, even after the tutorial, but I found myself getting a better feel for it as I kept playing especially when some challenges want you to perform specific tricks which usually become much more simpler than they sound. The number of tricks themselves feel very limited despite it saying "over 120" and they consist of board flips, spins, grinds, and ollies. Some of the animations for the tricks take a bit of time before being completed so learning what to use and when can also be a big deal when trying to stay on the board or not miss a rail to grind on just because your trick took too long. On that note you can actually finish most of the challenges with just ollies since they have practically no animation to wait for.\n\nPersonally I disliked whatever kind of music was in here. Luckily I'm able to turn that off and pump up my own tracklist on another window of the THPS series OST and whatever other genres I felt more appropriate for skating.\n\nThe game presents itself with a handful of glitches that can be incredibly infuriating to those looking to do outstanding to perfect runs.\nOne of those would be that when you try to connect a grind you'll sometimes fall under the rail or just wipeout completely, even midway through the grind. The only time you're supposed to wipeout during grinding in this game is when you get off and land on something that isn't pavement, land on stairs, or hit an obstacle at the end of the rail which are never present between the beginning and the end of any rail.\nIt could just be on my end but the controls become unresponsive often when performing fast actions. Uncommonly when I try to jump an ollie or a trick from the ground with the joystick nothing will happen which usually leads to a wipeout. There are also times when trying to do an ollie or trick I just suddenly wipeout on the long flat road I'm riding on as if the character slipped without even getting any airtime. The "slipping" doesn't really show that it's a part of the game so I'm lead to assume it's another glitch.\n\nThis was apparently ported from another console and it's not entirely well polished either; the game crashes rarely for whatever reason, sometimes I have no control over the menus thus forcing me to restart the game, and there are rare & random but minute frame drops & skips which can be gamebreaking for a game that requires precise timing.\n\nThere's not a whole lot to the game as each level & somewhat spread out challenges are actually just more of the same with a different setting however because I can be a sucker for skateboard games I had my big share of enjoyment from it. It's somewhat lacking so I probably wouldn't get this for 13 bucks.","August 4, 2015","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I'll pretty much play any skateboarding game since the EA skate games aren't on PC (thanks EA) but I was pleasantly surprised by how great the controls of Olli Olli are. The tricks feel very similar to their real life counterparts. For example, kickflips in real life are a flick off of your backside front of the nose, and in olli olli it's a flick to the right on the analog stick (which would be your backside if you ride goofy).\n\nThat and the variety of tricks are what keep me coming back. The courses are fun, but if feels a lot less like skating in the later levels. The first world is still my favorite.\n\nThe one possible con I've had so far is in the quality of the port. The game occasionally will have a runtime error and die on me for no real reason, and it's the only game I play that does it. But when it works, which is usually, it's a great game.\n","June 28, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

OlliOlli is no different, it just streamlines the experience by being 2-d, and forcing you to always move in the same direction. So in a sense it's 1.5-d.","July 25, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes\n\nWhy play this game? If you like the skateboarding theme and like "arcady" games give it a try. Has replayability, fastpaced gameplay and a simple yet cool artstyle (pixelated). Soundtrack is awesome too!\n\nProblems: Keyboard and mouse is annoying to play with. I recommend a gamepad controller which feels much more natural.\n\nStory: No story, you don't play this for a story.\n\nMechanics: It's a 2d sidescrolling skateboardgame. It's pretty technical when it comes to the tricks almost like EA Skate (flick stick) more than Tony Hawkes (press button-combinations). The game is about pulling off tricks and timing your landing for better score. There's like 5 different acts with 10 levels each (5 normal and 5 pro-levels). In the levels there are stairs, rails, ledges and objects that make you fall. On each level there are a few goals you have to achieve before you can proceed to the next one. If you make them all you unlock the corresponding pro-level which is harder.\n\nPlaytime/replayability: Room for replayability since there are leaderboards. Depending on your skill level it will take different amounts of time to play through all level (probably around 5 hours). If you decide to complete all goals on all levels you're probably looking at 20+ hours of gametime.\n\nWhy I recommend it: Simple artstyle, AMAZING soundtrack, responsive arcade game, the pricetag is worth the money. If you like skateboarding and wanna play a fun game ever once in a while, buy this! Just a heads up, there is a lot of trial and error, you might become angry or frustrated with the game if you play for too long.","January 1, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
