Infantry combat also has an unfortunate habit of turning into nade spamfest on some infantry maps.\nWhile Battlefield 2 isn't the best game of the series,(2142 takes that spot imo) i still recommend to buy it if you haven't.(its only like 5 € and has awesome mods too.)","November 27, 2013","true","253.4"," 446 of 509 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","446","509","0","12"

Let me explain:\n\nIf you had an account some years ago and you want to recover it, the first thing you should know is Gamespy was shut down. That means that it’s so hard to keep this account active unless you made a migration before to Origin, or you basically lost all the progress you made with your old account. I couldn’t find a solution for it yet.\nBut the worst part is, since the Gamespy is not working, you cannot create a new account either. That means... you can only play single player. So this is a multiplayer game played only single player, in 16 boot player maps. So 10€ for a 2005 game with the multiplayer disabled, is not a good deal.\n\nI hope, I really hope Steam will fix this because I feel scammed...\n\n\n7/12/2014\nSome people in the comments suggested to visit some webpages like (www.battlelog.co) where they try to keep the game alive. You can do it if you want, it's a good way to take some advantage of the money you spent here.\nBut since I bought the game on Steam I was expecting to play the game on Steam, and not needing to get by on my own. At least I think the minimum Steam could have done is warning people before buying.","October 27, 2014","false","1.7"," 1,877 of 2,306 people (81%) found this review helpful 87 people found this review funny","81","877","2","87","105"

In short you have to do a little work/get mods to get MP back otherwise treat it as an SP only game.\n\nNow Singleplayer is almost identical to MP (aside from it being bots instead of players) IF you get a few mods (namely the BF2SP bot changer and 64 player map sizes for SP) Allied intent extended is still probably one of the best mods out there for SP (mainly an SP mod)\n\nIn short ONLY get this game if your WILLING to get mods.

A little humble poll I made showed that BF2 is still close to the hearts of many, regardless if they are still playing it or not (please do vote your choice too!):\n\nhttp://vote.pollcode.com/74851954\n\nBF2's 'classic BF' gameplay set the precedence for later games in the franchise: BF 2142, BF BC2, BF3, BF4 & BF Hardline (including the now extinct free-to-play BF Play4Free and BF Heroes).\n\nThe BF2 weapons/physics is probably the most different than any other FPS. There is very little ‘visual’ recoil but the bullet deviation is more exaggerated than any FPS that I’ve played. There are hit boxes/hit detection problems, movement feels clunky etc etc (and the list goes on and on). The weapon handling is the hardest of all BFs, and also when compared to other FPSs that I play (CS/COD/ARMA franchises etc). It is not impossible to overcome the many problems to perform in-game, but it requires a steeper and longer learning curve.\n\nNevertheless, after describing the long list of problems above, the times when I manage to overcome all these obstacles and land kills -> the ‘high’ that I get can’t be matched by any other game.\n\nI have about 20 FPS games (BF,COD,CS, ARMA series etc etc), and have tried new ones like BF Hardline, COD AW, COD BO3 etc, and while they are fun, the movement/weapon physics don't really feel that significantly different from each other.\nThe only game which movement/weapon physics feels different than the others, fresh, and stands in its own category is ironically this 10 year old game: BF2.\n\nI played back to back BF1942, BFV, BF2, BF2142, BFBC2, BF3 and BF4 -> and personally, the hardest game for me to stop playing is BF2.\n\nThe graphics is 10 years old. But personally, I like games to look ‘realistic enough’ but don't care at all about picturesque graphics quality in today's games (especially to the extent of requiring and wasting CPU & GPU power).\nGameplay is most important, but graphics much less when determining what is fun - proof: CS 1.6 is still one of the most popular FPSs today and has many times more players than many latest pretty FPSs.\n\nUnlike all BF games from BFBC2 onwards, BF2 has a singleplayer mode, where instead of a campaign, you can play with bots in a multiplayer setting. Any idiot knows that there is no way any bots/AI no matter how good can match human opponents, nevertheless, it is still a fun option to have especially when the internet is down.\nThere are tons of mods available for BF2 which gives massive amount of gameplay options and also different games. For instance, the following link show more than 200 mods available:\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/games/battlefield-2/mods\n\nSome mods are very much more well known than others: Project Reality (which has become a standalone game), AIX 2.0, Forgotten Hope (WW2 setting), Project Alpha, and the list goes on and on. There is also a website offering advice and mods targeted on only the singleplayer aspect of the game:\n\nhttp://www.battlefieldsingleplayer.com/\n\nBF2 used to run on the Gamespy network, and since the Gamespy shut down in 2014, the BF2 community has created its own network to revive the multiplayer aspect of the game.\nEither if you are revisiting a game you once played, or even a new player curious to check out why some people remain hardcore fans of the game, it is very easy to get into the BF2 action, just visit:\n\nhttp://battlelog.co/\n\nhttp://battlelog.co/ is a one-stop center for all your BF2 needs: multiplayer network, files, patches, technical advice, a close-knit community etc. etc.\n\nSee you in the battlefield soldier :)","December 31, 2015","true","140.2"," 133 of 148 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","133","148","6","0"

With upwards of 1500 hours on this game since the demo and full game before Steam, I have yet to say any other game I have ever played comes even close to beating this game. The vehicular warfare, the infantry warfare, and the air warfare is all so smooth, and well flowing that it allows all three of those to come together in a nice combined arms to capture and control flags to win the game.\n\nGroundbreaking Features  Squads: Squads implement an entire new flow of gameplay PIONEERED by this game. The ability to spawn on the squad leader, and work together as a small team allows for amazing possibilities to take flags and objectives.\n\nCommander: The commander position in this game, I feel personally, has always been aimed towards RTS players. The commander has a DIRECT outcome on the game, and has power to call in supplies, vehicle drops, and even full blown artillery strikes on enemy hardpoints to allow squads to advance.\n\nKits: Kits have always been big in the Battlefield franchise, but this game was when I felt it truly started to show. The addition of the Medic, Support, and Engineer has added an entire new, dynamic gameplay mechanic that allows players to choose what they would like to do in the battlefield.\n\nGraphics: The graphics made a GIANT leap from the old, worn down Battlefield: Vietnam graphics, to groundbreaking HD gameplay that immersed players more than ever before.\nTo play this game now, for absolutely free, visit  here [www.battlelog.co] to get straight into the action!\n\nI'll see you on the Battlefield!","January 21","true","224.9"," 89 of 102 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","89","102","5","3"

I bought it on Steam, thinking that might solve the problem I was experiencing...It didn't.

In my opinion it hits the perfect balance between realism and a steady playability. There is different arsenals for each individual playable military force available (quite alot), a variety of big open maps, with semi-random objective generation and a realistic movementspeed, which forces the team to use vehicular resources intelligently and keep the flow going. The team will organize itself into squads, each having an individual task or role, such as infantry, artillery or transport, to name a few. The really good teamwork between the squads and the healthy community make sure, that each battle leaves back a unique experience.

After this EA Games got money greedy, and i honestly don't understand the hype about everything that came after this.\nThe freedom of choice by hosting from home, the pure combat without having an advantage with better weapons, simply choose class and get into the battle, where everyone has access to the same weapons, that's what is appealing to me.\nBF2 is as mentioned far from a dead game, thanks to mods that let you play online. Yeah EA games, you also turned your back on the modding community since BFBC2 , BF3 and so on.\nSo people BF2 still is highly playable and if you own it, then get some of the mods arround and play online.\n\nP.S.

One of the first memories I have of playing a huge multiplayer game and being gripped by it's promise of mayhem, destruction and teamwork. I even went as far as to buy a microphone so I could talk to people. TALK TO PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET!\nOh these were simpler times, before your Xbox 360s, PS3s and party chats. Before headsets were commonplace and teamwork was often done via macros, keybindings and speedy world record breaking text chat in-game to warn of an incoming squad attack. Oh those were simpler times indeed.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if nostalgia has taken over when thinking back to Battlefield 2, but I seem to have it high up there when I think of the Battlefield series. Sure it had it's issues when it was first released, but why even care about that now, the game has since been patched and those silly little bugs have gone (and strangely reappeared in later Battlefield games - reparing while inside Armor anyone?). Yet, the concept and maps were simple and not so grand and over the top to overshadow the actual gameplay and squad based mechanics of the game (which I think can be the issue with some the maps in BF3 and BF4).\n\nI guess if you've always been curious about the Battlefield series, but weren't sure where to begin than this game might be an OK starting point. However, you'll have to remember that this game is nearly a decade old and as such isn't going to look pretty, and it does have some very wonky mechanics, keybindings and movement issues. Yet, if you're stuck with an old machine and feel like you're missing out than BF2 should hold you over until you upgrade.\nI'm pretty sure there's still an OK community of players out there too, as well as various fan patches and mods (such as Project Reality) to enhance the gameplay features and breath new life into the aging Engine.\n\nIn fact... if you DO decide BF2 is for you, please DO download Project Reality if you're looking for the ideal squad based game.\n\nOverall Battlefield 2 has had it's moment, but it's still hanging around with a fair sized userbase considering how long it's been out. As long as you're not expecting modern levels of detail, visuals, sounds, crazy maps then I can't imagine you'd be too disappointed in BF2. If you're looking for a slower paced BF experience that relies on Teamwork then you might actually be surprised.\nSo that's why I'd recommend this game, as long as you know what you're looking for.","December 27, 2013","true","0.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

I had this game since its release but decided to buy it for my Steam account so that I don't have CD's or serial keys to lose!\n\nThis game supports up to 64 players on one server so that can certainly lead to some intense combat situations, especially on the smaller maps. The infantry combat might be a tad underwhelming compared to 2142 but it still feels pretty good. I don't like how iffy movement can be but it's something that you'll forget about after some time with the game. Vehicle combat is where it's at though. Having such a large arsenal of vehicles at your disposal is a lot of fun. The only downside is that when on the larger maps you can end up being stranded for a good deal of time when you don't have a vehicle. It doesn't take that long to spawn them once they're destroyed but the problem lies when there's so many people on a server that everyone is using every available vehicle and you're miles from the AO.\n\nIf you've never played this game then I strongly suggest buying it. The mod support is absoutely fantastic. Mods such as Project Reality, AIX 2.0, and Forgotten Hope 2 bring new life to this game. So be sure to check them out on ModDB, it might do some better convincing than this review!","December 5, 2013","true","136.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

There is nothing ever so fulfilling then do that!\n\nThis game comes with Punkbuster, so cheaters you havebeen warned. Some people in the xommunity have issues with Punkbuster kicking them, if that ever happens to you, then I have a guide in the guides telling you on how to fix it.\n\nThis game has offline multiplayer battles with bots. If you wanna play this game for the purpose of playing with bots, then you're gonna be bored very fast, as they are not a challenge.\n\nHowever, like every other game, this game as well has its flaws.\n- Some servers that are half full are actually empty. Forexample, I would stay away from servers that SAY they have 100/256 players in them, but in reality they're empty.\n- Punkbuster kicks users for no reason. I have a guide in the guides telling you on how to fix this.\n- Modding the game (mods are not hacks, remember that!) forfeits your multiplayer.","December 20, 2013","true","66.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","4"

Battlefield 2 is a sequel from the previous Battlefield 1942.\n\nBattlefield 2 set in modern world. Faction that are available in this game are US, Chinese, Middle East Coalition and the European Union. Battlefield 2 has improved gameplay. Teamworks has been improved a lot as now forming a squad is possible. Squad leader can call in a vehicle drop, artillery strikes or UAV recon to scout some area. A commander mode has also been introduced. Commander are responsible for giving each squad order to attack specific point, confirming squad leaders request and coordinating his team to victory. Commander mode interface is almost similar to real-time strategy game. Player can now get awards, medals and ribbon as they play, and when enough rank is achieved, a new weapon can be unlocked for each class.\n\nBattlefield 2 has good graphics and effects. The maps on Battlefield 2 are even bigger and more detailed. Soldiers animation has also been improved a lot. The game also runs optimized with all these graphics improvements.\n\nBattlefield 2 is a good game on its age.

With involvments of Veichles, figheter jets and helicopters in which you can use without any restrictions.  It can be played with up to 64 players per map and is mostly played in conquest mode. It was one of the first games to introduce online ranking in which you level up and can unlock weapons for all the classes. You can form squads and plan strikes at different objectives to help your team out. You can also be the commander and use the Artillery, UAV and drop supply boxes and veichles. Overall you get an intense gameplay experiance in this game and you should give it a try.\n\nThis game also has some rather awesome mods such as Project Reality which still to this day is an active mod. There are also many other cool mods for this game such as the Pirate mod and Desert Conflict.\n\nThis was also the first game I was involved in any form of Clan/Community. But we were basictly only 10 friends who played togheter on random servers and such. We were so young and stupid :P.\n\nAnyways try this old masterpiece out. You dont have to worry about the DLCs and such since this was before EA started to ♥♥♥♥ on their fans by adding DLC map packs that you had to buy.\n\n9/10","May 1, 2014","true","16.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Battlefield 2 is highly focused on teamwork, unlike the recent titles. This particular game defines Battlefield for me. It's the real Battlefield gameplay. If you have missed these times, well, in 2005 this game blew the gaming world! It had its issues, but they were just a scratch on this giant beast of a game!

After the last update the AI is broken and now you can't get "air drops" or "artillery" support if you are not the commander and it is impossible to undo this changes.

Download and play the "Project Reality" mod. It is absolutely amazing, like Arma for people who aren't geeky enough to waste time with milsims. You can download it for free without BF2 at moddb.com, however you won't be able to play on ranked servers.\n\n__________________________\nReview of the vanilla game:\n\nStill a very good Battlefield game. The gameplay is more similar to the orginal 1942 game, with a modern theme, and not very much like the newer BF3 and BF4 games, which are more organized and team-oriented and with more content, although BF2 I feel offers more freedom. However I feel that BF2 is even further from realism than the modern Battlefield games. The gunplay really lacks sometimes, and accuracy is serioulsly nerfed for some reason. I can only assume that this is to make maps feel larger and give purpose to the sniper class? Still, much better than COD.\n\nServers have been down since GameSpy died, but if you want to play multiplayer (because singleplayer is kind of broken) there is a very simple mod created by an awesome team that is keeping BF2 alive: http://www.battlelog.co/\n\nAgain, best thing about BF2 is the Project Reality mod.","July 21, 2015","true","10.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

But it took Battfield 1942 and Vietnam to get there (both interesting games in their own right as well). Much like Relic had to make Dawn of War before they got to Company of Heroes. You can still pick this up through Amazon and in second hand game bins so I'm not going to recommend legally dubious free downloads out there, even if its not for sale on Steam at the moment. It's a mystery that maybe only EA/DICE knows why they departed from the Battlefield formulae and basically trashed a recipe that had created something unique in later releases. But, frankly, *WHO CARES* ! Battlefield 2 is really still very much alive with releases still coming out from mods like Forgotten Hope - http://forgottenhope.warumdarum.de/ - and Project Reality - http://realitymod.com/ - that are both total conversions. If you still like the vanilla game play then there's plenty of player made levels out there, and even if you can't find a server then Battlefield 2 still packs a mean game in there thanks to its (still very advanced) AI bots. AI game modes can include Coop so you play with a few friends with bots included. Further Coop/SP stuff can be found here - http://battlefieldsingleplayer.com ... So still after all these years Battefield 2 could teach a lot to new game designers. I was reading another comment that pointed out that the commander mode is aimed at RTS players and it struck me that BF2 is almost a weird RTS hybrid, a bit like a Company of Heroes RTS where all those little soldiers can be played with human players. But whatever it is BF2 never fails to bring me that "immersion" effect where I feel like I'm in a situation fighting for my life rather than in a video game.","March 14","true","25.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The base game is fun for what it is, but the main attraction of this game for me was the mods that go along with the game. Battlefield 2 has a huge modding community that is fairly strong even to this day. The multiplayer community is almost completely gone, but with offline bot play that will be no problem. If you are looking for online play, some of the larger mods still have fairly active servers, depending on the day. If you do pick this game up be sure to check out Forgotten Hope 2 (a realistic WWII mod), Project Reality (a combat simulation mod), and Alpha Project (a bloody fun mod) on ModDB. They are all free and definately make this game definately worth the $20 price tag.","July 3, 2014","true","32.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With 2k hours clocked on the disk version I can say I love this game. Why? It has the bases covered. Singleplayer practice, multiplayer with stats, land/air vehicles mixed with infantry, with a fine balance between realism and arcade. It has dozens of little bugs left in even after the patches, but respect to EA for rescuing it from the 4:3 era by patching it to 16:9. BF1942 and BF3 are different products, making BF2 unique. I'd say it left a big footprint in gaming, but the boot is still firmly on the ground as people still play it. At 2,100 hours I'm still flying jets under bridges, rocketing from choppers, aiming anti-armour weapons at the tanks treads, trying to snipe headshots, and running face first into the meatgrinder as medic. The gameplay stands up while the graphics are ageing. Yes it's old, but then you know it'll run smoothly on modern hardware.","May 5, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With 2k hours clocked on the disk version I can say I love this game. Why? It has the bases covered. Singleplayer practice, multiplayer with stats, land/air vehicles mixed with infantry, with a fine balance between realism and arcade. It has dozens of little bugs left in even after the patches, but respect to EA for rescuing it from the 4:3 era by patching it to 16:9. BF1942 and BF3 are different products, making BF2 unique. I'd say it left a big footprint in gaming, but the boot is still firmly on the ground as people still play it. At 2,100 hours I'm still flying jets under bridges, rocketing from choppers, aiming anti-armour weapons at the tanks treads, trying to snipe headshots, and running face first into the meatgrinder as medic. The gameplay stands up while the graphics are ageing.

Giving the player the option of a vast collcetion of varied maps, Battlefield 2 puts you where you want to be, whether it's in the heart of the action by sprinting across the battlefield with your rifle in one hand and a C4 explosive in the other, or safely tucked away inside an armored tank surrounded by enough firepower to make Dan Bilzerian green with envy.

Become a commander of your team and lead them to victory by deploying supplies, vehicles and even bombing huge areas of the map with artillery for massive points and to help your team progress!\n\nThis game's atmosphere is really set in stone, with dreary looking outsets of what appears to be Arabic architecture to forestry and urban settings. As for the games mechanics, they are basic with some aspects of levelling involved such as Ranks which indicate how long the player has been with BF2 and his status with medals, new equipment and status. You can control absolutely every vehicle from Jets, infantry vehicles, AA gunners, deploy artillery onto areas to kill or clear the area.\n\nBe warned that this game is NOT friendly to new players, you will find yourself dying a lot from grenade kills and generally better equipped players who had more experience. You may need to download Punkbuster to update the game manually when buying it on Steam as it will not let you play on Secure servers, it's easy to do, just download the Windows executable @ www.evenbalance.com and get the one you need (32bit)\n\np.s I might make changes to my reviews to give accurate information and/or updates to its current state","January 8, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I felt pretty good about myself. I’d even lead squads, risking my neck for my men – so long as none of them were scoring higher than me.\nThen, after a long and happy career, I looked at my stats page. Kills to deaths? Not good, but that’s ok, I was a Medic. Score per minute? Not good, but that’s ok, I did a lot to help my team that wasn’t always rewarded. Wins to losses? Oh. Oh God.\nApparently I acted as some kind of bad luck charm, or perhaps just a terrible-teamplay charm, because having me on your side made you about 15% less likely to win.

All of these suggestions are great, fact of the matter is http://www.realitymod.com/ You cant kill this. Project Reality Mod for BF2 makes it a whole new game, new textures, new sounds, multiple new factions, 2 different game modes(AAS, Insurgency). Be warned tho this a a heavily team based mod, teamwork is essential. For this very reason, Project Reality has incorperated a system called Mumble, which allows the use of not only a squad leader to squad member comms, but a local area proximity comms. All in all this game is not for the faint of heart, can get extremely intense.","April 22, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

BF2 Special Forces is a fantastic addon to BF2 just like Euro Forces but this time in special forces you play as the SAS team and get cool gadgets and weapons it still has Conquest mode just being the SAS team. Overall I think BF2 is a huge improvment to 1942 while 1942 is still fun I think BF2 will be even better if you have not played either games I think you should get BF2 for $20.00 it really is worth the price it is fantastic and I cannot recommend it enough it is a fantastic game to add to your collection. So I suggest when you have some money to spend on a game I suggest you get BF2 it will not dissapoint you at all it is truly fantastic.","May 4, 2014","true","123.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

According to me Battlefield 2 is the best battlefield game ever made then comes battlefield 1942 because if you just dont mind the graphics and play the game with a couple of friends on a server or a lan server you will understand.                                                                                                                 It feels like for every Battlefield game that has come out after Battlefield 1942 you become "less free".\nNow what do i mean free? In the newer battlefield games animation takes a bigger part of the game. Like for example when you knife somebody you get into a animation instead of ragdolls just doing their amazing job.\nAnother example is the kill cam after each time you get killed it really just ruins everything, giving away your position and so on.                                                                                                                After 1942 alot of stuff was removed like driving bigger ships, all of the historical battles, the "reality" of the battles and much more.\n\nIt seems to me like Battlefield is becoming more and more like the newest call of duties which are stupid and ridiculous at the same time according to me.\nTakes away the whole "reality" part and replaces it with trick shots and other ridiculous stuff.                                                              But Battlefield according to me is when the Battlefield series was at its best.                                                                                      With the light feeling that you can jump around and get in to battle quick but at the same time the "iraq war" feeling.\nSo here are the main reasons why you should buy the game.\n* Light feeling in battles. * Less animations then the other games/Ragdolls take larger part in Bf2.\n* "Iraq war feeling" * Large maps * A "free feeling"\n* More serious than newer battlefield games/ Cod games( Older players, almost no trick shots.","March 16, 2014","true","474.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Interesting how there's a "Funny" button to rate reviews, gotta please those dank "lel 11/10 u can tek pants off ;) review" memesters.\n\nAnyway. Battlefield 2 is considered a very good entry in the Battlefield series. At the time? ♥♥♥♥ yeah, this game can be fun as ♥♥♥♥ and I bet when it came out in 2005 it would've blown your mind playing it for the first time. But now? It's pretty bland and boring most of the times. Your selection of weapons is pretty small, the classes are pretty badly set up, and recoil is handled terribly in the game. The community is pretty dedicated, and you'll find most of the time there's about 10 servers populated throughout the day. The modding community is pretty good aswell- If you get this game, I'd highly recommend getting Project Reality. If you're not from the US, Forgotten Hope 2 is also a good mod if you like WW2. The only active server I've seen on there is based in the UK I think.

If you're looking for fast paced fps it might be good. If you want a game that can be both challenging and not stressful then forget this one.\n\nYou don't have the option of enjoying a more relaxed and slow paced game like you could on BF 1942. In comparison to it, the maps have increased in size, which is good for aerial combat, on the other hand the controls for helicopter and jet are terrible, you need a ♥♥♥♥ ton of practice to be as efficient as a bot on easy mode, and if your vehicle is hit somewhere you might as well suicide 'cause if you walk you'll only reach an outpost at the end of the game.\n\nSo to sum it up, you always gotta play 100% serious to win, the enemy bots are kinda advanced even on easy, they move very quickly, hide and flank, and always have a counter for your own. It's good challenge, but I'm not recommending it 'cause it doesn't give you at all the option of enjoying a more playground style gameplay with the vehicles and stuff, and for this kind of gameplay there are much better games out there.","March 7, 2015","false","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Technically there are mods, community servers and LANs which can potentially allow play with others, but EA ceased official online support a couple of years ago.\n\nSingle player offers nothing essentially.  There is no campaign.  You are dropped into a map with bots filling the roles of other players and team based objectives to complete, such as securing points.\n\nOther than a bare loading screen description about what forces are battling and why – there isn’t any real narrative or driving story.  The match ends when points happen.\n\nI realise that BF2 is primarily a multiplayer game but even Unreal Tournament had a contest around which to frame it’s bot matches – something that could be progressed.\n\nThose 23 minutes of play had some tense moments, frustrations and satisfactions but since your AI teammates are morons, and your respawn points miles from the action (with no intelligent friends to pick you up in a vehicle), there is a lot of nothing happening as most of the time is spent running with just the sound of wind to keep you company.\n\nThis game has a bit of a legacy so I’m sure that the weapons and classes are balanced, that strategies and command centres are well designed, and blah blah blah… it no longer matters.  There’s just no one there to take advantage of these systems and the game can no longer be played as it was originally intended.  It’s a long abandoned, malfunctioning playground now.\n\nBattlefield 2 isn’t even on sale any more.  So this ‘review’ is just for the very specific people in my position – those who have the game on their list and are wondering if there is anything worth their time.\n\nThere isn’t.\n\nFor other modern day reviews for classic games you may consider buying check out my site at:\n\nhttp://theboilingpot.net/","March 8","false","0.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","3"

This is still the premier Battlefield game for anyone to purchase. There is just so much more teamwork in this game than anything else. People actually use mics, receive and follow orders, and capture objectives. The community in this is very hardcore so those who want to run and gun in this game should probably look elsewhere. The mod support for this game is phenomenal because of Project Reality just changing the entire experience of BF2 to a realistic war. The game's controls may seem clunky by today's standard of fluid FPS, but don't pass up on this game. You simply do not find games like this thesedays because the entire industry is based on instant gratification and "accessibility" and trying to be something they are not.

While there are no "officially" supported servers running today, the community is still large enough to host a number of games on a number of different sites.\n\nJust because the game hasn't aged well doesn't mean that the graphics aren't still impressive, especially when you consider the scale of this game's maps. The controls are smooth, and whether you're on the ground, in the air, or behind the wheel, you can count on tight control over your warfighter.\n\nThe amount of content in this game is massive.

Now lets continue, Battlefield 2 is the sequel to the game Battlefield 1942 which released to critical accliam. I loved the game and so should you! That game came out back in 2001, and this one was released in 2005, so a bit of a gap there! I was only 2 when this came out but when I saw it BOOOM! my mind blew up. I was hooked and I got it ASAP when I was 8, gg my brain. I should have got this ages ago but now I have discovered how good this game is now. First of all its battlefield, its going to be good and ironically the second best BF is the next one 2142. Now the basics, you shoot by shooting (ITSVERYSIMPLEYPUKNOW) and to jump you press a bar, any bar maybe a bar in space. Ok i get, you know the controls but did you know in the expansion pack special forces (codenamed xpack for some reason) you press 'g' to pickup your rope but you'd know that if you picked up project reality which is a great mod you should play. So when I got into the game I had to create a account, well a offline or online one but I was too stupid to create an online so I chose 'defaultplayer' WHAT A SEXY NAME LADIES AND MENTLEGEN!!!! I started the game and played dailiq-ching-chang-china-chong oil fields. I had a lot of fun for a while, and then I discovered mods and also the soundtrack to this game is the bees knees. I got this one mod, I don't quite remember what it was but I think it was Omnicide? anyway the mod was a zambeh mod.\n\n9.98/10 IM TOO LAZY TO FINISH THE REVIEW I NEED TO GO TO BED NEXT PART COMING SUMMER 9999.","May 29, 2011","true","47.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Over time lost the disks, but bought this as soon as I saw it on Steam.  It's too bad that gamespy had to kick the bucket because so did all of the servers.  At least there are various other ways to still play the multiplayer in this game such as GameRanger to name one.  But this game really holds close to me bacuse I played this a lot as a kid and I have been able to have the same ammount of fun now as when I was younger.\n\nLarge mulitplayer games\n\nVarious vehicles(Tanks, IFVs, LAVs, scout vehicles, boats and aircraft.\n\nDifferent roles for your team so you can get the job done and not have everyone as the same class.  Which I actually miss because 4 classes I think there is too much going into each class(As seen in the newer Battlefields(BC 1&2, BF3 & BF4) and it overpowers each class becuase you have this one guy who can do a million things as oppposed to,  "Hey, I am this and you are that, lets work togeather with our two different classes to take this objective, or destroy this target.  ETC....  It would be a lot more fun if they opened it back up to the 7 very specific classes in BF2, such as Special Forces, Sniper, Assault, Support, Engineer, Medic, Anti-Tank.  Who dosent want to be special forces anyway? :)\n\nThis series is not like COD and should never end up like COD either.  This game is built on teamwork and huge maps.  Unlike COD where you go around shooting eachother for no point like a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing ISIS pigs going through a small village.  But I guess the pat EA takes now a days it will eventually end up like COD, its a damn shame.  I guess the New Star Wars Battlefront will be the last one before EA makes Dice do something stupid.  I think they were well on the way with that when they released BF Hardline.  For the most part it was ok, but its starting to get into that COD theme.\n\nOh and check out Project Reality, it practiaclly brings this game back to life.","July 4, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What really makes this game great is the modding community and the multiplayer. Sadly the multiplayer is gone and the only mod that I have that has working multiplayer is Project Reality. Aside from that the mods make up for mostly because some of the mods like AIX2 for example mainly focus on the ai in singleplayer making the replay value more valueable. Overall I will give the game in its current state a 8.5/10. I will bump this up to a 9.5/10 if EA or Gamespy make the multiplayer work again if they ever do so that is. Overall this is a great 20$ game even if the multiplayer does not work at the moment. My recomendation if you want to make this game replayable is to get mods that focus on singleplayer, like AIX2 and Forgotten Hope 2 for example. If you are looking for a realistic experience using BF2 get Project Reality which will make you feel like you are in a real battlefield, The good news for PR2 is that it has working multiplayer! So you can play with strangers and freinds alike. Hopefully this review helps you decide whenever you should get this game or not. If you still can't decide, watch some youtube videos on the game itself and the mods I listed. Hopefully after that you can make your choice.","June 4, 2015","true","27.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sequal to the less well-known Battlefield Vietnam, and the famous Battlefield 1942. Possibly one of the most realistic games in the series, Battlefield 2 is an intense, action-packed military simulation with well designed maps and realistic properties such as huge maps, advanced vehicle physics and the extreme danger of being in large areas including fields, highways, deserts and large-scaled enemy bases. The game has a modernized set of weapons including the SA80, F2000, MP7 and G36C. It has a large variety of maps primarily taking place in China, but there are a large number of Middle-Eastern maps and some US maps. The highlight of this game is the extreme danger of being anywhere outside of base. The enemy is open to tons of killing machines; Tanks, APCs, Jets, Helicopters, Boats, Guns, and even Artillery cannons. It is certainly worth the money if you like intense action.","February 14, 2014","true","192.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But although i enjoy this game, it is definitly not without faults such as;\n-Horrible bot accuracy   i can barely go a game without having a teamkill- by a bot!\n-lack of singleplayer maps and too few bots   the issue with too few maps can be fixed by installing mods(reallywish they would come to steam workshop!), and the bots can be fixed by hosting a local coop multiplayer game with up to 48 bots instead of just 16, but this is very, very, very hectic at times\nBut all things considered, it is a great game.  i think you should get it.  and not just for yourself, for all of you siblings, your spouse, the person your cheating on your spouse with, your aunt, your uncle, you grandparents, your kids, your dog, your fishes twice removed great uncle, let everybody share the fun!","June 8, 2014","true","82.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It may not be the game that first got me into online gaming, but it is certainly the one I've spend the most time on. Massive maps, multiple classes and weapons, squad-play and commander tiers, and a variety of vehicles make the game easy to pick up and difficult to master. Over 5 years on and I'm still not bored of it. The slow accumulation of points makes it unlike the typical multiplayer game you get bored of after a week when everyone and their mother has reached the top rank.\n\n\n\nThe Special Forces expansion pack added cool new gadgets like zip-lines and grappling hooks, as well as great new maps. Unfortunately, at this stage in the game's lifespan, SF is mostly dead.\n\n\n\nWith robust mods like AIX and Project Reality, there is surely something for everyone.","April 13, 2011","true","113.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it is an older game so the graphics arn't that great. Also punkbuster will kick from matches for no reason. But if you do get into a match it is a whole lotta fun with the commander system you can command your teams squads and soldiers around and call in artillery strikes.

UNPLAYABLE if that`s how it is now.  Single player version seems to be all that will keep me on this game and that will be all of 30 mins then bored. Shame but we were written off just because gamespy shutdown, EA just don`t give a ♥♥♥♥.  Makes me wonder if spending money on their games means anything nowadays. Piracy welcomes me back somehow with EA f^^^ers!!","July 20, 2014","true","462.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
