I bought it to see what it was like on PC.\n\nThe good parts of the game would be - having lot of levels, different gods to choose from (about 20) and some form of strategical placement when it comes to using your spells. By that, I mean that you don't just simply spam the spells as much as you want. You have to make the humans like you by casting "good" spells in order to gain worship, which is the resource used to cast other, more offensive spells for destroying their tower. Basically, you have to find a balance between appeasing the humans and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off by destroying their tower.  It's an interesting combination which makes it unique and offers some depth in the otherwise very standard affair of stopping bad guys from getting from one end to the other.\n\nNow for the bad. The game is an android port. It certainly looks like one and plays like one. The menus on 1920x1080 look pixelated and stretched while the models and textures are pretty lackluster. It's not ugly, but it's not pretty either. The game also starts getting pretty hectic later on, where the difficulty wasn't too well thought out and instead of thinking about enemy unit combinations and synergy, they basically throw in as many of the big units as possible to give some semblance of difficulty. After a while, the game also starts to feel like a grind, but what do you expect from a tower defence game?\n\nProblems aside, this game is pretty good for how much it costs, especially with the sale. It's a solid defence game with some nice depth to keep you interested. It's going to feel like a grind at times but if you don't mind it too much, the game is pretty fun.","October 11, 2014","true","0.9"," 155 of 169 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","155","169","0","0"

Check out my podcast Steam on the Cheap where I review cheap games and let you know if they are worth your money.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/steam-on-cheap-discovering/id899847567?mt=2\n\nGods vs Humans is a quirky tower defence style game that does not reinvent the genre but does add a neat twist.\nHere is my video review and keep reading for a more indepth review here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhq07wcPw8&feature=youtu.be\n\nFirst off this game has a lot of depth for a $7 dollar game. The idea is simple. You are one of 20 different gods trying to stop the humans from building a tower to destroy you. Through the levels you will play as Egyptian, Greek, Nordic, and Japanese gods each with unique settings, tower and powers. (Nice rhyme i know)\n\nEach god has their specific set of powers as well as commons ones shared. You will use your powers to destroy pillars to bring down a section of the temple until the whole temple collapses. If the humans reach you then boom your dead and they are now gods. By the way you don’t want that to happen.\n\nThe difficulty ramps up because following old mythology you get you power from the worship of humans so if you harm them while destroying the tower they become angry with you and severely limits your power. Also there are evil priests that try to convert the humans and supervisors you have to keep happy or else the workers will repair the pillars faster than you can destroy them. There are also protectors on some floors that will counteract certain spells meaning you can use fire on a level or maybe lighting on a different one.\n\nSo far I am finding this game to be very challenging and one that I can't stop playing because I want to see what they are going to throw at me next.\n\nAs of now I am recommending this game even more so because it is half off so it is definitely worth it.\n\nI will update this review if I find anything that changes my mind or find things that are cool and you should not about. Don’t forget to click yes if you found this review helpful Thanks :)\n\nUpdate 5 hours in and still enjoying this game. It does get pretty hard so prepare to get frustrated here and there :)","October 10, 2014","true","5.4"," 173 of 226 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","173","226","0","0"

Like, I don't know, gathering faith represented by tokens, to purchase powers/upgrades. It feels too much repetitive and slow. I could hardly make it through 4 levels without shutting it down. The tendention of porting mobile games to PC is kind of a problem right now. No, I'm not saying that all ported games are weak.

You are tasked with being a God; I have lots of experience with that so it wasn't a problem. You have to destroy the structure of your insolent worshipers. You have a plethora of God-like spells to use, as you fight to bring it down.\n\nI didn't like that if you focus on the bottom of the tower you could complete the level more quickly than you should. It is unique that you have to zoom in on different sections of the tower with a mini-map. However, since you can just destroy the bottom level it's somewhat irrelevant.\n\nWorth a dollar.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Essentially, you're a god who's trying to prevent the humans from reaching you via a tower they are building.  It'll be up to you to keep them happy and knock down their tower at the same time.  Anger them, and your "worship" points trickle in much more slowly (preventing you from using god powers as often).  They also work faster when they're angry, which is bad.

The problem is, it's way to repetitive. I got bored about halfway through the tutorial, but I pressed on, because I thought it might get better from there. It did not. The interface is rather sloppily put together, with the numbers on the abilities not actually working, and just having an overall feel of being designed solely for mobile and then simply released as a PC game. Even the sale price I bought it at is too much to be asked for. In my opinion, the developers should either have spent a lot more time on the PC interface, or just stuck to mobile-exclusive.","April 3, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
