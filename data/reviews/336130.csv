Their latest entry, Shardlight, doesn’t stray too far from the design mindset they’ve carved within adventure gaming in the last decade – and while this more than often works to its benefit it sometimes also, much like its other recent adventure games that haven’t strayed too far from the beaten path, detracts from the overall experience.\n\nOnce you start the game you’re tossed unceremoniously into the post-apocalyptic world of Shardlight. Rather than a long scene explaining how things became what they are, you find yourself in the shoes of Amy Wellard, a mechanic who’s doing “lottery jobs” – highly demanding and dangerous tasks – in order to have a chance at winning the vaccine for Green Lung, a disease she’s just started showing the symptoms for, and is now on a job for the Ministry of Energy to fix an underground reactor that’s stopped working.\n\nAnd if that seems nonchalant, it’s because for the most part it is. Most of what you piece together about the world and what led it to its current state, or at least the state of the city in which the game transpires, is obtained by observation, dialogue and reading. The inhabitants of this post-apocalyptic Oceanic town don’t dwell too much in the past, as they’ve got enough problems as it is, and seeing such a society represented as a continued attempt to survive and thrive rather than collapsed in pitiful wallowing was a breath of fresh air from a genre that too often overshoots by being too ambitious about its narrative. By keeping it simple I thought the world was more credible, as you’d expect that the people of a town that’s been in such a situation for over a decade to be more preoccupied with their daily issues – gas masks, failing crops and issue with their livestock – than matters of a more philosophical persuasion. A scene in particular at the beginning of the game had me smiling: you find a few kids playing with a skipping rope, and can ask to play with them – at which point you’re given a list of five or six rhymes that Amy can sing while jumping, all appropriate to the game’s setting.\n\nPast the first part you’re given access to a limited amount of the game’s areas – four to start with, two of which are conjoined. By doing this the developers manage to remove an issue that often rears its ugly head in point and click adventure games: the excess of possibility. No one enjoys scouring dozens of different areas with different combinations of items, testing that stick they found an hour ago against every single object and trying multiple combinations just to get a smidgen of progress, something that’s also reflected in the modest amount of objects you’ll have at any given time in your inventory.\n\nThat isn’t to say Shardlight manages to avoid all issues that point and click adventure games frequently have. While for the most part I felt that how to solve each puzzle was easily discovered after giving some thought and trial, those of the more indirect or esoteric nature presented a challenge that I personally found unwelcome. In a genre where solving puzzles revolves around you adding A with B and reaching a conclusion, when the bridge between the two points is either too fractured or too long the solution starts to become less a product of your intellect and more one of incessant trial and error. The first third of the game has a puzzle that I felt particularly obtuse, requiring you to discover just how to obtain an object that allows you to interact with a chalkboard – which then, to my surprise, actually held an interesting puzzle. Although this did not happen often, the few times it did during my playthrough managed to evoke all the reasons why I’m usually not fond of the point and click genre, getting stuck because of two or three instances where the solution to a puzzle wasn’t necessarily a product of logic, but a keen eye and repetition.\n\nThese setbacks didn’t overpower that which I found the best part of the game, however: the character interactions and the world’s design. It was evident from my first visit to the Market district that a lot of effort had been put into creating a believable world not only by the storytellers, but by the pixel artist and sound designer. The voice acting was, surprisingly, a high-point – while Wadjet Eye’s crew of voice actors seem mercurial in their past games, with performances of varying quality within each one, in Shardlight it was consistently good and believable. The portraits and pixel art are also gorgeous to look at, although the trappings of the old Adventure Game Studio engine continue to show – the game’s low resolution means it’ll look gradually worse the higher the resolution you play it at.\n\nWhile I felt the puzzle design did falter a couple of times throughout my playthrough, for the most part I enjoyed the creative use of your tools and how most puzzles always had someone or something that would nudge you toward the solution if you weren’t figuring it out – unsurprisingly, the moments where this might’ve been needed the most it was absent, and then I had to rely on persistent trial and error. Despite the innovation in some puzzles and in how your inventory is more concise than the norm in adventure games, Shardlight still is very much your typical point and click adventure – to those who the genre might feel stale, Shardlight will give you little solace.\n\nIt took me a bit less than ten hours to complete the game, a couple of which were due to two puzzles that had me stumped for hours. The lack of player agency in the story that I felt throughout most of the game means there’s little to see of new when you do a second playthrough, and I felt satisfied with my single journey through the game and its story – which I won’t spoil to you, as it is definitely the sort of thing you’ll enjoy more once you see it for the first time. Within the point and click adventure genre there’s little to criticize of Shardlight and much to praise – from innovative puzzle design to superb voice acting and presentation – and that more than made it an adventure game I gladly played in a single sitting, curious to see how the mystery unfolds and never frustrated by its puzzles to the point of quitting (although once or twice that did almost happen).","March 8","true","16.1"," 54 of 68 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","54","68","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exaltedandforgotten/recommended/336130/","exaltedandforgotten","†◎urε††ε","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exaltedandforgotten/","863 products in account","Shardlight is a post-apocalyptic point and click adventure game developed and produced by Wadjet Eye Games, and also serves as my introduction to them as a viable gaming company. I've seen the Blackwell games on steam; I've thought about purchasing them whenever they go on sale, but to this day I've never added them to my cart. Shardlight was... well, it was a different story for me because I felt drawn to it when I first saw it in the steam store.\n\n\nThe Story\nPicture it; a city skyline of crumbling skyscrapers, half destroyed by war and time. The weeds, vines, and various other flora slowly overtaking government buildings, streets, statues. Rusting cars, scavenged to bare bones, littering the streets. The poor huddled in decaying structures, eyes sunken, starved. Filth and disease rampant throughout large sections of city that are blocked off and guarded by well-dressed soldiers, working for a corrupted aristocracy that receives only the best care the city can afford. A dystopian city, in every sense.\n\n\nYou play as a young woman named Amy, who suffers from Green Lung, a post-war disease that ultimately ends the lives of whomever contracts it. With time running out, and your desperation growing stronger, you take up a "Lottery Job" to receive a ticket for a chance to win a vaccine that will let you live.\n\n\nThe job? Fix the reactor that keeps the water running for the Aristocracy... an easy enough job until you get to the sector core and find partially collapsed walls, corroded serial numbers, and a dying man. The dying man begs you to end his life, but not before he makes you promise to deliver a letter to a mysterious person called "Danton." After you deliver the letter, you find yourself enveloped into the resistance, a group trying to overthrow Tiberius, the corrupt leader of the city. Will you get your vaccine? Will you find a cure for Green Lung? Will you overthrow the corrupt government?\n\nWhat I liked\n* The game is fully voiced, with even minor characters having pretty good voice actors reading their lines.\n* Amazing soundtrack of various genres that are not too soft and not too loud and add more depth to the aesthetics of the game.\n* Puzzles that aren’t too difficult, but aren’t too “in your face” easy to solve.\n* A rich storyline with good dialogue, that actually gets more intense in the second half of the game.\n* Three different endings to choose from\n* A character that I can relate to, meaning she doesn’t have super strength, but is smart enough to survive in the poor side of town.\n* The graphics are absolutely stunning, especially for pixel art, which is a hit or miss to me.\n\nWhat I didn’t like\n* I didn’t care for two of the endings of the game; they just felt underwhelming to me.\n*  I’m not sure if it was a bug, or intentional, but during the last half of the game I experienced dialogue that was sped up to the point where I couldn’t actually read the conversations because it auto-sped through them. Reloading game did not fix this, and only happened maybe 25% of the time in the last half.\n* The world felt rather small to me, but given that you’re playing in the remains of the city, is understandable.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nShardlight is one of the few games that I’ve bought off steam and played directly after purchase, and this says a lot, since I normally stick with a select few games, or MMORPGs. The price of the game is acceptable for the length of the game (although I'd like it to have been a few hours longer), and does have some replay ability potential. I am not normally a fan of point and click games, but feel this rates up there with Funcom’s The Longest Journey, as both were immersive and fun for me. Wadjet Eye Games is definately on my radar now for immersive point and click games","March 12","true","8.1"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","5"

You play as Amy Wellard a young mechanic who lives in the remnants of what is hinted at to be Australia after a catastrophic war.  Society is struggling under the yoke of the deadly disease known as The Green Lung and the authoritarian rule of the Aristocrats, the politicians of the Old World who have adopted Roman names and Elizabethan attire. But all is not hopeless as Amy finds herself entwined in a plot that can change the future of the society in which she lives.\n\nShardlight’s narrative isn’t going to surprise you too much but it’s well-executed so that you care about the characters and what’s going on. Shardlight’s world is also nicely fleshed out, unlike in most post-apoc games, it’s not a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, people are struggling and dying, but they are no roaming gangs or mutants or anything like that and there is civilization, just a heavily stratified one. The game also lets you settle into Amy’s city and let you get to know her friends and neighbors which also helps to engage you. It’s a somber game that manages to maintain a strong bleak atmosphere without devolving into cheap nihilism and this is strongly supported by how human and relatable the characters are, there is little in the way of cackling raiders killing helpless people for cheap laughs, just broken people struggling to bring structure to a broken world. Gameplay wise it’s pretty good, most of the puzzles are logical enough and there’s only like one part where it feels a bit obtuse where you have to give a character an item after doing a bit of an unrelated thing when otherwise they would just tell you to buzz off and it’s not all that obvious.\n\nOverall, its yet another great WadjetEye game and a must play for adventure game fans.","March 9","true","8.1"," 35 of 48 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","35","48","2","2"

Green Lung has gripped their community, the only medicine a vaccine in scarce supply. While the wealthy elite pay to stay healthy the poor must risk their lives, performing dangerous government jobs in exchange for a chance of winning meager vaccine doses in a stacked-odds lottery.\n\nStep into Amy's well-worn shoes to explore a dying city, navigate its social hierarchy, and expose the secrets that plague a community still suffering from the devastation of war. With old-school pixel-art graphics, classic point & click gameplay, and high production values all around, Shardlight is an ambitious game from the studio behind the Blackwell mysteries, A Golden Wake, and many other acclaimed indie adventures released over the past ten years.\n\nI enjoy Wadjet Eyes ability to make me care about a world and its inhabitants. Amy was a great character and watching her grow and learn about this world she lives in was a lot of fun. Since this game is very story driven and For the sake of spoilers I will say simply I enjoyed the story, the world was a lot of fun to explore and learn about while trying to help Amy and her friends. The world felt alive and thats what i enjoy about Wadjet Eye Games.\n\nThe gameplay of Shardlight is your typical point and click style gameplay, you collect objects and once you have the right peices to the puzzle you use them and continue on. The Creators do a great job designing sensible puzzles that feel real enough to belong in the world. There were a few cases were I got stuck and had to step away from the game and really think about it but for the most part the game does a great job navigating you.\n\nVisuals overall are really well done, I enjoy the Wadjet Eye style that is present in a lot of there games and it really works well for this setting. I do find myself squinting at parts where I think there is something for me to pick up but the game does a great job with mouse overs letting you know if anything is there worth taking or learning about. My one grip with this game is I wish there were more graphical settings I would have loved to play this game windowed on a smaller resolution because at times it seemed stretched out a bit.\n\n\nOverall Shardlight is a game any fan of point and click adventure titles should pick up, Wadjet eye games always delivers a fresh new story and puzzles and there world building is really nice. For $14.99 this game should be on your radar.\n\nShardlight is available on Steam for $14.99.

Overall the voices and play is clever, puzzles are a decent mix, and I did get legitimately stuck at a one or two spots.  It does suffer somewhat from tunnelvision, but in my opinion this can be a strength.  In this style of quest game no one wants to simply wander from screen to screen looking for the one item or item clicking combination they missed.  The story is ok, but some characters lack believability in my opinion, and some of the subplot is a little see-through.  The overall apocalyptic feel is well developed and the music is great.\n\nDon't be decieved by Amy's Quest for Glory style cloak.  This game is dark. A little too dark.  I made an impulse purchase when I was really pleased with the demo.  Little did I know (spoiler alert), only seconds more into the demo you are forced to assist a man in his own suicide: and the game gives you no other option.  It would be very feasible to simply WALK OUT and refuse, maybe the guy would yell at you ("but I made a promise" is her weak excuse).  I feel like the developers know this, and push this morality (or lack thereof) a little too hard.  It is fairly transparent that the devlopers are doing their best to create a world with no hope or salvation other than a very pragmatic sort of self-ism.  While these are personal nitpicks about game philosophy, the problem is that this hard-push agnosticism fosters lackluster gameplay, because you are cornered into these situations where realistically a third option should exist, but they simply didn't have the creativity or desire to implement that.\n\nOverall I recommend because this has been possibly one of the closest feeling games to my favorite era of quest games- quest for glory and Kings Quest 5-6.  I love scenes where you can sneak around, and I wish there would be more games like this where thieving and sneaking around places was a larger component.","April 28","true","7.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PocketNerd/recommended/336130/","PocketNerd","Pocket Nerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PocketNerd/","518 products in account","Shardlight is an excellent game with some very visible faults. Amy is deeper and more interesting than most adventure game protagonists; she cares about her friends, is visibly affected by the tragedies she witnesses, and shows far more personality and emotional range than is typical of game characters. The game's plot is entertaining but not especially remarkable, delivering nothing you haven't seen before, and it suffers from a lull in the middle third... but despite that you'll want to keep playing just to see where Amy's story goes.\n\nThe music and sound design are both excellent, with a gentle minimalism entirely appropriate to the ruined city where the game takes place. The voice acting is strong, with a broad and distinct cast, and only a few unconvincing moments. Unfortunately the graphics are quite dated; the AGS engine is showing its age here. The resolution is low (essentially 320x200, but scalable to larger screens) and animations are jerky and cartoonish, especially the peculiarly stiff-legged walk animation.\n\nOverall Shardlight is a flawed diamond of a game, but a diamond nonetheless. If you're a fan of adventure games, don't miss this one.","March 20","true","17.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

If you've played any of their games, you know what to expect. If not, here's what you get: Interesting characters with really well written dialogue and top notch voice acting, a world designed with so much attention to detail in every way, creating an immersing atmosphere, puzzles that are mostly neither too easy nor too obscure, beautiful pixel art (as you can see) and a great soundtrack to accompany it all, telling an interesting facetted story.\n\nThe world they built in particular is very interesting, the first place to visit is a (presumedly nuclear) reactor that's still running, the next place you'll spend a lot of time at is a marketplace that has a very mediaval feel to it. While the overall story might not be too much of an innovative idea -pitch revolution against aristocracy, find cure for plague-  the many side stories or sub plots making it up do very much tell a new version of it.\n\nI'd say Shardlight doesn't have quite as much character developement as other Wadjet Eye Games. Keep in mind though that they've set themselves a high bar there and even scoring underneath it can still mean great and interesting characters. Which in this case it very much does. (Just if character developement is what you're looking for, play the Blackwell series or Technobabylon or, considering how short it is compared to this one, even The Shivah)\n\nOverall great game, everything else mentioned atop at the same level as other current Wadjet Eye Games (translates to: pretty amazing levels).

No combining obscure objects or masses of red herrings but no hand holding either. There are even some non-inventory puzzles, which are particularly satisfying.\nIf I was to criticise it slightly I would say that perhaps it could have done with a few more puzzles of the "chalkboard" standard but it's a minor point.\n\n10/10 look forward to forgetting and playing again in years to come.","March 11","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's set in a futuristic, but mostly low-tech, post-apocalyptic milieu in which people scavenge or farm to survive, trying to keep under the radar of the wigged and tricorned "aristocrats" who rule and praying that they don't come down with green lung:  a fatal, perhaps bioengineered, illness for which there is no cure.  If one of lower rank catches it, his or her only option is to take a dangerous "lottery" job for the government, earning, if they survive, nothing more than a raffle ticket for the aristocracy's vaccine drawing (and the vaccine, of course, is only a treatment).  It's a science fictional world every bit as a engrossing as those of the more flamboyant sort, and though there are no androids or laser cannons in sight, you will be compelled to learn whatever you can about it by eyeballing every object and exhausting every line of dialog.\n\nShardlight takes the venerable "soft VGA" aesthetic that Wadjet Eye employs so well to new heights.  The oily green radiance from the omnipresent uranium glass shards, the sickly yellow of the sky, the grays and browns of the decayed urban landscape -- all of it is so skillfully rendered that the terrible bleakness is not only beautiful to behold, but quite surprising in possessing both perfect thematic consistency and great variety.  The audio is quite close to the visuals in quality; Shardlight may actually have the finest voice-overs of any WE game to date (the actors for Amy, Aquino and Tiberius are particularly excellent), and the ambient, introspective soundtrack adds the perfect aural spice to every scene.  The narrative, which is, of course, the most vital ingredient for any non-farcical adventure, is well-paced; it starts small with Amy quietly attempting to salvage her own health, and through a gradually increasing series of reveals and death-defying scenes, builds into something earthshaking for all the people of her city.  The puzzles are quite nicely designed (no crazy moon logic) and are mainly of medium difficulty, as is the Wadjet Eye standard, though a couple that might be deemed harder oddly appear early in the game.  I did get stuck a couple of times, but not for long (I did not use a walkthrough).\n\nGames like this are why I happily pay full price for Wadjet Eye (and if you don't see the rest of them in my Steam collection, it's because I bought them on GOG, also at full price)!  These productions prove that the real golden age of adventure games is  right here, right now!!","March 29","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The blue sky is a thing of the past and the life as we know it has come to perish. The everyday life is burdened with depression, scaveging and thievery but theres is still a shard of hope left in children songs. Aristocrats, the new totalitarian regime that established after the bombs fell,  is controlling the resources and manipulates the masses with a lottery in which the winnings are a vaccine, required to survive the "Green Lung" disease.\n\nIn this world you play the role of Amy, a mechanic that does lottery jobs in order to provide for herself the so much wanted vaccine. But the last lottery job wasnt like the rest. An encounter with a dying man gave purpose to Amy's life and courage to fight for something more besides her own existence.

The world is alive and full of detail that even surpasses blackwell epiphany's high standards. The voice acting is one of the best and the music sets the mood right and helps the immersion into the game's atmosphere.\n\nThe riddles was not something great but i can give that 2-3 puzzles were the most clever i've ever seen in an adventure game. The use of crossbow is a plus but some of the non plot tasks are very easy and they give the impression of fillers.\n\nWadjet eye has done it again!!! Every year delivers to the adventure community a quality title that sometimes may fall short on duration but nonetheless constitutes an adventure gem for everyone who considers himself a true adventure gamer.","March 11","true","7.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You play as Amy Wellard, one of the lower class of the city, taking dangerous odd jobs in the hope of winning a vaccine in a lottery. In your journey through and around the city, you'll meet quite a cast of quirky characters: old friends, new friends and new enemies. The story may be on the slow side, with the prevalent mood of calm resignation you'll see in the eyes of your interlocutors - but there's plenty of sudden plot twists, and the dramatic moments feel all the more intense in an otherwise almost serene setting.The political context is a little naive at times, but offers fun bits of bitter social satire. What I liked the most was the heavy symbolism and the many consequences of people depending on those symbols.\nThe graphics are Wadjet Eye's Ben Chandler's finest work to date, The puzzles -- mostly fair, and easy, even if clunky at times. The music's top-notch, with the end credits theme sounding like something straight out of Cowboy Bebop OST. The voice work is solid, with some familiar voices that are always a pleasure to hear. All in all, a great game. Maybe not as epic as Technobabylon, Wadjet Eye's last year's release, but definitely worth playing.","April 5","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only real response to it is "I really did not see that coming".\n\nThe puzzles are done well. However, if you're looking for puzzles requiring complex solutions, you won't find it here. They are secondary to the story and act to push the plot forward rather than acting as an obstacle. For players who enjoy the story more than puzzles, this is a plus.

The vaccine is rationed by a government that favours the wealthy.  The poor are asked to complete dangerous jobs to earn lottery tickets and a chance to win a vaccine.  You are thrown into the middle of a struggle between the Aristocracy and the Rebellion.\n\nWadjet Eye Games release another point and click gem.  Fans of Gemini Rue and Primordia should enjoy this one.  Like other Wadjet Eye titles, it's not overly difficult, but the narration, themes, characters and setting are all excellent.  The post apocalyptic setting is not as impressive as Primordia, but I was still impressed with a few of the locations I had to visit.  Puzzles could have been a bit more complex, though thankfully there aren't really any strange puzzles that have you clicking absolutely everything on screen in a desperate bid to progress.\n\nI would have liked there to be some choices throughout the game, especially when the early story seems to suggest that this will be the case.  Though I can understand why this didn't happen for the sake of the story the writers wanted to tell.  I still think the political themes and serious tone work well though and I did play through more than once.  Highly recommended for any point and click fan.

Back in the old days point click adventures were really hard and some of the puzzles struggled to make any real sense. These days however these new titles are simple, well thought out and generally easy to navigate.\n\nShardlight in particular is very pretty. This in part due to the resolution and engine that they use. For a seemingly old looking game, the art work and scenes look amazing.\n\nThe gameplay is a little on the clicky side, as there are allot of scenes in this game which serve very little purpose, others have you jumping around backwards and forwards to accomplish a task. I felt like I was running around like an errand boy most of the time. The characters are friendly and they introduce you to the game world pretty well. I seemed to connect with most of them.\n\nMusic and sound wise, I like the acoustic guitar with reverb, reminiscent to Diablo 1, and the rest of the game was pads and snyth keyboards. The voice acting was solid and clean, only a few scenes which sounded a bit off.\n\nStory wise, I felt immersed, interested, but occasionally stuck and I had to think about things a little. After a while you learn to use the town and pull your resources together fairly well. I did feel like things dragged a little, especially towards the end, just as you think you finish it, there is another plot twist -- although this probably adds more towards the overall value of the game. I liked the different choice of endings in the game, and the few open ended choices within the game.\n\nOverall, if you like these type of titles, buy it. It's about 3.5/5, not as good as Primordia, Gemini Rue or Technobabylon, but it comes fairly close. I found the massive amount of content a good value choice for people who want to hang around and enjoy this game to its fullest.","March 9","true","12.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","6","11","3","0"

She comes from a country that has been ravaged by nuclear war. In the typical post-apocalyptic sense… the world is devoid of resources and riddled with disease. The lines between the rich and the poor have been drastically drawn. The Aristocracy controls everything that happens in the country, and that’s a bad thing for people that have contracted a disease named, “Green Lung.”\n\nStory\nThe poor people in the city have to do odd jobs from the aristocracy to obtain a lottery ticket that can give them a chance to win the Green Lung vaccine. This is where the story begins, with Amy on a job to fix a reactor where she finds a crushed citizen with a request that changes her life. Amy needs the vaccine or she’ll die, so the Aristocracy leader, Tiberius, gives her a job to find the mysterious Danton in-exchange for tons of vaccine and a permanent job of her choice.\n\nDanton discovers that Amy is a spy for the Aristocracy but not of her own volition. They give her a chance to prove herself while making the same promises of unlimited vaccine. Amy has to choose between helping the people or the aristocracy with her life hanging in the balance as a double agent. The main plot is fairly straight forward from that point on, but it’s the moments in between that make Shardlight appealing.\n\nIt’s the understanding of how people cope with a world without abundant resources and death at every corner. How a farmer copes with not having enough food to provide to his animals. Where the Aristocracy come down from high above to request items that the impoverished need to survive. This is place where there is a religion with the idea that you must accept death so that the Reaper can come and take you away from here.\n\nShardlight is a fairly dark game with a grim depiction of a fallen society. Bodies are strewn about various places in the game. People seem to kill each other for both survival and subjugation of others. There are light-hearted moments in the game, but for the most part… Shardlight makes sure to let us know that everything in its world is quite grim.\n\nVisuals\nShardlight like most Wadjet Eye games features pixelated characters with detailed backdrops to accompany them. It works well to understand the dire straits of a bombed out country with a ravaged landscapes. The items aren’t simply strewn about by the art team. There are key details like a plane that crashed into a church during “The Blast.” To the many people that pile through the streets perusing and carrying items in the Market District. It creates a sense a life to adventure titles that are normally often still in nature.\n\nAudio\nThe voice acting is well done for the most part, there are some moments of bad acting but that’s few and far between. There are some grating moments though… like the fruit seller Marischka and the directory machine in the Sciences building. The music on the other hand is something I can’t even remember now that I think about it. So it’s nigh forgettable even though there isn’t a slider to turn it down individually from the voice acting.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is your standard fair point and click madness. There will be plenty of times where you’ll be scrolling over pixel after pixel trying to find an item you may have missed. However, the puzzles are logical and keep the pace of the game moving steadily. The only problem I had was the need to backtrack to areas randomly for the next event of an area to begin. At one point you’ll be at a farm trying to figure out what to do, and then realize that you had to go back to the market to trigger new conversations before receiving the item you needed.\n\nChalkboard which is fairly simple to figure out albeit annoying. Don’t be like me and leave the Chalkboard without reading between the lines though. It took me a good 30 minutes to figure out that you have to read the words from right to left in order to get inside the next area. I just saved you a bunch of time, you’re welcome.\n\nConclusion\nFrom there the game seemed to fly along at a rapid pace and I had a fairly good time understanding speaking to and solving puzzles. Shardlight is a story that re-tells the cliché of the poor versus the evil regime, but it’s full of intriguing characters and enough twists that you can get over the tropes. It doesn’t break the mold when it comes to the adventure game genre, but if you’re a fan of combining items, and clicking on random stuff to find items… you’ll find no problems here.\n\nShardlight is a fun game that’s definitely for Adventure title enthusiasts. If you’re looking for a truly special storyline though… you might want to wait for a sale on this one. For all other adventure seekers such as myself, this game does a fair job of providing a believable albeit clichéd experience.\n","March 8","true","11.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Are you interested in games set in the post-apocalypse? If so I think you will enjoy Shardlight.\n\nIn my opinion the most important thing for a point and click adventure game is a well developed story. The story drives the game forward. If the story is lacking, the game becomes boring and you don't even want to finish the game. For the most part Shardlight's story is quite good. The game has an interesting take on the post-apocalypse theme which creates an interesting backstory and makes you want to finish the game to see how the story ends.\n\nGameplay wise the game is your typical point and click game. You click on objects, use items, and solve puzzles in order to progress the story. If you have played a point and click game before you should know what to expect out of the game. While it plays like most point and click games, I would say that it is better than most of them. I liked that Shardlight doesn't contain a lot of obtuse puzzles that plague a lot of point and click games. I like games that I can logically think out the solution to a puzzle rather than just randomly guessing every possible option until I come to the right solution. This does make the game a little on the easy side since the puzzles aren't that challenging.\n\nI was able to beat the game in around 8 hours. I would guess that it would take most players around 7-9 hours to complete the game since I did get stuck for a while in one area which added around a half hour to an hour to my playtime.\n\nShardlight is a good game. If you like point and click games and find the theme interesting I would recommend you pick up Shardlight.\n\nNote: I received a review copy from the developer but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","March 8","true","8.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

From what I've read, they have other adventures similar to this one, and from this experience, it seems they are quite good at developing them. I have enjoyed it. Very. But it could be quite better.\n\nFirst of all, if you are a nostalgic gamer, you will feel like playing a good old LucasArts game. You like playing from time to time to Monkey Island? This game, and I suppose the others, are definitely for you. Don't hesitate, buy it!\n\nNow, for the rest of the people in the world. Graphics are from the Stone Age, if you are not one of the nostalgic guys. I mean it, the resolution of the game is 320x200 or something like that. And if you pay attention to those details, the poor graphics will not let you enjoy the game. It's a pity because the scenarios ARE detailed, colorful, immersive and absolutely amazing, but it's like watching Star Wars in a TV-recorded VHS after watching episode VII in 60fps 3D. Is the film worse? Of course not. It's far better. But you must have the appropiate mindset to enjoy it. I hope these guys get enough money to plan a great opera with graphics and ambition up to the challenge.\n\nI'll write now about the gameplay. After ending the game, I have mixed feelings. First, I felt the game too linear. Puzzles are well-written, but it's always the same: two or three scenarios to wander and search, some objects to interact and happily click on the correct point, and then your prize. Too linear - end this puzzle, story advances, next place & puzzle, story advances, etc. I felt I had no freedom to explore the city or other scenarios. I know this is just a problem of budget (it is an indie game after all), but I sensed the potential of the story and the "world", I felt really immersed, and I think the game could have been incredible with appropiate budget and people involved. Again, I realize it's not the developers fault - it's the indie industry.\n\nAbout the story. I would gladly read a book based on this game. The story, I cannot say this enough, is amazing. Again, it suffers from the same problem: it feels accelerated, with enormous potential but a little disappointing because of the great story it could have been with more budget and a longer game.\n\nVoice acting is simply incredible, 10/10. Music also adds a great ambience to the game, although a bit repetitive. Oh, and to my surprise, the game is not localized! WTF? At least the major languages. I know many people who would buy this game but will not buy it because it is only in English (subtitles could have been translated at least). Strange decision from the company.\n\nTL;DR: Totally recommended, even if at the end you sense the game could have been legendary, and just stays in the "great game" category.","March 13","true","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I'm an adventure game fan who's really loved the stuff that Wadjet Eye has been putting out for ages. They've been a 'must buy' publisher for me - as soon as something gets released, I pretty much buy it on the spot. No waiting for discounts, I know I'm going to get a solid piece of entertainment and puzzling to dive into.\n\nNot so much with this. Spoilers for the solutions of several puzzles below, and why Shardlight might have basically soured me on the publisher and any future games they put out.\n\nSo first things first, it wasn't going too badly until one particular puzzle. Let me describe how it went: Your main character is faced with a grid of jumbled letters and you have a symbol which is linked to it somehow. You get a book that shows how the symbol fits into a grid of the exact same size. Great! So what you do next is obviously to compare those side by side, figure out which are the letters not covered by the word, and work out that they spell out what to do next -\n\nOH NO, WAIT, THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL.\n\nNo. Instead, what you have to do is:\n\n- Observe that a guy outside is drawing cartoons. Ask him for chalk.\n- He won't give you chalk. Oh no!\n- Suggest that he draws a politically offensive picture.\n- Talk to him and discover that a bell ringing means guards are coming by.\n- Go into an alleyway.\n- SHOOT A ♥♥♥♥ING CROSSBOW BOLT at a bell.\n- Startle the guy into dropping his chalk and running off.\n- Take the chalk.\n- Mark out the symbol onto the grid in EXACTLY the way it's drawn in the book. No, you can't just cross out or block out the squares any which way, you must draw it exactly or it won't count.\n- ONLY THEN can you proceed to follow the directions.\n\nIt's just - are you kidding me? First off - there is also apparently nothing else AT ALL IN ANY WAY around that you can mark things out with. Like, say, mud... or coal... or dirt... or your hands... or just using your brain to observe and figure out things line by line. The ground is also dirt. You could just grab a stick (or a piece of broken pottery, or whatever), scratch out the same grid, then scuff out the letters. But no! The game says that you MUST draw things on the grid itself with chalk that the guy dropped.\n\nHere's the kicker, how did you even know he'd drop his chalk when he runs away? There's no indication that he would, the chalk was important to him, he could have just GRABBED IT IN HIS HAND and ran off with it. That would've been more likely. What would the character have done if that hadn't been the case? Who knows.\n\nBut you know what, all of this alone wouldn't have made me leave a bad review. I'm fine with obtuse puzzles, I've played my fair share of 'no you must insert the monkey into the balloon with a straw and then drop it into this hole' games and have mostly just laughed and moved on with it. No, what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off is that the game FLAT OUT SAID I WAS CHEATING FOR FIGURING OUT THE SOLUTION AHEAD OF TIME.\n\nSee, nothing quite irritates me like that. I wasn't ♥♥♥♥ing cheating! If I had been cheating, I'd have just GOT THE BELL RIGHT AWAY because I'd have looked up directions or a walkthrough that would've told me how to clear that area. I would not have skipped forward and solved a really basic, easy grid based puzzle because cheat guides don't tell you to do that, they just show you step by step how to progress in things. And coming up with an alternate, more straightforward solution isn't my fault, it's the fault of your ♥♥♥♥♥ily designed puzzles that make stupid assumptions (like the chalk being dropped somehow, instead of a dozen other things that could've happened or materials that should've been available).\n\nThe ideal in adventure game puzzles is that they're difficult to put together, but have a eureka moment once the person does. Like - 'hm, I have all these, how do I get past this obstacle with this'. Not to make the player struggle to figure out which solution the game WANTS. Or start trying out every item with every clickable thing to brute force a solution, because that's not thinking at all or working out a problem. Calling the player cheating for figuring something out and forcing them to do it your (somewhat illogical) way or not at all? Wow. No. ♥♥♥♥ right off with that.\n\nAnd you know what, that wasn't even the silliest puzzle. No. By far the most irritating puzzle was this - you need thread! You have a rope and some sharp bits of things. There look to be nails and shrapnel and stuff lying around. BUT NO. You can't cut some frayed ends off. You can't rip some of the sheets on the bunks around off. You can't take the clothes off one of the corpses and pull a few threads from them. You can't even remove the string from your own crossbow or use your own clothes as a source or anything like that, or scratch something into the board with a pin or whatever. No, those would apparently be too logical and straightforward for this game. Instead, guess what! You must give a thing you have (that is unrelated to threads) to a person hanging around, who COMPLETELY INEXPLICABLY happens to:\n\na) Be carrying EXACTLY 8 threads of exactly the right size you needed around, for who knows what reason, because carrying exactly 8 small threads is something people do in this world, and;\nb) Think that trading you 8 OTHERWISE USELESS threads is totally an awesome idea in return for the thing you're giving him.\n\nWHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ SENSE DOES THIS MAKE.\n\nI'm so annoyed with this game, it's seriously unbelievable. These are probably the two oddest puzzles around, but quite a few others shared the same level of general ??? to them (hey, MC, I've got a ton of mobile cameras around and frequently travel to look at people, but YOU totally have to go out there and search each corpse for some signs) and there were a lot of things that SEEMED to perhaps make sense at the outset but didn't quite later (I need water in a place that other people are apparently living or surviving in! I got it, I'll take this ancient bottle of water off the shelf instead of maybe just asking them where they get water from and if it's clean. Who cares how they've been surviving or feeding themselves anyway?).\n\nThe thing is, like I said, I REALLY wanted to like it. I love post-apocalyptic settings, played a bunch of games with that. I'm into politics - hell, I'm a history major, politics and worldbuilding and regimes are basically my jam. Cults fascinate me. Adventure games are a huge weakness of mine. But this game basically took lots of stuff I like and produced a jumbled mess pretending to be dramatic and just ending up sort of bleh. I haven't even started on the total lack of character development for most of the characters. Take the main resistance leader. Close to nothing in exposition, and all that you DID get was just told to you and you were apparently supposed to believe it. Where did she learn how to fight? Who knows? Who cares? Is she ANYTHING besides badass? Who knows, who cares? I mean, the ♥♥♥♥ing CULTISTS got more intriguing character development than she did, and that's kind of... sad, really. I wanted to be interested in her, I wanted to like her, but all she really did was stand around for most of the game and stab a bunch of people at the end. I don't want to be TOLD by everyone that she's a good leader who's rallied people, I want to be shown that somehow, or have that demonstrated to me.\n\nWhat I also sighed at was the complete lack of exploring what people on the 'aristocrat' side were like as well. Who are the guards? What are their backgrounds? How did they get the jobs? What pressures are they facing? Do they have families too? But no, somehow it's the poor people who are given all the sympathy and the guards are just faceless, less-than-human mooks to be killed for the sake of drama. It made it really hard to take the game seriously. There were so many opportunities to explore here and really it was kind of a letdown","March 18","false","7.0"," 16 of 41 people (39%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","39","16","41","4","4"

I wondered what the name was all about.\n\nTurns out the (female) protagonist's hometown was ruined and left desolate after a severe bombing attack - when she was just a little girl - 20 years before the actual story takes place.\n\nWhich left her in a place with no electricity, no running water, hardly any food or decent shelter ... and death around the corner... since she's sick.\n\nThe mysterious disease in question, is "Green Lung" - affecting the lungs & skin - and has haunted the townsfolk for decades without a cure, unfortunately bringing death & sorrow.\n\nFortunately, the heroine does have a home, which reflects her love for tinkering :).\n\nThe coolest thing about it, is that it's decorated with shards of glass, which shine a bright fluorescent green (hence, "Shardlight").\n\nThe whole town is embellished with these as well... :).\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nNow, as the story begins, the main character is all grown up; Amy Wellard - a bright mechanic - ends up using her skills, in life-threatening jobs so she can get her hands on a vaccine.\n\nNow, I'd really hoped they would have the character make better use of her skills, I felt the game lacked greatly in that regard. Almost as if it didn't even matter she was good at tinkering. The puzzles hardly called for this.\n\nEven so, most of the puzzles were pretty straight-forward (though at times, a bit erratic and even requiring an eye for detail). Meaning, if you missed a tiny piece of information, chances are you would get stuck (as I did, early on!).\n\nOne particular puzzle almost had me quit playing, because it asked for an unexpected amount of precision, and felt disconnected from the other puzzles.\n\nRegardless of this, the gameplay generally felt very flowy (it was very easy to figure what to do next, without feeling too dull, though slightly repetitive - "get X, go to Y, come back with Z").\n\nLuckily, the way the story unfolded in unexpected raw ways, provided a good balance for this.\n\nI was left baffled (in a good way), more than once (especially near the second half of the game), due to some of Amy's actions.\n\nThe game ended rather abruptly & in a (potentially) painfully shocking way, almost like there was meant to be a sequel (I sure hope so!).\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIn closing, I would like to point out some [details] about the game:\n\n- the shards' fluorescent colouring was applied throughout the game in the form of; a glassy bright green [dialogue box], [mouse pointer], [UI & in-game navigation system], (which added an overall sentimental touch, that I liked!)\n\n- at some point, public announcements were made in town, which sometimes overlapped with dialogues I was having with other characters & made it hard to understand them (a bit of an annoyance, but nothing major)\n\n- moments of choice & consequence not really making much of a difference (e.g. one of the side characters ended up in a very dire situation, regardless of what I did, which left me feeling powerless, saddened & a bit disappointed)\n\n- 3 slightly different endings - entitled [Chaos], [Order] & [Free Will] (text-based, no visuals), very short & slim - which I found satisfying, but a bit sudden & rushed (I'd be happier if there was a sequel!)\n\n- the (surprising) absence of flashbacks or flashforwards (even though I find these to be a key ingredient in any apocalyptic-flavoured story, as they could've made a deeper impact story-wise, without these the story feels rather superficial & flat, though believable)\n\n- the lack of a diary (or something) to keep track of game progress\n\nOverall, the story was solid, interesting and believable. I especially liked how the main plot & a surprisingly unique subplot weaved in together near the end.\n\nI'm really hoping there will be a sequel & even a prequel to this!

It's a really outstanding version of the genre.\n\nFirstly, Shardlight is an adventure game -- that means there's no shooting, no dying, no multiplayer or anything of the sort. You probably already know this but just in case you don't: this game is about story, characters, puzzles and beautiful art. Comparing it to similar games in the genre, this game is much more tonally serious than Gemini Rue and is perhaps most similar to Technobabylon in its overall writing quality. The story is top-notch and the voice acting is excellent with the main chracter's VO work as a particularly outstanding example. The graphics are honestly astonishingly beautiful, especially for an Adenture Game Studio game. The backgrounds are wonderful and the use of color and tone is just... really amazing. Some of the character art can be a bit odd (i.e. some of the soldiers seem to oddly stand out) but that can be explained as a story decision.\n\nWhere this game stumbles a bit is that the pacing is a bit strange. The game feels really long and varied until about the halfway mark (you'll know it when you get to it) and then the number of different locales really starts winding down and the story wraps up pretty quickly. Given how much I enjoyed the game I wouldn't have minded if it was twice as long, though that's hardly a big thing to complain about (hey, I enjoyed this so much I wish it was longer!). Also, one or two of the puzzles weren't super well telegraphed (notably one in the early part of the game) but that's hardly a huge sin for adventure games.\n\nHonestly if you're looking for a really outstanding adventure game this is a wonderful one to choose. Wadjet continues to publish just outstanding games and they should be really proud of helping to bring this one out. I'm excited to see what these developers bring out next.","March 20","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Music and voiceovers are good and the visuals characteristically not. Every time they come up with a new game, the same question pops out: Really, couldn't they improve the graphic just a little bit? I know it's become sort of their trademark style, but I'm sure some gamers who would like to play are put off by the belove average resolution.\n\nI buy these games because they are a rare comodity in the game world: storytelling at its core. You care about the characters and what to see what happens to them in the end. The puzzles are logical and straightforward (with one or two exceptions), as long as you make sure to identify all hotspots. Yay, pixel hunting!?\n\nOn the downside, the game is shorter than it should be (about 10-11h of actual play), which I find unfair.\n\nNote: If you like this, also check out Alum by Crashable\n","March 16","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Decent voice acting, art reminiscent of the good old adventures that kept me busy for so many frustrating hours and a soundtrack that fits the environments pretty well.\n\nThe story and puzzles side (both really make the difference in a good adventure) are bland to say the least. More often than not you end up having to 'solve' a puzzle by using the same mechanic over and over, when some thought could have gone into more variation.\nOther times you're forced to wander off to another area to trigger a specific piece of conversation before being able to use the blatantly obvious solution.\n\nMoral choices you have at the beginning don't seem to influence the game's progression and just funnel you into the same linear path you would anyway. My guess is you'd get a different ending scene depending on what you decide on the final one.\n\nI blasted through this in under 5 hours. Enjoyable but not the long-lost prodigal son of adventure games people make this out to be.

I've described this game as if Dishonored and Fallout had a baby that happened to be a point and click adventure, with a dash of Loom and crazed death cults (played moslty for laughs) thrown in as well. Good voice acting, great art, atmospheric music, and very good game design. Very few gripes with the game, but it does stop short of being a truly amazing game. Definitely recommend for an adventure game fan.","April 13","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't feeling massively world-changed while I was doing it, but now it's completed I can't stop thinking about it. Like reading a really, really good book.

(Even though I'm a big fan of this kind of leisurely, point-and-click gaming.)  The story doesn't exactly "grab" you immediately, but rather gets you gradually more involved.  You start to like the lead character, Amy, more and more.  By the time I found out the secret hideout and was enlisted on a "secret mission" by the rebel leader Danton, I realized that I was really enjoying watching things unfold.\n\nLook, I'm not saying it's absolute best game I've ever played, but it is ultimately worth it, particularly for fans of this genre.\n\n...\n\nBy the way, there is a *stupidly* unfair and flippant review of this game from "Slant" floating around out there.  Pretty annoying how some people are allowed to review point and click games when they clearly have a preformed bias against them.","May 10","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A truly believable milieu (although you'll need a flexible science fiction imagination to see past the obvious holes and scope problems), meticulously crafted, laced with a rare 100% voice-over performance, and a haunting soundtrack that fits the mood well.  I was particularly pleased with the authors' use of colonial-era America iconography alongside a society that looks "steampunk" out of necessity.\n\nUnfortunately, this game was also riddled with inventory and hotspot puzzles of the type that I have about 15 seconds of patience for.  I was particularly frustrated by the distinction that the game occasionally made between "using" and "examining" certain magic hotspots, and how most "puzzles" could be solved by waving the mouse around until the unseen hotspot had been found.  I plead with game designers everywhere to stop this:  hidden object games are a separate genre.  Please stop making me move my mouse down the screen in a raster pattern.\n\nOverall, a fun narrative and a game I would recommend, especially for fans of the post-apocalypse/future dystopia genre.","May 15","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
