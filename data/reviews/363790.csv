But you're an egg that uses its rolling as momentum for speed to make long jumps, you don't exactly have the luxury of legs and feet.  And it's this simple point that makes the game both equal parts frustrating and challenging.  You will die... a lot.  But you will also gradually get better.   It's not exactly eggscellent, but it is certainly one shell of a tough game that will challenge your patience.\n\n6.5/10","May 5, 2015","true","2.4"," 81 of 97 people (84%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","84","81","97","34","2"

But if you want to witness how carriage is turning into pumpkin - welcome to.\n\nIt's about:making the egg roll;\njumping and feeling the rhythm;\ntesting your skills of staying calm and being patient;\ncursing developers.\nWhy you should play this:you like hardcore platformers and don't care if the difficulty was caused by original game's mechanic, brilliant level-design, necessity of trainging or just by questionable controls;\nyou like platformers with simple physics elements (here it's inertia);\nyou like games where a lot depends on luck, not on your skills or training ability;\nyou don't mind to play the same level many times.\nWhy you may not like it:controls - let's say that they are controversial: on many stages game demands preciseness, but controls aren't precise by default because they based on inertia;\nsome levels definetely must have checkpoints, otherwise it's a meaningless repeating of the same again and again and again;\nthere's a constant feeling that egg's ability to roll is randomly generated;\nsometimes it's literally easier to close eyes and try to beat the level believing in pure luck than beat the level through polishing your skills - that says it all about game's mechanic and level-design.\nIt's not that bad, it's just as fun as tossing a coin: may be entertaining first dozen times, but you hardly like to do that hundreds of times.\nHere is the same: on some of the levels nothing depends on your skills - luck of the draw as with coin.\nHow much pleasure in that is up to you.\nLikely, relief is the only emotion you will feel after beating the game.","October 13, 2015","false","5.5"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","44","59","8","1"

Timing the egg wobble just right doesn't take long and is deeply satisfying, I can now be the Egg I have always dreamed of, and so can you. One very interesting mechanic is moving forward by jumping backwards; you can't do this on a skateboard - you need an egg; so if you ride a skateboard then you need this game. I have mastered the physics of eggs and life now feels complete.\n\nDelightfully short levels, the casual playthrough took 1 hour. Hardcore playthrough took 3 hours. 100% Achievements in 4 hours. The sound track is an audio smoothie; 6 relaxing concertos written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nCaviat Emptor: In hardcore mode there are two levels which require 99% luck and brute force perseverence at one hundred respawns each !\n\nBuy this if you want delighfully simple platforming game with the physics of an egg, easy to pick up and hard to put down.\n\n2015 Nov","November 3, 2015","true","4.7"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","27","35","8","0"

Instead I got a game that is really frustrating! It levels of frustration this game causes me reminds me of VVVVV. The controls are pretty strange as well, and there doesn't seem to be a way to change them. The gameplay video makes this game look quite simple and simple mindedly enjoyable, but I assure you, it is not.\n\nIn the dev's defense, "Simple Platformer" can be interpreted in at least three ways. It's a really hard game to play, but the concept is really simple, and the controls are really simple.\n\nThe only technical error I came across was that I can high-jump through the portal beams (I imagine I'm jumping over the hitbox that registers that I went inside the beam). It would also be nice if the controls could be changed. It's strange having 'a' and 'd' for the move keys, and then pressing 'f' to do a high jump.\n\nWith that being said, I cannot rate this game poorly because do not fall within its target audience. I'm sure there are people out there who would enjoy this game. The programming feels solid, has nice visuals, and has a great soundtrack.","May 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","28","41","0","1"

Nope.\n\nAll I wanted to do was play this game. The last achievement I have is play every level on hard/expert - something I don't think I'll ever achieve. Was it worth it? YES! : D\n\n♥ My bearded dragon loved watching me play.\n\nRhyssa and her tank are positioned behind my desk, meaning that she can see everything on my screen, and surprisingly this game turned out to be her favorite.

I appreciate the free beardie entertainment!\n\n♥ I'm terribly allergic to eggs.\n\nWhy is this as positive trait? Because for all the years that eggs made me sick, I appreciated seeing the egg  crack.\n\n✘ As I mentioned before, the game is addicting.\n\nPlaying it made me lose my attention span with schoolwork and turned me away from playing games with friends. The fact that it's addicting can be a plus and a minus but is a feature I appreciate in video games.\n\n✘ The jump button is clunky.\n\nI do admit that the controls can be hard to use at times. I've played the game with both controller and keyboard, though I ended up trying to perfect it with a keyboard. The jump keys can be difficult because sometimes they seem to just stop.\n\nAlways seemingly when you're just about to finish the level.... x)\n\n✘ The spikes.\n\nJust when you think the levels are as hard as they're going to get, you meet your best friend, the spikes. Not only do they soar up, they also soar down - all bunched together it requires you to figure out the pattern of how you should jump, and quickly.\n\nTake a minute to think and you'll die. This drove me absolutely bonkers though I appreciate how the developer put time into changing up the levels.

You cannot move but slightly hop to the left or right. You got to use the momentum gained by the egg shape of your protag to jump over gaps and spikes. It's really innovative and refreshing but the lack of control drives you crazy by the later levels.

I admit there is a certain skill to timing your presses for the most height/distance possible, however even this is limited due to poor level design (e.g. low ceilings which make some levels horrific without any effort).\n\nThere are three buttons: jump left, jump right, and 'jump higher', however that last one is more of a 'hold down almost all of the time, otherwise game is impossible' button, and sometimes you'll find that even with the button down your egg will simply fling itself into the spikes shell-first.\n\nOverview: REALLY short game, mostly luck-based gameplay, humour of being egg wore off after 3 minutes.\n\nRating: 3 rotten eggs out of 10","December 18, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokuniho/recommended/363790/","mokuniho","MOKU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokuniho/","55 products in account","One moment, one mistake, one egg.\nIf you're looking for a game that will test your platform-game skills, look no further.\n\nIn this game, you play as a swanky egg who, after a small mishap with a teleporter, is trying to find his way home. How will this egg get home, you ask? Through 40+ levels of pure hell. Jump through spikes, traps, and pits with only your egg-physics and persistence to carry you through. Pray to RNGesus as a certain tyrannical spectator sends his side-scrolling wall of death toward you with the ultimate goal of ridding your existence from the face of the eggy-Earth. This game has the ability to make you scream great warsongs of rage, but it can also make you cry tender tears of pure bliss. Do all of this with a wonderful sountrack playing in the background, sure to soothe any lost and broken soul.\n\nSo, do you think you have what it takes to help an egg return home?\n\nWhat I thought of the game!\nOverall, I thought the game was a very enjoyable experience. Anyone who knows me knows that I am terrible at platform games, so this game was a real challenge for me... A challenge that I have beat! I will try to expand a bit on some of the things I liked the best about this game which include the story, the music, and the physics.\n\nThose who have played this game may be thinking, "What? There's a story to this game?" To that, I have to say, "Yes! There is!" This game features a very simple, amusing, and wordless story about an egg who made a silly mistake and just wants to go home. It's very hard to not sympathize with this poor egg, but it's also hard to not chuckle a bit at his situation!\n\nI know I'm biased, but the music is great! Sometimes I leave the game open in the background just to listen to it! I never thought I would be hearing Mozart's Oboe Concerto in a game like this, but I guess it's just the little things that take the cake. I think the music is very fitting to the game as a whole; it gives the game a very quirky, yet sophisticated feel to it. Needless to say, great selection of music!\n\nFor the physics of this game, all I can say is kudos to the developer. When I first started playing, I thought this game would be fairly simple because the egg would roll and jump like a ball... but I was horribly wrong. You play as an egg! Therefore, you roll and jump how an egg would! This offers a whole set of challenges and setbacks that you would have never even thought of experiencing. Sometimes when you try to move to the right, the way your egg-body is angled causes you to move to the left instead. Or maybe you are trying to jump over a large pit and need to gain enough momentum to make the leap... let's just say, good luck on timing that jump! I truly think that out of all the good things this game has going for it, the use of egg-physics is simply the best of them.\n\nSo, if you have a few bucks to spare, I'd definately recommend adding this game to your collection! It's a simple, fun game that offers very thoughtful challenges and plently of rage-quits.\n\nTL;DRThis game is 70% rage, 40% tears, and 300% egg.\n100/10 would egg egg-gain\n","November 21, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","6"

For me, I would think of Donkey Kong Country, Super Mario Bros. and maybe Super Meat Boy. And what exactly do these great platformers have in common? Many things of course, but most importantly, tight controls. These games may be hair-pullingly difficult at times, but they're fair because not only have they actually been play-tested, but they allow the gamer to feel like the death was their fault. Does "Egg Returns Home" have tight controls? No. Does "Egg Returns Home" have fair deaths? No. This piece of garbage relies wholeheartedly on luck as the basic mechanic between failure and success, and that is the last thing any platformer (a game genre based on skill), should ever resort to.

Most games I've played I've felt positive towards; nevertheless, it didn't end that way with this game.\n\nEgg Returns Home is a simple platformer game, with avoiding obstacles and death. It sounded simple until you started using the controls for the game. For the most part, the music for the game was acceptable in my book, I'm a fan of classical music, (as I am with music genres excluding country), but solely the music was the one reason why the game stood out a little. For my game ratings, there's "Excellent" "Dreadful"; luckily this game wasn't near the worst rating, but unfortunately not close enough toward the positive rating. If I had to rate it, I would place it as,"Below Average."\n\nThe controls for the game were abysmal to me. It felt impossible sometimes to make those high end jumps if you used a controller, and had to press the F key at the same time while moving forward. Even though it was meant for using the keyboard, I wish they would have the controller Fully Supported to make the movement of the character easier and feel less frustrating. Dying in the areas where it should be incredible simple was frustrating for me despite understanding the agenda of the game by reading the achievements.\n\nFor my rating, Egg Returns Home - 55/100","December 28, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The controls are difficult to use, sometimes even jamming so I have to restart the level or die before I can move again.\n\nThe game is hard, a challenging game is difficult but involves skill to beat, this game is mostly luck based. I can sometimes jump higher when I'm not holding F (The key that apparently makes you jump higher) and when trying to go left (or right) I go in the opposite direction.\n\nThe game was fun for the first few levels, but constantly dying gets tiresome very quickly. In most platformer games when you die on a level, it's for a reason, lack of skill or accidental, but as you know where you died, you can easily avoid doing it again; with this game, you'll die multiple times in the same place because of how exact you must be when moving, even the smallest of mistakes will kill you, which is irritating as you don't get to decide to high you jump.","March 23","false","3.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

A game with simplicity, and it barely functions. It uses 3 keys and the physics in-game are mental. Recieved this as a gift, looked neat and had a nice package. Then i loaded it up. I dont understand how momentum doesnt apply in a game about using force and timing fall so short. The A key moves the egg left, the D key moves it right, holding the F key gives greater height. Dont be fooled, if you roll too quick, you cant shift direction either mid air or on the ground. If on your eggs side, you cannot build momentum without backtracking, and will simply hop about in place.\n\nMaybe im being critical, i dont know. Not really worth dedicating time into. With thousands upon thousands of steam titles, this one can be ignored. Nobody will be missing much. I assume this game is a mobile port, or intended for mobile only.","November 5, 2015","false","9.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
