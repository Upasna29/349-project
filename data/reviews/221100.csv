Haven't played the mod? Well, I will say that this game is grape. Yep, grape.\n\nYou start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty.\n\nYour main objective is to find buildings and search for food and drink and then a melee weapon. Don't know where you are at? Find a online map of Chanarus and look for town signs and landmarks. Once you've found where you are at, make your way to the nearest town for supplies. Keep in mind your current clothes allow for very little inventory, so you'll want to look for new clothes in order to carry more items.\n\nOK, so you've managed to find a can of soda, a can of tuna, and some gloves. Good start. Now you'll want to continue... wait. Is that a zombie you hear? Yep. He sees you. Go back inside that house and shut the door. Everyone knows they don't know how to use doors because THEY CAN CLIP THROUGH THE FREAKING WALLS!!! AHHHHHH!!!\n\nAlright, after you've put down the zombie with a hammer, you'll want to take care of the warm red stuff squirting out from your body. Take off your shirt and rip it into rags. Now use the rags as bandages. Good as new. Carefully move on to the... What? Hungry again? But you just ate 3 minutes ago. Pull out the can of beans you found and... crap. You need something sharp to open the can. Keep looking. Maybe the guy rapidly coming at you screaming "HEY YOU! I WANT TO AXE YOU A FEW QUESTIONS!" can be of some assistance. Calmly face him and...\n\nYou start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight.

I have noticed a few similar questions and comments being repeatedly posted, so I am going to address some here.\n\n1.  Does this game require ArmA II?\n\nNo, it is a standalone game, which is different than the mod, that requires no other purchases.  When you buy the game, you can start playing immediately and after the full release.\n\n2.  Will this game come out for the Mac?\n\nThe system requirements on the store page list the following operating systems: Windows Vista SP2 and Windows 7 SP1.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nUpdate as of June 5, 2015.\n\nIt's been a year since my last update and I felt it was time to do another one.\n\nNot much has changed with the game and that has been greatly disappointing.  It came out with such promise but time passed and I have been soured over the fact that so little work has been done to it.  What happened, devs?  Is anyone working on it anymore?  Did you stop caring?  It sort of feels like you took the money and ran.  It saddens me because I still love the game but I cannot heartily recommend it like I once did.\n\nLooking to buy this game?  Do your homework first.  Read the reviews.  If you don't mind an incomplete game, go for it.  Otherwise you'd be wise to save your money for another game.\n\nI am keeping my original review up for now.","January 8, 2014","true","19.0"," 15,805 of 17,240 people (92%) found this review helpful 70 people found this review funny","92","805","17","70","410"

There optimizations do nothing but chop away at fps with each release. This game ran on my non-gaming laptop (on lowest settings) a year ago better then it runs on my FX 8350 (8 Core) w/ 8GB Ram, Gigabyte R9 280x SLi Setup with a SSD. I now get FPS drops down to 10 FPS whenever im near more then 10 houses worth of textures no matter if I put it on Everything Max 1920 x1080 or Everything off 640x480.\n\nAlright second, for those of us who liked this game when it was a mod for its vehicles, choppers, tents and Tons of zombies making it hard and fun! They still have nothing more then a giant slow truck that gltiches your items periodically 2 years into the game and the Zombies now are so limited you no longer need to use prone or crouch or even restrain from singing songs along your whole journey because there simply are no ♥♥♥♥ing zombies (or not enough to warrant mentioning)\n\nOk now for the Big THIRD and biggest ♥♥♥♥ off of all. These guys release this game 2 years ago hoping to get only 50k in buyers and now after having over 3 Million copies sold which by the way even at there current sale price for the game of 33$ works out to over 99,000,000$ Dollars Yes Ninety Nine Million Dollars and they still cant hire enough people to finally finish this game more then one tiny piece at a time. That BTW is 66 times the amount of money they said they would be able to finish the game with, within a year, at launch date!\n\nAnd for all your trolls Yes I know its Early Access Game and Guess what thats all it will ever be! 2 years and 99 Million dollars laters and DayZ Standalone Has lost all my respect!","November 29, 2015","false","294.3"," 2,157 of 2,374 people (91%) found this review helpful 150 people found this review funny","91","157","2","150","101"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liscion/recommended/221100/","liscion","❛Liscion シ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liscion/","98 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis "game" sets a perfect example of how to do everything wrong in software development\n(Disclaimer: I'm a software engineer myself)\n\n(UPDATE) I never thought this would get so much attention. Before you read the rest of this review, please keep in mind that this - like any other review out there - represents my _opinion_ about this game and mine alone. Since the game is still in development, my criticism is mostly pointed towards the acutal development of this game rather than the game itself. There might be a one in a 1000 chance that I might change this review around by the time the game gets officially released.\n\nWith a sum of almost 590 hour in this game, I've given up hope on this. We (my family) started playing about 2 years ago and it really wasn't bad back then. Of course there were bugs, things were incomplete, but that's to be expected from an Early Access game.\n\nHowever, as I've been closely monitoring the development progress of the game, I see so many things going wrong in the development team, I almost feel the urge to take a plane, fly there and put some people in their place and teach them a thing or two about priorities.\n\nIt's been almost two and a half years since the release on steam, the game is far worse than it was 2 years ago. In a long period of time, Bohemia managed to keep implementing 'content' to keep the players happy, while they should've been working on engine-related systems instead. Now they have to "refactor" every single piece of content to make it fit with the 'new engine'. As an engineer myself, I know how much time and effort this takes. The person responsible for prioritizing content over enigne should be fired and never to be allowed in game development again.\n\nIf you follow the development updates on their forums (forums.dayzgame.com), you might notice that the team works in an agile method using 'sprints'. We do the same in our office. However, usually there is one person responsible for prioritizing tasks and planing them ahead. This person clearly thinks from a business perspective instead of something to improve the quality of life of the software (maintainability, easy-adopting and stability), and it hurts me to see this happen to a studio like this.\n\nWhile DayZ started the 'hype' of zombie/survival-games, a lot of much better alternatives got released in the meantime. I'm not here to advertize or suggest anything in particular since I gave up on these types of games after the horrible taste in my mouth that this game gave me.\n\nJust to sum up some highlights of the things that happened in the past 2 years:\n\nDean Hall left. No more proper leadership.\nBrian Hicks took over.\nContent was released that needed total refactorization for the new engine (who the hell though this was a good idea?)\nLooking at the speed things are being implemented/fixed, I'm guessing there is less than a handful of actual programmers on the team.\nLoot tables got completely messed up. It still isn't fixed. Central Economy? Who thought this up?\nServer side programming is utterly horrible! Lag doesn't even begin to describe the rubberbanding/desynchronisation  happening in this game.\nLastly; Somebody messed up the entire world (height shifts in entire sections of the grid, floating/flying buildings, etc.)\nEspecially the last point of the list above dazzles me. They have an internal testing process. They have an experimental process. Who in their right mind would push these things to a production environment? If you introduce a bug like that (which isn't a byproduct of a feature but just a complete and utter f*ck-up), you bloody FIX IT.\n\n\nSo, to answer the question if I would recommend this game to ANYONE:\n\nThe answer is NO.\nNo you shoulnd't. Go spend your money on something more useful like a tray of sodapops or some food for the coming week.\n\nIf anyone of Bohemia reads this, here's the proper way to "port" a game to a different engine:\n\n- Find a game to port (in this case, the DayZ mod for Arma II)\n- Build a new Engine for your game to begin with - you already knew the limitations of Arma when you guys started.\n- FINISH THE ENGINE!\n- Build a toolset for designers and artists to populate the game with content.\n- Once you have a MVP (Minimal Viable Product), go early access, AND NOT BEFORE THAT!\n- Go fix bugs, implement content - finish the game.\n\nApparently, people with absolutely NO EXPERIENCE in software engineering in general had leadership over the development of this "game".\n\nIn all seriousness though, big kudos to the team that's been there since day one. All the negative crap they get over themselves right now would completely ruin any form of motivation to even keep working on the game for me.\n\n\nThis was my first review.

Get everything there, functional, then iterate over those features, getting back to SCRUM, for polish. But get things done.\n\nIt is really a shame for me to see how this team is playing with people money and expectations.\n\nPlayers will lose faith in other game developers, making it harder to get funds to create great games.\n\nDayZ could be a great game.\n\nIt is not. It feels like a scam, at current status.\n\nYou developers should show respect for people who paid money for it, deliver content ASAP, and be, at least, polite to them on every communication you did.\n\nYou owe them $100M, do NEVER forget it.","September 20, 2015","false","5.4"," 993 of 1,079 people (92%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","92","993","1","42","44"

Soon, he was getting the hang of things. I jokingly put handcuffs on him and forgot we had no keys. I told him to struggle, but avast no success.\n\nEventually, this 5 minute joke turned into an hour hunt scounging around a town for a hacksaw to free him, defending him from zombies and the elements. I fed him, gave him drinks and comforted him. In the end, he was never mad at me. He had complete fun with the hilarity of the situation.\n\nAs our supplies ran low, I told him the bad news once we had hit the last building in town. He too had realized we were at the end. He got on his knees and I asked him what was on his mind. We both knew what was going to happen at this moment. I legitimately felt sadness and cried as I trained my gun against his back head. The sun setting in the distance. I told him that one of us will have to walk this earth for eternity, and that I should be the one to suffer the curse. Instantly I felt nothing more then the cold air against my back neck as the echos of my gun filled the town. Zombies began to run towards me as I held out in an abandoned apartment building at the top hill of town. I made sure to spare no zombie, nor myself.\n\nI still walk this earth as we speak.

Not far at all. Bugs that were existent with the release with the game still exist, like zombies coming through walls, constant server crashes and a really, really bad combat system. For a whole year, I jumped on the bandwagon, bought the game, made a half arsed review which blew up and I tried my hardest to enjoy the game amongst all the problems.\n\nBut enough is enough. The developers are lazy at fixing their game, but as long as we have different coloured shirts and the ability to plant tomatoes, everyone is happy. Fix what is breaking your game first before adding in new features, which just add more bugs and issues to your game.\n\nIn another six months when I rewrite this review, I do hope that I can recommend the game, I really do.

This did not happen.\n\n2 Years down the line and the game has barely been developed. Lets look at the things which this game potentially requires to make it interesting.\n\nCharacter interaction - Right now, with no real threat from zombies, starvation or the elements, there is no reason to seek help from your fellow man, and as such, most people shoot each other without uttering a word. Without a pre determined group to play with, you will find little interaction, and when you do, you will quickly realise you are doing nothing other than what you would do alone.... loot for hours on end, to potentially lose it all to a 500km sniper shot you don't even hear/falling from a 3m drop.\n\nBase building - this endgame content could realistically require people to form groups and interact to complete tasks too daunting to face on their own, possibly a future savior of the game... But 2 years and $100m down the line and we have basically none of this. Right now you can lock a door in a house (which can be opened by hitting it with an axe ONCE), or hide items in unlockable barrels/tents which are regularly wiped by the servers/updates.\n\nVehicles - a smaller version of basebuilding, getting a vehicle working could be a reason to group together for a cause, the only problem is, right now a vehicle takes on average longer to repair than to run across the entire map, then when repaired are probably the worse iteration of vehicles i have ever seen in a game. Though they are right now possibly the only reason to band together with fellow survivors.\n\nSurvival - Perhaps the challenge of survival against the elements/zombies could be a draw to the game? No.\nzombies finally made their re-appearance to experimental build after the massive drop in player numbers without them, and are a minor threat, but are so sparse and easy to outrun, they are nothing more than a hinderance. Food/the elements are a joke, you can find enough food and drink in any town to survive for an untold ammount of time even on a full pop server, the elements take the form of the heat and the cold. both implemented in the most irritating way possible, you often have to stop running for 10 mins to sit in a pool of water naked to cool yourself down because you got hot from running too much, cold is the reverse, you didnt run enough, now sit next to a fire you spent 5 mins crafting, great fun...\n\nGunplay - Ok so perhaps this will be a great shooter game? It COULD be, it's more tactical then most other stuff on the market, and your aim matters less than your intelligence and positioning, it's the thinking mans shooter. However, to really compete you are going to need to spend 3/4 hours getting a military grade weapon, and probably only have a firefight every hour or two. It just takes too long for a quick pvp fix\n\nThere is much much more but tbh I am getting irrate writing this review as it reminds me of the massive dissapointment this game has been so far. I personally believe the Devs have given up, they're about a year behind their last "roadmap", and were suppossed to be releasing a beta by jan, if the game went to beta in this state it would be a travesty, but then again, taking this long with the budget they had is also a travesty. I think they will probably get it to the bare minimum of playability and hand it to the community to finish, which is pathetic, but probably the games only hope.\n\nOne day this game could be amazing, but it will not be in the hands of the devs","December 4, 2015","false","554.1"," 1,204 of 1,351 people (89%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","89","204","1","72","46"

However no matter how much I love it, I have to give it a thumbs down. With nearly 600 hours into the game I believe I have the right to share my opinions on the game thus far.\n\nDayZ is just one of those games that started off great and ended up being a neverending supply of letdown.\nDeadlines have not been met and the updates are up to the point where they're basically nonexistent.\n\nI honestly suggest leaving it a couple years to see how it plays out. At it's current state it's filled to the brink with bugs and glitches and from something that I would consider a AAA title, it's not worth the purchase.\n\nPlease don't give me any of the 'Early Access' excuses. If anything, the development for this game has gone backwards rather than forwards. This game was full of promise, yet now I'm left with nothing but dissapointment.\n\nTaking a look at the 'To-do list for 2015' the development team haven't even cracked the surface on what was meant to be introduced this year. From the same company (Bohemia) that created ArmA 2/3 I would have expected them to care a little more for a product that, to be honest, sold their game.\n\nI will continue to play the game, but not as active as I once was. I'll probably log a dozen or so hours every month to get a gist of how much the game progresses from now on and share my thoughts as the year(s) draw on.\n\n\n[Updated 25/05/16]\n\nAfter 6 months, we've recieved our next update for the game: 0.60 Experimental.\nThis is why I said leave it years, not months and see how the game progresses.\n\nSince my original post, I've logged a further 300 hours into this game. Can you believe it?\nI still do not recommend this game, not even with the new 0.60 experimental build.\n\nPerhaps now that the new renderer is done (great job on that, by the way!) the development of the game will speed up, as it will free up more time to focus on improving the game mechanics and fixing bugs and glitches that have been around for years.\n\nI was hoping for more out of this build. 6 months is a long time and whilst this update seems huge, it's actually rather small if you compare to what the older updates used to bring, at a much more regular intervals.\n\nSo, the DayZ community in a nutshell: "Oh cool, 0.60 has been released! When's 0.61?"","November 4, 2015","false","908.6"," 743 of 824 people (90%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","90","743","824","38","29"

I'm going to go into detail anyway, because I like to complain.\n\nHow many years has it been - about 3, yes? 3 years of development. Sure, the team started out small, and has gone through some changes over the years, but is this really all they have to show? Even when Bohemia took over, things didn't improve. Let me carefully go over all of the things I love and hate about this game, and why I never plan to play it again.\n\n\nMajor Cons:\n\n- Sound.\n\nIt's broken.  While playing I am constantly bombarded  with repeating moans, split ammos, eating and drinking noises... oh god make it stop! Gates opening, clips being reloaded, and god knows what else. If anything, sound has gotten worse since the beginning, and now zombies make your ears bleed as they constantly spam random moan clips like they're part of a down-syndrome orgy, even if theres only one zombie. Good.\n\n- Performance.\n\nYes, I am going to kick THAT dead horse, oh yes. I know it's basically a pile of mush and crumbled bones at this point, but god damn it, I expected some kind of improvement after this long, but if anything the game runs worse. Even on the lowest settings, where everything is basically a brown-green pixeled blur on the screen, the game runs like a man who is coma-stricken, severely asthmatic, and has no legs. The engine acts like an apathetic nurse, occasionally walking up to the man and flipping him over so he doesn't lay in his own feces for an hour.\n\n-  Net-Code/Bullet Detection/What the @(!% is happening?\n\nSo I spend hours looting, feeling tense and unsure of my surroundings, adventuring and meeting people, until finally I catch someone from behind, blast them in the head (and see the blood), only to have them spin around and kill me. This happens all the time, and it's because even though I killed him, the server hasn't quite understood that he is dead yet, so despite his screen violently shaking and flashing red because he's technically dead, he will have no problem being temporarily undead and turning to return fire. Great.\n\n- Movement\n\nHoly mother of jesus. If anything exemplifies the fact that this engine sucks, and that it needs to be ripped out and completely redone... it's the movement. How many times do I have to press "V" before I vault over that fence? 2? 4? 6?? Well, sometimes it takes a few presses, and I die because of it. Kind of important to get over objects while being chased.\n\nHow about when your legs are broken? Heh, good luck fitting through doors, scrub. Oh, and if you do manage to sqeeze your obese ♥♥♥ through a doorframe, you'll have to do a kneel-stand-prone dance on any ledge above 1-inch that leads outside, and sometimes it doesn't even let you out. Hope you weren't being chased.\n\nThe half-second of input lag (was this intentional? If so, that is worse) whenever you try to start/stop moving makes you feel like your character is moving through thick mud (although feces would probably make more sense for this analogy). I cannot count the times where the delay between my release of a movement key and my character actually stopping has caused me to go flying off ledges, cliffs, and into the open. I'd call movement 'janky' or 'frustrastingly mind-numbingly bad' but I don't think there are words left to describe how awful it feels.\n\n\n- Graphics/ability to see what the @($* is going on\n\nThis ties into performance, but I felt it needed it's only brief section because of how bad it is. Yes, on the lowest settings this game looks like garbage - we all know that. However, looking like garbage wouldn't be an issue if I could actually see enemies within 300 meters, but I can't. The settings are so ♥♥♥♥ that I can't see through windows, I can't see people, and I can hardly move around unless I'm in the middle of nowhere with no buildings around whatsoever. If you want to have a fight in the city, have fun - just make sure you have one of the NASA computers. ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\n\n"Minor" Cons\n\n- Broken Zombie AI (they are braindead, and still walk through walls)\n- Weapons drop to ground even when you have bag space\n- Bag space often glitches and requires relog\n- After cutting down a tree a stick is put onto your back (what level of insanity is this?)\n- Hands often glitch and can't be used to hold anything, requiring relog\n- Bouncing off things at a great height and not dying (yet falling 4 feet can kill you)\n- Horrible hit-detection with melee attacks\n- Severe shaking when cold, but nothing to indicate level of cold - no way to effect temperature (other than fire and sort of heat packs?)\n- "Default" button in settings is too easy to hit. Remove this from the god damn game. I spent hours getting things just right to accidentally hit this thing.\n- Loot spawning is broken - buildings with dozens of coats while other buildings have nothing. Delete old loot, useless loot, and repopulate loot please. Nothing useful is up north anymore, at least nothing I can't just get south. This is silly.\n- Drinking from well/pond. Let me drink until I want to cancel, or until I vomit. Don't make me spam "drink" over and over or wait five days to take one sip. I got ♥♥♥♥ to do, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nMajor Pros\n\n- Adventure/tension\n\n\nI like the adventure and tension... but only when the game isn't lagging, and when the server is responding... and when the admins won't just kick you for killing them. Huh, maybe adventure isn't so great.\n\n\n- Meeting People\n\nI like talking to people and wondering if they're going to stab me in the back or not, but nowadays I've given up on it. It's a risky thing to do, and after so many wasted hours, I don't want to waste 5 more just to be backstabbed by a 'friendly' guy. And that's why I never meet anyone anymore, or if I do it's at the end of their gun, pointing at my nose as it blasts hot lead through my brain until I am no more than a bloody puddle on the road.\n\n\nOther Pros\n\n- ???\n\n\n\nSo yeah, don't buy this. After 3 years the game has added a few articles of clothing, guns, and trucks - nothing more than a tiny strip of cloth acting as a "bandage" being applied to the long-since dead corpse that this game is. I became addicted to the adventure and tension early on, and I suckered myself into thinking the game would improve. It did not.\n\nI am ashamed to have bought this now, and as I look back all I can do is shake my head in despair, wondering why things haven't changed. Well, the price changed. The price went up. Fancy that.\n\n\nI wanted to make some great analogy about how Dayz is a skeleton and how terribly empty it is, but instead I'll just say the game is ♥♥♥♥ and always has been. I see no future in it, and neither should any of you.\n\nGood day sirs.\n\nPS (excerpt from comments)\n\n"And Hicks, I assume by saying "not yet ready for the main Steam branch" you mean whatever you are developing can't even run on steam (servers or clientside) effectively?\n\nNot that it matters, because when you bring up the fact that we are only playing on a placeholder, I wonder why it is you guys are still developing for it instead of focusing on* your assumedly newer, better version of the game. Are you doing it because the information gathered is revelant, and because the changes you make to our current version are somehow revelant to an (again, assumedly) entirely new engine/game?\n\nYou know, it doesn't even matter if I understand the process or not. The fact is, after a couple years of basically no change, I just can't help but shrug.\n\nWhat hope I had is gone, and my patience has all but dispersed like the tears of a one-winged angel (so dep).\n\nDon't buy this game.

During my adventure i stumbled across a guy bleeding like a woman on def con 5. I told him to tear his shirt into rags and bandage himself. He replied gratefully. I asked if he had any food, he replied a can of beans I can't open so I didn't ask for them. We parted ways. About a half hour later he showed up on the highway with 2 goons.

Im guessing steam is just messing up\n\n\n\n2013: The long promised Stand alone game for DayZ finally gets released. We are all very happy that our favourite mod finally gets its own game. Things couldnt be better. The game has a fair share of bugs but its to be expected. Its in early access Alpha, we jsut need to provice feedback and the devs will fix it.\n\n2014: Okay the progress of this game has been really slow. But we still have hope, they are going to make this game the greatest survival game ever. They did make millions of dollars from this game after all. Just look at the sales figures. I mean. They will make the game perfect, jsut like they promised right?\n\n2015: Noone is playing this game anymore, only the few youtubers that make exclusive DayZ content are keeping it alive. Almsot noone of Bohemias promises have been fulfilled. Plus Dean 'Rocket' Hall, the main guy behind the ever so popular DayZ mod has left the development team. Every fans hopes are crushed.\n\n2016: Here we are 3 years later. Still the same story. Still the same problems. Just no more players. But it's okay right? The game is in early alpha. it will all get fixed when the game comes out of alpha, right?\n\n\n\nThis game single handedly made Early Access look like a joke and caused all these "DayZ Clones" to spawn, making 2013-2015 a terrible time fo gaming\n\n\nDo not waste money on this game, Buy ArmA2, downlaod the Epoch mod and get a far better experience.\nThis is my honest review.\n\nReply to people claiming "You havent played the new DayZ. there has been alot of updates e.t.c."\n\n\nThat's the whole reason this game is trash. The "Updates" are only to add things like Clothes,hats,weapons,weapon mods,a new village e.t.c. We don't need those. That's just a cheap trick by bohemia to keep clueless people playing, cause they will try to obtain all that new pointless stuff.\n\nWhat I am talking about is the terrible optimization of this game. The horrible Zombie AI. The really bad inventory system. The non existent anti-cheat. The broken promises by Bohemia. The building clipping ( where you would randomly teleport on the other side of the wall while pressing agaisnt it ). The list just goes on and on.\n\nIf you fail to see this then you are one of the sheep that allows Bohemia to do what they are doing now. Hype up a game, promise wonderful stuff, make millions in sales and abandon the game.\n\nAnd if you dont believe me just visit the DayZ website and look under the news section. They bring out an update every ~60 days just to add a handful of weapons and a few clothes evey time.\n\nJust because i no longer invest 2 hours every day ( and i most likely never will again ) in this game doesnt mean i dont follow the development.","January 10","false","241.4"," 819 of 928 people (88%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","88","819","928","57","131"

It was so simple, but so, so much fun.\n\nWe made our own zombie holdout missions, too.\n\nI was among the first people to play the DayZ mod. I was there, saw it grow and develop over time.\n\nEventually the inevitable happened and we got the standalone announcement. I was thrilled. Everyone was. I bought it and so did my friends. It was amazing. Surely, it was lacking in many respects, like zombies having no pathfinding at all and phasing through buildings. Still, we damn played it. It felt like a culmination of the childhood years of poorly made Operation Flashpoint mods.\n\nThree years later.. I feel as if the game has not progressed at all. Zombies were buggy then, they're buggy or nonexistent now. You could die suddenly and inexplainably from a bug then, and the same can still happen to you. There are more towns, but I can no longer tell them from each other because they function and look the same. Performance feels even worse than before. Community has dwindled to a core group of die-hard murderers and elitists. Gone are the days of innocent exploration, the stories of friendship and betrayal. Only paranoia and almost spreadsheet-like pattern of effective looting remain.\n\nMaybe in another three years the game will be good, but I doubt the bad taste will ever leave my mouth.\n\nI feel as if things have only gotten worse,\n\nor I have only grown bitter from having what I hailed as a culmination to my faithfulness being defiled by this demented, stretched-out perversion.","April 8","false","450.2"," 791 of 901 people (88%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","88","791","901","57","29"

I NOW HAVE PROOF THE DEVELOPERS ARE TRYING TO DISHONESTLY REMOVE THIS DAMAGING REVIEW> SEE LINKED SCREENSHOT. I've uploaded it again as somehow its been flagged and taken down...UPDATE ITS NOW BEEN TAKEN DOWN 3 TIMES BY COMPLAINTS...I WONDER WHO....\n\nhttp://imgur.com/HbqKLjP\n\nIf you look at the screenshot, there are two places to look. The first part is the orange part. The developers have attemped to dishonestly remove this review by flagging it as "Abusive". If you read it, there is nothing abusive about it people. The second part to look at in the picture is the chat pannel with a Moderator on the forum. He confirms that is in fact the Producer of this game "Hicks" that tried to remove the review from Steam. This is a clear attempt by the Developers to silcence critisism and restrict free speach. If you read below you will see "Hicks" comes up often, and has had run ins with me before.\n---------------------------------\nAs you can see I have almost 350hrs on record. This is negative review of the Developers, their tactics, and the state of the game so long into development it is frankly appaling this game is still so under developed. I decided to review after being PERMENTANTLY BANNED from the forum by the Developers without a given reason. a second ban for speaking my mind, showing the facts and informing others from an informed perspective.\n\nThe basics:\n1. This game has been in development for almost 2yrs, and far far longer if you count the original mod. I don't, however for those with game developing experience 2yrs development on a game where much of the basic foundations and information are already present in the mod is poor, to have 2yrs go by and this product is still in "Alpha" is shameful.\n\n2. Numerous deadlines were missed, numerous targets moved and some altogether disapeared, the owners of this game have repeadedly been told things were going to happen which they have failed to deliver. Reports of game breaking and terrible bugs from day 1 continue to today, with the developers bragging about adding a fireplace, a pot, a pig....when zombies can run through walls, hit you whilst invisible, and players can look through walls and even shoot through them. Shameful. Fix the house lads before you paint the garage....\n\n3. I was banned from positng on the forum very shortly after I made readers aware of who these "developers" were, what products they made, and the track record of misinformation and failed promises from the Dayz Team.\n\n3. I then spent the next 4months playing other games, I had given up. One day 4months later I decide to see if my ban has been lifted and what the status of the game is now after such a long time away. Surely the've fixed bugs that were prevalent 6months ago? What a suprise....NO. This time I posted a topic on the forum about the current state, and the fact I had been away for so long and nothing had improved, we were STILL in Alpha. Within and hour I was permenently banned. The reason given? Just a blank black box....Anyone already thinking what I'm thinking?\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1. This game is now confirmed to the PS4, when they haven't even fixed massive and basic issues, they clearly have used this as a massive cash grab to potentially pay for the full development of the PS4 game. Why else would it take them almost 2yrs to stay in Alpha yet state there will be a PS4 version soon?\n\n2. The developers have fundementally failed to deliver on their promises, and continue to do so.\n\n3. Any dissent is met with 4-5 die hard fanboys who operate with total immunity, insulting, showing the most repugnant language and attitude in clear abuse breach of the rules, yet the dissenters are banned, removed, and shipped off. Even screenshot clear violations are completely ignored. I had one person publically talk about my "trophy wife and family on the forum. I reported the abuse and showed evidence...ignored. Essentially this is similar to the Day One Garry's Incident fiasco where the developers are clearly putting a concentrated and dishonest effort to silence critics and not allowing freedom of speech. Would you beleive me if I told you that every single trace of my posts and evidence has been deleted from the forum? Outrageous.\n\n4. This game is sold on a wonderful premis and has great potential, the developers have taken approx £30m and have utterly failed to use that money to develop a proper working game. Instead our money has been spent on buying an Eastern European developer nobody has heard of, and 4 thousand that have hate them, and the rest of our money is being spent of the full proper development of a PS4 title people will have to pay for again if they want to see what the game was supposed to be.\n\n\nIF ONLY ONE PERSON READS THIS AND DOESNT BUY THE GAME MY TIME WILL HAVE BEEN WELL SPENT....DO NOT BUY THIS GAME","October 31, 2014","false","348.0"," 8,570 of 10,305 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","570","10","2","912"

If you check the reviews you'll notice that the trend is that the older the game gets the more negative reviews it receives (people that reserved judgement rather than making a snap evaluation). This is for several reasons.\n\n- Most can't play it regardless of specs: If you've read any review you'll see that it has optimization problems\n- The community and devs are rude: Fanboys have empowered the devs to be rude. The original project lead was known for it and the next man up is equally a ♥♥♥♥. They actually praise them for it. They're not professiona.\n- It's lost it's appeal. They've made the worst parts even worse. For example, you must run forever to really get into anything fun or exciting. They reduced the speed of running and increased the rate at which your stamina depletes. Makes it even longer.\n- The community is dying: Most people acknowledge that even if it does get released that it'll be with a dead community of only the most hardcore fanboys\n- The Engine: The fundmental flaw was the the engine was never right for this project. They started off with bad project management and have only continued this trend.\n\nMost people say that they wish that they had their money back. I actually requested it 30 minutes after buying it because they flat out lied about the specs required and I couldn't play it. They refused and while eventually I could at least see the world and play with friends I regret that steam didn't have the refund policy in place before hand.

Basically, Spawn, Gather, Gear Up, seek a skirmish win or die and repeat.\n\nBest played in groups the game allows for a pack/gang of players to divide and conquer as you take over towns, city's and army bases / airfileds at will be sheer force of numbers on your way to 'gearing up' your toon. Gearing up basically prescribes hours of grinding in the form of scavenging for materials, food and loadout. All the while defending yourself from the Zobie apocalypse and even more threatening - other players.\n\nI can honestly say that the process of gearing up can often take so long that you feel attached to the toon, You work so bloody hard to gather the gear required to defend yourself and survive... So much so that when the time comes (and it inevitibly will) that you have a skirmish with another player or group of players you feel so vested in surviving that the game genuinly gives you a HUGE adrenalin rush!! Truly, It does! These skirmishes never end well... Although there are multiple things that can happen typically the end result is the same - you get killed - Only the way in which you die or how long this takes varies.\n\nExamples of how I've been killed so far:\n\nShot,\nAxed.\nStripped completely naked of all equipment (except underwear) and handcuffed and fed disenfectant - Die a slow painful death.\nDeath by Zombie,\nDeath by glitch.\nDeath by being forced to stand beside a servcie stations fuel bowser while the enemy shoot it and blow up the servo...\nDeath by cold.\nStarved.\nElectrocuted.\nIt goes on and on...\n\n\n\nThe cons.\n\nMy biggest gripe is with the DayZ developer's, Bohemia Interactive and Dean Hall (DayZ's founder). I feel like we are being completely and totally taken for granted and here's why...\n\nThe game is early access, We sign up for this on the promise of the games potential and we make this decision based on what the developer tells us they are doing / going to do to make this game complete.\n\nSince DayZ standalone's early access release it has sold over 2 MILLION copies!!! Thats right TWO MILLION + because the two million mark was actually reached sometime around May of 2014.\nhttp://www.joystiq.com/2014/05/02/dayz-standalone-racks-up-two-million-sales/\n\nGiven that was 8 months ago... The actual current figure could now be closer to 2.5 MILLION or even 3 MILLION copies sold...\n\nSo here's my point - lets assume it's 2.5MILLION copies at an average of say $28 per copy accounting for periods of reduced cost to buy to average out Steam Sales special's  ... 2.5 million times $28 = $70 MILLION in sales for this game and it hasn't even left ALPHA.\n\n\n!!! $70 odd MILLION in sales !!!\n\n\nSo the issue for me and many others is not the money, It's the lack of meaningful progress in the games development cycle. At writing I have just over 400 hours of game time logged. In 12 months I have seen a slow and infrequent update cycle where no real beneficial or meaningful upgrades happen... For example;\n\n: One gun gets removed and replaced with another gun. The new guns is useless until the next patch because there is no ammo in the game for it.\n\n: The guys dutifully upgraded the textures of some objects - Things like Zuchini's (food) and so forth that make no difference to the game what so ever other than visual. Really? Can't the polish wait till a little later in the dev cycle?\n\n: The melee is essentially completely broken. Hitting a zombie usually finds you flailing madly trying to move the cursor around the zombie's body to find that small area where the hit can be registered. all the while, it never misses you with every attack.\n\n: Clipping. Clipping everywhere! And... yup you guessed it.... it's not being fixed.\n\n: Teddy Bears? They gave us teddy Bears in the .52 update, Yay!!! Why? Why when I still can't cook food or fly a chopper? Why?\n\nYou see the thing is.... after taking 70 MILLION odd in sales Bohemia and Dean Hall are currently laying on thier beds at night making money angels in the layers upon layers of $$$$ bills.\n\nAll the while taking us, and you the prospective buyer completely for granted. Why push to complete the game - In thier eyes clearly they don't need too!!\n\nSeriously considering making a facebook page where we (the paying community of end users) can lobby for improved progress and frequency of meaningful updates because at the rate these guys are 'pfaffing' around changing textures on Zuchini's and adding Teddy Bears in four different colors this game will never be completed in a reasonably acceptable gestation period.\n\nWhat's the average norm for a game these days, start to release it's normally around about a 2 year cycle afaik... Yeah.... well we are well on the way to eclipsing that date and we are still playing an alpha game with more things broken then are fixed, more proposed content and fuctionality missing than in game and... no real direction on when we will see it.\n\n\nMy advice, H1Z1 is coming to Steam very soon... Suggest you check it out before you buy this, because I suspect it will take the crown from DayZ very quickly once released because... you guessed it, It has a active team developing the game under the guide and watchful eye of Sony.\n\nSo with the knowledge the game's development is almost non existent - well thats not exactly true... More that the development not being meaningful to improving the game is leaps and bounds and knowing they have raised over $70 million from it, I ask where is the investment in the game?\n\nWhy hasn't the development team expanded, new expereinced people brought in in large numbers to get the thing moving - accellorating productivity and the quality of the output.\n\nLike I said - it all points to a developer who is taking the Intelectual Property for granted - harvesting it for all it can without putting in the development $$$ what they know they should.\n\nWell... i say you get back out of it what you put into it.\n\n\nBohemia and even more so Dean hall - You should be completely ashamed of yourselves.\n\nSteam - You shuld too for allowing such a reputed developer (ARMA series) to take it's purchasing customers for granted in this way. You need to tighten up the EARLY ACCESS rules with a view to ensuring progressive updates are delivered on a agreed schedule (failure to meet a deadline see's a financial penalty to the studio) to protect the end user.\n\n$70 million raised and after nearly two years it's still broken and still ALPHA.\n\n\n\nCOMPLETELY DISGUSTING.\n\nSincerely, Shags.","January 7, 2015","false","624.0"," 1,475 of 1,748 people (84%) found this review helpful 125 people found this review funny","84","475","1","125","70"

Shot after shot was fired at me. I kept yelling into the mic "You suck at shooting!" Nearing cherno i was hit once. I crawled up to the top floor and used my only rag to stop bleeding. By this point i knew I was gone. Tears were streaming down my face as I wished it didnt have to happen like this. I could hear him running along the floor below me looking for me. He came out of the doorway from the stairs and i scream "WAIT!"... He pointed his gun at me. I closed my eyes and braced myself. nothing happened..... I looked him in the eyes as he looked in mine. I told him the bad things i did. I told him about my family. My friend that he killed. I told him how what they did to me i had deserved it. I could see tears streaming down his face. He looked at me and told me something. He told me how he knew i killed one of his friends. He told me how the other was shot in a shoot out. His face soaked with tears he pointed the gun at me. I said "no need. we have both lost something." He put the gun down. "We can end this together. No need for anymore violence. We dropped our stuff and walked to the edge.

And I've enjoyed most of it. But, unfortunately, after a year of early access and over 60 million dollars in sales (!!), I really cannot defend the rate at which this game is being developed anymore. Like it or not, the developers have already sold the game to the majority of their potential playerbase, and for them to ignore numerous issues that drastically damage most player's gameplay experience on the grounds that it's still alpha is unfortunately ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off their playerbase.  After more than a year in development since the start of the alpha, the game has somewhat more content but feels no less broken.\n\nWith the amount of money they've made on this game, I cannot understand how they can only manage a few bug fixes every other week and a few new models every month. Maybe it's a staffing issue, maybe it's management... I can only speculate.

I've supported DayZ with my whole heart since the mod, and it's an awesome concept, I love everything about it. Except for how it's faring with progress. Here's the to do list from November 26, 2014.\n\nQ1 2015:\n\nBasic vehicles\nAdvanced loot distribution\nNew renderer\nNew Zombie AI\nBasic stealth system (zombies and animals)\nDiseases\nQ2 2015:\n\nAdvanced vehicles (repair and modifications)\nAdvanced animals (life cycle, group behavior)\nPlayer statistics\nNew UI\nPlayer stamina\nDynamic events\nQ3 2015:\n\nTraps\nBarricading\nCharacter life span + soft skills\nAnimal predators + birds\nAerial transport\nConsole prototype\nQ4 2015:\n\nAnimal companions\nSteam community integration\nConstruction (base building)\n\nThis was scheduled to all be done by 2015, and we're closing in on the end of this year. The developers are lazy, or not interested in working with DayZ anymore. Every update is add a few weapons or items, and that'll be that and it works as a temporary satisfaction for the playerbase. Well, guess what. The performance is dropping, I used to get 40 to 60 fps in towns, now it steeps to twenty. I started a new life from a long hiatus, got gear and you know what? Didn't see a single zombie in MAIN TOWNS.  And the performance was STILL lower then what it was on the release date. I had better frames in TOWNS on the release date then I have in the country side these days. And this is on a mid end PC, how are they expecting to port this to consoles? With our luck, it'll be an half ♥♥♥♥♥ port. DayZ is steeping lower and lower.\n\nBy this point we'll throw a dice, it's pure fate on what'll happen with DayZ. Either they turn it around, or it'll never come out of Early Access.\n\nEDIT: I am very displeased with it all, but I do not support refunds. I agreed on that term, and I understand that that money isn't coming back my way ever again.\n\nPlus, all this about the 60 man team, if you're making one of the most anticipated zombie genre games of, arguably all time, why just hire 60 persons, especially when you're backed by a big company such as Bohemia Interactive?","October 30, 2015","false","199.9"," 397 of 446 people (89%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","89","397","446","15","42"

DayZ is pretty broken. You got zombies running through walls and glitches that can be abused, but I go and ramble on and on about that type of stuff. So, here is a summary of my first day on DayZ. I spawned on a small coastal town (Solichny probably spelled that incorrectly). I only had basic clothes and a flashlight with a battery in my pocket. I wasted about 20 minutes going through every damn building in the town, because I didn’t know the good areas to loot at the time. So I found some food, a hoodie, and even a new backpack with ample storage. Then, I just blatantly and blindly ran down this road, just to see where it would take me. I ran and ran, then looted most of some other town (Kamyshovo). I followed the road some more and came across a large city called Elektro. I was in some apartment building of some kind near the church. That’s when I meet someone. The first person I had ever met in DayZ. It was decision time: try and take on this man (who, by the way, was armed), or try and befriend him. I decided that I’d try and be friendly. He was, to my surprise, friendly back. He actually gave me some food and a splitting axe. I walked out of the apartment building with him and we were just about to part ways when all the sudden, I hear a child yell over the mic “GET ON THE GROUND!” That’s when I see a militant- looking man come out from the shrubbery, and another one followed. One had a Mosin and the other had an M4. They handcuffed me, but my newfound “friend” ended up running away. The two “militants” shot him down. Next they took the little gear I had from me and put a gun to my head. *Bang*. Everything is black. I see one sentence on the screen. It read “You are dead”. And then I said, “Well, no ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, game”. And basically I spent 203 hours on this game, repeating the cycle. Now, you may be asking yourself at this point “well, this doesn’t seem very fun. It seems kind of repetitive. Well, let me tell you, it isn’t. You know why? Because, it always pans out differently. Like, for example, maybe when you find someone while you’re geared up you decide to explore your dark side and torture the dude. Or you want to be a hero, or even neutral (me usually). So for that, I will give this game 2 thumbs up. But know this, the game is still young, and it will be a long time for the finish product. So if you don’t mind that, then I suggest you buy the game.\n\nHere is a more basic version of this long-♥♥♥ review for those of you who don’t want to read the whole thing: Spawn, loot, run, loot, run some more, die, respawn, repeat. Wow, that kind makes it sound boring.

Pretty chill dude. We told him we would give a prize if he sang a song and we like it, so he starts signing some songs. After a wuick vote, we realized we couldnt agree on wheter or not he was a decent singer. We had this dude play three more songs before we decided that we couldn't ever agree. I loved every note that this dude sang, but my friend wasn't having it. We agreed that we should try something else to test this dude's worthiness. We quickly devised that if we started shooting off some rounds and it attracted zombies, that he would have to fight the zombies. We would mend his wounds if he survived. So we empty like a clip or two into the air and I kid you not this dude single handedly kills 14 zombies with a baseball bat and was barely bleeding at all. We quickly tended to his wounds and agreed that he deserved whatever one Item he wanted. Then this crazy dude starts chasing us, we hight ail the heck out of there but the guy was really persistent. We look over our shoulders about a mile up the road and sure enough, he's still running at us like he wants to hug us really bad. But seeing as he has abaseball bat equipped that he just used to kill like 14 zombies with, my friend and I were reasonably afraid. we Run like 4 towns away and this guys is STILL following us. He was probably the most persistent person I have ever met in my life. He just simply and unequivcally would not give up. Finally, about an hour of solid running later, we talk to him. We agree to stop and give this dude his rightfully earned prize. We ask him what he would like or if needs anything. This dude went silent for awhile. He was quiet for about three, maybe four strau=ight minutes. My friend and I talked and didn't want to disturb this crazy killing machine, but he earned a prize and a prize he should recieve. We then asked him if he was still there and again want he wanted or if he needed any supplies. He said he was still there and that he was just having areally bad day. apparently this guy's dog just died three days after his girlfriend broke up with him because he couldn't move with her across the country to Califronia. He really loved this dog and had had it for roughly 15 years. He proceeded to tell us a few stories about the dog and how much he loved it. He said he was really upset about his dog, and cared way more about it han his girlfriend. One time he took his dog to a park, and he started to.... uh... well, be VERY friendly towards a homeless man. This guy clearly loved his dog and had tons of stories to share with us. Aftwerwards, feeeling rather sorry for the guy, we asked him one last time if there was anything, anything at all that he needed from us, it was his. At this point, he very wearily siad "I'm gonna need 'bout tree fiddy." it was at this moment that I realized this traveler was actually a hundred-fifty foot sea monster from the Paleozoic era. "God damn lockness monstah!" I said. "I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy!" He ran way super quickly and I never saw him again","January 31, 2014","true","217.7"," 590 of 692 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","590","692","5","33"

I stood by it for a long time, I defended it as being alpha, I talked it up to everyone. But no, after two years we still have a worthless pile of glitchy garbage. Any sort of close quarters combat is impossible because everything you're seeing is about 2 seconds late. Your player tends to randomly stop, put his weapon away, and pull out a random new one at the worst times possible. Sometimes you don't hear gunshots. Your legs can randomly break if you go over certain areas. Sometimes you can't hear gunshots. Almost every gunfight in close quarters consists of you being shot and dying before you even see the other person raise their gun. Sometimes guns won't fire. Sometimes you can't aim down the sights. Sometimes you can't switch weapons (All the time, more like). Sometimes you can't climb ladders. The game is ridiculous. Please, spare it the time I obviously didn't and do not buy this game until it comes out, if it ever does. As previously stated, I defended this game for a long time but there's no excuse for how terrible it is now.

Dayz is the best survival game that exists on the market today, even if it is still in alpha stage. Now i present some pluses and minuses of this game :\n(Dayz  v0.52)\n+ Graphics\n+ The idea of survival\n+ Variety of weapons / food / clothing\n+ Private Hive\n+ A large map with many towns and villages\n\n- The way they uptade the game. Adding stuff =  break down things that were good before\n- Zombie (even if it's a zombie survival, currently their number is very low, their mechanics is disastrous and sometimes you surprise them to be invisible on some servers)\n- Crafting : right now, the only thigs that u can craft and use is  just fireplace, splint and rags. Others like bow, backpack (u can find backpack before rope usual), arrows r useless.\n- Lack of info about who is killing who\n- Game Client (often crush to desktop and fps drop )\n- Anti Cheat system (this is the biggest problem of the game)\n\nWhy not recommend this game? is  because engine that allows hackers to ruin this game. Unlike other games, in Dayz you need a few hours to gather a decent gear so you can get a nice pvp and hackers can destroy everything in a sec. If in other games aimbot and wallhack is something usual, in Dayz u can find some "ridiculous hacks" :\n- Aimbot, speedhack, wallhacks\n- They can ignore solid texture (walk or shoot through walls)\n- Can interact with a player from 1 km distance without visual contact and they can steal your gear or teleport bullets/ melle hits in your character\n- Can spawn items, or can duplicate their characters\n- They can fly or levitate :)\n\nI think Bohemia would need to do something to reduce game client capability to do so many on server side.\nEDITED: Btw, i whant to add some procent of my Death times:\nKilled by zombies - 0%\nKilled by Players  - 30%\nKilled by server - 25% (this include: character not loading from hive, fall through textures, crush to desktop and killed by zombies, killed while on stairs)\nKilled by hackers - 45% ( i count here only when i got killed by bullets throw wall, teleporting/speeding player near me and almost instant group deaths while i'm with my friends)\n\nAnd this is all for the moment.

As a gamer, I am not here to placate the development team or ruffle the feathers of the clearly loyal fanbase. I am here to give an honest opinion of what my experience with this game has been like at this point - WITH EMPHASIS AT THIS POINT -\n\nFirst off, I am historically not a fan of FPS games but just because they are not my 'thing' does not mean that they are undeserving of play. I picked up this title after the prodding of several guys that I know, my husband included. I figured- I will get shot in the face a few times and we will laugh it up and I will be done with it altogether. So I gave it a go with about 35 bucks. I mean that's the cost of taking the boys to the movies one time so not too pricy. Besides- I have been wrong about games in the past.\n\nSo, I loaded it up- prepared to be irritated.\n\nWhat I discovered was that I actually liked it, mind you this was before the recent debacle that removed persistance. I met up with my friends we looted and shot zombies. I became fond of the Winchester rifle because at least I only had to hit crap once with the thing before they dropped. Some mechanics were not quite there yet but that was okay- the game is in alpha. We made ourselved a little tent city in the middle of nowhere and started storing up supplies and bags, everything was great. We raided the airfield and we explored freely knowing that we had gear stashed should we meet with untimely ends.\n\nI began to make notes of what I would like to see- given the fact that the development team made it very clear that they were open to suggestions and wanted the community to participate- I mean that is the point of an alpha release is it not? So when I felt I had played enough to familiarize myself with the gameplay and mechanics I decided to post some of my findings on their "Official Forums". Here is where my problem with this title began...\n\nI attempted to create an account- there was a problem and it would do nothing but give me an error telling me to try again later. So I tried later, on more than one occasion on more than one day. No luck. So I found the e-mail for support and sent them one detailing my problem. The response I got was automated, and from my e-mail provider informing me that the address I copy/pasted did not exist. So I shook my head and got back in the game.\n\nThen the game updated and persistance was gone... and so were the majority of zombies... WOW this is so great now we have a zombie survival game with no persistant storage and no zombies. I tried to play but the game quickly devolved into a shooting fest where the only point to play is to shoot each other in the face, respawn, grab a weapon and go at it again.... not fun. "Oh but the game is in Alpha...." I just want to punch the crap out of the faces of everyone who spouts that comment off. Yes this game is in alpha but at this point it is most decidedly NOT a zombie survival game at all.\n\nWhich brings me to my experience with early access games- I own several alpha stage games and none of them are being produced with the same apathy as this one. They do not post anything of any value as to the state of their game or EVEN the things they expect to fix in their next update. OR EVEN WHEN that next update might be. Sure they update their forums but .... oh yeah the forums.....\n\nSo I go back to the forums to try again this morning.... now it says my e-mail is in use....WTF so I go through the proceedure of captcha playing to get the site to send me my username and then password reset.... follow the instructions- use reset code.......INVALID CODE.... so yeah forums are a bust.\n\nThis is not to say that I cannot be patient about this or that I am unwilling to wait for fixes and deal with bugs and interruptions in gameplay. I am however not willing to deal with the lack of communication and availability of information given out by the developer as to the status of their project.\n\nTo compare- ARK is currently in ALPHA as well and was released only a month ago on steam. They make small fixes nearly every day. They update steam almost daily with a report of what they are working on, what is in the current patch and what they expect to roll out in the next update WITH a timeframe of "this week". To put it simply almost everytime I log into Steam that game updates... But no word from the DayZ team. Just saying.\n\nNow I know they have announcements on steam that they do update- but these announcements include 0 valuable information for the average gamer and instead include vague statements about how near they are to whatever they are working on. Their Development roadmap for this year is also not on target....it seems to me that the team's idea is to grab money and drag this out while grabbing more money from players with no real intent to actually complete this broken pos.\n\nSO- If you are looking for a FPS with no point beyond that and or a snakeoil salesman's promise that it will get better, than this is the game for you.\n\nHere is to hoping that as this game improves as it continues to be developed, I really wanted to play this but at this point it is a waste of my time.\n\n----------------UPDATE 7/27/15----------------\n\nSo today I got a one week ban from the steam forum for DayZ. I did not violate any rule nor did I lie as I was accused of doing. This is just one more reason not to purchase this game. Not only can you not communicate effectively with the dev team you are not allowed to voice dissatisfaction. The moderator in question has banned other players for "false accusations" under similar circumstances according to his steam activity. These other parties did not IMO deserve bans. I am not naming names because that would be stooping to their level.\n\nI did submit a support ticket out of principle. The ban is only for 1 week, but I don't like being called a liar- especially since all I did was tell the truth. We'll see what support has to say.","July 6, 2015","false","177.5"," 451 of 530 people (85%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","85","451","530","24","31"

This game in its current state is fogging awful.\nThis is however an early access review.\n\nDayZ is the full game based on the popular mod for ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead with less content and more heavy breathing. In it you play as a man (or woman) with Crohn's disease, a cold blooded thermophysiology, Asthma and Bulimia... that has the super power of Blurred Vision. You have to overcome these obstacles in a world of psychopaths, narcissists and Let's Players.\nEnter the world of eternal rain: Chernarus.\n\nDeath comes quickly in this world. After stuffing yourself full of three whole cans of beans, you will have died from starvation after about half an hour. That is, if your blurred screen hasn't made you fall off a two meter high rock resulting in you breaking all your bones and damaging all your internal organs.\nAlways remember: ladders are your worst enemy. They are sadistic possessed contraptions that will kill you every chance they get.\n\nYour dedication however will pay off, you will have a gun, you will find someone who deserves to be shot full of that half empty mag you found, you will sneak up behind that person to the point your barrel is penetrating their neck. You will pull the trigger... and you will miss. Every. Single. Shot.\n\nThen you will be lying there with a piece of gardening equipment sticking out of your head wondering why you haven't seen a single zombie yet even though this is supposed to be a zombie game... right?\n\nEnjoy the search that is finding the colour-customization system hidden somewhere under layers of empty spray paint cans and broken down weapon components.\n\nThis game will teach you that a diet of rotten fruit and charcoal is the greatest thing since Rotten Flesh in Minecraft.\n\nThis is DayZ.\nYou will find yourself dodging bandits, running away from attention seeking Let's Players who are desperately trying to help you and hoping to the devil Dean Hall himself that you will find another can of beans in this next empty house.\nThat is DayZ.\n\nMaybe at some point this game will actually get close to the idea of realism the devs seemed to have had in mind when this thing started out but for now it's a mess of a game that has been outdone by just about half of the games in this genre and even the very mod this game is based on.\n\n3/10 for being suspiciously much like a complete waste of time.\n\nFootnote: I would just like to mention I played the DayZ mod for a good 400 hours and that some of the best times gaming I have ever had were spent in the world of DayZ.\n\n\nADDITION: A more serious review.\n\nThe crafting aspect of DayZ was never fully realized in the mod when Dean Hall was developing it but has since been hugely improved by the community. Even in the current build of the DayZ standalone crafting is still as poor as ever and many games have already demonstrated better ways of doing this, even Minecraft, a game that served as huge inspiration for Dean when I made the mod.\n\nThe UI feels and looks terrible and is something I dearly hope will be completely changed before the game even gets out of Alpha.\n\nThe weapons in the standalone are another major problem. Trying to stop people from shooting on sight the weapons have gotten a strange mechanic where they become less accurate depending on how well the weapons condition is. That's neither particularly realistic nor does it actually deter bandits from shooting people on sight.\nIt makes the game feel messy and ruins the immersion of any gunfight. Be it because my gun is acting poorly or because it is acting poorly for whoever it is that is shooting at me. The issue is always there.\n\nOther parts of the improved realism aspect include a more noticeable stamina system that was most likely based off of ArmA 3s stamina system.\nA hunger system and the ability to get food poisoning.\nBeing affected by cold and rain.\nYes, these are all great additions to the simulation aspect of the game but are also horribly out of balance with not only gameplay but also reality.\nAs far as I know, nobody in the history of mankind has ever died of starvation within two hours of not eating any food.\n\nLoot spots are also far to scarce. There are maybe five or six places in each house where you are likely to find an item and more often than not these items are completely out of place.\nThis is one of the issues I think DayZ has that I can't really get away from. The Chernarus world worked well for the mod which was more about hunting/gathering rather than scavenging buildings but in the standalone the emphasis put on scavenging just makes the lack of variety more apparent.\nThere are things absent from the Chernarus world that didn't matter to Arma II as that game has an entirely different focus but that are glaringly apparent in the mod and more-so in the standalone. Things like clothing stores, hunting/fishing stores, coffee shops and even audio/video stores. These are all things you now need to make the world believable and are necessary to give the player a more clear objective for what to loot. At the very least it would give the world a more life-like feel.\n\nBut let's look at this for the early access title this is. The development itself has been a mess of deadlines that were impossible to reach.\nThe way Dean Hall has been bossing around at Bohemia has had its toll on the development of the game as well due to constant rumours of DayZ switching studios and what-not.\nThe original release date for this game was naturally extremely poorly thought out. Those types of quick decisions has kind of become the trademark of Dean Hall. Usually it ends up with him having to explain them later and nothing ever coming of it.\nI hope the promise of vehicles coming in the next update is at least going to be true.\n\nOverall I'd say the reason DayZ is a poorly made game right now is because of the directions the developers have taken in development and the awful prioritizing and balancing of the various gameplay mechanics that the game currently has. One thing they need to get right is subtlety of the mechanics in the game to make it feel more realistic and immersive.\n\nThere you have it; my more serious review of DayZ in its current state.","October 12, 2014","false","15.0"," 700 of 846 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","700","846","0","7"

The survival mechanics; heat, hunger, thirst, blood level, fatigue are all there and in excellent shape. The PVP aspect of the game is unparred in any other game in terms of tension and suspense. No game has ever given me an adrenaline rush before, but this game still sometimes does it. In fact this game has been some of the most fun nights playing with my friends that I've ever experienced gaming. I honestly don't have any negatives other than the hacking situation.\n\nEven with that, I still love the game to the point of calling it my favorite game. There is not much that can be done with hackers, especially given that the game runs on the Arma engine which is probably the worst engine that they could have possibly used for this game since it is a modding engine making it very easy to manipulate and hack till your heart is content. And even the lack of control that the company seems to have over the hacking, that pales in comparison to the company itself. I offered to give them physical evidence of a wall hack or exploit or glitch, whatever it is. I post it in their forums asking if it's already a known issue and acknowledged by Bohemia and Battle Eye as a problem. That is all I asked and waited for a response. Their response was locking down my account on their forums.\n\nI've been playing this game for over a year, paid the money and put up with a lot of bull****. Because I expected bugs and glitches and hacks considering the mod was hacked beyond belief. But I also expected the company to actually care about, not only their game, but their consumer base as well. Rocket took the money and ran, and Bohemia and BE are just taking the money and adding new guns and shirts and breaking many other things in the process of adding new content, then producing a hotfix which in turn breaks other things like wells which after about a month got fixed. All of that, I put up with, because it is in alpha. But a company that will lock your account because you have proof of people hacking and and exploiting their game is a company not worthy of your money.\n\nThat is the one and only reason that I say do not buy this game. If your a person who just wants the game and doesn't care about what the company does with it, then by all means play this game. It is a great time, most times. But if your like me and want the game and the company to stand by their game and respects the community that provides them the funding for their game, then this game is not for you. In fact I suggest you boycott Bohemia Interactive, and Battle Eye, and just for the hell of it, boycott Rocket and whatever project he decided to start with the money he made from not finishing his game, who I put on the same level of scumbag as Phil Fish, and never support anything that these companies do. Let them destroy themselves and become insignificant. This genre of game is in its infancy and there are many other games already that are out, or that are currently in development for your to play. Just wait. This genre will get much better with other games and other companies.\n\n","December 17, 2014","false","508.4"," 722 of 874 people (83%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","83","722","874","17","19"

It has been exactly one year since I posted this review. So far, literally nothing has changed from the day that I wrote this review. It doesn't surprise me that all the fanboys in denial who went as far as spamming on my Steam profile have now come to a realization about this trashy game and shut their mouths.\n\nTL;DR - Don't buy this game. The mod will provide you with a better experience.\n\nDayZ is probably the biggest example of a cashgrab I've ever seen on Steam Early Access. As the game has now been in development since its release date back in December 2013, the developers have made tens of  millions of dollars off the 3 million copies sold (since January 2015). Many people have asked what happened to all this money: Only rumors remain... (I could go on a rant about how Dean Rocket stole all the money for himself and is now living in a cozy mansion but I digress). Please don't get the wrong idea. I really enjoy DayZ as a game. What infuriates me, however, is the fact that this game has so much potential but was all squandered with the lack of updates, fixes and news from the surprisingly large development team. In the time that I'm writing this review (April 2015), it has been just under two years since the game's release (excluding the many months of development beforehand as well as the Closed Alpha stages - dating all the way back to May 2013 and even earlier) and very little improvements have been made; thus, the game remains in Alpha despite the many deadlines in which the game would move into Beta and even release, only to be delayed every quarter of the year.\n\nMy personal experience with the game has been an ever-worsening nightmare. With some history playing the DayZ mod and the many variants of it (Epoch, Overpoch, the whole lot) on ArmA 2, I simply just had to purchase the game only a few months after release with the mindset that it would be a great game by the end of the year, especially with the videos being posted left and right showcasing the new features and potential that it would be superior to the mod in every single way. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThe main issue that was supposed to be fixed many months ago but has been pushed back was the  optimization  of the game. I cannot account for anyone else when I say that you require a NASA supercomputer to run this game. This is the main area where DayZ shows its potential: The game has gorgeous visuals on maximum graphic settings. The reality of this is that the majority of people that play the game have to run it on the lowest settings due to poor optimization and use of an outdated engine that fully renders the entire map all at once for some reason.\n\nThe game struggles even with the most basic functions such as moving, vaulting, equipping weapons and such. Often times, I would die because of how glitchy the ladders and staircases in the game are. Inventory management is a drag and does not add any realism or immersion. Also, it is important to mention that the game presents a very poor  atmosphere  : Apart from the few piles of debris (I'm talking about the infamous tossed-out laundry machine) and the building with the plane crash located at Cherno, all the major cities in the game look like they were built yesterday. The developers could have easily made vast improvements rather than just ripping the map off of the mod and just modifying the spawn points and adding a few cities. Other than the major cities, many of the small villages in the map are recycled and reused many times. It's easy to get lost in the map because of this. The use of an online map would deter this but, at the same time, remove what little immersion remains.\n\nOne large factor which was lacking in the standalone game but had a strong presence in the mod was  vehicles . At this time, there are only two vehicles in the game which are very similar: Both are military transport and they look visually similar, the only difference is the number of seats they provide. Due to the size of Chernaurus+, it would be less of a hassle to travel by vehicle rather than spending hours sprinting to a location. A bicycle at the very least could have been added.\n\nI had high hopes for this game after its release. Unfortunately, the game does not deliver what it promised. The developers know this but yet continue to release very small updates every now and then to give us players the illusion that changes are being made in the game. In all honesty, there is no hope for the game. With all major fixes being constantly delayed, it is doubtful that this game will exit Alpha. Please save your money and play the mod if you want a good experience. Thank you.","April 4, 2015","false","227.8"," 733 of 889 people (82%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","82","733","889","52","34"

I play it a lot.\nI just can't recommend it. Written during Alpha 0.44.123800:\n\nDayZ is entirely a game of going to the North East / North West airfields, hopping from server to server hoping to find fresh loot, and then picking up and hunting / helping other players. That is saying that you aren't found and killed by hackers, desync and be killed by invisible zombies, have your leg broken by entering a door, or being shot by a long range sniper. This is not even to mention the zombies' astounding ability to phase through whatever physical barriers exist in the world. What you should get from this is that Battleye is indecent allowing hackers to operate, the servers are very well horrible and so is the game engine as of now.\n\nAfter you have gotten all of your new found loot, give yourself a pat on your back! You've completed half of the game, so far. Now you have the enjoyment of sprinting all the way back from where you came, which takes about 30-45 minutes on average. Due to there being no vehicles in the game so far, running takes up about 75% of your time. I'm not exaggerating.\n\nThen comes the real fun. Welcome to Berizino! A town of bandits, newbies, and hunters! Beware the herds of newspawns, they are an odd nomadic species of players; a herd will approuch you, attempt to knock you out, and if they succeed, will take your items, weapons and ammo, and proceed to murder all others present in the herd. Luckily, these are quite rare outside of major cities, and only occur on populated servers. Bandits, and hunters, with their hacker varients roam the cities as well, looking for others to murder: it is your duty to turn the tides and save those who are in need! The needy shall repay you handsomely, with a volley of bullets in the body, as players in DayZ are generally horrible shots. And so ends your life, and begins the cycle again.\n\nIn all, this game is a big loot grinder with a deathmatch / hunting game at the end. Friendly players you meet are lying about their intentions, and the only remotely good people you can find are in hardcore servers. DayZ currently has a small choice of weapons, food, ammo, etc.; and no selection of any other means of transportation other than your legs, which results in exeedingly long running times to move from one point to another. With infrequent updates, poor content within said updates, and a horrible player base, this game is not worth the 30 dollars. Wait for this game to come out in Beta, and in the mean time, please go purchase some other, more fulfilling games.\n\nTL;DR Wait for the game to be more developed, it's not worth it right now.","May 24, 2014","false","189.2"," 736 of 905 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","736","905","0","34"

I have to say that the best feature of the game is the suicide option, because after seeing the terrible frame issue and all of the broken features that never get fixed, it is all I wanted to do. I don't even think that 9th company roots of terror is as broken as this game, and that game is pretty terrible. If you enjoy all of the buggy crap that would happen in Arma 2, and the stupid stuff that happens in Arma 3, then you will love Dayz. Another nice feature is the slideshow presentation that you get to see when you run through any large city even if you have a good computer, it is truly a nice color slide, just like in the old days. Also, if you are into possessed demon Jackie Chan zombies that glitch through walls, run through doors, and can somehow stop a bus with one punch, then this is definitely the game for you. In finishing, I don't think that you can possibly find a more terrible dev team. I mean come on, it has been almost two years and the game feels even more broken then when it first came out. The game is almost never updated, and when it is, they just add more useless crap to it instead of fixing all of the bugs. These devs get a load of funding from bohemia and from idiots like you and me who make the mistake of buying this waste of time, and then they don't use any of it to make the game better.

The experience back then was somewhat endurable but still painful and i convinced myself that it will only get better in the future... how wrong and naive i was.\n\nIn the year 2012 when DayZ mod came out, while it was clunky and very bad in many ways,  it managed to be fresh and very memorable, so all its flaws could be easily forgiven, after all - it was a MOD created by a single man.\nDayZ standalone on the other hand is the complete opposite of the mod.  Developed and produced by a bigger company with more people and resources than the original mod.\n\nI literally saw 0 progress after 1½ years of "development", unless you count pink Deringers, hockey sticks and bunch of other useless crap as progress. Instead of going forward like you would expect from an early access game, it has been in the same buggy and broken state all this time, perhaps you could even say that the game has gone backwards.\nI could add your typical pros/cons- list but why bother? There are so many bad things about this game that the non-existing pros could not tip the scale.\n\nOverall i feel very disappointed because DayZ seriously had alot of potential but i just cant see it to be possible for DayZ to be complete and functioning. I have no doubts that the developers just took the early access money and ran for the hills, abandoning the game.\n\nI paid full price for the game when it came out and honestly, i dont really regret that.

If your a fresh spawn, and you start bleeding, your first instinct should be to take off your shirt, and begin ripping it up into tiney bits\n4. DON'T. TRUST. ANYONE. (Except for most youtubers that you'll never meet)\n5. If you don't have a gun, pick up any ammo you see\n6. If you ignored rule 4, don't tell them you find ANYTHING. Especially not beans\n7. Always. ALWAYS. check the condition of items\n8. Stay away from large towns, (Cherno, Berizno, Elektro, ect.) unless on extreemly low pop servers\n9. Before leaving a large town, make sure you have food, water, and something sharp to open your food\n10. If possible, try to look unimportant (Some bandits may not have much ammo left)\n11. If it looks like it will break your leg IT WILL BREAK YOUR LEG\n12. If you find a Beret, wear it- It might just save your life\n13. If you find spare food you can't carry, eat it.\n14. If you fidn a gun with some ammo, make it imperitive to find a clip for it\n15. When you get shot, and your unconcious, guilt trip your captor\n16. Don't wear the Payday masks... Just dont...\n17. When your on a low pop server, constantally keep pressing P\n18. Just because you find something new, doesnt mean it's better\n19. Memorize which buildings do and do not have loot\n20. Above all.

I looked for fellow survivors, offering aid in any which way I could, I followed a creed, "saving people, hunting things, the family business." I came upon a fellow survivor, who started running circles around me. "STOP" I shouted, for they had something in their hands. What was it? A weapon? Handcuffs? I'll be damned if I let bandits take the food and medicine I was going to give to the needy. I raised my gun "STOP, OR I WILL SHOOT," I continued. "I'm here to help, I have food, water, anything you need, but if you try anything, I'll put one between your eyes." This stopped the person, and they kneeled to the ground, fear struck their voice as they said "Don't kill me!" only then had I realized he had a med kit in his hands all along, no threat. "I'm starving to death...please mister..." As I looked him in the eyes, I knew this was my time to shine as a hero. I pulled out my handcuffs and said "I'll fill your backpack with food, but I need you to trust me and let me handcuff you, for my safety." Instantly he shouted back "DUDE I DIDN'T SAY YOU COULD TAKE MY BLOOD!" He bolted, confused I chased him, saying I had handcuffs in my hand, not something to drain blood. He didn't believe it, and said "I'M NOT STUPID OKAY I KNOW THOSE AREN'T HANDCUFFS, YOU'RE TRYING TO STEAL MY BLOOD! HELP, SOMEONE HELP!" This was getting out of hand fast, I drew my gun again and yelled "ON THE GROUND NOW!" he once again fell to his knees, for fear of dying at my hand. As I stood over him, gun drawn, I realized how out of hand this has gotten, and so I was just going to drop the food and go. As he is on the ground, awaiting whatever fate had in store for him, I went to my inventory to get the food. Instantly behind me, a voice shouted "DROP YOUR WEAPON AND GET ON THE GROUND BANDIT!" Bandit? who was he...no...my gun was drawn, the guy on the ground shouted for help and it got through to someone. I was just going to give him some damn beans and leave. The "Hero" behind me focused his rifle at me, as if ready to shoot. I suddenly start taking damage, what's happening?! I turn around, the guy I was going to save is now punching me, trying to knock me out in hopes he will be saved. I am no bandit, this has gone wrong, I'll just leave and try again. I instantly darted across the town, obviously the rifleman was bluffing and had no bullets, or I'd be a dead man by now. After three minutes of running, I stop and turn around. They followed me?! The guy I was trying to save was now charging me, fists up, the rifleman now had a bat out, they were going to kill me. No, this isn't what I wanted...I wanted to help! They attacked, I had no choice. I pulled my assault rifle, and killed the very man I had sworn to save. The rifleman was now scared, he starts to run. He witnessed my murder...there can be no witnesses. I shoot his leg and he goes down, he slowly continues to crawl as I approach him. "....Why..." he asked, his tone filled with despair. "I just wanted to help...this wasn't supposed to happen! It's true what they say...you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a villian.." He stopped crawling, "I'm sorry, I didn't know..." I looked up at the sky, it was bright out, more people would be here soon. "It's okay my son...I'm the one who should be sorry, I'm responsible for two murders." Two?" he said, shocked, "Who is the sec- a clean shot through the head, and the rifleman was silent. I was a monster....no....not a monster, I am the Hero they deserve...but not the one they need right now. I hid the bodies, and ran on to the next town, on to the next survivor I would...save.","March 16, 2014","true","105.1"," 165 of 181 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","165","181","2","18"

I consistently participate in the community and help the content creators.\n\nAfter 700 hours of subjecting myself to Dayz standalone, however, I really cannot recommend this game to anyone again.\n\nI used to recommend to my friends that they try this and promise that there was fun to be had. I would be a liar to do that now.\n\nFor anyone who actually plays this game in the wild, "persistent loot" has been synonymous with "persistently NO LOOT" for a good six months now. We all tried it and consistently went back to the non persistent servers where the game actually functioned somewhat. The devs have apparently not noticed this even though I know for a fact that it has been mentioned to them repeatedly in various forms.\n\nNever once has this system functioned correctly and after 3 days every server other than low population ones will have nothing but books on the floor and pens and other useless junk. You will literally starve to death trying to run inland because of the inane choice that has been in this game since day 1 to make your character start on the coast just on the very edge of hunger.\n\nOnce the servers have been stripped in a couple days (and loot doesnt spawn as the devs claim) and you happen to find any food or a melee weapon capable of doing anything within 5km of the coast, you are the luckiest man in chernarus.\n\nThe obvious solution to this?\n\nApparently it was to force every single server to use this ridiculous mechanic that does not function and has never functioned and then exclaim "oh you wanted the game to be hard".\n\nI feel like I can speak for most of the community by saying:\n\nWe want a functional game that is difficult. Not a game who's lack of functionality makes it difficult to want to play.\n\n\nI understand this is an alpha, but that does not excuse the developers from repeatedly engaging in idiotic behavior like deciding such things are good for the game and outright lying to us about the functionality of their "features".\n\nThe last patch before the current terrible one was all about the new and improved animal AI.\nThe result: Apparently nobody actually tested the STABLE build before deploying and noticed that the animals just run in circles around bushes at top speed.\n\nThe patch before that highlighted the wonderful new prison island content that was so overflowing with loot that nobody ever had to leave the coast again to find military gear.\n\nEvery single supposed "highlight" of this years development path on this "pay to test" alpha has consisted of features that did not work at a core level and which broke the very few actual things to do that were in this game other than killing people with the worst handling guns in all of PC gaming and playing dressup on the coast road while punching each other or swinging brooms.\n\nHunting heli crashes? Half the time heli crashes didnt spawn (mostly on persistent servers) and now with 15 trucks per restart they're all picked in 10 minutes and you wont find anything if you do happen across one.\n\nHunting for people off the coast? There is nobody there unless you count the people accidentally spawning naked in Vybor due to a persistent bug that has been unfixed for more than a year and that I know has been reported. Everyone is over at Balota by the prison or respawning every 15 minutes in elektro to fight over the one guy's AK who brought it back to the coast to kill fresh spawns.\n\nLooking to make friends? Theres nothing else to do, and no loot laying around so everyone just kills you for your can of beans or to literally eat your flesh since people are the only source of food in the game that consistently respawns.\n\n\nI don't need "development cycles" explained to me. I went to college to program for a living.\nI don't need people blowing smoke up my ♥♥♥ telling me one day the game will work, when there has been scant evidence up until this point that any part of it works.\n\nI just want a dayz game that I can play, and I paid for one along with a good 3 million other people.\n\nWhat has that investment gotten us so far?\n\n\nEdit: It got me banned from the community forum for asking.

My overall advice - don't buy it, not even if it hits Beta! Why not? Because the game is hardly making any progress since months. The devs are working on it, but with the lack of update and their arrogant attitude about it, they really don't deserve any support right now.\n\nThe problem of Dayz is that what was a game development turned into the development for Bohemias next/future engine. Dayz is more or less just a proof of concept for the engine at this point. It has lots of features, including crafting, vehicles, zombies... but all of them are placeholders (which means they suck) and we are not being told by these devs how and when we can expect improvement. So, blame the team for ruining a great idea. I would have recommended this game for the longest time in the past, but without any real updates in more than 6 months, I cannot honestly recommend this game to anyone right now.\n\nFor about half  year we've been told the new renderer would arrive soon and change the game completely. I've seen it, it's going to happen - but after that they still have a good two years of work, in order to make this become a full game. My advice would be to buy it after release and hope that mods will cure it. Vanilla Bohemia games always suck in my opinion. Mods are what makes them great. And that exact modding community is severely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at Bohemia for bein unable to keep a single release date/announcement. Modding Tools were announced for February this year. And what have we heard about them? Exactly - nothing. So whatever you hear about DAyz releasing updates - add between 6 months to a year for it to become reality. So much fail here, it just hurts.","April 28","false","006.0"," 591 of 742 people (80%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","80","591","742","38","41"

With the current pricetag of this game 27.99€ or $34.99, that puts this games overall income of sales to over $104.9million. Of course the game has made more than this from Events, Ads, and being funded by bohemia. With the game making $5.1million on its release date, you would of course believe the hype over the game, but what about from the dev team? Dean Hall was the man behind the project at the start, with his leadership proving to be one of the the best since Satoru Iwata (R.I.P). Near the end of 2014 there was reports of Dean leaving, and we could see, as fans, that DayZ progression had slowed down and was soon to be named a 'to-be-dead game'. Dean steped down in December to launch his own studio. and as a DayZ EA user, I was very frustrated because this game, DayZ, had so much potential. After Dean Hall left, his right hand man, Brian Hicks took over the team. At first, I was unsure, then I saw the quick development pick up again. That was......... for about 2 months.\n\nToday, playing the game. I, and everyone else, is left with an even more broken game than before. I experience problems from day one, that were at .3, in which they're arising now in .5.. The game is not optimized at all, and is worse than anything I've every played. I've even gone to the extreme of overclocking everything possible in my computer, disabling usless windows default desktop programs, and changing things in the Config folder. I'm still, like MANY others, left with low performance. (I have a high end PC that cost over $2500).. My frustration with the game has further increased after false schedules from Brian Hicks, leaving things from Q1 2015 (like the New Render we were all promised), that are not even really talked about from the Devteam when 2015 is coming to an end in 4months. Not only are promising tweets not followed through from Hicks, but the DayZ community is left with mistreatment from Hicks and the Devteam. MANY reports over constructive critism rusulting to bans on DayZ forums, as well as, from personal experience, smart ♥♥♥ tweets. I recently tweeted to another DayZ EA user:  "I agree. I would rather see Dev team related tweets rather than him being in YT vids and at events." My intent in this tweet were not wanting Hicks to respond, but for him to see that MANY people are very unhappy with his 'Leadership' on DayZ. I was suprised with a tweet response FROM Hicks saying: "What I choose to do after work is none of your business". Well, all disrespect INTENDED, when you put forth your personal life on all social media, as well as take over leadership of a Best Selling (unfinish) Game, you will have thousands of people in your business. I have seen many tweets from Hicks towards other EA users that are half ♥♥♥♥♥, that are disrespectful, and also full of unfollowed promises. I just now over the past month have seen Hicks using "hopefully" and "maybe" rather than his go to statement of "This is a Early Access Game". Although I'm happy he has eliminated the EA statement from his vocabulary, I'm still upset on how he treats everyone and the development of DayZ.\nMany friends, and even other steam users in the DayZ forums could agree that Hicks is not the right person to lead DayZ. He has been leading just near 8 months, and 6 of it prove that he is clueless to lead.\nI've been met with comments towards me that me not being a Lead Producer or mean not being apart of the development of a game, I shouldn't comment. False. I earned my right to comment how I feel about DayZ and people apart of it when I put in my $34.99..\n\nSo, Yes or no on buying this game?\nIt is really your choice, but from personally experience, I say you should wait when this game is COMPLETLY DONE and when Hicks learns to respect the communtiy that made him into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ he is today.","August 7, 2015","false","760.3"," 237 of 277 people (86%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","86","237","277","21","25"

Melee-fights are still clumsy, you can't predict where your AI opponent will strike due to laggy movement animations. No vehicle diversity. Character animations are nothig close to an AAA-game made by a large group of devs which made huge money on pre-oders. Regular patches only include new hats and nothing more significant. That is a fact. At the meantime dayz-mod was much better optimized/coded and had a great loot/vehicle diversity without useless rubbish like books. You can't see any game-mechanics polishing because there is no polishing at all. Price is increasing, game quality is not.

The game is exactly what I expected, there are new fun mechanics for drinking and eating, the Zed and Item spawning is differnt: Everything gets spawned in at server start ( Something all the haters who played 30 mins and quit to go post crap on the reviews would have know if they watched maybe a single dev video leading to this moment) so yes there will be buildings that have no loot and towns that seem devoid of zeds becuase they have been cleaved thru by the horde of players wanting to play. As far as all night servers, totally bunk: From what I see the servers are bound to the Realtime of there location i.e. a server hosted in IL in the states would be off CST so if you join said server at 9pm central time guess what? ITS FLIPPING DARK, shocker I know. Other servers I joined DID have daytime but a majority were hitting dusk meaning there local time was prolly hitting the early evening as well. Movement IMO is better looking, I did swim a bit too for S**ts and giggles and even that seemed a little faster than the mod and deffinetly nicer looking. Inventory system is a little wonky at first but very easy to get used to, the hot bar at the bottem is great for quick selecting important items and even remembers the last item that was placed (I hotkey'd a soda and after drinking it the outline stayed put and the next time I grabbed THAT kind of soda it was placed in that slot) seemingly random spawn in : alot of us seemed to spawn in at the coast which wasnt surprising, but a few people spawned inland as well including my buddy who spawned at Stary Sobor (Practically the middle of the map). Lastly the servers are linked via a hive, meaning that if you didnt like the connection you had or the population, or simply thought there wasnt enough loot spawning: Hop to another server and be at the exact point with the same gear as when you logged off on the other server.\n\nThats just a few of the things I experienced in one night on a few differnt servers, now for the bad: The KOS mentality is deffinetly a problem and seems to only make the task of Alpha testing that much harder, not that anything can be done about the rampant PvP or should be done but it pays to know that the process of helping the staff debug this game in Alpha stage only gets harder when someone fresh off the coast with nothing but the cool fancy axe he found and the gear he spawned in with see's you and buries said axe in your head while you try to talk with him or loot gear unknowingly, and of course is followed by "You mad bro" or my personal favorite "What a dumbass!" (Followed by his mom telling him not to cuss, LOL) that said, griefers abound so watch your six, alot of folks I ran into were genuinly nice and trying to just figure out the game and not ♥♥♥♥ rush the nearest breathing human with the kitchen knife they JUST looted (I fear for the survival of humanity in a real zombie apocolypse). A big one here and has been address'd already in testing is the fact that when you pass out from thirst or hunger or a good hit from a weapon you dont wake up, this is true to a point, IF your in a group or IF a friendly passerby see's you he/she can hit you with an EpiPen if they have one to wake you up but as to be expected that doesnt happen very often so basically you might as well press Esc and Respawn (Effectivly a built in suicide button, kills character and spawns you again) Infuriating to say the least but deffinetly on the top priority fix list. To finish the bad up I really dont like the lack of a Thirst/Hunger/Blood/Temp UI. The text warnings are OK, but spam too much and seem to give you very little in the way of knowing EXACTLY how bad off you are, something that only seems to compound the Unconcious-ness issue.\n\nAgain ill reiterate that this game is NOT a finished product, dont believe me? why not read this message thats right on the store page:\n\n“DayZ Early Access is your chance to experience DayZ as it evolves throughout its development process. Be aware that our Early Access offer is a representation of our core pillars, and the framework we have created around them. It is a work in progress and therefore contains a variety of bugs. WE STRONGLY ADVISE YOU NOT TO BUY AND PLAY THIS GAME AT THIS STAGE UNLESS YOU CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHAT EARLY ACCESS MEANS and are interested in participating in the ongoing development cycle.”\n\nCouldnt be more clearer, but at the same time this is also the lowest you will see this game priced for a VERY long time. If you love DayZ, want to be part of the process to make it better, can overlook the problems it has currently, and maybe JUST MAYBE take some stuff with a grain of salt like a mature adult than I hope to see you in Chernarus sir/ma'am.\n\nEDIT: Some changes to take into consideration:\n-Saline Bags can be used as a form of Epi-Pen for unconcious-ness\n-New Color coded Text in the TAB menu for Thirst/Hunger\n\nAlso Ive noticed a few things that you should be aware of, as of yet I have NOT been infected in game at all. Friends have told me the same and the ones that have been infected all say its from zeds. This may be due to them not fully fleshing out or introducing infection to the other regular sources so that being said get your fill of stagnant ponds and water pumps while you can. This also means Water purification tablets are unnessesary, if someone finds out otherwise let me know! Also Cooking has not been implemented yet so dont waste ammo on the bunnies as fun as it might be to murder the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (Bunnies as of yet dont have there own SFX so instead they make Zed noises, annoying and scary when you here a zed and theres not one around), this also means you can stop picking up Cooking pans and taking up Inventory space. There is also a few bugs that my buddies have let me in on that involve dup'ing Saline on unconcious players that are glitched out somehow, and server lag can sometimes result in Dup'ing items from one backpack to another (Seen this happen alot with ammo clips, specifically the FNX42 pistol) Also alot of people I know keep getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when they see there hatchet/Gun carried ♥♥♥♥-eye'd resulting in missed shots or swings. Ive made a bug report for it and my fix has been to either hit Spacebar to re-raise it to rdy position or de-equip it and re-equip it via the hotkey bar.\n\nI think I may need a discussion channel or something lol\nGood Hunting Survivor!\n\nEdit #2 - Just for "angrymonkey" the nub\n\nThis review is not all about melee "angrymonkey". But since you brought it up, yes melee currently is pretty lame, hit detection is off with zeds and players alike until you just get used to using the damn weapons as they are set at the moment. I have no problem dancing circles around zeds swinging my axe and killing them without taking DMG. What you fail to realize is at the moment zeds cant hit a moving target very well so staying mobile and swinging your axe/pipe/wrench etc... will yield results. Also I should note that only the 2 Axe weapons will outright kill a zed in 1-2 swings, players may take around 1-4 depending on your aim. Also, when has melee combat in DayZ been anything BUT difficult? taking into consideration as well that most PvP encounters with melee or otherwise results in spamming of the attack button (Almost every axe wielding maniac has just run up and swung madly, and every gun toting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ has unloaded an entire clip while running around), nobody seems to care about Accuracy but more about how much chaos they can create for there target, and how many shots/swings they can make before one lucky hit happens and call it "Skill".","December 17, 2013","true","40.0"," 451 of 560 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","451","560","0","18"

Steam community is asleep and they constantly be ♥♥♥♥♥ over until steam produces repercussions. You can put an EA warning on a game and fanboys will defend it until the game dies.

It first started development in 2012 and released in December 2013, meaning that this game will be 3 years old in December of this year and still in early access. The worst part is that the developers use the early access excuse of why the game is still broken.\n*Developers rarely listen to community. We give suggestions, we cry horrible optimization, horrible desync and game breaking bugs and they don't even acknowledge us.\n*The community is only getting worse. I remember back when dayz mod was really popular, when I met another survivor, we would actually communicate before shooting each other. Dayz Standalone on the other hand is like a complete ♥♥♥♥ fest when you run into another player or group, your kos to almost everyone, even if you say your friendly, your still dead.\n*The optimization in this game is one of the worst if not the worst I have ever played. I have a decent, not great but decent computer setup. I have a AMD fx 8350 with a Nvidia gtx 760 graphics card. I get great fps in arma 2 and arma 3, but in this game I get around 30-35 fps out of town and in town I get like 20 fps on 30 player servers.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nOverall this game has really good potential but because of the terrible optimization and lazy developers, I don't recommend buying this game.","October 10, 2015","false","34.9"," 212 of 248 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","212","248","6","20"

I could go on and on about how the devs are doing nothing and how they took our money and ran but I won't. The facts are this:\n\n1) There has been no significant advance in this game since play has begun. They claim they have this great new engine and all you have to do is "hold on and wait", the fact is the game runs like crap.\n\n2) Map is way to big for number of people. I have played on full servers and haven't seen anyone, for hours. The map really is nice but its way to big. I understand they are making server to hold more people also, but like everything else on this game it has yet to be seen.\n\n3) 2 years and nothing. Yes 2 years and still a shoddy running alpha.\n\n4) The community SUCKS! DO NOT got into the steam forums and complain or even critisize the game. DO NOT ask a question as to when it will be finished. DO NOT comment on anything except the fact that DayZ is the greatest game ever or you will be banned by one of the fanboy moderators. I have seen more people banned, threads closed and people berated in these forums then in any other forum. It is pathetic. If you have a question be prepared to be screamed at that the game is in Alpha and if you don't like it come back later when its finished, problem is no one can tell you when that time is.\n\n5) Gameplay is sad to say the least. Things just don't work and it really seems as nothing is being done.\n\nSave your money, there are far better games then this piece of crap.","December 16, 2015","false","494.3"," 400 of 503 people (80%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","80","400","503","46","66"

The ARMA II mod was infinitely more complete than this game will ever be.  There's not even zombies in it anymore, because the development team literally could not be bothered to design a passable AI for zombies, yet they continue to sell the game as "DayZ" despite the "Z" element having been completely removed.  It's basically false advertising.\n\nThe best part about the DayZ mod was collecting guns, hunting for a car, then driving up north and mounting raids on their airfield and northern towns for better gear and resources.  That dream is dead as a doornail.  It's hard to find guns, much less ammo, you can find food but have to get a separate implement to open it, so you'll probably die of starvation moving from house to empty house looking for an implement.  And you'll never find a car.  So good luck walking up north to where all the fun stuff might still be.\n\nThe developers continue to add more roadblocks to make the survival element more realistic and difficult, but have failed to create systems or a world that is compelling to survive within in the first place, a world that's been completely stripped of anything that makes it more than the most boring, empty ARMA mod of all time.  The loot tables are completely at odds with even the character's most basic needs for survival.  A five year old could tell that about the game, and yet the developers do nothing about it.  The one new thing that's nice is the redesigned Chernarus map with more interiors, but with nothing meaningful inside them except 15 functionally-identical items of clothing, the gesture falls flat.  Plus the same old performance issues from the ARMA mod persist.\n\nDo not buy this game in 2015. It's dead and should be allowed to die. There's no point to PvP, there's nothing to survive except boredom.  Bohemia should be ashamed for continuing to sell this farce.  This is the single worst abuse of the Early Access label in Steam's history, the progress is glacial, Early Access is not an excuse for such an offensively glacial development schedule, the subtraction of content over time, and other mistakes.  Early Access is not a blanket excuse for these things.  It is a promise to your purchasers that you will do right by them, and the developers have not.","October 9, 2015","false","17.2"," 171 of 201 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","171","201","5","5"

This game has so much potential and can deliver a fantastic survivor gaming experience when it works, that I cannot deny.\n\nBUT please continue reading for there is much more to this game than meets the eye. The problem with this game lies primarily in the development and the team behind it.\n\nThe pace of development is frustrating beyond belief. They repeatedly set targets for features and systems and one way or another they will be late, in some cases YEARS late.\n\nAnother issue lies in their delivery of the game. Features that they've added like the Central Loot Economy (an integral part of DayZ) have been out for over a year now and still, patch after patch there is game breaking delays or problems with it. So even what they do add... like vehicles, rarely works like you would imagine it should. Granted they still have the excuse that this is alpha but you would expect major components like this to be to be working by now.  Excuses or delays which at one point were acceptable and even understandable are now just pathetic.\n\nThe final issue I'll share about the development team is their interaction with the community. All you need to do is drop by the subreddit and you will see anger and frustration on a daily basis like no where else and for good reason. After the delays and mismanagement this community has undergone you would think the devs would be working to pacify and correct the situation. Instead what you will find is an equally snarky excuse or vague comment in retort. The transparency of this project is seriously appalling at times.\n\nUnfortunately all of these problems show no sign of changing and so for that reason I'm obliged to say do NOT give these people your money until they get their ♥♥♥♥ together. Because you will undoubtedly get the sense that this is just a bunch of amateurs who are really just figuring it as they go and once they have your money they could care less what you think or want.\n\nEdit 1: In the next month or so a significant patch will move to stable and includes the new renderer which has been in the works for about 2 years now. It should be noted that this patch significantly boosts fps to a minimum of 30 in cities from the previous 15 or so in cities. This fixes likely the biggest drawback performance wise and should make the game more accessible. Unfortunately it will not change the development pace, delivery, or transparency so expect the problems on that front to continue. But it must be said this patch is perhaps the biggest leap forward in the last 2+ years performance wise.","May 5","false","126.7"," 273 of 340 people (80%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","80","273","340","19","21"

Where do I start with how terrible this game is? How about with the developers shall we?\n\nI have heard many a story about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the devs are of this game to people on the forums for their games and what not, but since I have never visited their forums, I digress. I can speak on some of the stupid ♥♥♥♥ that they have done though.\n\n1. At the time of me writing this they are having a sale on this game. How wonderful right? A full 15 percent off. Now I know what you are saying, why Dildor, there's nothing wrong with that, atleast its a discount right? Yeah, except its not. The devs marked up the game 5 dollars so they could say that it is 15 percent off when in reality its still the same price it's always been with a whopping 26 cents off. That's right folks.  A WHOLE 26 CENTS  How nice of them. They could have just not put it on sale, but no, they want to make it look like they are being kind to us peasants apparently.\n\n2. This game has been in Early Access for way too long now. According to steam it was released just under a year ago, but I dont believe that is accurate. Even if it is it's still a year. And I would atleast be a little more tolerant if the game was out of Alpha. But its not. Its still in the alpha stages. What the hell are you guys doing over there Bohemia? Are you bathing in everyone's money that they've sent you instead of putting it towards the game? That brings me to my next point.\n\nThe game is broken as ♥♥♥♥\nHow do I begin to describe this game and its many failings? Maybe a few examples.\n\n1. THE ♥♥♥♥ING ZOMBIES ARE BROKEN AS ♥♥♥♥. It took them right around a year to even get them to fix the zombies to where they dont go through every door and wall in the game. THEY FIXED IT THE MONTH BEFORE I WROTE THIS. And it's so great too, because the pathfinding is still broken.\n\n2. Broken legs everywhere. One time I was walking down from a construction site and broke my legs while walking down the stairs. I then decided that I would put my character out of his misery by throwing him off the roof. But no. I spent 30 minutes give or take trying to glitch my way back up the damned stairs because the game didnt want to let me do it. I finally got on the roof, and started crawling at roughly .0000001 mph towards the edge of the building. BUT NO. The devs decided that it would be fun to just randomly through invisible walls wherever they wanted to so I spent around 10 minutes trying to manuever my way around an invisible maze to get over to the edge of roof. I then nudged my character all the way to the edge of the roof where he was literally hanging by his feet and threw him to a glitchy death which amounted to him falling back and forth and gliding around like a piece of paper in between the roof and the ground until I got a screen saying "You are dead". Fun.\n\n3. I went up an atc tower and got too close to the railings. I flew roughly 50 feet like a majestic eagle to my death.\n\nKeep in mind that this is not me furious because this has all recently happened to me, or that this is all of the stupid stuff that is happened to me. I have had many other stupid things happen to me similar to this. I would go on to explain why the community sucks, but I feel like plently of other reviews have stated it before. To put it bluntly, the community for DayZ is quite possibly the worst I've seen next to League of Legends.\n\nYou would be surprised by how many excuses I have heard for the fact of this game being early access. I know that they state that the game is in development and will come with bugs and all that stuff. But that doesn't excuse the state that this game is in. They have had a good and long time to fix all of the things in this game that everyone is having problems with, but instead they choose to add more and more stuff to the game. This is simply not how that should work. You don't add new meaningless ♥♥♥♥ when your base game is so entirely broken. And I most certainly don't care if it is "because of the engine it is running on". Why would you put a game on an engine you know that it is not going to work on on purpose?\n\nWell I have a simple answer to that.\n\nMoney.\n\nDon't give it to them.\n\nEdit: Wow, gg Bohemia. I can no longer find my review anywhere on the dayz page when it used to be 6th down from the top. If my review was removed from the page, if that is possible, that is ♥♥♥♥ing despicable.

I started PC gaming when I saw a video about DayZ Standalone on youtube when it just released. Beleive it or not but this game is supposed to have BASE BUILDING IMPLENTED ALREADY. There 2015 goals that were put out to the public on November 26 2014 were to have the new render out by the first quarter of this year which is 2015. Base building was planned to be implented this month and we from the progress of this game right now are far from that. This game made like 24,000,000 bucks from sales but where dafuq did all the money go towards? There are still fanboys out there who will still back it up saying it was coded from the ground up THEY MADE 24MILLION DOLLARS THEY COULD HIRE THE WHOLE MICROSOFT STAFF TO WORK ON DAYZ BUT NOOOOOOO THEY WANT TO JUST ADD NEW GUNS AND HOPE THAT WILL BOOST THE FRAMES FOR THERE PLAYERS.

On realease it was... Okay. Nothing groundbreaking, still had the mod formula, which to be honest was quite dissapointing given all the hype behind it. ALL these cool things that were coming out of the devblogs made me super excited. Still waiting for those a year later. Yes, I can now get waterproof backpacks and I can plant tomatoe seeds, EVEN GO FISHING! That is, if you can survive the still broken walkers, and the horrible players who think DayZ is a Call of Duty game, not once have I been held up, or spoken to by anyone, just a bullet in the back followed by the familiar "You are dead" screen. DayZ is now just a large scale deathmatch. To charge $35 dollars for this is a crime, Dean already has announced he's leaving the team... Basically taken my money and ran with it.\n\nTerrible FPS in large cities, STILL. It's boring, there's base building to a certain extent. Actually, no.. I'm sorry, I don't call locking myself in a room base building. It's fun with friends after about an hour playing time, ontop of  the 2 hour quest to actually find eachother. Seriously, I am so, so disspapointed. I'm fully kitted at the moment, lots of food, a backpack, camo, AK47, few mags, and feel no need to play... I mean what am I going to do, run into a town, loot, move on?? THAT'S ALL YOU DO! If you want my advice, you can get The Forest for 15 dollars. Why? It's in the same stage as this (alpha), it's fun, IT WORKS, the AI is not buggy at all (not from my experiences), infact it's some of the best I've seen, I beg to you to go and spend your $35 moolars on other games, there's plenty out there that work better and offer more content. This game is digging it's own grave as we speak.\n\nAs for the visuals the game looks okay, it looks like Take on helicopters (Another title by Bohemia Interactive) as it was made in a recycled engine which had direct aspects from that engine, which doesn't make much sense to me. It would have made more sense to just use the Arma III engine, it's new, it looks good and it would allow some cool mechanics like the stance mechanics, something you could utilize in a game like DayZ. If you want the true DayZ experience, I would recommend buying ArmA II or III, and installing the DayZ mods, more specifically the Epoch and Breaking point mods, there's a fantastic base building system in it and the community is very good, good old classic DayZ Banditary, not like the standalone. No honour or fair game, just shoot on sight... Too bad Steam doesn't give refunds, I would give this back in a nano second.\n\n:: Even when the game is released it will be a huge flop, if H1Z1 is a success it's "You are dead" for DayZ.","December 2, 2014","false","117.2"," 465 of 611 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","465","611","0","14"

I was very excited for it when I purchased it but every update has been another disappointment. I do not like bashing games and I hate to admit when I've bought a  bad one. Short version, melee sucks, zombies suck, and the gameplay itself sucks. Long version the melee is completely useless, unbalanced, unsatisfying, and broken. The zombies are extremely annoying, have terrible pathfinding, their attack range is rediculous,  the noises they make are obnoxious rather than frightening, and they are all around usless. They bring nothing to the game so most of the game is spent killing other players, it doesnt deserved to be called a zombie game right now. The loot system, the server restart system, and the loot distrubution make the game unenjoyable because you can never build up, you just server hop looking for loot until you have enough to pick off people on high pop servers or until you die. I understand that its in alpha but they constantly add random crap to the game like glow sticks, flares, clothes, and new crappy towns that look exactly the same as all the other ones, but never fix the core issue. Meanwhile the developers are trying to make other things like releasing this game for xbox instead of actually completeing this broken half-made game.

Dean struck Gold and when he got his share, he jumped ship and let his crew die in the wreck.\n\nFirst off, It's been in developement for 2 years. No, not one. They were working on it before they released it. Then they released it, got top seller for 2 weeks, made ♥♥♥ loads of cash, and stopped caring. 2 years of development and the game is in a constant state of repair. They fix one thing and 10 other things break. And they still do not care about the excessive amounts of hackers that plague the servers. Why would they? They're filthy ♥♥♥♥ing rich.\n\nSecond, if it isn't the development ruining this game, it's the community. God, is the community awful. On the forums, the Moderators delete any negative comments about the game. The ones they don't delete, they shuffle into one thread to keep it from the public eye so they can still sell the game. So when people go the forums, all they see is discussions on how amazing it is. I've seen them remove comments, well constructed criticism on the game, and call it "slander". Haha, slander! And if it isn't the moderators making sure the game looks like gold, it's all of the 12 year olds or Ex-Military ♥♥♥ clowns asking for more guns. Want the core mechanics fixed first? You're an idiot, what you want is another rifle to spawn close to the coast and plenty of ammo. That way you can kill people as soon as you spawn! Just like every other FPS! Want player interaction? Want to really feel like a survivor? You're a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot.\n\nIn conclusion, I've gotten my money's worth out of the game. But it's still broke after a year and the only real change is it's no longer constantly night time, I guess. 2/10, Thanks Dean "Rocketwerkz" Hall. You filthy ♥♥♥♥ing kiwi.","February 14, 2015","false","62.9"," 576 of 775 people (74%) found this review helpful 111 people found this review funny","74","576","775","111","26"

Not only has this been an early access for years, it's as bad as when it first came out. It's inredibly glitchy and laggy. Finding loot is like trying to find a joint in church. Finding a gun is like finding Obama smoking crack. And say you do find a weapon and some decent loot, you get all excited you see a zombie in the distance and you're like "♥♥♥♥ I'm gonna test this weapon out". You fire your gun with the sights pointed directly to the head of the zombie. Miracously you miss, and the zombie is on you like Usain Bolt. And that's the game basically. Or you can just jump from the third step of a stairecase down to the floor and break your leg? Or you can eat "pristine" food and die instantly for some reason. Possibilities are endless.\nHad this game been free to play I'm sure everyone would understand. But considering how much cash the developpers have received, and how much the game hasn't improved, you're better off not wasting your money on this. Trust me, look at your money, hug your money, kiss it a couple times, and be happy it's still there and not in the hands of the developpers.\nWorst game ever, barring a miracle of course but who am I kidding, its been ♥♥♥♥ing years.","May 10, 2015","false","23.7"," 120 of 138 people (87%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","87","120","138","19","3"

Everything on lowest settings doesn't change my FPS compared to everything maxed out. Please change these false spec. requirements, as they couldn't be more wrong.\n\nThe idea of the game is awesome, but a couple of years down the line, and the same issues/bugs  STILL continue to ruin and interfere with the gameplay. I would list the pros and cons, but quite frankly in it's current state, there are only cons. So here are the most common bugs I have encountered while playing as of 31 July 2015:\n\n- Hotkeys to equip items almost never work.\n- Items in inventory can disappear.\n- Zombies STILL hit you from far away/through walls.\n- Hitbox on zombies is beyond terrible (melee mostly, but even sometimes for guns too)\n- If you have an item in your hands and you 'use' anything (ladder/drink/eat), the item you're holding often disappears.\n- When approaching other players, you may notice a glitchy animation of them constantly pulling a gun out... this means their gun is out, and for all you know they could be aiming at your head... great.\n- I thought this was fixed but it happened to me yesterday, stairs can randomly break your leg (firestation most commonly)\n- If you sprint and jump at objects you can clip through them to hide (most parked cars, bins, some walls)\n- Guns sometimes decide not to fire, even if it's 'pristine' (including the ammo and mags etc.) and you will need to re-log to fix it.\n- Hunger/Hydration often displays incorrectly, re-logging can also fix this (e.g it states you are hungry still after eating 3 bages of rice.. re-log and you are 'stuffed' and really thirsty).\n- My friend once fell unconcious from hunger, but on my screen he was still able to move around as if he was alive... re-logging just gave him a new spawn character. (So from what I can tell, he actually died but it said 'unconcious' instead)\n- Sometimes firing a full auto weapon just decides to empty the clip for you, even if you shot once.\n- The servers can be very laggy, good connection or not. Often places of other players aren't represented correctly.\n- The optimisation, which is my main concern is just, well... non-existent. (45-60fps in fields and as low as 10fps (20 average)  in Elektro/Cherno/Novo check my specs. to get a good understanding on how bad this is)\n- Sometimes after throwing items (chemlights/grenades/flashbangs) your character will be stuck on the spot for a couple of minutes, unable to even move or equip other items, making you a very easy target.\n- On some occasions I have dropped dead for no reason what-so-ever (with friends there reassuring me I wasn't shot/killed)\n- Animations are fairly buggy, and often you will see players holding nothing in their hands when actually they have an axe, gun out etc.\n\nNow to be honest the list continues to grow, with old and new bugs. They need to stop adding more and more items/cars etc. and sort out the frame rate. They could add every vehicle in the world, but I won't be able to enjoy/appreciate any of it at >20fps! It's ridiculously laggy and un-responsive at most times, which really is a shame as this really could have been something great. I have enjoyed moments testing/playing this game, but overall It's annoyed me more than it has been entertaining as it's outweighed with numerous game breaking bugs.\n\nMy excuse used to be, "..but it's early access.." Over 2 years worth of development and that is just a list of the more common bugs. It's not really acceptable and as I said at the start, the specifications listed are FALSE. Which I suppose I would class as false advertising.\n\nThis game can be fun with friends, but what game isn't? So, If you still purchase this game after readingall of  this review, then that explains a lot about the kind of people that I find in-game.","July 31, 2015","false","221.3"," 194 of 242 people (80%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","80","194","242","16","20"

If anything it got worse. It's barely gotten any new content. It got a few new cities, a bunch of new clothes / weapons, and a buggy vehicle or two.  Oh yeah, and extra glitches.\n\nBasically what you do in DayZ is you spawn, spend hours gathering gear, go shoot people, die, and do it over again. Another thing you'll do a lot is run. Running between cities takes forever, and is what you'll do during 90% of your game time. Absolutely nothing will happen while you're running, aside from the chance of finding another player, who unless they just spawned, will probably just shoot you on sight. No zombies either. You'll only find a zombie or two in the cities.\n\nWhat the developers of the standalone DayZ did, was take the mod, and make it worse. To make the game standalone, they pretty much had to completely redo the entire game, removing pretty much every feature, which were promised to come back plus more over time. Only, this never happened.\n\nThe only reason I don't regret buying the game was because at the start not everyone was ready to kill on sight, and I met some nice people I still talk to to this day. Nowadays it's just hackers being hackers, and other people just hiding with sniper rifles making sure you get to see the "You are dead" screen.\n\nIf you're looking for the zombie survival game a lot of people praise it to be, I very much suggest you look somewhere else.\nIf you're looking for a shooter, you'll have a lot more fun with an  actual  shooter.\nReally dying to play DayZ? Buy Arma II+Operation Arrowhead and play DayZ Epoch, which is pretty much a 100% better in every aspect.\n\nI can't recommend the game, unless bugs, lag, hackers, running for hours, no updates, and generally having an unfun time are your kind of thing.\n\n\nExpect lots of glitches.

The mod was created by Dean Hall in 2011. Then, in late 2013, this pile of ♥♥♥♥ made its way to Early Access and everyone jumped onto the band wagon. I'm going to attempt to keep this professional, even though this game is one of the worst I have unfortunately purchased.\n\nLet's be serious now, DayZ is an Open World, Zombie Survival MMO that is in Early Access. The game has many issues and the devs are taking it in the completely wrong direction anyone ever wanted it to be in. The fanbase is very small, and everyone in the gaming community uses DayZ a lot to describe a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Early Access Game.\n\nUI: 2/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nAnimations: 7.8/10\nFunctionality of the game: 3/10 (VERY BUGGY)\nOptimization: 1.6/10\nMultiplayer: 8/10 (It's not too rubberbandy)\nCrafting: 4/10 (Not very interesting or fun in any way.)\nGuns: 9/10 (Very well modelled.)\nVehicles: 5/10 (You're more likely to have a vending machine fall on you than finding a Vehicle in this game)\nUseless Items: 10/10\nContent Amount: 6.9/10   ;)\nZombies: 0/10 (Completely broken, you can hear them in your ears when they aren't even nearby)\n\nOverall Rating: 2/10\n\nNow, in all seriousness, the reason I gave it a 2/10 is because of one reason and one reason only. It is pretty obvious that the developers of this game (Bohemia Interactive) have GIVEN UP on it. Of course, they are kind of actively developing it, but are they really adding anything good, worth while, or not completely useless like a stick of glue? No. They want money. They are just a greedy company that wants $34.99 bucks for an unfinished, never going to be finished, Pile of complete and utterer ♥♥♥♥.\n\nHow many hours will you get out of this game no matter who you are?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Entar/recommended/221100/","Entar","Entaro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Entar/","157 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you haven't bought the game already, I would probably recommend sitting on the fence for a while to see what happens.  Whenever you hear somebody use the word "potential" with regards to a video game, red flags should be going off immediately.  Its true DayZ has a lot of potential.  Its had a lot of potential since it first came out as a mod 2 years ago.  The problem (as I see it) is that nothing much has changed.  And that is a long time for nothing to change...\n\nThe argument goes, that they spent the last 18 months redeveloping the arma engine to be specific to DayZ, and that these mechanical improvements will allow the standalone to flourish in ways which wouldn't have been possible as an arma 2 mod.  But if you've played this game, and are being honest with yourself, then this product feels like 1 step forward, 2 steps back.\n\nTo their credit, they tell you flat-out on their store page not to buy the game, but for those of us who are DayZ veterans, its like telling crackheads that crack will kill them... pretty damn futile.  18 months later... Personally I expected A LOT more.\n\nThere is no reason for this game to be publicly avaliable in the state that it is in except to cash in on Christmas.  This 6 man development team has already banked $1,200,000. Ho...Ho...Ho....\n\n"Its got potential" and I'm hoping for the best.  Do yourself a favor and don't spend $29.99 on potential.  If this game ever ends up becoming something real, spending $59.99 on success will feel a lot better.\n\nEdit:\n\nJeez, such anger from fans.. Try to keep the hate down.  also I havent played '10 hours of it', as Ive spent 500+ hours in the mod and its various submods over the years so I think Ive pretty much seen it all.  Not to mention, 10 hours in standalone is more than enough time to experience everything it has anyway.\n\nYes, I understand it is an alpha, but its been 18 months and it was an alpha then as well.  Dont fall into the trap that you are playing some new game that started from scratch, as very little of DayZ is from scratch.\n\nIm guessing most of these trashy comments are coming from fellow DayZ junkies and I understand the diehardness of the fans.  This review is moreso aimed at people who maybe skipped the mod or played very little of it, expecting standalone to be their 'entry' into the series.  Im here to say it isnt, not in its current state.\n\nI continue to hope for the best for DayZ SA, but given the speed of its development, especially compared alongside the development of DayZ submods over the same time period, it appears we'll be waiting for quite a while unless something drastically changes.\n\nI never said I hate the game, only that I have concerns about its future.  Im a huge fan of DayZ, just not a cultish one.  I still stand by my argument that there is absolutely no reason for this game to be publicly avaliable right now except for $$$.  However, given that they have releaed it I sincerely hope that they continue to develop it to its maximum potential, but I just dont have that unshakable faith anymore that many of you still do.  Because now that they have our money, its ALL faith at this point.\n\nIm just here to say to anyone undecided or completely new to the franchise: wait for this flower to blossom.  Dont sully your virgin experience to the great world of DayZ with this alpha offering.\n\nEDIT2:\n\n@CptTripps Yes, the "mechanics" are what have me fearing for the worst with DayZ SA.  They are still fundamentally on the Arma2 engine (a variant) and those of us with 100's of hours know how it works and plays, and some things will (IMO) just never "get better", such as melee, AI pathing, performance/rendering, etc...  They are still constrained by all of the limitations present in the mod, as far as I can tell, mechanically speaking.\n\nI was kind of blindsided by this alpha because of this very reason.  I was expecting 1 of 2 things, not 0 of 2.\n\n1: A game lacking content but with major mechanical improvements over the mod to build upon.\n\nor\n\n2: The same mechanics as the mod with a major expansion of content/things to do.\n\nI don't mean to belittle the work they've done, but I honestly just do not see the culmination of their work these past months.  While content creators have been busy expanding sub-mods and pumping DayZ full of ideas, they've seemingly done very little to capitalize on any of it.\n\nAnd its been said before, but Chenarus again?  Its a good map but not the best nor ideal for DayZ.  As a stepping stone map to use while a unique one was being developed I could understand, but they've appeared to have doubled down on using it.  Namalsk, Lingor, Taviana, Celle, etc... are all maps made by modders, not companies.\n\nDayZ is backed by a respectable company and has made some mucho dinero (from Arma 2 sales as well as standalone), so if it is true that they are on a 6 man skeleton crew, I fear this game is going to be stuck in neutral.\n\nEither way they got my money so I am waiting and hoping for the best.  I reiterate my point to those on the fence:  Save your money until a (much) later date.\n\nEDIT3:\n\n@arthurbritanico  "why not buy it now for only $30" That logic assumes the game is going somewhere, which it still *might*, don't get me wrong but I'm not totally convinced at least as far as any kind of timeline in concrend - its going to be -awhile- before DayZ SA is a worthy $60 launch title.\n\nAnd my logic there is that, -IF- (because I am not 100% convinced it will reach this status) that day comes that this game is fully fledged and worth the whole investment... it will be worth the money.  Currently, its not worth $30.  I would much sooner recommend to someone to purchase Arma 2 and play the mod.\n\n@Mojo Rising  I guess you didn't read the whole thing before you started foaming at the mouth, no worries. "no more ♥♥♥♥ bugs and ♥♥♥♥ zombies", you've got your blinders on pretty thick there mate.\n\nAlso if you've ever played "Take on Helicopters" and "Arma 3" you would know that many of the new featured in the standalone are just borrowed from those titles, including the engine (TKOH).  The DayZ Dev team is basically running a chop shop and doing very little original content as it pertains to unique game mechanics.\n\nAll my mates and I are bigtime DayZ players, all 500+++ hours, run our own servers, yadda, yadda, yadda... time played in SA: (hours)\n\n10.5\n60.8\n35.3\n13.3\n2.9\n7.9\n10.3\n7.2\n3.4\n2.4\n1.6\n0.3\n\nThere are DayZ Mod sub-mods made FOR FREE with 10x the content and 10x the innovation and 10x the improvements...... Rocket & Co. need to start busting ♥♥♥ on this project, which they still haven't done 1 month later.\n\nEDIT4:\n\n@thatguyinthecorner I don't know if the book/movie comparison is the best analogy to use.  More like Book:Book or Movie:Movie in the case of Mod vs. SA.  In many ways, SA is very feature poor compared to the mod (+ submods) even to this date.\n\nIf you've never played the mod, and enjoy the underlying premise of DayZ so that this is all fresh to you, I completely understand your 100-200+ hours invested into SA.  But I would just reiterate a point that the SA is not particularly new in many regards.  It has slight mechanical polish, some new features (also missing old features), but it is still very much the same game, on the same map (a few new buildings here and there, modders have been doing this for years).\n\nSo I don't really see it so much as a book>movie thing, more like a remake.\n\nBut all of that aside, I've gotta say that I am still very much concerned about the development future of this game and have my doubts about it.  Its still a very feature-poor game compared to the mods, the AI is a mess, etc...","December 18, 2013","false","10.5"," 4,186 of 5,874 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","186","5","0","209"

Yet he decided to go ahead and use the engine anyway. Who knows why.\n\nSo what exactly is wrong with the engine? Well, for one thing, occulsion culling is completely broken and can never be fixed. Essentially, everything in the world (in the direction you are facing) fully renders. That means something several miles away, behind several walls and structures, is fully rendering. Why? Because the individuals who made the RV engine are utterly clueless. The engine also doesn't fully support SLI or multicore processors and never will.  So you can have 3 GTX 780 Ti's and an overclocked Intel i7-4930K and guess what? You'll still have under 30 frames per second in medium to high density areas. It's nearly 2014, and this is just plain unacceptable. You also have to deal with the absolutely horrible controls and the terrible melee (the engine does not support melee at all, so melee will never work as it should).\n\nI'm sure a bevy of insufferable fanboys will respond with the same old "it's alpha" excuse, but sorry, this game has been in alpha for over 18 months, and the mod has been in alpha for far longer than that. If absolutely zero optimization issues have been fixed over the span of 18 months, then I think it's safe to say that the whole "it's alpha" excuse is totally moot. The game will never be fully optimized because of its terrible engine.\n\nThere's obviously a market for a zombie-themed survival MMO, as evident by the massive sales DayZ is making. Unfortunately, most of us duped into spending 30 dollars for this game will sooner or later realize that even though "it's alpha" the current state of the game is probably not too far away from the final retail version of the game. If Rocket had a clue or two, he would have sold his intellectual property to a developer that actually knows what they are doing.","December 29, 2013","false","9.6"," 1,610 of 2,253 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","610","2","0","63"

The looting system in my opinion and the majority of the people's opinion think it's ruined.  Loot no longer spawns in Firestations, Prisons, Airfields, or Military Bases;  The food is scarce, too scarce.  If you're in a firefight, you're more likely to die from starvation before the other guy gets the chance to kill you.  This update has also ruined player interaction, people are forced to shoot on sight to eat other players for food, since it is so scarce.  Some people will say "You suck at DayZ, go play something easier for you like COD."  Well guess what, more people play COD because it's easier than DayZ.  Easier is more fun and attracts more people to this game.  I'm not saying spawn M4s and AKMs in every house you enter.  Everything was good until this update, the two things in this update that has ruined it is : New "Looting" System, and the New Zombie AI.  It's good that they're now a threat, but at least make it reasonable to fight them.  They are hitting me 3 times before they're even done with one hitting animation, it's ridiculous.

With the project slowly able to reap the rewards of hard work put in by the engine and gameplay programmers over the months prior. I for one cannot wait to begin to roll these changes out to stable branch."\n\nSo doing basic math 3 million units sold since its release comes to the rough total of $105,000,000.  Now just how big is that number? Well let's  see,  according to Jay Hancock's blog the following quote will size it up for you.\n\n"Let's make counting a full-time job of eight hours a day, five days a week, 50 weeks a year. Counting to a million would take about 18 weeks, or from January to the first week in May. To reach 10 million would require four years of counting. If you started young and retired after 48 years of counting, you'd be at 100 million."\n\nSO exactly why is it that BI and The DayZ dev team cant even give us a single reason why we haven't even seen a decent attempt at fixing the basic problems in the game instead of just dumping a load of added content on top of an already suffering game? My review of this and all other BI/Dean Hall releases still stands as follows\n\nBefore the Fanboy's and keyboard wielding Nerd Ninja's come on the attack, I would like to say this, After an initially very positive review nearly a year ago I am having to reassess my opinion of this game. I understand that this is an "Early Access" which should be in its "latter stages of development" so please put your Bruce Banner face back on. I don’t want my money back and I don’t want them pulled off Steam. I want them to listen to their customers, fix what they have to this point and then continue. I played the mod for a long time and was one of the folks that hoped the Standalone would come. I prayed that Dean Hall and Bohemia Interactive would see this game for what it could be, the biggest open world true zombie survival experience and not just a cash cow. I stopped playing this game only recently because the developers refuse to fix the very basic fundamentals of the game. Melee combat, pathing issues, falling through floors, desync, and the list goes on. In its infancy this title garnered the developers, from best estimates, nearly 6 million dollars in the first few days. Now nearly a year later and the basic game fundamentals are still broken. The latest iteration of content and bug fixes only serves as proof to me that there is no intent to fix the game but merely pack it full of content and then port it to the consoles as quick as they can for even more money. BI's latest "DLC" releases for ARMA3 are even further proof to me that they are pushing profit over product. It is my suggestion that you DO NOT buy this or any other Dean Hall or Bohemia Interactive title until their intentions are clear. Fix it or flog it to console, make up your mind.","November 7, 2014","false","291.2"," 291 of 384 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","291","384","0","5"

I was open to making friends through the game. I have done so but 99% of my encounters I die and the sad thing is I could have killed 75% of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who killed me but I backed off and then you killed me. I guess the fact I did not shoot you and said hello when I was behind you must have made you think I was a bandit. I particularly love this last death where I am a foot away with my axe and I back away and you let me get out one word before you execute me. There is hardly any conversation in this game. I as well as everyone here I am guessing spend  99% of the game running to your friends or running to one city or another or being killed as mentioned earlier and starting the process all over. I notice zombies agro seems to be a longer distance now. They still hit me through walls. Hell they even hit me when I am 2 stories up from the bottom floor. There is a glitch where if you set an item down it goes into your inventory which is handy but it's a bug lol and it can cause you to lose your weapon if you’re not careful. You have trucks but they are not persistent, you have tents but they too are not persistent, you wait to make a vault at the end of what seems to be an endless process full of bugs, hackers, and 0 persistence with character wipes. You have hackers selling hack scripts to players on sites charging them 10 -20 bucks a month to have hacks so you don’t even have to be a hacker to cheat on this game. Auto aim, teleporting, invisibility, seeing through walls, speed boost, unlimited ammo, seeing freaking txt of what’s in every building without even bothering to enter them, a map showing where the players are in your area. I had one of these people shoot me a few nights back he was so stupid he did not even realize he had the see through walls hacks he said I was floating all over the place and made some comment after I died. Oh yes and like so many have said never mind if you can avoid hackers there are the players who shoot right away they don’t even bother to talk even if you don’t even want to kill them you have to THEY MAKE YOU! Because after trying to talk to people 45 times and being killed without a word you start to realize man what's the point of it all so you follow suit so you have dumb idiots forcing even friendly players to kill on site because you make the game this way by NEVER EVER COMMUNICATING yet still I try to talk to players when I am geared out and could ruin them at the drop of a hat with the same outcome 99% of the time. I would have worked hard to get you gear just like mine had you just spoken to me and you would have gained a loyal friend and ally.  And if that bs does not kill you there is always instant death going up stairs. I did that 3 nights ago on a server with just me on the sever… and thanks so much for adding cannibalism to a game that’s already filled with people killing me for no reason now you give them even more incentive to kill first and there is no insensitive to talk to people in the game… you don’t fix stair death, you don’t fix ladder death, you don’t deal with these hacker sites making money off your buggy game. I love dayz and I have tolerated the bs far less time than most of the other players who have complained I bet but something has to give don’t give me Christmas tress give me results show me you can fix this game, make me believe you give a crap by fixing the problems instead of adding content FIX THE BUGS IN THE GAME enough stupid add-ons fix your freaking bugs!

I love this game I do. the premise is great the tension and adrenaline is great. Those two this really only come once every other hour or so.\n\nThis game is broken. The updates over the years have not addressed any major issues.\n\nNear a city be prepared to have your FPS drop by 50-80 randomly all over. the melee comabt is meh. the zombies still aggro you from 300 meters away knocking out the ability to sneak in/out of locations.\n\nI understand that it is an alpha. That excuse only goes so far. It's been year and millions of dollars. We've gotten one vehicle 15 melee weapons no one uses and 15 guns that are meh. I'd be happy with the mosin/m4 only no cars 3 melee weapon version from back in the day if they just made the game stable.\n\nI would love to reccomend but I just can't. i'm sorry. I'll come back once a month to check up on it but honestly. I'm out.\n\nupdate: 4/18 - I come back every other week or so an try it out again to see if it got better. IT GOT WORSE. The zombies now are like bruce lee on crack. They never miss and one swing animation yields three hits on you.\n\nThe loot system is a joke. I find food here and there but I haven't found a single water bottle in 3 cities, oh and did I mention you can't drink out of wells anymore... yeah. Found a crossbow, can't find a bolt. Found a CZ75 mag, havent found a gun in i dunno how long but I've given up.\n\nSo Hooray I can farm now, too bad the rest of the game got thrown under the bus. When it realeased it was 7/10 and enjoyable. a year later it dropped to 5/10 and now it's literally a 3/10. Wouldn't play at all.\n\n7/12/15 - They changed the loot spawns again. So now repeaters, mosins, axes, and water bottles, and food spawn all over the place again. woot. So pvp is on a high again and the game plays like it used too. Zombies are still stupid fast and the fps still lags in cities. A GTX 980 still chugs through elektro at maybe 20-30fps. There is tons or texture pop and long distance rendering is still glitchy as all hell.\n\n11/28/2015 - In 8 days It will be the 2 year mark of Dayz becoming available. The game still runs like garbage. Less than 10% of the items on the development map have made into the game. I'm calling it. it's DOA. Uninstalling and walking away, and NEVER returning. Ever.\n\n5/19/2016 - Checked out the reviews for fun to see if MAYBE... just maybe they had improved. Had to scroll through over a hundred just to find one postive review. Then almost another hundred just to find the next one. Wonder where the $50 million we gave these guys went. It's bad when even the creator of the game bails.","March 29, 2015","false","90.7"," 210 of 270 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","210","270","9","0"

Each session I've played I often ended up dead after either 5 minutes or an hour due to bandits (once I literally only lasted about 20 seconds). As someone who hasn't had any prior experience with this game other than a few occasional videos I got easily fed up and frustrated, I never figured the game would be something like this. It seemed like everyone in this world acts like an as-shole. Despite waving or surrendering, players would often seem to get enjoyment out of killing players that weren't even a threat to them, simply because. I figured the only way to enjoy myself would be to become like one of them, a bandit. I despised this idea, I told myself over and over after each death that I would never become like one of them, but the more I kept dying due to bandits the more enticing the idea became.\n\nIt was this day that I finally decided to go through with it, I told myself, I don't care how friendly anyone I run into is, they're going down no matter what. I figured this would be the only way to actually enjoy the game. I started in black mountain, and made my way to Krasnostav, luckily for me, not many people travel this high on the map, so there was a lot of loot, I found enough equipment to survive and defend myself.\n\nI really couldn't wait to get my hands on the poor basterd who happened to cross paths with me, after looting the airstrip and Olsha along the way I reached Svetlojarsk, as I reached the place it became night time, it was really hard to see and using a flashlight would be suicide, despite being well equiped I felt pretty vulnerable, anyone could try to take me down and succeed even if they didn't had any firearms. Little did I know, someone was actually following me for a few blocks.\n\nI start looting a few places here and there until I come across this small storage unit next to the church, after seeing there's nothing interesting inside I quickly turn behind only to see a man crouching just a few feet away from me directly looking at me. He was obviously trying to find an opportunity to take me down, I had my weapon drawn already so I aimed at him, he quickly froze in place. I thought, ''this is what I've been waiting for... right? All the times I've gotten killed, now's my chance. Just fu<king pull the trigger''  and then... he surrendered. He put his hands behind his head, he didn't try to run away like anyone would do or even helplessly try to fight back with his bare fists, he just simply surrendered, he had no weapons nor a backpack, only a vest and a hat. I aimed at him for a few more seconds as he stood still and it was then that I remembered all the times I did the same thing he was doing in this instant. Putting all my trust into those bandits that caught me, hoping one of them would be kind enough to just let me live after surrendering, hoping that one, just ONE of them would not be an as-shole like everyone else.\n\nAfter a few more seconds pass... I wave at him, I drop a few soda drinks along with a can opener and some canned food. He stands up, grabs everything I dropped for him, starts drinking the sodas and just as he finishes, he gives me a thumbs up.\n\nWorth it.","May 18, 2014","true","24.4"," 75 of 78 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","75","78","0","8"

If so, you should read this.Looking for a survival game to play with your mates, ready to do tactics, teamspeak, share, pvp just like the trailer suggests?\nLet me tell you whats going on these days: today playing DayZ standalone looks like a cheating battle apart of the amount of bugs. And now you say: "lol he's just complaining because he got killed...", let me explain, I only play DayZ with friends, we look for some loot at empty servers then we go to a server with more people to fight against, thats the main idea, survive. "You can report a cheater/hacker", there is NO system to report a player, you need at least 1 name, there is no way to get a players name as a normal player.\nBattleye? Battleye is a joke, doesn't work at all. There is servers that actually ALLOW the cheaters? There is also servers where if you try to report a hacker to a admin by adding at steam you get BANNED from all the servers. I mean what kind of game is that?\nIt's frustrating try to play for hours and keep alive for days and then you get killed from nowhere, you can't do anything, you just see your people dying from bullets through the walls or even from someone flying. It is rediculous.\nRecently they said there will be VAC envolved on the future, forget it, if valve will be based at battleye nothing will change.  It's not hard to give you a example: Today I was with 2 friends in a PVP server, and guess what we were in a military building looking for people to kill, and... just follow this video and watch for yourself to realise how stupid this game is: http://youtu.be/NaeQ9Wep0zs but also happens a lot a player going through the wall and hits you with a axe in the head and you die.\nIt happens like everytime we try to pvp in a "large amount of people" servers. I could get the cheats and hack like others but what's the point of it, is it even "having fun"?\nAnother note to the DayZ reviews, there is 90k positive and 20k negative, if you analyze, most of the positive reviews are before end of 2013 early 2014, because everyone was expecting "fixs", from there to now the positive its only "good survival game" (meanwhile has less than 2 hours of gameplay...) . I also recommend read the negative reviews as there is the real truth.\nTake a look at my DayZ screenshots and there is some real fun yea but\nseriously, this game isn't what it seems to be, my friends after buying this, ALL OF THEM, considered it a "waste of money". That's all.\nThanks for reading\nJorge.","January 27, 2015","false","84.5"," 592 of 815 people (73%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","73","592","815","44","28"

You will run, and run, and run for hours, just to be sniped by angry 6th grader with more time than you. Meaninful player interactions are not in this game. They simply do not exist.\n\nUntil this game hits a stable state, where it is actually something not filled with game breaking bugs and glitches, You  should not touch it.

The simple fact is, nothing has changed. The game has implimented a few new clothing choices, weapons and re-modeled cities that should have been in there since day one. The game was rushed into Early Access way too fast. And while I realize that it is in fact, an Early Access game, there is no excuse for not adding anything meaningful to the game after 2 years.\n\nAnd I would even say that there are more bugs in this game than there originally were two years ago.\n\nAnd if you're a person that can handle bugs and glitchs and can take all that in stride, the community is the next problem. I have recently finished watching all of FrankieIn1080p's videos on his DayZ story, and the mod is so much further along than this game is, and the community are 4x better as well. Everyone in the stand-alone WILL shoot you on site. At least in the original mod you had a 30% chance they would not. And trust me, that 30% seems a whole lot better than spending 10+ hours getting gear all over such a huge map (which still does not have vehicles, but the mod does) only to be sniped from somewhere you can't even see.\n\nThe big thing that annoy's me about this game, is that the 4 year old mod, is still so much further along than this game. Like I said, I can respect that an Early-Access game has its fair share of bugs and glitchs, but when the original mod still has more stuff and is more stable than this game, there is definitly something wrong.\nThat, and the lead dev is leaving to make some other game when he has not even finished this Alpha.\n\nIt's your call if you want to buy it, but I really did try to like this game and it wasn't for me... or anyone else I know. The concept is there, it just could have been executed better.\n4/10","November 16, 2014","false","105.4"," 247 of 324 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","247","324","0","11"

I was looking for an experience with zombies unmatched! But I didn't find that either. What you will find are a ton of glitchy, slow, and dumb zombies that you can easily escape from. The real threat comes from the people. Usually hackers, liars, and server hoppers. People claim that this game has the best PvP system ever, but if you engage someone they will more than likely log out and move to a different server. Not only that but you will be crawling for hours around a bland map looking for items you will use up and then need again or be shot. The realism is hardly there. The most realistic part is that you need to drink, eat, and die when shot. The time it takes to eat and drink is out of proportion and you can die from a 5 foot fall. Anyone claiming this game is realistic are just fooling themselves. It amazes me that people can even call this a zombie game. This game is nothing but a glitchy, hacker infested, survival game that keeps you playing for hours on end to find something that you will be searching for all over again in an hour tops. TL;DR: Are you looking for a game with bad AI, hackers EVERYWHERE, hours of mindless crawling, glitch galore, and hardly any realism!?

I picked up DayZ late february this year and I was really excited to play it. I played my first session with one of my friends, where we ran for 2 hours before we was rudely interrupted by a gunshot followed by a "You are dead" screen.\nI then tried the game solo, and tried approaching a group of three with my hands up. I got shot. This repeated for almost 10 times before I said to myself -"This game is ♥♥♥♥ing trash"\nI left the game for about a month but was drawn in by the fact that I didn't want to live with the fact that I had wasted $30. I met two people who actually did not kill me and I still talk to them every day to this day. They have become my best friends and I suppose I can thank DayZ for this. We tried for so long to be a couple of friendly guys and gave away food, weapons and misc- supplies. We saw a repeating pattern where we got shot every time we tried to approach someone. The only time I have not been shot when I walked up to someone was when I came behind them with my gun raised. But this time I did not get shot, I got one-hit by a zombie which hit me from outside the building.\n\n2.Let me tell you about this one time I had played over 40 hours on a character. I had the best gun, I had great clothing and a couple of friends to play with. It was a casual day, raining as usual. I was strolling along the North-West airstrip. Once I stopped in a couple of stairs to look at the window I was shocked to see a black screen pop up on my screen. I did not get shot, but simply just... died? I was so mad at the game at this point that I was ready to uninstall. I decided to give it another chance. I spent 5 hours travelling to the north, following city to city. When I approached a building, a guy popped out of the wall with a shotgun, blowing my brains to hell♥♥♥♥. When I respawned, I made my way back to where I died. I was taking position to scope out the guy that killed me and stepped on a rock. This killed me. This made me ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But I decided to give it another chance, one last chance. It was a calm tuesday evening and I was walking across the North-West airstrip. Once I walked into a green halfcircle building, I was getting shot at. With adrenaline in my blood I quickly ran out of the green wooden house to take cover in a metal warehouse. Once I had got into the METAL building and close all the doors, I was still killed. Apparently, since my friends were a couple of hundred metres away, I was shot by a 9mm pistol from over 100m away. This made me realize how stupid this game is. The game has been in "Early Access" for almost two years now. Bohemia have added a lot of new items and features but have completely ignored the core ♥♥♥♥ups that was in the game on realease (the rubberbanding, glitching into walls, death glitch etc..."\n\nI love ArmA 3 and I have huge respect for Bohemia Interactive. However, you ♥♥♥♥ed up big time on this one Bohemia. The game is just not fun. I'm not enjoying the game. No one I'm playing with is enjoying the game.\n\nDear Bohemia, if you intended to create a glitchy and outright broken deathmatch game, you have succeeded.\nDON'T MARKET THIS AS A REALISTIC SURVIVAL GAME.\n","November 3, 2015","false","029.8"," 96 of 110 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","96","110","10","2"

The game uses 20% of my CPU and 45% of my GPU, so the game is not using my hardware and is not optimized at all, loading in every texture that you can't even see.\n\nWait till H1Z1 is out, that is a free game and going by the fact that it is made bt SoE (sony) it should be optimized very well, like their FPS-MMO planetside 2, which I can play on a gtx 750 @ 1080p on low and still hit 60fps...\n\nI wanted to like this game, I really did, but I can't justify paying 20 quid for an unfinished game that will only come out of early access after HL3 is released.\n\nThe gameplay is good, if you can find someone that doesn't shoot you in the face, you can have alot of fun. With 2+ people PvP fights become amazingly fun, you have to watch enemy flanks and pin them down and send somebody up round to flank them, just to see their brains fly 10 meters because nobody saw that sniper, amazing.

Where do I begin?\n\nThe game was made originally made a mod for Arma II: Operation Arrowhead about 3 years ago, and during its mod days I totally enjoyed the game, had constant fun of running around the map with stable game mechanics, lots of content and numerous updates coming very regular. Sniping people in Stary Sobor at like 4am on highly populated servers was the life, setting up car traps (Hence the word, CARS.) and it was so fun I could sit there for hours picking off unsuspecting victims. The DayZ where you could get into helicopters, cars and have a wide variety of different weapons, a working system and it was absolutely bliss. Then the developers announced it was going to be made into a standalone game.\n\nDayZ Standalone  came out on the night of the 16th December 2013, I bought it within 15 minutes of release, thinking it was going to have a sufficient amount of content considering they was developing it for a long period of time. Yet upon loading and playing the game for some time, I was quite dissapointed by lack of effort actually put into the game. Their was like 2 guns, the hand held weapons didnt even work, zombies could run through walls, no vehicles not even a peddle bike and their wasn't even a proper loot table let alone respawning loot. So today is 09/11/2014 and I am going to say that, literally, the only thing that has probably changed is the following;\n\n- 5 ish new zombie annimations.\n- 3 to 4 new guns added.\n- A semi-working loot table.\n- Countless amounts of clothes added (When zombies are still running through walls and under the ♥♥♥♥ing floor).\n- A couple of towns added.\n\nI mean, every time DayZ gets updated, Im like "Oh my god, its been three months and there is finally an update! OMG. What is it? Vehicles? Guns? Zombies fixed from breaking my legs from under the floor? Actual working hit detection system with melee weapons? Im so excited!!!" Followed by... "In update 0.xx, we have added... WATERPROOF CLOTHES!!!" and then people like going mental as if they've fixed the entire game in the comments. Like really? Waterproof ♥♥♥♥ing clothes? When Im still trying to hit a zombie when its under the floor but not only is the tip of the zombies head showing, the floors physical height is higher than the visual model, so Im hitting the floor and not the zombie, but regardless even if the floor was a fixed height in comparison to the visual model, I still wouldn't be able to hit the ♥♥♥♥ing zombie due to the 5 hit detection points on its body, they are the following, centre of chest, big toe, little toe, left knee cap and thumb on right hand. It's genuinely like the game's made for people to rage at and put their reactions on YouTube to get some sort of hilarious comedy out of it. Another aspect of the game, that still hasn't been fixed is some of the buildings, you can casually run into a solid looking building, then spontaneously collapse on the floor (with your top notch clothes that you've been spending hours to find) with two broken legs and lost about half your blood, and about 2 seconds after that it's announced beautifully that you're dead dead centre of your screen... I mean, it might aswell just say "Hahaha you ♥♥♥♥♥♥, just thought I'd glitch you through the map a few times to turn your little legs into mushy peas and watch you suffer and die, have fun getting your loot back you little ♥♥♥♥♥". Quite infuriating to say the least. Another bug, that involves one of the two guns in the game, is the Mosin scope. Now, realistically you'd expect the bullet to land around the crosshair in a rectangle as shown in the picture below, but what you really get is, well... check the picture for god sake! It's like trying to stay hydrated ingame... oh I didnt mention how every character shows constant Ebola symptoms. Oh and one last thing, just check the bleeding model below and that's after fighting 2 zombies with a crowbar and killing neither and look at where the blood is actually exiting my body.\n\nMosin scope accuracy -\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qBKqPaA.jpg?1\n\nBleeding after having a pathetic fight with two zombies with a steel crowbar -\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vVU6IlQ.jpg?1\n\n\nI actually think that the Dev's are more interested in adding pointless content like, waterproof trousers or a skater helmet, than fixing the performance deterioration, the zombies or even adding some sort of transport that will get us around the 225km2 map instead of walking for 6 hours. Whilst on the topic of map size, the vast majority of us have played Battlefield, and I'd say everyone has played Call of Duty, so here's a map comparison for all 3 games.\n\nMap comparison:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AOsmMra.jpg\n\nBeing a huge fan of DayZ mod, I clearly expected too much from the developers in there humble opinion, the game made a lot of money, selling just over 2 MILLION copies to this day. So lets do some math,\n\n2000000 x £20 = £40,000,000. Yeah, you read that quite right... £40 million Pound Sterling.\n\nNow obviously, Steam has a cut of this, so like 30% lets say (Average from sources). So lets take 30% form that £40 million for estimation purposes.\n\nSo £40,000,000 x 0.7 = £28,000,000. So where does this ridiculous amount of money get distrubuted? Who knows...\n\nI hope the DayZ Development team actually start to pull there ♥♥♥♥ together, I've been verging to get a refund for months, along with many of my friends, but we've stuck to it because of the mod and maybe one day, it will relive again and will be such a good game, but after almost a year of development, I can't really see this going anywhere anymore.\n\nDayZ Mod gets a solid 10 out of 10. (Requires Arma II and Arma II: Operation Arrowhead)\nDayZ Standalone 3 out of 10. Gets three for the countless amounts of clothes, and if someone's designing a fashion simulator, don't bother, we've got one... right here... for £20.","November 9, 2014","false","76.2"," 574 of 800 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","574","800","0","38"

I am not gonna tell bugs or problems. So read If you wonder what you will be doing in game incase you buy it.\n\nFirst it is exciting and your own survival challange begins, it goes like that for the first few hours finding food, clothes, some tools and an axe if you are lucky. So after all if you fed yourself well and not thirsty your survival goal kinda ends.  Maybe from now on you want to see some bigger, nicer cities. You run all the way to another city and when you arrive you can slightly see other people or you can keep scavenging houses. But mostly you will find more food, more drinks and more clothes. Finding a firearm is one thing and finding bullets for it? Only if you are lucky. Also you will need a magazine too.\n\nLets think you have rifle and pistol and full magazines with you; you are well fed...\nWhat is next?\nKill zombies with your axe by one hit, don't bother wasting ammo.\nZombies are not very large groups only 2 at the same time mostly, so zombies are not a treat too.\n\nWill you keep scavenging till you have 3x of everything? No. Since you got nothing better to do you start to kill other players. If he is lucky you can shout freeze, capture him, put on handcuffs and give him a chance to live maybe. If you don't think that way (most players do not) shoot him from behind and take his all scavenged items at once. His hours are lost now.\n\nBut its not that easy, you will run a lot to find firearms in military bases first (which those bases are mostly far away from your spawn points), than you will run some extra more to go back to crowded cities where you can hunt people. And 2 hours of doing that, you die in 2 seconds. Nonsense! That guy did the same thing he wasted his 2 hours. And you guys shot eachother. Now if you want to live that 2 seconds or try to not die this quick next time go ahead waste another 2 hours of your life.\n\nWill I keep playing it? Yes. Because I love it?

I also played the mod and the many variations that came along such as Epoch, Origins, Traviana - for quite a long time. I was a die-hard fan of the game (and the survival genre as a whole). After 3 years (16 Dec, 2013 steam release date) of rubbish updates, rampant hacking, unresponsive dev team and plentiful bugs, I just need to state my opinion.\n\nThe list of negative aspects of the game:\n1. 3 Years of developement: the game is still in alpha.\n2. The progress of game delevopement is extremely slow, the updates are sparse and do not bring anything signifcant to the gameplay (light changes to item spawn rates and plants - farming/cultivation, some new weapons from time to time).\n3. Game breaking bugs are still not fixed:\n-Walking down on stairs in various buildings such as the fire station can break your legs.\n-Zombies still sometimes glitch through walls and doors.\n-Some buildings may just simply kill you while standing/crouching in them.\n-You may spawn inside rocks on rare occasions.\n-You can also take no damage from jumping off buildings.\n4. Hackers and dupers are back again (although they were gone for quite a while).\n5. The game is still a walking simulator.\n6. Game optimization is still quite poor, massive FPS drops are a common occurrence. (Game slows down, especially while walking in large cities).*\n*My PC should let me play the game with decent frame rate and on graphics set to normal/medium. Arma2 was working way more fluid than the standalone DayZ.\n7. At this rate of developement the game will never leave alpha.\n8. Rare bug fixes.\n\nThe list of positive aspects:\n1. The game is still the most unique concept I encountered.\n2. I will still play DayZ in short bursts from time to time. (No other alternative with similar gameplay)\n3. The tactical aspect (gunfights, team work) are still fun and challenging.\n4. You can stumble upon lots of crazy encounters and situations - the community can be quite creative.\n5. The survival aspect used to be quite fun, gearing up and finding rare items/weapons could bring satisfaction*\n(this changed after the last patch since items are obnoxiously hard to find right now (2015-04-03).\n\nFinal verdict: PLAY THE MOD. Dayz standalone is a cash grab, think before you purchase this game.","April 3, 2015","false","280.3"," 109 of 130 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","109","130","2","1"

To my understanding, DayZ was going to be improved since it that was the general expectation. Nearly 200 hours over the course of 2 years later, it is apparent that progress is stagnant as instead of fixing some of the numerous bugs, the Devs instead decide to add new pants and broken loot tables. I've played many builds and patches to say the Devs have not done much to improve the game. To add insult to injury, they hiked the price up from $29.99 USD to $34.99 USD. Instead of adding new textures for pants, they should create a new engine entirely. Running a higher end PC, I still cannot maintain 40 fps. This game is as optimized as a Nacho Bel Grande meal at Taco Bell.\n\nTechnical issues aside, the community is cancerous, and it's very unlikely that you'll ever encounter someone not looking to kill you. The fanbase is the reason why nothing ever gets done in this game and why Bohemia Interative gets away with arbitrarily driving the price up and not ever fixing the issues their paying customers constantly complain about.\n\nDayZ was a brilliant concept, but in execution by Bohemia Interactive, the product is a rancid pool of camel diarrhea sitting in the Syrian sun. This game is not worth $35. It's not even worth $20. The game is too broken to recieve any real enjoyment. There are just WAY too many bugs in this game to fix, and they really just need to start over, beginning with planning a new engine. Items disappear for no reason, combat is clunky and complicated, you die from literally nothing, there are buildings just floating in the air, and the inventory system is just as well planned as an Adam Sandler movie. Stop adding things, and just fix the game already.\n\nIt was a brilliant game, and I really wanted this game to work. I've given DayZ more than a sufficient amount of time to improve and show that this was going somewhere, but after almost three years I'm at my limit. I cannot recommend this game to anyone legitimately looking to have fun.","April 2","false","192.4"," 200 of 263 people (76%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","76","200","263","16","78"

The game has been in development for three years and we still have the same buggy piece of ♥♥♥♥ we had at launch. I had high hopes for this, seeing how well the dev team had done with the mod and other titles. Clearly this was not the case. The more I play the more I think this was a cash grab. Everytime they release a patch to fix one game breaking bug another appears to restart the cycle. Not to mention the devs damage controlling on forums and only adding clothes and new guns instead of fixing this broken and unoptimized game. The best part about this game is the fanboys who scream and cry "SPOILED BRAT", "R U A PROGRAMMER? NO? STFU", "I GOT MY MONEYS WORTH STOP STFU" and the classic soon™ remark when asked when any real progress will be made or any criticism about the speed of the development.\n\n\n\nTLDR Dont waste your money on this piece of crap, devs will probably jump ship in a couple years anyway when they slap finished on this for adding some new guns and clothes.","August 30, 2015","false","891.7"," 114 of 140 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","114","140","10","14"

Melee combat looks like the karate fighting scene from "Team America". Walking in interiors is a bit stressfull, luckily there is an option to commit suicide now.\nThere are other people playing this game as well I suppose, however after 6 hours of walking I haven't seen anyone else. This might be a positive thing though, as I don't enjoy eating rotten fruit and drinking detergent while handcuffed anyway.\nDropping items inside buildings usually ends up with the item being stuck inside the building somewhere, so good luck trying to pick it up again, try not to die while clipping through walls and doors. Supposedly you can set up campfires and what not, but finding wood is very rare in this game. I had to walk miles through thick woods armed with just an axe to finally find some wood on a cargo ship.\nI think that the game knows what kind of item you are trying to find and deliberatly hides it from you.\nI had to scavenge through roughly 150+ kitchens to find a pot. Mostly they were just full of motorcycle helmets. Everyone in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ had a motorcycle helmet. Unfortunately no one had a motorcycle. I suspect it was a land of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ where everyone would bang their heads on the furniture and surroundings and was a danger to himself and the society and the helmets were thus mandatory.\nI'm not sure when exactly is this taking place. This game tries to cofuse me on purpose. Everything you find is broken, desolate, abandoned and dirty resembling years after the apocalypse, but there is a ♥♥♥♥♥on of fresh oranges and kiwis lying around everywhere in this moderate climate country.\nAlthough this might be a plot twist and later when this game is released, there will be some kind of an evil big corporation that turns people into zombies and delivers kiwis and oranges to abandoned houses just to take a ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone.\nOverall this game feels like being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by a cactus while trying to ♥♥♥♥ a porcupine, which is not necessarily a bad thing if you're into that kind of stuff.

Dean struck Gold and when he got his share, he jumped ship and let his crew die in the wreck.\n\nFirst off, It's been in developement for 2 years. No, not one. They were working on it before they released it. Then they released it, got top seller for 2 weeks, made ♥♥♥ loads of cash, and stopped caring. 2 years of development and the game is in a constant state of repair. They fix one thing and 10 other things break. And they still do not care about the excessive amounts of hackers that plague the servers. Why would they? They're filthy ♥♥♥♥ing rich.\n\nSecond, if it isn't the development ruining this game, it's the community. God, is the community awful. On the forums, the Moderators delete any negative comments about the game. The ones they don't delete, they shuffle into one thread to keep it from the public eye so they can still sell the game. So when people go the forums, all they see is discussions on how amazing it is. I've seen them remove comments, well constructed criticism on the game, and call it "slander". Haha, slander! And if it isn't the moderators making sure the game looks like gold, it's all of the 12 year olds or Ex-Military ♥♥♥ clowns asking for more guns. Want the core mechanics fixed first? You're an idiot, what you want is another rifle to spawn close to the coast and plenty of ammo. That way you can kill people as soon as you spawn! Just like every other FPS! Want player interaction? Want to really feel like a survivor? You're a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot.\n\nIn conclusion, I've gotten my money's worth out of the game.

It is shameful that they sell this for $35.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: People don't seem to get this so I'll just write it out here. The fact that this game is in "Early Access" is irrelevant to my review. The review is of the game in its current state, which is abysmal considering the pricetag. If (and that is a massive if with this game's development history) there is an update released that makes this game worth the price of admission, I will edit my review. But, as it stands, DayZ is a hobbled together "nothing" of a game. There's no depth, and no reason to keep playing. Games like Rust and the actual DayZ mod provide significantly more content than this title for cheaper, not to mention those are regularly updated.\n\nDayZ hasn't had a significant update or patch since it's "launch" into Early Access. It's essentially an abandoned title and if you're defending it it's most likely because you're trying to justify your purchase rather than admitting that the game is not worth the money you paid for it.\n\nI'm not saying you can't like the game, I'm not self-important enough to claim that what I say should have any bearing on someone else's opinion. If you like the game, that's great. I'm just trying to warn potential buyers of DayZ that it is NOT worth the money that Bohemia is charging for it and that there are far better titles in this genre that are available. Rust, ArmA II DayZ, 7DTD, H1Z1, and probably some others that I don't know about.","September 15, 2015","false","50.9"," 80 of 93 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","80","93","3","4"

Spawned in a rock, I tried getting out but my legs broke and I couldn't commit suicide so I had to do other things intill I eventually died so I could respawn (took almost an hour for my character to die)\n2. Went inside a buidling and closed all the doors to avoid zombies chasing me, as I am looting the zombies start hitting me through the wall and I had no weapon to kill them so I ran down the street to another townto avoid them and they were still hitting me despite the zombies being in another town, died shortly after from bloodloss and being magically bitten.\n3. Was looting a police station and for no reason my legs broke randomly, I tried crawling out of the police station but everytime I tried to crawl down the stairs I would fall through the world and teleport back to where I originally was and eventually a guy came and aimed his gun at me and staired at me and I said "could you help me? my legs are broken" he didn't respond, staired at me for a minute and then shot me and called me an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for some reason (maybe he thought I was someone else?)\n4. Just spawned and found a rain coat, guy trapped me in a corner and wouldn't let me go, I started punching him but he hit me in the head with a fire extinguisher and knocked me out, I woke up with only my jeans and nothing else, my survival depended on that raincoat as it was raining, got hypothermia shortly afterwards and died.\n\nI would rate this game a 2/10 due to some of my friends having fun but that quickly stopped after we got stressed from the annoying bugs and gltiches for example having to exit a room and re-enter just to loot something of the floor and other times we couldn't even loot that item at all (apparently it is because someone has looted that item before you but for some reason it still appears there for you although I am not sure if this is correct it still happened alot of the time)\n","March 31, 2015","false","66.6"," 170 of 227 people (75%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","75","170","227","51","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rGRonin/recommended/221100/","rGRonin","|FF| Ronin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rGRonin/","30 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUnfortunately my review will probably be washed down by the large amount of negative reviews this game has received, however I will take a stab at getting my voice out there to the people. First off, however, I want you to look at how many hours I have logged into this game. The amount of time I have spent in DayZ Standalone far surpasses any other game I have played on Steam, and for good reason. There is a lot of misconception going around the Steam reviews, and quite frankly many of the negative comments are filled with bigot hate towards the developers and a lack of understanding for how the early access model works in DayZ. Hopefully I can clear some of the confusion and give potential buyers some clarity on the title.\n\nLet's rewind the clocks back to late 2013, a year after DayZ mod was released on Arma II. The survival sandbox genre had just exploded into the videogames scene, and every developer was trying to claim their stake in the land of the survivalist games. At the time, Bohemia Interactive had in their hands the most popular survivalist game on the market. Thousands of people played DayZ mod, and people loved the idea of an open-world survival game in which the elements and players are pitted against you. DayZ mod set the tone for what a survival game should be: challenging, unforgiving, and hard to top. Bohemia wanted to take the title and make it something greater, something much bigger and smoother than what the original mod intended to be. They knew that releasing a full version of the game on that clunky Arma II engine wouldn't cut it, so they had to make major improvements to bring the title into 2016 and beyond.\n\nInstead of releasing the full DayZ Standalone game on the horrible Arma II engine, Bohemia made the decision to completely re-gut the engine and build a new one from scratch. FROM. SCRATCH. There are a few legacy modules that are getting carried over, but for the most part every aspect of the game is new (render, physics, lighting, etc). Anyone who has had any kind of development experience in video-games understands that this is a daunting task, a momentous task, a task that doesn't happen in one month or one year; No, creating a brand new engine takes years to develop, and this is where the root of the "problem" started.\n\nDayZ Standalone went into early access in late 2013, and this is where they made their big mistake. The game simply wasn't ready. With no new engine components even being started on (plus it hit early access only 4 weeks into the development timeline, dear god), many early access players were left in disappointment when new features could not be pushed right away. People cried "fix zombies", but the zombies could not be fixed yet because an entirely new AI system was being created. People cried "fix FPS", but no FPS fix could be put in place because they were busy developing the new renderer. People wanted new vehicles, but vehicles could not be added yet because the physics system was being re-worked. There's no point in providing a "fix" for a mechanic in the game when that mechanic is going to be entirely replaced down the line anyways.\n\nAnd so people got ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and fed up. "$20 for a Standalone title, and there's no fixes for these bugs?" Even I was at the point of rage, often times quitting DayZ Standalone for months at a time. People started saying that the developers weren't doing anything, that they "took the money and ran". But the real reality was that they were simply hard at work laying out the foundation for the title, unfortunately not being able to fix most bugs and issues at the time because they were so busy writing up new systems for the game to play on.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSO LET'S FAST FORWARD. It's late 2015 now, nearing 2016. DayZ Standalone has been in development for 2 years now. Has the game changed? Are any of the new engine models finished? Are zombies even fixed yet?\n\nYou bet your ♥♥♥ they are. If you were to ask me when I think the game should of been released to the public as early access, I would have said right now (version .59) would have been the time to do it. FINALLY, after 2 years of development, Bohemia Interactive is getting around to completing all of the upcoming engine changes and new foundation for the title. Let me make a quick list to get your hype train rolling:\n\nNew Renderer is nearly finished, should have "30 - 40 % FPS boost overall"\n\nZombie AI is brand new and fixed, zombies now have sense of smell and sight, don't clip through walls, are actually a challenge\n\nFour vehicles currently in game: V3S, Sedan, Hatchback, and Bus. Arial vehicles confirmed, as well as bikes and boats\n\nNew vehicle physics system taken from GTA V (Bullet SDK). Full vehicle maintenance and parts\n\nAll servers persistent. Camps and items are saved after restart. You can create large camps now.\n\nTents, Barrels, vehicles, protector cases, and backpacks can all be used as base storage now. Stays persistent through server reset\n\nLoot respawn fixed. Loot spawns in areas that make sense now, it is very hard to get access to good weapons and ammo\n\nSickness and Disease now a major factor of gameplay\n\nTons of new animals in the game with new Animal AI. They react to sight and sound, as well as naturally roam the map looking for ponds and fields to graze in.\n\nPredator animals confirmed, including wolves and bears\n\nmap changes and new northern towns expand the map greatly from mod\n\nSoftskills soon to be implemented, aka the more you run the more fit you get. skills develop over time\n\nEvery building now enter able with loot\n\nA ton of new weapons and cosmetic items (clothing) added into the game\n\ncharacter wear progession, such as growing beards and getting dirt / blood on yourself, soon to be implemented\n\nContaminated Zones confirmed and being worked on, the first being a military base up north\n\nAnd soo so so much more. I could keep the list going forever but it honestly doesn't cover how much they've added into the game since launch.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nConclusion\nAnyone who says DayZ Standalone is dead, or that the developers have "taken the money and ran", or that the community is dead, quite frankly is full of ♥♥♥♥. The game is very much alive and so much better than it was when it started. Even though DayZ SA has been slow off the start compared to other survivalist games (H1Z1, Rust, ARK, Unturned, Miscreated, etc), I strongly believe it will come out on top as the best survivalist game when it is finished. No other survival game has this much attention to detail and realism as DayZ. No other survival game has the kind of studio resources and money that Bohemia has to put out a strong title. No other survival game has mastered the hardcore aspect of survival and struggle better than DayZ. Almost every other survival game was rushed out on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unreal engine in an effort to reap money off the survivalist scene and try to outbeat Bohemia to the punch on features and gameplay. Games like Rust and H1Z1 fail to hit the bullseye on what a survival game should be. DayZ Standalone does this right and does it good. I would definitely recommend this game now, as it's about to surpass the ♥♥♥♥ outta all other games on the market.

I have to run everything on lowest and disable everything I can, also I have to go into the config files to edit the render distance, shadow distance and all these things that you actually need in this game to see someone far away... And still I cannot enter a city without huge FPS drops. But even in open landscapes, the FPS is not satisfying at all. I don't really care about the servers swallowing weapons or items that you drop on the ground, what I care about is if the game is playable at all. But the optimization just makes me sad.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know if this game will ever be optimized at all. I feel like there is something seriously wrong with the engine they are using. IMO they should seriously develop or just use a different engine, I don't care if they even go for a more cartoonish/animated style, as long as the game is optimized.\n\nAnd for a FPS game, it's terrible. Honestly, if you're coming from CS:GO, CoD, BF, Battlefront, Half Life or any other known successful FPS game, then you will be highly disappointed. It's terrible to look around and aim in this game, no matter how good PC you have, you will miss how good it feels to turn around and aim in a different FPS game.\n\nI don't have the latest hardware, but it's damn better than any of the requirements.\n\ni7 Six Core processor 3.20GHz\nTwo GTX680 SLI\n16GB DDR3 RAM\n1200W PSU","December 4, 2015","false","198.3"," 132 of 171 people (77%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","77","132","171","10","11"

So, don't buy this game in Early Access because all you are doing is promoting their   terrible work ethic.\n\nI played the free mod frequently, but left it because I couldn't find servers in the standard version. I purchased this game instead with faith that it would eventually reached its grand aspirations. In fact, until recently I wouldn't post a review because I was uncomfortable slandering a game in Alpha, but all that changed when they released patch 0.55. This patch single-handedly destroyed my faith in this game.\n\nZombies went from glitchy to purely unrealistic. They now run at Olympic Runner speeds and hit you before they can finish their animations. The new loot economy that they are pushing towards mixed with persistence will absolutely break the game. Now, instead of walking the entire map for hours to receive awesome gear is merely a dream. The plan is to make items limited so that the only way to to receive items is to kill people that are already geared. The best part is that in some insane logic this will reduce PvP and KoS according to the devs.\n\nAlso, the community for this game will constantly yell and shame anyone that dares question the devs because it's in Alpha. At a certain point it's no longer a defense. Don't take your complaints to the forums because they only want feedback that promotes what they are doing, or they send your posts/threads to the graveyard. Great Community!\n\nMy advice, wait for the real apocalypse and live your dream there. Because I'm certain that you will have better chances at surviving.","April 4, 2015","false","91.0"," 89 of 107 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","89","107","6","0"

Do not buy this game. This whole DayZ is a scam. Today efforts made to silence those who speak out are more abundant than efforts made to piece together whatever sloppy fragments there are that make up this 'game'.\n\nThe updates that you see put into the 'game' are unauthentic, more gamebreaking, and only serve as a pathetic show- to deceive any buyer or person waiting to buy- into thinking that the game is actually updating and developing. It is not the case! Any person attempting to question the actuality of the game status is banned or shut up through abuse. Personally posting on the forums had my topic banned in under 10 minutes and a poster contacted me to say he was banned permanently for commenting with statistics in the thread.\n\nThis is the truth of the game that has pulled in over 10 million dollars. Now 2 years in Early Access and counting. There is no excuse that is valid for the slow "progression"- in fact the game is worse now than it's initial release state on Steam. Do not fall for this trick. They will continue to milk first time buyers' money until someone with higher power stops them. It's sad and it's true. Please avoid and spread the message [Once you research and see that these alligations are true.

Not worth the buy now, and probably still won't be a year from now.\n\nI really tried to like this game. But I can't. It's been over a year since its release, and it still seems as though very little development progress has been made. I put tons of hours into the original Arma II mod, and I bought this with the intention of helping development and eventually getting a good standalone game. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case.\n\nFirst, the game's updates have been nothing special since launch. Beyond a few new weapons and the addition of a vehicle (I think? I've never actually seen it before) there have been almost no remarkable updates to the game, with the exception of the occasional bug fixes. However it seems that with every bug fixed, more and more annoying ones arise, taking development priority over everything else.\n\nThe game runs terribly, since day one, seemingly regardless of how impressive your specs are. My computer isn't the absolute best, but it is certainly powerful enough to max out games like Crysis or Battlefield. It's very hard for my system to maintain 30 fps while in cities, and usually I am stuck around the lower 20s. When running in the wilderness, with nothing but trees and the ground to render, I manage to get a whopping 40-50 at best. Woo hoo! Perhaps if the devs put half as much effort into optimizing the game as they did into adding gardening to the game, it would actually be playable.\n\nLastly, I feel like DayZ's community has gotten significantly worse since the release of the standalone on Steam. Back in the days of the mod, I remember encountering people that weren't solely out to kill every other player on sight. Don't get me wrong, I know that hostile players do add to the difficulty and realism of the game. But it just seems like now that's the only thing the game has going for it. The zombies are hardly a threat, there's very few at any given time, and they're very easy to escape from.\n\nThe game used to (sort of) reward you when you helped other players (giving blood, sharing food, etc.) by giving them the "Hero" skin. On the other hand, violent players would be given the "bandit" skin. This was a feature that was actually interesting and worth while. It served as a kind of goal for people to reach for with every new character. And now it's been taken away, and hasn't returned since. Just like vehicles, helicopters, and gear that is actually good and worth playing/fighting for.\n\nLike I said before, I really wanted to like this game. I knew that it was early access, and I knew what I'd be getting into wouldn't be perfect, but after over a year, I can't say it's been worth my time or my money.","July 29, 2015","false","75.6"," 95 of 117 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","95","117","2","2"

I played over 100 hours on the Arma 2 mod and love it, even if was a buggy mess. It was excusable because it was just a mod. But now here we are over a year after the standalone release, and the game is in many ways worse.\n\nWhat got better:\n+ Graphics look great\n+ World is more detailed\n+ Much bigger variety of loot to be found and used (even if a lot of them are totally pointless)\n+ UI is much easier to understand\n\nYou'll notice that all the +'s don't actually add anything tangible to the game. It's just polish, which is something you're supposed to do AFTER you get the gameplay sorted out.\n\nWhat got worse:\n- ZOMBIES. Literally the selling point of this game and they have been practically removed. You can count on one hand the number of zombies you'll find in each major town like Cherno or Elektro. And they're STILL buggy as hell. The supposed reasoning is that it puts too much stress on the servers, which brings me to...\n- SERVERS. For some reason that I can't fathom the amount of stress that a server is under will directly influence your framerate signinifcantly. Want to play on one of those fabled 40 or 50 person servers? Hope you like playing at 10 FPS.\n- VEHICLES. After a year of standalone we finally have one, single vehicle, and it's still unfinished. (can't ride in the back, blowing out the tires has no effect)\n\nSo the fundamentals of the game are the same, but most of the things that made the mod amazing aren't in the standalone. What happened to sneaking by streets filled with zombies desperately trying not to draw their attention? There's no zombies anymore! In the mod you'd be hesitant to use your guns in town because you'd draw a whole horde to you. In the standalone, that threat is completely gone. And without the threat of zombies, it's just a PvP game. If you want a scavenging deathmatch, Arma 3's Battle Royale does it a hell of a lot better.","January 9, 2015","false","7.1"," 104 of 131 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","104","131","2","0"

Its a bit long, but if it could save you your hard earned money, all the better for it\n\nI've owned this game since Jan 14,  played every patch update they have put to stable and experimental\n\nI can say ive had my monies worth from it......however\n\nI honestly wouldnt recommend buying this game at its current stage\nIve held off writing this review, during my time playing it, ive had ups and downs with it, some good updates, but mostly bad\n\nIn its current stable release, 0.58, there isnt much of a game.\nIts the chernarus+ map, some bits of loot and a few thousand players online spread over many, mostly empty, servers.\n\nThere are no zombies, so no point to PVE\n\nThe animal AI has been removed so no hunting or various crafting options\n\nThe vehicles are bugged, some flip easily, passengers are desync'd beyond belief\n\nthe loot economy, while a slight improvement over previous releases, still seems unbalanced, coastal(spawn) areas dont respawn loot on a quicker timer than anywhere else on map, meaning it can be impossibly hard for fresh spawns.\n\nThere is a 'map swimming' glitch, cheaters paradise\n\nThe desync during PVP encounters makes PVP pointless, for example, on numerous occasions, shooting prone or standing people with no effect, only to see them get up or run off uninjured.\n\nAwful clunky movements, delayed actions, random actions, horrible FPS in any populated or built up areas (10-20fps)\nvisuals, as you would expect from older engine/renderer, are starting to look dated when compared to say, FO4, they are in the process of building a new one from the ground up and implementing it\n\nThere is zero optimisation for this game. ZERO. DO NOT TAKE THE RECOMMENED/MINIMUM SPEC REQUIREMENTS AS GUIDLINES. The game only uses 1 CPU core, no multi threading, and doesnt matter if your using a titan gfx card or a toilet gfx card, there is very little adjustment to be made. There are 'fps guides' to try boost your fps, but you are not going to see anything pretty\n\nFor me tho, and for many others, the worst, and probably most discussed issue about this game, is the development progress.\nThis game is moving so slow.\nThe developers roadmap hasnt met a single point its set.\nStatus reports are vague, trying to be all pally pally, and avoiding any hard details on issues encountered and why deadlines not met.\nEvery PAX event see's a new 'road map', the latest being, that the game will be in beta in jan/feb/march 2016.\nI'll eat my pants on you tube if that happens.\n\nIve been testing the 0.59 EXP release, there are a few areas of improvement, dont be fooled tho. The zombies are in 0.59, however, they are poor, hardly ever attacking unless you walk up and hit them.\nThe loot system is a little better\nThe desync is awful still\nThe new vehicles are awful\nFPS is still awful\n\nAll in all, this game is awful.\nwait until start of 2016, when beta isnt released, and you'll thank me, for saving you from what the rest of us suckers have had to endure\n\n","November 20, 2015","false","686.5"," 72 of 83 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","72","83","7","4"

I was so happy and proud of this game,because I played a lot  DayZ Mod and because I loved Bohemia Interactive as a great czech game developing company since ArmA II...  At the beginning of its way it was normal and very awaited "going to be Stand-Alone version." I bought this game right when it was on Steam and there were a lot of bugs.. But it was,and then there comes the bad word "The Famous Early Access"... The bugs were okay,you can say "It is on its start of development,so heads up,my friends." I was still so proud of this game,but then\n\nTODAY 12.05.2016\n\nIt's year 2016 and it is still in "The Famous Early Access" , one week ago,the .60 (unstable experimental branch) version released... Game changed only in details,new engine had to be here on DayZ's start,not in a half of "neverending story called Early Access".I liked this game and the sad fact of it is,that a lot of things since alpha and early versions of it were forgotten,are not in game and probably will be forgotten and never will be added to DayZ.Now updates are still slowing down,the "weekly updates" are now "half year updates",developers earned a "mountain" of money and this beautiful title of "DayZ",I am not kidding,its a very great title with a big concurency is falling to the hole of forgotten things and developers look like they made it only for money,which they do and can,but not that bad like this,like scam... If I was in this situation one year ago,you will probably see thankful and positive recension,how I like and I am proud of Bohemia Interactive.. Always when somebody told about Bohemia Interactive how they do this game bad,I was telling him the bright sides of DayZ.In the game,there are still people like I was,who are proudly of Bohemia Interactive and Dayz,but one day you will read their negative recensions in here like I,one of them do now...\n\nDevelopers,\nIf you are reading this with full honesty,DayZ is losing its popularity and when times goes it is still getting worser,recreate "weekly updates" and start doing something ! This game don't deserve this way of development,where are you Bohemia Interactive,where is game company of what I was proud of... Wake up...\nThank you all for and don't forget to rate it as useful or how do you feel it... Thanks\nIf you want to buy DayZ,do it only if developers will wake up and make this game not the "Game of our childs" or in worser scenario "The game,which wasn't completed" Cheers.","May 12","false","547.9"," 141 of 187 people (75%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","75","141","187","13","2"

They run around them now but can still walk through closed doors.)\n\nInstead of fixing these problems, the developers have instead added a plethora of useless content and items and built new cities. While this is good of them, what's the point if underlying fundamental issues I mentioned prevent enjoyment of the game? Supposedly there is a "new renderer" around the corner which should address some performance issues. I would like to see more news from the developers on when and how they plan to fix these issues, or a reason of why they are adding features and content before fixing game breaking issues.\n\nOf course, the game is also full of fresh spawn killers which will never change and just create an angry player base who will kill anyone for no reason.\n\nThere is also a large community of people who say cut it some slack because it's only in alpha stage. These are the same people who think that content is more important than performance, and that all bugs should be fixed at the end. I don't care whether the game is classified as a pre-alpha, alpha, beta or whatever, just fix the big issues! DayZ first came out as a mod in 2012.

It's now almost impossible to play the game because you cannot find loot anywhere along the coast where you spawn.

Because lets face it, that's what we are, investors in early access games providing funds, testing and feedback.\n\nI have sat n thought about what i really enjoyed about the game, trying not to display only the negatives. I will admit I am having a little trouble.\n\nDayz, at first, was fun and something a little different. It had a large map to explore, and it is huge. The survival aspect was good. I enjoyed having to try to survive in a harsh world where things are scarce, but not so scarce you die within 10 minutes from lack of food. There was plenty interaction with other players...which usually ended in death but one could hope you met a friendly player or group to make your day a little brighter.\n\nThis soon wore thin.\n\nThe community became worse and you can guarentee almost every player you come across will shoot you on sight.\nThe forums are not very welcoming either if you have an even slightly negative thing to say about Dayz.\n\nThe controls are terrible. You have to spam buttons just to hop over a fence or draw your weapon, which is not good in a situation which calls for quick reactions.\n\nYes, the map is big, but without vehicles, you are forced to run for hours to get anywhere and to find your friends if you have died. Usually, you die of starvation before you reach them as there seems to be a problem with loot spawning in specific areas and no where else.\nAlso there is no feeling of an apocalypse. More like the residents got bored n decided to up sticks n move somewhere else.\n\nThe zombies...oh my... at first they weren't too bad. I understand yes they are 'placeholders'. They ran through walls and doors, they managed to hit you from quite a distance, they weren't too bad to kill, you could run in circles or you could kill them with an axe to the head.\n\nAs time has gone by and they have tried to improve the zombies, they appear to have gotten worse. They spawn randomly and right next to where you are standing, they're almost impossible to kill. The damage they do is huge! they often kill you in a couple of hits and if they don't, they will ruin every single item on you regardless if its in a bag or protected in a box. The last time I played, they had removed the zombies from the map.\n\nThe general content of the game consists of guns. Guns, guns and more GUNS! It's slowly morphing into a military simulator. Yes, they have alot of content, but most of it's garbage. Right now, content is not what this game needs.\nThey have tried to add the ability to throw objects. Removed from the game at this time. Apparently they added wildlife and animals, I have seen 1 cow..1 cow in all my hours of running the map. Then they were removed and more guns added! Don't get me wrong, I love guns, but c'mon! really?! Apparently there is also persistance...NEXT..\n\nThe core mechanics of this game are terrible. This is what they really should be focusing on, not hoards of content and guns. Focus on the core architecture and mechanics of the game. Get this right and the rest will flow. You need a good solid foundation before you build a house.\n\nDayz is like building a mansion on quicksand.\n\nThere is no hope for this game. The updates are erratic and usually broken. This game has not progressed in a long long time.  I feel that the developers are playing everyone for a fool. Taking your hard earned money and snorting it up their noses because it's clear that Dayz has seen NONE of that cash.\n\nHow many millions of copies sold and money made, yet they still only have a team of 20 from Bratislava.\n\nDon't waste your time or money.","August 16, 2015","false","171.1"," 72 of 84 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","72","84","5","6"

Have you ever wanted to have a gun fight where you shoot someone ten times on your screen and they take no damage because on there screen they aren't even there. Have you ever wanted to play a zombie survival game that has 3 zombies on the entire map and when you do find them they have wallhacks and never stop following, rationally you would think to go in a building right? well ♥♥♥♥ that the zombies just go through the wall like they are casper or some ♥♥♥♥. Have you ever wanted to spend 5 hours "gearing up" and finding a whole lot of ♥♥♥♥ing nothing because of the 3 guns that spawn per server restart. Do you want to find a decent weapon well none of them spawn on the map or they apparently do at heli crash sites but when you do find one of the three that spawn ever you'll be happy to know you'll find some boots and a hat for you. I know right truly amazing immersive gameplay. Love every second I play of this buggy piece of ♥♥♥♥ game that has been in alpha for over 2 years, and the best part is I have never encountered problems like this ever on the DayZ mod.\n\nSo spent the last 3 days gearing up making a full ghillie suit that literally took a ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous time to make, spent ages finding all my gear and a mag for my AK 74, because finding the mag is 1000 times harder than finding the gun as boots and fresh fruit are nine times more important than being able to have a functional weapon. So after all this me and a group of friends who had put up with countless amounts of bugs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t decide to head down to Cherno for some good old PvP as it is the only thing that makes end game enjoyable and within literally 10 seconds of joining a full pop server mine and a mates game crash which is clearly stated in the patch notes as a thing that happens and believe me it happens ♥♥♥♥ing frequently, so i'm like oh ♥♥♥♥ better re join the server and here comes the best part in the time that my game has crashed my character had found it in himself to walk himself off the top of the building we had been on and killed himself so I log back onto a fresh character losing an absolute ♥♥♥♥ ton of gear that took me ages to find. Oh wait it gets even better my friends say they will see if they can find my body so I can come back and get my stuff, I spawn at some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Northern town two times in a row to have the server go down and you know what that means don't you, no chance of getting my loot back none at all, this is probably the biggest kick in the balls I have ever recieved in a game. I gave this game a second chance after an extreme case of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and it does it right again in a ♥♥♥♥ing worse fashion that just shows how buggy and unfinished this game truly is . DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it has been in Alpha for over a year now and had also been tested via the mod, it clearly still has bugs in it that have been in since release but have not been addressed as adding in more towns to the NE side of the map that nobody ♥♥♥♥ing cares about and just makes the game more confusing to player who have never played the game, seriously save yourself the time and money and buy Arma 2 and OA or buy Arma 3 the mods for those are way less buggy and are actually enjoyable to play. Please also don't use the god damn excuse of this game being in alpha as I have played other alpha games that have no where near as many bugs and issues as this game. 10/10 IGN\n\nUpdate time, decided to give this game another chance which was obviously a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid idea, so geared up yet again for another entire day actually found decent gear this time and yet again with nothing other to do than PvP with end game gear yet again we head down to Cherno and get on one of the taller buildings and set up to change to a high pop server, within about 30 seconds of joining the server me and my 3 mates spot a speed hacker running through the town, and i say oh he probably wont do anything to us, a few seconds later mine and my mates game crash yet again within being on the server for about 30 seconds, but this time my character doesn't fall to his death (learnt from that last time). I'm loading the game back up and hoping that my character didn't somehow glitch through the barrier of the roof i'm on and fall to his death, as we are loading back up my mate who was on another building says he's being shot and he can't see anyone, wonder who that could be none other than the glorious speed hacker who decided that speed hacking wasn't enough he found it in himself to fly around the server killing everyone including me and my friend who wasn't on the server but our characters were logging out thanks to the combat log prevention that seems to cause more harm than good, as it has killed me multiple times through crashes. The speed hacker then flys past my other friend confirming that he is just flying around killing everyone. Truly amazing game considering that a new anti cheat system was introduced days if not weeks prior to this. In 100% seriousness I am never playing this game again you spend ages gearing up and then just to get killed by non legit sources such as  bugs and hackers, this game is the epitome of ♥♥♥♥, it is garbage, avoid this game.\n\nIn all seriousness this game is enjoyable but in its current state is too buggy and honestly just full of hackers/ glitchers, hackers are literally in every high pop server and spend there time flying around killing everyone which in turn ruins the fun for everyone else, i'm not joking when I say there are hackers everywhere. This is the best zombie/ survival game out currently but that doesn't make it a great game if you are willing to put up with hours of gearing up being lost instantly by unknown sources then go ahead and buy it in its current state but for me it just currently isn't worth it. One last tip if you ever see a hacker log off immediatly and if you see that your server is filling up and getting to near full you may want to leave as they tend to enjoy the higher populated servers. Also I just figured out the other day that their is a script that allows people to crash others games as it makes there game render in the entire map, this is what happened in the above mentioned incidents, it's not bad enough that they are virtually unkillable they make sure you have no chance of fighting back by crashing your game and killing you whilst your character logs out. 10/10 lame as ♥♥♥♥","December 15, 2014","false","520.8"," 97 of 122 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","97","122","7","0"

Time to re-write a review. So... Where to begin.\n\nI was so hyped when this game was released, got it right away after playing the mod for a year. Looked at the road map and was very happy. Played for months waiting for updates that were worth while, making the game, the game they promised us. coming on 2 years of development, they still have not done so. What so ever really.\n\nAlthough fun with friends, its only fun now for a short time. They are adding the most useless things now, aka, more clothes, weapons and flawed designs etc.. When they fix one thing, they in no doubt, ♥♥♥♥ up and make more problems.\nRecently they showed footage of their new vehicles, it looks NO DIFFERENT than Arma 2. What so ever.\n\nI play Arma 3 mods with more in depth systems than they are making use of. Which also leads to the point, the engine. They used their OLD engine, and apaprently are making a transition to a new one finally (god knows when that will finish). When they could have used what Arma 3 had, and worked from there, but didn't because "It to was in alpha" which is stupid.\n\nThe 30 dollar price tag is to steep for this "mess" at the moment. Although yes I still play it, it's in hope that they finally start getting their ♥♥♥♥ together, and the fact there are fun moments to be had, but when they take this long, and literally change nothing, it's a rip-off at the moment.\n\nTLDR; Wait until Beta, then see how it is, because of how long it is taking to develop, there's no excuse for the state it is in.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and the community online for this game is getting worse, used to be a nice time visiting the sub-reddit, its now fested with awful posts, communication and people saying the same thing over and over and others being really rude for having your own opinion.\n\nEDIT 2: WTF!?

Not thousands of hours but at least long enough to write a recommendation about it. in my opinion this game is a waste of money. it is really disappointing because it seems like the developer just use for everything the excuse " its an early access game so dont complain" its already more than a year in early access and since then it hasnt changed much about it. none of the major bugs got fixed..for example (zombies punch you from the outside through a wall while you are inside of a building, or they get stuck in the floor, sometimes u cant pick up items, sometimes items disappear when u drop them) the controls arent the best either..this are all things which should be fixed after so long time. the movement of the zombies is looking so unreal when you punch them, you punch sometimes in the air or beside them its just so laggy. and its not even because of a bad computer or a bad internet connection, its just miserable programmed and the layout of the map is so wrong you really need a non plus ultra gaming computer that you can play it nicely. i have an 8 core and at least a GTX 560 as GPU (not the worst thing) and its still not enjoyable for me. in the arma 2 mod it was possible to drive cars..to store items in a tent..or to make fire..nothing of that works yet. basically u can just pick up some food and survive out of it. ghosting in buildings is unrealistic too. recently they updated it and placed a bunch of new items in game like a stove for example..they are all not usable and its been a few months already..they also added more houses but u cant walk in all of them. bad thing about it is..the houses of which u can use the doors and where u cant use doors look exactly the same..and there arent much static meshes in it..basically it all looks the same its just a "copy paste of buildings randomly in the map"\nBy selling this game they got millions of $ budget. By a high price of 28 €/$ compared to the quality of this game it feels almost like a scamming to me. within a year the game hasnt changed.i would expect something better slowly. if you compare it to games like Dying Light where i just got the key for 30 €/$ or to games like Dead Island..well..its a different gameplay but you actually get a working funny game without bugs and wonderful graphic even with a crap computer..if they just take out the story mode and add the possibility of hunger, thirst, sleep and take out the coop then you have a zombie survival game how DayZ should be. The zombies of dayz look so bad like its a game of 10 years ago. the developers have no intention to ever finish this game and also there isnt anything promised how the game will be in its final version. contractual the game can be forever in early access cause it doesnt give you a datum for finishing it or any kind of deadline.\neven if my english isnt perfect im still right and my critic is based on facts. If it was possible i would rather get my money back and buy another Dying Light Key.\n\nEdit: Another information which i didnt know as i wrote this review and probably a lot of people also dont know, the main inventor of this game or main developer (however u want to call it) left a few weeks after releasing the game on steam in early access the team. they made around 60 million $ within the first few weeks (because a lot of gamers wanted to support this type of game (me too) since it was the first of them). Everyone thought when this people just have the financial support they need it will be great since they showed so much talent in the Arma2 Mod where they had no Cent of money to make it.\nBut he then ran off with his share of money, left the team and opened up his own gamestudio. And as it wouldnt have been already bad enough for the team, then they had the "amazing" idea to take pictures in military bases which is (like in every country) strictly forbidden. So of course they got jailed.\nI think this are also important facts to know for people who havent already purchased this game.\nLike i said, i dont ever expect this game to be finish, or to be what gamers expected it to be in its final version.","February 23, 2015","false","108.4"," 174 of 239 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","174","239","10","15"

All their humanity has left them. Except its not the zombies were talking about here... its your fellow player.\n\nAlso unique about this game is that while my gaming rig can run Battlefront comfortably at ultra settings. Dayz dips to a few frames per second everytime theres a house or another player nearby (on medium settings) /fx6350 R9270x4gb\n\nThe engine is so poorly designed that player interaction with the world, whether its jumping off a ledge or trying to hit someone or something is just dreadfull. Leading to 15 minute long choreography of two guys trying to hit eachother with a sledgehammer.  (whilst still screaming "dont hit me man im friendly")\n\nIt reminds me of the tv series Lost where after a while you stop believing that there ever will be a solution to earlier issues and accept the endless stream of new stuff they add as changing the subject to make you forget about earlier suggestions. Now im in some shed looking at a pristine tire repair kit for a tire that should go on a truck that i havent seen around since a YEAR ago when it was first added.  Same goes for Chainsaws, bayonets etc etc.\n\nA constant stream of new weapons must please some people who can still believe. Wow we get to fire an SVD? that would be great. Although the SKS we allready had in the game could do the exact same trick if the game engine would allow for some proper firing mechanics.\nAnd realistic player movements I might add. Dayz's equivalent of BunnyHopping is shaking your mouse from left to right whilst running. This will cause your player to run in an very unrealistic zigzag patern. Combined with the 3 second delay in a person going through the three steps needed to get to aiming down the sight from 3rd person mode this will make it impossible to kill an unarmed pregnant woman from 5 meters away with a full clip of a handgun.\n\nLots of smaller bugs, glitches, and unrealistic choises i could put on the simulation takeing itself too seriously. Its not a good engine... not a very comfortable menusystem so dont make me go into my inventory to individually pull one shotgun shell out of my dual barreled shotgun in order to stick two new ones in. THATS WHAT A RELOAD KEY IS FOR.\nIn real life i can eat a banana and still shoot ♥♥♥♥ cheneys lawyer in the face with a gun at the same time.\n\nNo more clicking on the 'I agree that you have made a game that isnt finish so i hereby promise to not ever ask any questions' for me while starting the game.\n\nPeople dont buy it...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robertcoleman/recommended/221100/","robertcoleman","rob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robertcoleman/","160 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm not a DayZ diehard fan and this standalone version is my first experience with it.  So this will be a 100% unbiased objective review of the game as it is in December 2013, priced at $30, WITH the knowledge that I'm playing the game in its Alpha stage and lots of changes will be implemented in the future.\n\nPROS:\n\nThere's a real sense of danger in exploring towns, terrifying/exciting when you've collected lots of valuable food, medicine, weapons and you finally run into one or more other people and you don't know if you should (a) run; (b) hide; (c) fight; (d) try to communicate.  Exploration is fun and running long distances isn't even boring because you're always on your toes thinking about your food/water necessities, hoping you make it to a town that hasn't been looted so you can replenish your supplies and not die of dehydration in the next hour.  All that is really fun.  Even playing for hours without seeing another soul is fun because you're kept in a state of desperation/fear so that even looting a first aid kit (or the mythical can opener) out of a vacant house feels like a huge victory.\n\nAlso, the game world (post-Soviet Union hinterlands of Russia) looks very good.  It has a massive scale that games like Skyrim could only wish for.  Climbing a hill to see an abandoned Russian city below you in the distance feels like so much opportunity (and danger).  Running through a forest feels like the first time I ran through the forests of Cyrodiil in Oblivion.  Beautiful and a great feeling that you're immersed in "nature."\n\nCONS:\n\nThe engine is poorly optimized.  It seems the main perpetrator is the ArmA II engine's horrible occlusion culling problem:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/1thpsp/dayz_alpha_gpucpu_utilization_issue_video/\n\nThis is an issue that probably cannot ever be fixed, Alpha or not.  So as good as the game looks, it doesn't look good enough to warrant how poorly it runs.  I have a computer that plays Far Cry 3 maxed out without a hitch and this game brings my computer to its knees. Playing on medium-ish settings I get 30 fps with dips down to 10-15 in towns.  That is pretty standard for most people, regardless of settings, due to the occlusion culling problem.\n\nAnimations are terrible and glitchy and will screw you up and betray you when you need to make quick moves.  Controls are unnecessarily complicated.  Some people will praise them as being realistic, but they're extremely unintuitive and cumbersome.  Very frustrating.  For example, before you can shoot a gun you have to (1) equip it; (2) select it as your active item which will un-sling the weapon off your shoulder (this is a lengthy and really slow animation); (3) then LIFT it up.  If you want to actually aim it instead of hip firing there's a 4th step where you raise it up to your shoulder and peer down iron sights.\n\nA process like that wouldn't be a big deal if the animations weren't horrendously slow/glitchy and the controls' responsiveness was quick and crisp.  But actions have to be repeated because the command doesn't go through for whatever reason, then you get actions queued up and you can easily end up in this traffic jam of animations where you're trying to do one thing but your character is still in the process of completing actions you wanted him to do 4 or 5 seconds ago.  It's all extremely frustrating and combat is horrendous overall.  It's a HUGE problem when you don't feel like you're in control of your character in a survival FPS where your life hangs in the balance at every moment.\n\nFighting in melee is terrible.  Sound effects give almost no indication that you're doing anything.  They're delayed as well.  Zombie animations are laughable and it's hard to even tell if you're being hit sometimes.\n\nAnd there's no jump option, which is pretty stupid.  You're making a game that's supposed to be "realistic", using a realistic base game (ArmA) but you can't jump???  The "step over" function is not equivalent to a jump function in any way, shape, or form.  If I'm at full sprint running from a zombie and there's a 1 foot tall fence in my way, I want to just leap over the fence and keep going.  But Day Z makes you come to a complete stop and "step over", one foot at a time, before you can keep going. I could write a book on how awful the animations in this game are.  The engine just doesn't support what the developers want the game to be.\n\nAlso, you'll come to realize is how nonthreatening, pointless, and inconsequential the entire "zombie" facet of the game is.  They're relatively harmless, oblivious, and you can run away from them easily.  Once you have a gun they might as well not even exist.  They're a complete afterthought and not one second of any zombie encounter I had in Day Z elicited 1/100th of the thrills I had running from and fighting zombies in games like L4D2.\n\nOn a final note, and I don't know if this is still the case, there are pretty consistent connection problems right now also probably due to the fact that DayZ likes to keep your computer informed of every single thing happening anywhere on the server at any given second. So careful playing this if you're on a data cap.  Seriously.  Do some research on this before you buy.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nDon't touch this unless you're a dedicated fan that just lives for the atmosphere/experience of surviving in the wilderness.  The controls/animations/graphics are gamebreakingly bad.  Animations will be improved as development progresses, but for now, they're unacceptably awful.  The framerate problems are probably unfixable and if you pay for this game, do so with this warning in mind. Vision/atmosphere/theory get A+; execution of that vision gets a D-.","December 19, 2013","false","41.9"," 1,763 of 2,658 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","763","2","0","109"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/221100/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","952 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA post-apocalyptic survival horror. The game has no story-line/plot/linearity, you just start as a thirsty individual that needs to look for supplies or else you die. The zombies are annoying, and can cause trouble if you're not careful, but what you should really worry about is other players, but there are benevolent people out there who help those in need, which shows me how empathetic people can really be. So I see it more as a post-apocalyptic survival thriller. With all this having been said, please enjoy my review.\n\n\n\n\nReviewing DayZ at this point in time is probably unfair, mostly because the game is in ALPHA. Developer says game is only 20% finished, that means we have 80% worth of game to still see.\nEither way I decided to review it now, then re-doing the review when the full game is released (which won't be for a while). The game has bugs, glitches, the game may crash sometimes, and this all comes with some incredible moments where one gets an observational point of view into human interactions, as well as cool gaming moments.\n\nThere are many things one can do in the game, though maybe not right away. In DayZ surviving with newly acquired gear is what matters. Be it Zs, or be it a group of newly spawned Bambis (new players) punching you to death while you're eating or bandaging up, or be it a bandit you never even saw because he shot you from behind from really far away. There are also things one thinks one can do, like jump from a roughly 8 feet high roof. You will break your leg(s). Think you can eat rotten fruit and live to tell the tale? Maybe, but you will be sick the whole time. The bugs and glitches themselves can also kill you. Climbing to the top of a ladder for example: you may be standing away from the foot hold, and on top of the ladder, only to fall and die at the bottom of the ladder.\n\nSurvive. With. The acquired. Gear.\n\nAfter you know how to take care of yourself, who to trust and who not to trust, and how not to be an idiot, you may start doing cool stuff. Take a fully geared group, who have nothing else to do but blow up gas-stations. Yesterday, a group was doing that to each gas-station on the map, I could hear almost every single one exploding in the distance. Another cool thing you get to do is overpower a single guy with your group, for killing one of the people in your group for example. Cuff him, take his things, make him stand on the street and run, only to be killed by the so-called 'firing squad'.\n\nWhether you should get this game or not is up to personal taste and if you have patience. If you're not patient and you just want to do cool stuff right away or shoot at anything and everything that you see, this game might not be for you. This game is only for you if you're okay with playing it until the full release and put up with all the glitches, bugs and crashes that it comes with. Seriously, patience is one of the things one needs the most, just as much as time, this game is time consuming, mostly because vehicles aren't in the game yet, one has to run through the whole map.\n\nNow, if you like loot, this game might be for you, it is extremely loot-orientated. To survive you need food, to find food you have to loot, simple enough.\n\nThe animations are clunky, the physics aren't fully there yet whatsoever, and a portion of the planned features are not there yet (like Hunting, Interactive Environment[like cutting down a tree], Building Things, Vehicular Transport, etc...). But this game is still amazing, tapping into one of the most basic forms of human behaviour: surviving, which is composed of two of the three things that the human brain will always notice first, Food and Danger (the third one is sex but obviously that's not in this picture). This is one of the most interesting games ever released, in my opinion at least. Quite the social experiment, seeing what the player's actions represent about society.","February 2, 2014","true","65.7"," 78 of 95 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","78","95","0","8"

Before I "review" this scam game, I will personally note the lack of game hours I have invested.  The lack of hours is due to the fact that the five or 6 times that I did try to get into this game, I ran into game breaking bugs and the worst of the worst gaming community within 5 minutes.\n\nFirstly, let's point out the fact that this game has been in early access for nearly two years now and the fact that it was a stand alone from a game idea that already existed.  I hear that the old arma II mod is still better, and that's just sad.  The game has seen little to no improvements or additions, apart from clothing, since I bought it over a year ago.  I remember logging into it 14 months ago and thinking... "REALLY?!  Where is the hype coming from?"  I then logged in a few weeks ago and thought "REALLY?!  Nothing has changed."  The game-play is clunky, the graphics are poorly optimized, and the 'Z' part of the title still doesn't work.  How can a zombie game, that is two years into ea, have the worst zombies AI and mechanics currently on the market?  The title of the game should be DayP.  Simple as that.\n\nThe first time I laughed myself off the game was when I first encountered a zombie.  I was "looting" a small town when this happened. -- I say "looting" because there was absolutely nothing to loot in the first 10 buildings I came across. -- I then hear a zombie breathing outside of the house, so I head out there to bash its brains in with the only thing I had managed to find: a monkey wrench.  As I proceeded to smash the zombie in the head, or at least I think I was, there  was zero indication that I was making contact, the zed just stood there.  After another 10 seconds of swinging at the incorporeal zombie, it finally took notice to me and began attacking me.  As I swung into the nothingness that was the zombie's hit-box, I slowly took damage until I was dead.  I logged back in a few months later  and experienced the exact same thing again.  FYI, it wasn't lag or my computer.  I was choosing low ping servers and my comp is a beast.\n\nA few months later yet again I log in to be immediately shot in the legs by someone who was trolling new players.  After talking to him for a bit, while I bled out helplessly, about how he was giving the game a bad name, he just laughed and bantered me with derogatory names until I died.\n\nMy next try, a few months later, ended with a zombie running through a wall and killing me.  I think this was  after the devs had removed the zombies from the game  to "fix" them.\n\nI proceeded to call the game a joke on the forums, and I was banned within the hour.\n\nThat about sums up my time with DayZ DayP.\n\n- Crap zombies in a  zombies game.\n- Crap  community in a multiplayer game.\n- Crap devs in an early access game.\n- And just about crap everything else too.\n\nDO NOT GIVE THEM MONEY\n\n$35 at that!  That's twice the asking price of most ea games, and more than some COMPLETE games.","August 10, 2015","false","2.0"," 108 of 141 people (77%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","77","108","141","12","19"

PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS OF GAME"\n\nOK, I get that, but that's no excuse for what has happened with this game. I bought DayZ about a year ago and really enjoyed it. A ton of people were playing, it was actually difficult to survive, and I had to consider how to approach somebody because they might not be so friendly. There were some bugs, like zombies clipping and janky hitboxes, but I still enjoyed the game and made a handful of good steam friends.\n\nIf anything, DayZ has made backwards progress since I got the game in October, 2015. The playerbase is terrible and you can usually count on every player that you find trying to kill you on sight. Why? Bohemia removed zombies from their zombie survival game months ago, plus "surviving" became easy as ♥♥♥♥. The only thing to do in this game is kill other players. Everything that made this game a zombie survival game is gone, it's just a buggy fps on an oversized map.\n\nAs far as performance and gameplay issues, barely any of the bugs have been fixed. In fact there are many more bugs and exploits now then there were a year ago. I understand that the game is in early access but that doesn't excuse the embarassing lack of progress. With each update you can count on the game running worse than it did before, even on my PC that exceeds the recommended specs. And what do these updates add? Jack ♥♥♥♥. You'll wait several months for the next update only to find that none of the issues have been fixed and all they've done is move loot spawns around, change minor mechanics that were really already fine, and add a few new items that rarely change gameplay for the better. There's never any real progress like the inconsistent status reports promise.\n\nI strongly suggest that you don't buy this game. I really wish that it was improving, but there are so many things that are fundamentally wrong with DayZ, and the incompetent and lazy team behind it hold the game back from ever getting to where everyone hoped.","December 6, 2015","false","164.0"," 101 of 131 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","101","131","2","0"

Have\nyou also noticed that DayZ is never on sale all that\noften? but when it is on sale it's always only 15% off.\nThe game has sold over 3+ million copies and most\nlikely made millions of $$$ in the process, you would\nthink that they would hire more workers or pick up\nthe paste a little with updates, right? But then again,\ni don't know much about making games but if i did...\ni would certainly be faster than them, that's for sure.\n\nMy advice is to not buy this game... at least not until\nthe devs prove they aren't just wasting our money away\nand or not just sitting with there thumbs up there A$$.\nDon't get me wrong, this game is a lot of fun and has\nhuge potential... if it weren't for the stability problems\nand hackers and crashes and the constant shooting on\nsight controversy (trust issues you see)\n\nDayZ - 4/10","February 9","false","66.2"," 92 of 118 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","92","118","7","4"

They keep saying the new engine will be out but i have waited too damn long, I have moved on to other more promising games that offer a much more promising results. Poor management and not focusing on the core dynamics of the game have made me given up hope. I dont care about all the new guns they have added to the game... add them later and focus your efforts elsewhere.\n\nIf you really liked this game i would check out "Escape from tarkov" this game looks to be on point and they actually give people an insite of what the hell their money has gone to. unlike Dayz who just takes and shows nothing behind the scenes.\nHope this review helps.

I gave it a lot of time and tried it over and over after increasingly long periods of time.\n\nTried it again after what feels like a year and sadly nothing changed. It's still poorly optimized, full of bugs, there's nothing to do in the game. You still have to guess how to do everything, I spent around an hour trying to find a zombie to see if they fixed the mechanics but... I couldn't find one. Did they just remove them instead of fixing? I spent all the time looting everything on my way and I still died of dehydration because there was nothing in all the houses and I did travel a long way and got past a few villages.\n\nInstead of being a precursor for the zombie sim genre it's now - considering the speed this game is being developed with - years away from other titles.\n\nI can't recommend this, I feel like I wasted my money and this game will never be brought to a playable and most importantly - fun - state. I know I didn't get too much into the game but you shouldn't have to try hard to have fun or find if the games development is even moving forward...\n\nThe biggest change for me was the graphics because I have a new PC since I last played it, which was nice but also sad.\n\nI feel like if this game ever gets properly finished no one will want to play it anyway.","December 11, 2015","false","17.7"," 101 of 132 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","101","132","4","17"

I put over 350 hours into this game, but some of the major problems with the game just aren't being addressed. The UI is still a buggy mess, lag still plagues this game, frequent disconnects, players rubber banding all over the place, the game is not optimized at all, and the framerate can sometimes drop so low that you'd have to measure in seconds per frame rather than frames per second.\n\nYou'd have to have a pretty beefy computer to run this game well. Otherwise you'll have to sacrifice either graphics or framerate. Sacrificing graphics means the game looks so horribly pixilated that you can't really see. Sacrificing framerate means you can't react in time to anything going on around you.\n\nThe game plays fairly decently for me when there are no other players around. When they are around, my framerate drops significantly. I really want to like this game and I really want to recommend it, but in its current state I simply can't.\n\nPlus, there's no zombies... in a zombie themed game.","October 13, 2015","false","385.9"," 58 of 66 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","58","66","0","1"

I bought this game back in October of last year. I love zombie games, so I was really following the zombie survival strain. DayZ(the mod for ARMA) I had watched so many videos of and it sounded so perfect. Open world. Role playing. Survival. Zombies. A game were you might actually be afraid to die! So I bought into the standalone. It was in Alpha I understood. The meele combat was horrible. Everything felt laggy. The game was POORLY optimized. But I accepted that played a few hours got killed by a random bandit and put the game down to await for more progress. Now, nearly one year later, the game...looks..practically the same? Animations still look jerky. Meele combat is sill...ugh. It seems a little disapointing when you compare DayZ to H1Z1.. or even the DayZ Arma 3 mod (yes I watch Frankie). Even UNTURNED. A game made by 1 teenager ALONE has made more progress than DayZ. Like when I look at the progress Unturned has made over the past year, and compare to the progress of DayZ...\n\nI mean someone who played Unturned a year ago and decides to play today can login and WOA. They can IMMEDIATLY see TONS of improvment! This guy is actually WORKING! I logged into DayZ and I scratched my head wondering what they've done for the past year. (Yes I occasionally read the status updates). What I'm saying is when you can grab someone who hasn't played this game for a year, throw them back in and ask them what seems new to them and they just shrug their shoulders and maybe point out a thing or two. That seems like really bad progress for a proffesional team compared to just one teenager working alone on his game.\n\nAm I saying Unturned is a better Zombie Survival game? No.\nHas Unturned made much more satisfactory progress in the past year than DayZ? Yes.","September 23, 2015","false","15.3"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","54","60","5","0"

The ARMA 2 mod was riddled with bugs and although this is in alpha, it's also riddled with bugs that are even worse. Everyone will say obviously an alpha game will have bugs, but it's going to be a long time coming for fixes if his previous deadlines are anything to go on.\n\nI can honestly say after a year and half of development Dean and his bunch of morons have done absolutely nothing, if anything they've made the game worse. All he seems to have done is add a handful of items; that hardly improve emmersion from the old mod. They haven't fixed any of the major bugs from the old mod and the player to player interaction that he strived for is non-existant.\n\nDean brags about how many zombies he can get on a server, and it will not affect user PC and server PC performance, well I can say that is an outright load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The built up areas suffer for FPS compared to more open areas and smaller towns and when he claims to be able to add 3000+ zombies onto a single server, well I can say thats not going to be an enjoyable experience for either server hosting or user parties.\n\nEven the user interface is amateur looking, I could knock up a better interface in a few hours on photoshop and make it look more appealing and professional.\n\nI'm suprised Bohoemia haven't put more resources towards the game as the selling capability of a good zombie survival game are huge as there is absolutely no competition. The price tag of £20 is a total rip off as well, I was expecting a £10 starting price for the game and I can say £20 is not worth it at all for what you get.\n\nSo after a year late game that is far from finished I can confirm Dean is a useless ♥♥♥♥ that has the wrong intentions and ideas to develop a game. I just wish Bohemia had taken over with the development as they would be much further along in the development and I could speculate it would contain much less bugs.\nTo round everything off nicely, I can say I do not recommend this game to anyone.","December 29, 2013","false","45.8"," 232 of 337 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","232","337","0","4"

For those unfamiliar with this, dayz mod came before this title, and was 1000% better. However minor a role I played in this, I was proud to be a part of it. Fast forward a year and 90% of my fellow staff had quit due to needless abuse from the then lead Dev Dean "Rocket" Hall. We were spending hours of our day devoted to keeping his game alive, and he ♥♥♥♥ all over us. The marketing campaign for this was out and out lies. Rediculous promises of features even they could only dream of. For the fist 6 months of this games creation, Rocket spent traveling promoting the game. Spewing lies and creating hype for features that he knew he could not achieve. He then immediately took a trip to climb mount everest using money from a loan he took out, knowing he could pay it back with revenue from dayz standalone. Upon his return he announced his departure from bohemia interactive and left to "Create things of his own". Left after banking 2.9 MILLION dollars in the first week of sales. Not only did he wipe his ♥♥♥♥ with his lower end staff, he then made sure with a safety wipe of the whole community. The result at this point, 2.5 years later is a game with 1/10 the features the mod had. There are "zombie survival" mods out there for arma 3 that FAR outshine this, and I strongly advise you to play those instead. It really does pain me to see the mostly positive tag attatched to this game.","April 3","false","181.5"," 70 of 86 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","70","86","4","3"

If ever there was a thesis written on hubris in the games industry, this would make a great case study. Essentially, it abused the EA model and used it,, as a cash cow. What BI have done with the millions of gamer's money remains a mystery? Day Z currently resembles an indie game. This despite massive resources, advanced in good faith by an unsuspecting gaming public.\n\nThe entire enterprise has been plagued by incompetence and mismanagement. No doubt, the initial success and hype caused poor judgement . One does not have to delve too far to unearth it. The use of an outdated DX9 engine has made the game all but unplayable . The renderer is far behind BI's own public schedule. The AI is a joke and the UI, even worse. A plethora of other promised content has also failed to appear. Those that have, remain largely broken.\n\nPlayers are increasingly joining its founder, Dean Hall, and abandoning the game. Steam numbers gives testament to that . The arrogance of the developers is all too apparent. There is little appetite to engage with Alpha participants and their input, all but unwelcome. Dissent in their forums is not tolerated. A Stalinist level of censorship is enforced with a hair-trigger ban hammer. One would be forgiven for drawing parallels with another ill fated game, War Z.\n\nIn summary the project is fast running out of time and its players , out of patience.

So let me write it down in points.\n\nBad:\n-Not optimized (low FPS which is causing headaches)\n-Broken features (Even after they were "fixed")\n-Takes ages (It's very rare to see some patch)\n-Broken engine (Random deaths, leg breaking... DON'T USE STAIRS - one of the two could happen)\n-Zombies (AI is very bad and their hitbox is horrible... Sometimes you them hit in the head and sometimes you hit them in the leg, even though you were aiming at their head... Sometimes they die from 1 hit sometimes from 5... They can hit you trough walls or from 1st floor to 2nd floor, they can also walk trough walls and door)\n-Item ruining (it would be ok... In fact its a great feature... BUT... Zombie hits you once, Jacket, pants = ruined. You get shot in the head, pants get ruined... But everything else including helmet remains in great condition. It would appear that most of the time your pants get ruined... Maybe your character gets very scared ? Or you get diarrhea from all the stuff you're eating ?\n\nYes... You should expect bugs and issues... It's in alpha. However, for almost 3 years now.\nAnd updates are not as frequent and big as you would expect them to be after all that time between their releases.\n\nGood:\n-Loot variety (if you can find some that is)\n-Vehicles (Although they can drive underwater and are indestructible)\n-Weapons and upgrades (Military/Top grade stuff is rare and best items are found near rare helicrashes.)\n-Features like Hunting, cooking, fishing, crafting (A bit broken but not gamebraking)\n-Map and military camps placement (some are good some are badly placed or the good ones removed)\n-PvP - one of the few things that work relatively good.

I love this game, I won't lie, but at the same time I hate it. I've had a lot of fun with this game, especially with the PVE part of the game. My friends and I will go on empty servers and we'll set up a base, and try to survive in the woods. Getting the gear you need takes a VERY long time, but its extrememly rewarding. Well, until you have a months worth of gear and you log on one day to find out the game decided to wipe everything out of your inventory/world.\n\nThe community is extremely trigger happy, don't expect to team up with anyone, because they'll most likely shoot you on sight, or backstab you when you find good gear.\n\nAs for development, its understandably slow because they're working with the ArmA engine, which is notorious for being absolute ♥♥♥♥. People need to realize this, instead of throwing a tantrum and blaming Dean Hall for everything.  The DayZ team is in the process (and is almost done) of making a new engine, and when its done, performance should skyrocket, development should speed up quite a bit, and the game should get back on track.\n\nBasically, if you're thinking about buying the game, wait until the new engine is implemented. Once that happens I will change my review to reflect on the change.","July 22, 2015","false","125.4"," 67 of 84 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","67","84","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spartan1ben/recommended/221100/","spartan1ben","Helix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spartan1ben/","345 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDayZ mod stands out as one of the most thrilling, scary, and immersive chapters in my gaming hobby. The challenges were great, and despite bugs, the game felt more real that many AAA titles. Death carried weight, and it lingered everywhere.\nBut hackers, unfortunately, drove off the majority of the community. Can't really beat people who mass-kill all players on a server, or spawn in thermal, auto-aiming .50 cal rifles.\n\nSo Dean Hall and his team decided to rebuild DayZ on a heavily modified game engine from scratch. After countless failures to manage expectations, funding, and time, Hall's inadequacy as a project manager left its mark on this game--permanently.\nDayZ standalone is one of the worst games I've ever put my money on, and it makes me sad that Steam's refund policy wasn't around back then. Loot spawns on the map are poorly spaced, player movement and aiming are WORSE than before, and zombies are essentially not even part of the game. They aren't a threat and they are scarce. Server and game stability are a joke, and the graphics settings in the engine are tragic.\nHall, realizing the utter failures he and his team had wrought, abandoned the project. And that tells you all that you need to know. Some die-hard fans will argue "It's still in-development!" and such. They are right, and typically it's worth considering such things. But with DayZ standalone it's not just superficial design and balance errors that riddle the game. The deficiencies and poor design choices run deep into the core planning and structuring behind the game and its engine.\n\nDayZ standalone is unlikely to ever turn into a worthy experience. No matter what you've heard about all the old exciting days of DayZ, you're better off snoozing to the countless, aimless and dull Twitch.tv DayZ streams. Watch the game in action for yourself. Or get back into DayZ MOD. It's not as good as it once was since the community favors deathmatch servers with blackhawk helicopters, ghillie suits, and military weapons galore rather than hardcore survival with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ farm/old-war weapons...but it's far better than this.","September 29, 2015","false","164.6"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","46","51","4","0"

That being "Hey I haven't play this game in a while so the problems have to be fixed and besides its a survival game with zombies. Can it get any cooler?" That's a big mistake on my part. I start off with a fresh character and within a few hours of collecting supplies and equipment, I have died from some ridiculous event and leave my computer in a rage. Some of my encounters include my character breaking his legs and dying from a 5 foot drop and zombies rubber banding and clawing at my character as I despirately try to attack them with my axe while slowly bleeding to death. This game has been out for roughly two years in Beta... It will never be out of Beta. The only improvement I have seen in the two years of playing this game is the zombies now do not deny the laws of matter and run through walls and doors which is an undenyable improvement.

I know the roadmap was a basic idea for the layout of the game and not a set thing. But the roadmap they initally started with gave a lot of people hope that this game would get a lot better within reasonable time. I bought this being a fan of Arma2 Dayz mod (which is a lot better than the standalone) And i was very sad after putting in a little time into it. I stopped playing it probably after a week of the release. Waited 3 months for updates, tried it again. Still the same thing. Waited probably another 6 months to play it. Installed the updates and still was not satisfied. I probably didnt play it for a year, just playing the Dayz Mod instead. came back after a year and it was still badly optimized, glitchy as balls, invisible hackers, invisible player glitch. So many game breaking bugs after so long. Yeah i get it that its in early access, so is Ark, H1z1, just to give an example of some playable early access games. The whole point of this is, dont buy this game. You will regret it. If you want a true Dayz experience buy Arma2 + Operation Arrowhead and play the mod.","April 18","false","140.6"," 119 of 167 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","119","167","4","6"

I played for nearly 4 hours, running city to city, running in and helping the occational naked, and then I came up on a military base (The one south east of NWAF) and saw someone running around with gear. I ran up infront of the barracks he was in and layed down with a scope aimed at head level, he never ran out into the open, so I ran to the side and saw him in the 3rd room, so I ran to the window behind him and he was gone, ran in cleared the entire barracks and turned out he combat logged, so already sad about that, (Part of the story, not something that needed fixed) I ran around looting the rest of the base, and then went into the jail. 5 steps in to the jail I found an engraved 1911 with a full mag, thinking I was just lucky, I ran into the back room to see what else I could find, where I was shot in the head from somewhere inside the walls, by an exploiter/hacker.

Standalone is absolutely horrible compared to any of them.  Rocket (Standalone dev and original DayZ mod creator) will be leaving, which I believe will send this game to the pile of all the other abandoned Early Access games. And that really sucks too, because DayZ can be lots of fun, that is when you aren't constantly getting killing on sight by troll bandits, which btw are a large part of the community.  As far as content, Standalone has SO little variety, and yes it is early access, I get that, but it is inferior to DayZ mod. Also Standalone does not support custom maps or client sided mods ( idk if it is planned, check their website if custom maps or clients side mods like sound mods if those are your thing). Anyways, I will probably recommend DayZ Standalone IF it adds more content like weaps and vehicles to feel like there is a good variety. Sadly in its current state, I cannot recommend it unless you are absolutely dying (no pun intended) to try it out.","January 5, 2015","false","20.4"," 68 of 87 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","68","87","0","0"

For a mod, it was tons of fun, and had a lot of potential. It then become a standalone game, and the early access alpha version of this was released on the 16th December 2013, and it looked quite decent, despite being in early access.\n\nEverything seemed like it was going well in the beginning, but 17 months later and very little development progress has been made. For the entirety of it's release, it has been considered a 'Walking Simulator' by many, and that is essentially what it is. There's very little to do other than walk and kill the occasional zombie. As you can imagine, it gets extremely boring after playing for a short period of time.\n\nThe fact the game isn't even in beta yet is absolutely ridiculous. I get that games can take a long time to develop, but there has been so little progress throughout the time it's been available for purchase that I believe the development team is just lazy and doesn't care much. Not to mention, they're greedy - they upped the cost in order to use the previous price as a sale price!\n\nIt's also very poorly optimized and a lot of users with perfectly decent machines are unable to run it properly, even with low graphic settings.\n\nThat said, there is one positive about the current state of DayZ - the players. While messing around on various different servers, you're bound to meet some interesting people, some of which can be absolutely hilarious. However, funny people on online multiplayer is certainly not a valid reason to recommend a game.\n\nTo sum it up: DayZ has been in early access alpha with very little progress for way too long, there's very little to do besides walk, and the developers are greedy. It has the potential to become a pretty good game eventually, but I'm not the slightest bit impressed with how it's been handled since release. 2/10.","April 6, 2015","false","3.6"," 47 of 55 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","47","55","0","0"

This story is about a lil Rocket that could.  But like with any rocket, eventually it runs out of gas.\n\nThe year, 2012 and the space program was all but annihilated.  No one was innovating anything.   The scene was desolate and lacking innovation.  Then this lil rocket came out of nowhere and took us all on a journey.   He seemed like he could carry millions of us, and millions did want in and got in.  It was a thing of beauty.  There was griping among the passengers about the destination but overall, all seemed well.\n\nThen came our first stop and the rocket needed to be refurbished to ensure it can continue the journey.  Everyone was really excited and behind the refurb, including myself.   Years passed by, it seemed like we would never get off this planet and truthfully, it was becoming a bit stale.   Not the planet itself but the things you could do on it.\n\nNow, finally, the rocket seemed flight worthy once again so we launched.   It was a bumpy lift off but aside from a few things it was smooth sailing or so it seemed.   Partly through the trip most realized this rocket was a former shell of it's original glory.   Sure there was clothing and food albeit no ♥♥♥♥ing can openers but there was warm socks and knit caps... some of us were content.  But that some, was few and far between.\n\nThen out of nowhere the rocket started dying and let us know that a super cruiser would be picking us up and he was gonna go into the great beyond for his next adventure.\n\nNow, the super cruiser is OK but it lacks the personal feel that we all had when we were struggling on the fledging rocket.\n\nI feel like we are going into some indescribable void and it is empty and lacking any character.  There will probably be a surprise at the end where they enslave us all for their evil bidding.\n\n","January 10, 2015","false","428.6"," 77 of 103 people (75%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","75","77","103","22","9"

It wasn't relatively hard to pick up, the gameplay was simple, and it had a very generous amount of loot and zombies. Those factors meant that while it often got you geared way too quickly (servers spawning you with a battalion's worth in equipment) the simplicity gave you more room to just play. There were heroes, traders, wanderers, bandits, and a ton of people eeking out a different experience. In fact, DayZ mod was probably more fun in its light rp aspect than its survival one, interacting, fighting, or joining up with other people.\n\nDayZ Standalone does little of the above.\n\nSo, I'll start by comparing the standalone to aspects of the mod.\n\nHow difficult is it to learn to play? Well, the learning curve isn't really any bigger or smaller, you'll still need an external guide or two to learn advanced aspects, but you should be able to get around when you first set out. So in this regard it may be an improvement over the mod, if only for inventory management and crafting.\n\nI don't normally care about graphics unless they enhance or ruin immersion, and DayZ standalone is one of those cases. The mod (obviously) used Arma 2 graphics, which, while somewhat dated now, still get the job done. Raining and misty fog? it does it well. Sunny day? Yep, got that too. With the standalone:\n\nRoses are grey.\n\nViolets are grey.\n\nGrass is grey.\n\nThe f*cking sun is grey.\n\nSunrays are grey.\n\nThe sky is grey.\n\nTrees are grey.\n\nDirt is grey.\n\nFood is grey.\n\nShoes are grey.\n\nSunglasses are grey.\n\nWater is grey.\n\nAll items are grey.\n\nNeon objects are grey.\n\nBright clothes are grey.\n\nGuns are grey.\n\nBullets are grey.\n\nFlowers are grey.\n\nSnipars is grey.\n\nMountain dew would be grey.\n\nYou are grey.\n\nZombies are grey.\n\nBlood is grey.\n\nMy poem is grey.\n\nI couldn't resist, but it's true, there is something going on with the lighting system that makes everything dull and faded. Since we are in a post soviet country and there are zombies, obviously it is realistic for everything to be grey. Russian countries don't get sunlight, you know? It kills immersion, the environment always looks the same, the only time it doesn't is at night. In fact night time is sort of a relief because everything should be grey under those conditions.\n\nAlright, what about gameplay? Want to know? Have you ever pressed w for 7 hours? you played dayz to the point you can't refund it without even knowing you were doing that. Actually that's not true, I forgot to add in you die at the end of that pointless 7 hour finger exercise. You walked a lot in the mod too, but it wasn't pointless. In the mod you could look at your surroundings, being alert for players and wild animals to hunt, or you could just casually stroll through a zombie horde like some macho-man survivor. And at the end of your journey was normally a location to loot, a decent reward for your fairly dangerous travels. The standalone has neither. The most danger you'll have is looking for food at a gas station, the dangerous doors can kill you.\n\nLoot and zombies are nearly non-existent, more so for the latter than the former. I see why they made loot rarer in the standalone, many times a mod server would up the loot spawns or spawn you with tons of gear, and it made the gameplay less worthwhile. Vanilla mod servers; however, had a decent spawn rate, in my opinion, items weren't always there, but you wouldn't have to circle chernarus 10 times and waste a whole day tediously looking for higher tier gear, as you have to here. Zombies are barely in the game, 10-15 of them across the whole map on a server isn't exaggerated, in fact that may be inflating the actual zombie numbers. You'll see one zombie in a major town if you're lucky. Many have said they are kept low due to bugs, but in my rare zombie encounters, the only danger is their jumps. Lag may be an issue, but I do recall them populating a server with 10,000 zombies in videos before the steam release.\n\nAnd not surprisingly, the light Role play the mod had does not exist here. The extent of player interaction is to use each other as practice targets. Due to a lower quantity of loot, players kill each other to find their kills didn't have any more gear than they did. At least that's what it was in the start. Now, everyone is so used to just shooting before being shot that kill on sight is mandatory, don't even try to work together, it isn't going to happen. You need to stay alive so you can enjoy the greyness this game provides you. This is the greatest downfall, there are no heroes. No bandits. No survivors. No traders. No repair-men. No hunters. Just deathmatcher's, and can they really be blamed? there's nothing else do to. DayZ Standalone just doesn't have enough content by way of features and gameplay options, and the present ones are tedious. Fixing a truck is boring, it takes so long. Making a farm is a thing I guess, as is hunting, but they aren't exactly a source of entertainment now, are they? In their attempts to move away from the noob servers of the mod they ended up making a crappy deathmatch. And who wants to play CoD deathmatch across a 164 square kilometer map with 15 people, walking for 3 hours to get a kill. It sounds like ♥♥♥♥, and it is ♥♥♥♥.

It went from being fun and playable in 2013, to being total garbage in 2015. It's buggy as hell, unable to pick up random items when the game decides, dissapearing weapons, random sounds of gates opening and people drinking. The lag on this game is unbelevable. I can play pretty much most games on ultra or high settings with no lag, and this one i feel like i'm getting vertigo when i am turning around. Oh, don't worry though, you can improve this by turning the settings down to 16BIT. Yay.\n\nUpdates are becoming increasingly rare and when they do occur, they add in a crappy new gun instead of fixing the glaring huge all consuming mistakes in the games engine and play. They have made literally millions from this game because the playerbase believed that it would be similar to the ARMA 2 mod in terms of performance, but have regular updates and it's own direction. Instead, the developers cashed in on having an early access label and now is left on the side of the road like a rotting hedgehog. It's literally the only game i have encountered that has got worse with each update.\n\nIf you like FPS multiplayer killing people, try H1Z1 battle royale mode which is fun. Both project zomboid and 7 days to die are also fun working games that are updated regularly and make this one look like a total embarassment.\n\nIn summary,  Do not buy it.","August 31, 2015","false","136.8"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","36","38","0","3"

My framerate was poor, despite running medium settings and SLI GTX 780s. There was mouselag, mouse acceleration that I could not disable, and it took quite some time in the options menu before I could figure out some basic controls.\n\nMeanwhile, my character stood in the pitch darkness. I was on a beach. The moon was rising slowly at my back, over the water. I could hear the sound of the waves. A subtle text prompt indicated that I was thirsty. If I squinted into the distance (Right Mouse) I could see the outline of some buildings.\n\nBuildings could mean loot... Or zombies... Or worse: Other players. But I was thirsty, and I had nothing. No equipment. I could not survive if I did not find food, water, and something to defend myself with. I walked (Shift) slowly towards the buildings, their features becoming slightly clearer as the moon rose higher.\n\nEvery few steps I paused, and listened. It took me almost twenty minutes to cover the approximately one hundred metres from my starting location to the edge of the group of buildings. Once there, I hugged walls and furtively leaned around corners (Q, E). Always pausing, always listening.\n\nThere was nothing of value - I checked a small wooden shed, several doorways, some locked. I crept inside a building, but could see absolutely nothing in the darkness, so retreated back outside. Another building nearby had windows facing the moon - I entered, and could make out some beds.\n\nMethodically I searched from bed to bed, looking for anthing of value. I was literally groping in the darkness. That's when I heard them. Footsteps. Something walking. A zombie? I was paralysed with fear. Would they come inside? Probably not, I reasoned: They would wander around between the buildings.\n\nThen the footsteps stopped. I looked to each of the windows in turn, the moon would make a clear silouhette if something was there. Nothing. They started again, it fits and starts. Then I realised: No moaning, no growling, no gurgling. It must be another player.\n\nThe fear I felt at knowing another human being was poking around the same building was too much. I quit the game, like a little baby. I tried to reassure myself that the half an hour I had promised I would limit myself to was up, but in reality I knew that DayZ and just scared the crap out of me.\n\nThis game is a technical mess. That does not matter. Even in this unfinished, broken state, it is a superlative and seminal gaming achievement. You must play it: Do not hesitate.

Any intresting mechanics (e.g. crafting, etc.), nothing...all that devs added is useless fishing and gardening. I wouldn't say it's completly useless if your backpack wasn't filled with 15 cans of beans all the time. The update progress is really slow and devs spend too much time polishing and retexturing items...while serious problems (zombies cliping through walls all the time, bugs, glitches) stays untouched.\nMy personal worst experience - after 0.46 the game crashes after every 10 minutes. With a little googling I found out, that there are tons of players with same problem....unfortunately there is no fix for it yet (and there was already 6 updates since then)\nThere is no meaning in this game at current state...you just get full gear (in 20 minutes if you are a little familiar with map) and end up shooting other players...pointless.\nDo yourself a favor and don't buy this game untill it's completly finished.

You know a games a failure when the mod (epoch) that wasnt even made by dean hall  is more fun than the standalone.\n\nDevelopment started in August of 2012 (1130 days ago). Dean Hall announced they planned to release alpha in November of that year. However there was many delays in development leading to a barebones Alpha release on December 16 of 2013 (642 days ago). so after 488 days of development they had a barebones game. Still now 642 days later after this alpha release the game is still ♥♥♥♥ with the same problems, Also they did not develop an engine from scratch they just combined Arma 2 and Arma 3's engines as a way to save money as it would have cost them extra money to develop a new optimized and solid engine to create one of the most hyped games of all time. now tell me why their game is still ♥♥♥♥ after 1130 days of development like what the ♥♥♥♥. they could have at least put in helicopters by now or fixed the zombies walking through walls and random game crashes and the horrible FPS. Everything about this game is just garbage and a failure. the only reason it sold so many copies is directly due to its reputation in the Arma community as being one of the best mods ever to be played. May i also add the Epoch Mod has made a lot more progress in the development of their Arma 3 mod than the entire Dayz Standalone development? So let’s face the fact that this game was going to be an all-time great but due to how cheap Bohemia was with development and lack of leadership in the company they let this game turn into a 4 year or longer project that is still broken and has made little progress besides their small accomplishments that made no sense when main aspects of the game were missing. example "1000s different character items" when they still only have a few vehicles that work and main features such as base building, modding support, Air vehicles, optimization, Working AI, Proper hit detection, are all still broken or not even close to being implemented.

I was in the Jail cell on the side closer to the storage units, I walked to the room upstairs to look for some goodies that I could shoot people with. After I finished searching I went downstairs to look through a second room, that's when I saw him, a man with an accent (Let's call him Alehandro) he was rich in gear and Mosin ammo, Mosin is short for Mosin Nagant a sniper rifle as soon as we saw each other we both ran into seperate rooms, he ran into the one upstairs and I into the one on the first floor. I had this urge to run up there and shoot him. I had a shotgun which could have had his name on it. I hesitated and instead of going upstairs and shooting him I spoke to him "I'm friendly I'm friendly" I said. His response was an unatural one for a game like DayZ. "I'm friendly too" Alehandro said. To make up for my hesitation of not killing him earlier I asked him if he wanted bullets I was going to make a pun about giving him bullets to the face he asked for sks ammo so I went upstairs knowing that I did not have any. Again I did not kill my new friend Alehandro. Later we exited the building with both of us unharmed. I thought to myself as he was leaving, "how could I falter in my murderous ability I've seen so much Dexter I can do this" so I tried yet again. As Alehandro was running towards the Radio tower I took out my Mosin, I aimed my sights at Alehandro's head and steadied them. But alas, I was unable to kill him. I put my gun down and started walking away. That's when I heard 5 M4A1 shots, at first I thought they were aimed at me. I soon realized they were shot from farther away. I looked at my friend Alehandro he was not alive anymore. I tried finding the shooter and then I did. I aimed at him and fired, I was not going to let him kill my new friend and continue his pathetic life. And then I recieved a shocking realization, my gun wasn't loaded, I had to make a decision, either stay, reload, and have an enormous chance of being shot down like Alehandro, or run away. I chose the one that prolonged my life. I ran and I ran then I reached Chernogorsk, as I was walking down the main road in front of the main factory I saw a truck, filled with two people, moving towards me. The driver hadn't seen me yet so I hid behind a wall north of the factory, When they passed me I shot them so they would pull over I wanted to steal their vehicle and luckly they did. The driver dropped off his friend who ran into a building near a water pump. I chased his friend into the building but the doors were all opened and I knew I wouldn't be able to find him like this. So I ran back outside and tried killing the driver with a CR75 pistol I had. I don't know if I hit the driver or not because he drove away after I fired the first few shots. So I turned around hoping I could run away but I saw his friend. He was a new spawn and I pitied him. I thought to myself that suicide is something I might not fail at. So I got on my knees, put my gun on my head, looked straight at him, and fired. He called me a "Badass" as I died which made me feel like a success. This is the end of my story about friendship, disbelief in ones murderous ability, and death.\n\nSo basically what I'm saying is buy the damn game.","December 25, 2014","true","83.2"," 164 of 246 people (67%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","67","164","246","79","8"

Although ER, it was a more polished version (even though lacking in majority of weapons, vehicles, etc), but once they started "patching" things, they more just started smearing actual ♥♥♥♥ all over the programming of this game.

The Devs added in new items that appealed to me. But now... as people have said before, I never thought that Devs could ruin a possibly fantastic game. Of course, I'm not hating on DayZ, I like it, but not as much as I did before the recent update. Lets get movement out of the way first...\n\nHo-ly sh*t... I never thought that a game could be as badly optimized as DayZ is, and this has been a problem for me since day 1. Jesus, the movment is just.. awful. It isn't smooth and it is annoying to use. For example, you want to crouch? Okay just press your assigned Crouch button like 10 times before you finally crouch. You want to stand back up? F*ck you. - from game...\n\nAnyway, moving on to the worst part about DayZ, the zombies, ironically. My God, the zombies in the old update were dumb and predictable. Predictable meaning you could actually see when and/or what attacks they're about to do, which was an okay mechanic I guess, well it would be if the melee system didn't suck d*ck.\n\nTo continue, in the latest update of DayZ, were the zombies made smarter, or maybe some variety in their attacks?? F*CK NO. The zombies are still dumber than ever, and this time they were updated to be faster in their attacks, literally spamming move after move making your little new-spawn self sh*t his/her pants.\n\nI'm not joking when I say this, the zombies beat the SH*T out of you, they show no mercy. You want to run away? NOPE, they'll just follow you to the end of the map and back. What was that? You can go in a building and close the door? With the way the crap game controls, good luck with that, not to mention the zombies somehow hit you through the walls and doors. Another thing, you could be at least 3 or 4 metres away from a zombie, and somehow they still hit you.\n\nThose were the cons... of the new update I guess?\nThe Pros of the whole game?\nFinding good loot...\nFinding a car/truck now... Uhmm\nYou can.. shoot people I guess\n\nF*ck it, over the time is has taken me to write this sh*t review, I've grown to loathe the game.\n\nComing to PS4?

You could say it is a positive that they've managed to keep the essence of the gameplay from the mod so far, which is straight forward pvp with zombies around the town.\n\nThere are some negatives of course, AI pathfinding is still very poor,severe lag when interacting with the world, still very awkward melee combat, other various bugs on visual,sound and gameplay in general. I know all these can be excused as the game being in alpher and would be addressed and fixed by the time the game is officially released, and as alpha testers we have to find all these problems and report to the devs.\n\nI wouldn't recommend to buy DayZ Alpher at this point of time,because it's not yet a full game and I'm not too sure where this game is going.\n\nP.S.

I enjoyed it a lot. I defended it with my angry keyboard warrior methods, and whatnot. And it's still the same game I defended.\n\nWhich is EXACTLY the issue. DayZ is the exact same thing, and now they even cranked the price up, as if they didn't grab enough cash already. "Minecraft-principe" yeah, at least Minecraft improved. What does DayZ have to offer? They added in a Truck now. More than a YEAR after it came out, and people demanded it since the beginning. And like the vehicles, many other things people were asking for, like the fixing of major bug issues, that allowed players to go into walls, for example, or a way of looking through walls, haven't been fixed for months, until the Devs thought it may be time. But instead, they gave people new weapons! Hurray! Nobody wants weapons in a broken game. And even a simple thing, such as combat-logout, was possible as the game was released. It used to be a massive issue in the Mod, until they made it that the Character stays 30 seconds in the game, after you logged out. Why wouldn't you put that in the game in the first place? No it took them MONTHS to add that back in. A basic feature of the Mod since a long while.\n\nAnd they went as far as promising a Mod support right off the bat. Sadly, there never was a mod support on launch. "Later." "Soon." Those are the two magical words, with that the Devs justify everything.\n\n"Soon" will the bugs be fixed.\nAnd then they circlejerk over having tents in the game now.\n\nOh and don't forget the glorious excuse "BUT THIS IS EARLY ACCESS ALPHA, HURR DURR YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE BUYING INTO." Yes. I was fully aware I was buying an Alpha, but I thought there would be progress. It's been a year, the game is still the same thing. They added some towns on the map, wow. Great. But the Zombies are still ♥♥♥♥, bug-using is the only way to win in PVP, and everyone is duping anyway. What is the point?\n\nI am frustrated, I am angry.\nI payed 20 bucks for a game, that hasn't made any noticeable progress so far. It's not like I can throw around with money.\n\nI don't recommend this.\nWait unitl this game is either fully released and everyone is saying it's working.\nAnd even then, I don't think it would justify the 27 bucks they want for it right now.","November 30, 2014","false","88.3"," 58 of 76 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","58","76","0","11"

Why? Most of the time you'll be walking around the map for a few hours(3-5 hours min. in order to get some proper gear) and then, after  you've spent so much time, some 'tard with a shovel will bash your head in as you are spawning in.\n\nMost of the places you'll find will be looted to the ground, aside from some towns nobody ever checks, because people log out at one spot, and join another server because every server knows where you last were, so all the hotspots will either be camped by people or looted by 100 people before you.\n\nAlongside all of these, there are countless bugs which include, but are not limited to; Zombies running through doors, walls, ceilings, across 500m of you in 0.5 seconds.\nFalling to your death from 1ft height.\nBreaking your ankles, chest, neck, spine and knees whilst going down the stairs!\n\nAlso a notable part is, if you don't have friends who play the game, you might as well not play because it will make you depressed for sure, walking around 10h a day looking for loot and then finding a person that will kill you for your hard work? No thank you, I'd rather watch the Kardashians, ew.\n\nNot to mention that the game has been in alpha for a year, and now counting, the progress really is slow.\nUnless you count adding bananas, kiwis and apples to the game progress.\n\nIf you don't have a high-end gaming computer with at least 8-16GB of ram and 3+ Ghz, you shouldn't even try to play. I did, I can play, but when I shoot one bullet I feel like my PC is becoming hotter than the sun and more radioactive than the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl right now!\nJesus!\n\nWhat's the good thing?\n\nThat there are some smart people who don't trust early access games and spend 20€ on them like I did.\nI wish I could get a refund.\n\nSincerely, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of 2 year fan of the game, who is now leaving it.\nI feel sorry for you people that still play, but if you find enjoyment in it, go ahead.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\n29.8.2015\n\nDecided to try again, maybe they optimized it? Updated it?\nTook me about half an hour to join a server only to get kicked for session lost, not even ♥♥♥♥ing kidding.

They ♥♥♥♥ing took the zombies out. Out. Of this Zombie game.\n\nYes, there's an explanation from the (so called) developers. I think it's pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, there's no excuse for taking the zombies out of a zombie game.\n3 years ago, I fell in love with the DayZ mod for Arma2. I could not wait for the Standalone game. Now, 3 years later, it amazingly made a few big steps back. No matter what hardware you use, this game is going to run on low fps. Even when there still were zombies, they were much fewer than in the mod. I took it, no problem. Was fun, finally more houses to enter, finally a lot of clothing to find, finally mods for weapons. But that's it. Within these 3 years, that's basically everything they ♥♥♥♥ing did. Besides taking the zombies out of the game of course. This game is dead. I assume the so called "developement team" is one guy who designs a new pair of pants every few weeks, then, a few weeks later, takes them out again because they're too buggy. Like everything else in this game.\nMe and some friends have the theory that this whole DayZ standalone thing is a big sociologically experiment of some university. To see how much they can do to the players, without them giving up. I did it. Gave up. Don't make the mistake I did, don't even consider buying this game. Except of course, you are willing to buy almost 30$ for a Zombie game without Zombies, but with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs instead. Hell, 3/4 of the so called new invented features are useless. Seeds. ♥♥♥♥ing seeds. Oh, the rage.\n\nI recently began playing the mod version again, instantly calmed my wrath a bit. That's the ♥♥♥♥ you wanna play. So go buy Arma2 instead, and enjoy a really great Zombie apocalypse survival game.\n","December 10, 2015","false","195.9"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","45","56","5","1"

To say the least, I looked forward to the standalone.\n\nWhen it was released on Steam, I snagged it up and installed (sadly no friends were on at the time so i could not play with them). Immedietly I noticed how much smoother things were from the old Arma 2 OA version of DayZ. Everything has been vastly improved. Then the negative things arose, loot is the jankiest (if thats a word) I've seen. I ran around for a solid hour and was left with a can of pop and a screwdriver. Also no vehicles yet is a huge downside to the experience of DayZ. Understandable that the game IS in Alpha and I have no doubt these things will be fixed and the standalone will be improved.\n\nAs a conclusion, do I recommend DayZ? Yes (in the future), but No (as it is now). The full experience of DayZ in my opinion is much more achievable in the current add-on for Arma 2. For those of you that enjoy the game currently more power to you, when the game is more polished I'll be that dirty bandit with the sniper ready to kill you and your friends :P.","January 3, 2014","false","54.2"," 157 of 240 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","157","240","0","8"

Let me explain why.\n\nAt the game's moment in time, it's VERY unfriendly to computers- especially those with weak GPUs. No matter what they say about the recommended requirements, they are lies. This game is SUPER unoptimized at the moment and is just a ♥♥♥♥♥ to run. Even on my GTX 950 (also paired with some handy launch commands) it struggles to keep a steady 40 FPS at most times. Mind you that I keep the game on the lowest settings posible, and it has pretty harsh drops when you enter cities; mostly 20 FPS drops. I've also heard mention from AMD users that this game is just completely unplayable, so if you're running an AMD build, don't even consider buying this game until they debug the game and optimize it for both Intel and AMD hardware. While the devs ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON OPTIMIZATION, I still feel like these framerates should be ironed out already. Cities are still usually 20-30 FPS even with the -newui enabled and semi-low settings.\n\nAs far as newbies coming into the game, I think this game won't really appeal to them because of the fact that this game souly depends on the user doing his/her own research to figure out how the game works. There are no tutorial stages, no etiquitte, no instructions, nothing. The game forces you to go to the Steam User-Created Guides, or YouTube for help. Granted, this is how I got into the DayZ community on YouTube and Steam, I still think it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t how much I struggled at first- and how much I STILL struggle even with these 40+ hours on my account.\n\nThe community and players in the game can be both great, but also very negative at times. For example- I've met two players today, 1 of which was suicidal and wanted me to kill her (which I did), but the other guy... that guy, was the first friendly guy I've ever met. He was asking about a friend who radioed in earlier and asked if I knew where he should go. He was a good guy and I gave him some food (because he was a fresh spawn) and sent him on his way. Even though there ARE good people in this community, there can be a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥ who will kill at any cost. In the same day, I was killed from behind while drinking some water from a fountain. He gave me no warnings, didn't imprison me, nothing. Just a clean, straight kill from behind. I've also had a group of two kill me just for saying "Hi" in the chat.... So yeah...\n\nWith that being said about the community, I wish people had a little bit of ♥♥♥♥ing humanity. JUST A LITTLE BIT! I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've met up with some person on the side of the road just to have a short and friendly conversation with him/her and then he/she proceeds to hit me in the head once and i'm knocked out cold while they take all my gear that I worked so hard getting. This not only discourages me playing the game, but it makes me never ever want to go to high pop servers and kill EVERYONE I MEET ON SIGHT because I cannot trust ANYONE in this mother♥♥♥♥ing game. Call me crazy, sure, but when you realize that NO ONE IS EVER FRIENDLY, you'll never want to befriend ANYONE.\n\nBugs are riddled so much throughout this game. I know that the devs don't like to refer them as "bugs", but that's really what they are. I've lost so many characters because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs- I lost a recent month-old character because I walked up a flight of stairs and got desynced off and fell to my death. Desync is even worse in 0.59 now that it's stable. Regardless of desync, I still see the occasional hacker in the ground or some zed hit me randomly out of nowhere (sometimes even when there isn't a zed around, I'll randomly be attacked). Developers are still trying to fix these common issues that SHOULD have been fixed months- no, YEARS ago.\n\nThe game can just be more of a pain in the ♥♥♥ rather than be fun at times. I'll admit, I have fun playing this game, but I get anxiety because I'm afraid a person will jump me, either take me hostage and steal my ♥♥♥♥, or will kill me and loot me for all the ♥♥♥♥ that took me weeks, if not months to gather up. I have definitely gotten addicted to this game, dispite my newbie-ness and dispite all the issues I've come across. I still find some way to enjoy this game. I will DEFINITELY reccommend this game when it reaches an ACCEPTABLE STATE. Right now, it's just WAY too buggy and glitchy to even be considered a game.\n\nWait for this game to get into Beta/full retail release. 4/10","October 24, 2015","false","50.6"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","0"

I told him to face me, and not to do anything funny, or I would shoot him and make him bleed to death. He complied. So I told him to drink up. I kept forcefeeding what I told him was Water, but was disinfect spray. I then gave him some food. It was a rotten apple. He thanked me because he didn't know the evil I was doing. I then told him to crouch into the shed adjacent to us, and face the corner. I then stripped him of his clothes, and then proceeded to take his blood.

It slowly got ruined by hackers.\nI then heard about the Standalone Version being released and was excited, so as soon as it was released I purchased it.\n\nIt was fun, for about 30 minutes, it got boring simply because there were hardly any objects, guns without ammo, items that you could pick up but they had no meaning. Glitches all over, people shooting through walls, looking through walls.\nNow these "bugs" maybe fixed by now but it is the simple fact it is taking the development team ages to fix them.\n\nAnother Con is: Updating the game is taking forever, they update the game so slow you may as well just wait until it comes out of Alpha before you buy it.\nWith games like H1Z1 being released I suspect a lot of people will leave DayZ and play H1Z1 or other similar games because DayZ developers appear to be lazy and rolling in the profits they have made from DayZ.\n\n@@@EDIT@@@\nNow they have also deleted the NE Airfield, why???\nAdded a new town in the NE, why???\n\nThe Airfield at NE and the NW Airfield was one of the places to go if you wanted rare loot, or a good shoot out, now people don't go there because there's other towns, and of course NE Airfield is deleted.\n\nAre DayZ Developers trying to make the map have zero forests and just an entire city? Stop adding more towns, stop deleting Airfields and start adding more items, start fixing bugs, start giving items a reason for being in the game rather than some having no meaning.\n\n\n\nDon't buy it.\n\nYou'll be disappointed.\nI wish they'd stop editing the map, I liked the old Chernarus and just start making items have use, adding more weapons, adding more vehicles.\nMake it like the old mod, that was fun but as I said that got ruined by hackers.\n\nThanks.","February 6, 2015","false","143.5"," 77 of 109 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","77","109","6","13"

All the houses you check are empty, theres rarely any loot, except in a few set places where theres 100% good loot. oh, and also- you run into a town after said 10-20 minutes only to die to some camper then you gota run again for another 10-20 minutes.\n\nit doesnt feel rewarding at all, its buggy- you die randomly from nothing, it has a terrible engine and for your 27,99 euros you get a runing simulator.\n\nthis "game" is horrible in every way there is- i TRULY hope they fix the loot and running later on, i know theyll fix the loot, but for now its not worth your money.\n\nHOWEVER- if you want a game that has the same feel as dayZ but is 10 times better, and requires less runing for items to actually start playing the game- i suggest Arma 3, it has alot of really nice gamemodes that gets you right in the battle, so check that out instead, WAY more rewarding and fun,\n\n\nIF youre a Dayz fanboy you probably LOVE this game, its 100% runing around and 0% fun.

Seriously stop giving these people your money.\n\nPros:\n- Cool concept (Open world multiplayer zombie game)\n- Universal character save (You aren't locked to playing on one server. Everything transfers over)\n\nCons:\n- Terrible performance (gets worse with each update)\n- Terrible graphics\n- Broken loot economy (Items don't spawn where you think they would Ex: no millitary gear at a army base but an assault rifle in a warhouse? Either the same couple of loot keep spawning or nothing will spawn at all. Some towns will have literally 3 - 8 pieces of loot in them)\n- Terrible gaming community\n- Amatuer and unorganized developers (priotritizing adding more content compared to fixing the game)\n- Out of date engine (same engine BI engine used since early 2000's. It needs to be updated or scraped seriously)\n- Game breaking bugs and glitches (Zombies still ♥♥♥♥ing hit and walk through walls)\n- Terrible UI\n- Hackers/Poor anti-cheat\n- Everyone is a bandit meaning the game is basically one giant PVP match\n- Limited content/Useless content\n- Game is behind schedule (the devs cannot stay on track with their original development map)\n- Slow development time\n- Everyone kills on sight\n- Getting gear take forever compared to the mod\n- No incentive to be friendly to other people (In the mod you would get a new player skin and some bonuses depending on the server)\n- Vehicles are broken and very limited\n- Walking simulator 2013 - 2016\n- Game is nearly 3 years old and the community gets smaller and smaller\n- You can still die during loading screens\n- Melee weapons have been nerfed to uselessness (Fireaxe is 3 - 5 hits on a zombie?)\n- Game will propably be dead before launch\n- Literally one of the worst games I have ever played in my existance\n\nDayZ is the biggest scam on Steam and it's ridicoulous how the game is still able to be purchased.\n\nEdit: I have over 300+ hours on the DayZ mod and would reccomend you get that instead. There are several diffrent game modes you can try and they all get updated faster than this crap.\n\nAlso if you're just going to comment insults because my opinion of the game dosen't match yours then I'll just delete your comment. No one should care that much about a video game.","May 29","false","59.4"," 83 of 119 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","83","119","8","10"

Why is it always some prepubescent cretin with a terrible mic who tells me to kneel in front of their crotch and move my mouse back and forth so it looks like i'm fellating them? Not only do I feel like a goofus for getting caught, but now I just feel like an actual real-life creep for virtually performing oral sex on a minor.\n\nI just sit there thinking "This is my life. THIS, is what I am doing with my life right now." So then I become sad. Start thinking about life choices, and what I probably should be doing instead. Inevitably you stew in personal disappointment, because no one ever has positive moments of introspection or self-analysis. No one ever looks in the mirror and says "You know what, you're pretty good." Why not? Because from lies come the waterworks. With unparalleled immediacy. Standing there, crying all over the place. Watching intently like you're some sort of circus act, because such a display of pure human emotion is so alien to you, that the only way you know how to respond to it is with scorn and condemnation. If the capacity to hate others were the depth of the ocean, then the counterpart which is directed at yourself would make the Marianas Trench look like a newely formed puddle.\n\nBut, you know, meanwhile there is just this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kid who has no idea that he just caused a life-changing existential crisis to a stranger over the internet, of whom he decided to rob and sexually assault. So he'll just keep on keepin on, until a decade from now when life decides to take a dump on his chest while he's the one trying to relax, and play a game in a world where he gets to be somebody that matters.\n\n\nDayZ made me feel again. 10/10.\n","April 10, 2014","true","79.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","5"

Bought the game a couple of years ago and I thought "holy hot ♥♥♥♥♥ from hell, this is CRAP!!!", even though I had VERY low expectations since it was an early access alpha. Decided to wait for the devolpment to get a little further along.\n\nCame back to it a few days ago to see the progress (despite it still being early access alpha...WTF!?!?), and I must say, I'm actually quite amazed at what i saw. My reaction this time was "holy hot ♥♥♥♥♥ from hell, this is CRAP!!!". It seems like they have done absolutely NOTHING to the game in the two years or so that I didn't touch it.\n\nThe fact that they are still allowed to sell this is baffling to me, it is so clearly a scam, the developers have jumped ship. Or perhaps the have spend the vast amount of cash gained through early access sales to buy a small island in the carribean, that way the money has at least been put to SOME use.\n\nTL;DR:\nDo not buy this game! it will never reach a even sligtly playable state.\n\nUPDATE: So, since I had spent less than 30min ingame when i made this review, I gave it another shot, a real chance at proving itself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/death666saint/recommended/221100/","death666saint","Death666Saint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/death666saint/","542 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDayz is a post-apocalyptic infection ("zombie") simulator MMO. Unlike other MMO's the objective is not to get a high k/d ratio or rank your character up by gaining xp. Instead, it's all about the experiences. You can camp, hunt, fish, craft items, scavenge, and so much more - all with other players or solo. You can also handcuff players, break their bones, poison them, lock them in a room, bag their head, and force feed them (which is great when you find rotten food or disinfectant spray). It shows you how savage humans really are. How savage you really are\n\nThere are hundreds of bugs, glitches, and hours of just hiking through forests, yet I still come back for more. Why? Because it lets you experience unscripted adventures other games can't come close to providing. From torturous horror survival to scavenging with friends to clan wars. All very unpredictable\n\nLoot\n\nYou must find many items to survive in Dayz including clothing, backpacks, melee weapons, guns/ projectiles, ammo, gun attachments, food, and water. All of these items are randomly generated in different areas and are in random conditions (pristine, damaged, ruined)\nYou can craft many items from loot such as clothes, tools, and weapons by combining or destroying loot you find.\nOnce you start to memorize landmarks looting gets a lot easier. Knowing Russian will greatly benefit you because town and city names are in Russian\n\nPlayers\n\nOther than scavenging for loot the only other way of getting it is to find someone else who has the loot you want. You can either befriend them or attempt to rob them by killing or threatening them. This is where the fun of Dayz really sets in. People are very unpredictable and you never know what "adventures" they're going to take you on. You'll interact with 5 different kinds of players: Kill On Sight (KOS), Back Stabbing, Clan, Friendly, and Server Bouncing players\n\n*KOS: Players who kill anyone they come in contact with. If they see you, no matter how far you are from them, they open fire or swing at you - even if you have no loot\n\n*Back Stabbing: Players who act friendly at first but eventually rob and/ or kill you. They'll get you to trust them by sharing supplies, saying they're friendly, or accept your offer of a truce. Once your guard is down they'll cripple you, knock you out, handcuff you, kill you, or threaten you for your supplies. Sometimes they will even keep you as a slave\n\n*Clan: These players are either playing with their friends or found a clan that accepted them into their group. They normally travel in groups but may have a scout travel a clique in front of them. Scouts may not tell you their group is on their way and may try to stall you while their comrades catch up. Clans intentions are always different; they may be friendly, murderous thieves, trigger happy killers, kidnappers, or thieves with nonlethal intentions. In your adventures in Dayz you may find yourself in the crossfire between clans, be offered to join a group, or become one of their slaves\n\n*Friendly: Don't shoot or threaten you right away. Some may aim at you and tell you not to move, but only until they've made sure you're not going to kill them. They may share their supplies with you, tell you where more supplies are at, invite you to join their group, or join you for an adventure\n\n*Server Bouncing: These players are mostly just for the loot. Unlike most players they don't stay on one server for long. Once they find a good location and take all the loot they want from it they will quit out of that server and join a new one to loot from that same area. They will quit the game if they feel threatened - which really sucks if you are like me and like to mess with other players (read the last paragraph)\n\nZombies\n\nThe zombies are very buggy but used to be a lot worse. They used to run right through walls and doors which quickly made Dayz very frustrating. Now you can lock them in rooms.\nThe best way to deal with them is to either use an ax or a gun; most of the time it takes one hit of an ax or one well placed gunshot to kill them.\nNote: They are a little OP compared to players.\n\nVehicles\nOnly one so far but it already has made the game so much better. Traveling no longer takes hours!\nMaintenance is still being implemented but when they're completed you'll have to fix them up, find missing or busted parts, and fill them up with gas every so often\n\nMap\n\nVery large with many towns, cities, airfields, military bases, and forests. Nicely populated. Vehicles make great use of its size\n\nFriends, Spawning, and Respawning\n\nDayz is one of the most fun games to play with your friends - if you can find them. This game is meant to be realistic and that means not being able to choose where you spawn. You will spawn in random locations and so will your friends. You cannot just join a friends game and spawn next to them, you must find them.\nAnother flaw is that you can only respawn if your character goes unconscious or dies. That means if you break your leg you will have to find someone to help or kill you, craft a splint to fix it, get up high to fall to your death, or you can wait until you die of starvation, dehydration, or hypothermia. It also sucks when your character is not healthy, whether it's from starving, bleeding, hypothermia, or poison, because the screen will start to lose color which makes it very depressing, and it takes quite a while to get "colorfully healthy" again\nNote: Servers restart every so many hours and when they do you lose connection and must rejoin a game. Joining a new server has a 60 second count down, and respawning after dying has a 30 second count down\n\nGraphics/ Performance\n\nHas a decent amount of settings. Despite how great this game looks it can a b!tch to run smooth enough to play. I have to play in 1600x900 resolution, tweak its cfg file, and use a few commands or it has too low of a framerate (avg of 15-40fps w/out fixes, 30-55fps with) and that's with an nvidia 780 3gb gpu, 16gbs ram, i5 3.0Ghz cpu, and with it installed on an SSD\n\nControls\n\nThe controls are great. Beginners may feel overwhelmed at first because there are so many actions to memorize, but every one of them is useful. Hold Alt to look around with only your head, hold right click to zoom in, tap to look down sights; tab is inventory, and space is to bring up your weapon or lower it. F keys are for hand gestures and sitting down\n\nCombat\n\nMelee could use some work (bad desync) but gunplay is amazing. Sniping is very satisfying because there is bullet drop. There is also anatomic targeting which means where you hit players matter. Head and chest shots kill or knock out. Limb breaks bones and can knock out\n\nUpdates\n\nDayz updates quite frequently and the dev's blog daily about progress of new content including clothing, weapons, zombies, animals, landmarks, loot, animations, weather, and much more\n\nMy Best Rounds\n\n*Looting a house when someone snuck up behind me and said "don't move or you're dead". I didn't move and he handcuffed me. He went on to force feed me rotten apples, then beat me with a bat. My leg broke and he unhandcuffed me to watch me crawl around until he got bored. Beat me unconscious, then shot me dead\n\n*I spotted some poor sonuvab!tch running through the mountains and got a shot at his leg. He went down but stayed conscious and tried shooting me with his pistol. My leg got hit and I went unconscious. When I woke I saw him crawling towards me. I pulled out my pistol but miss with my only shot. He took aim and nails my face\n\n*Scavenged an airfield at night. Opened the jail building and there were 8 guys (four kneeling, four standing behind them) all armed with rifles aimed at me. Next 3 hours went like this: handcuffs, bagged head, beatings, broken bones, force feeding, poisoning, bullet wounds, knock out, patch up, repeat","September 28, 2014","true","77.9"," 81 of 118 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","81","118","0","4"

Look at their Facebook page. They literally have update their page once every 4 months usually with irrelevant slop. They posted a pic with weed captioned smoke weed everyday. And another update they posted a picture of a poorly rendered semi nude old decrepit woman. Dean Hall is a manipulator who used a fake interest in Dayz to swindle many steam users to pay for his own greed. He ran like a coward rat grease on face cheese in little hands. Wish I could get a refund on this pile or get a couple minutes face to face with Dean Hall, give him a couple hooks to that long rat snout of hers.

After a few moments I looked round and saw that the fighting had ended, and thought this would be a good opportunity to get some food, I went closer to the dead bodies lying on the ground, there was one person alive, looting the bodies, I couldn't take the chance so I smacked him over the head with my machete, killing him instantly, I looted the bodies, but no food, I hit an all time low as I was starving to death, and cut one of the bodies up, harvested the flesh and ran into a house where I ate raw human, I'm not proud. Afterwards I continued wandering and eventually got home, I turned on DayZ and played it.
