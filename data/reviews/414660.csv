Who is behind this?\n\nVampires Legends is based apparently on a true story, though I didn't check the facts. The plot is perhaps basic but well, at least, the bonus chapter is kinda a twist and while Rose, the woman featured in the header, is a minor character, she's still important for the plot. Unfortunately, it lacks of Artifex Mundi's creativity. Indeed, the game is published by them and done by another studio. I found rather annoying your partner, however, I loved how Stefan was everywhere at one moment, I even suspected him as the culprit.\n\nBut I loved the bonus chapter! It was kinda different from the main story as you were seeing past scenes. It would have been great to have that during the whole game.\n\nThe gameplay is the standard one: HO scenes, puzzles, items to pick... While the HO scenes are easy, some puzzles made me sweat a lot - but I suspect that I wasn't in the right mood for that (real life reasons interfered). However, while the hint system is classic, I found it very original as it's your partner (or Rose in the bonus chapter)\n\nThe graphics are good, as I loved that kind of atmosphere (gloomy, tragic and mysterious, a tendency to go to the dark side of the Force if I may say it like that) for HOG. The soundtrack is correct.\n\nThe game isn't perhaps the game of the year published by Artifex Mundi or hasn't the same quality of any game developed by them, but it's still very enjoyable and one of the best in my opinion about vampires in the HO world that I've played.","December 4, 2015","true","3.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The user interface looks dated, the animations are cheap, and the voice acting tends to be incredibly amateurish. Even the game mechanics are barebones and never go past simple hidden object scenes and the most basic puzzles.\n\nThe premise also has a bad vibe at first: using vampires and a standard small village location often ends in cheap, predictable, Z-grade plot lines. Yet this is the part where the game gets good.\nFirst off, unlike most HOGs, we have a duo of investigators as protagonists, who are trying to get to the bottom of some strange attacks at a remote Serbian village. Their constant banter eliminates all possible sense of desolation, and it is also a good tool to slowly unravel the mystery. Yes, it is obviously about a vampire, but the presentation still manages to build it up. So much so, that the game has a really long bonus chapter, where it wraps up everything in a clever (albeit predictable) way.","May 27","true","5.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

As usual, the story is pretty basic and the atmosphere isn't bad but still I kept wishing for more here. Also, I kept wishing for more of a mystery here than there truly was but that's usually the case when it comes to HoG's.  Some of the puzzles were quite cleverly done and they definitely blend well into the storyline, none of them feel too terribly out of place. Overall, it's not a bad little HoG, but I definitely don't think it stands up to some of the others overall.\n\nHowever, what I really have to applaud is the "bonus adventure" which ended up feeling more like a mini point and click open world aventure at times (although short) rather than HoG and was very well done. I always love returning back to the original locations that you see in the base game in the bonus adventures, and this was no different and was done in a very clever way and even opened up a few new locations.  I thought the adventuring in this portion was a lot better and the storytelling was well done.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's worth it if it's on sale, only because it's so short and definitely not as beautiful as some of the other offerings out there. Here's my ratings:\n\nStoryline: 3/10 - Basic storyline - tis is on a scale of HoG games, not all games in general.\nPuzzles: 6/10 - Some creative sparks here that I enjoyed.\nAtmosphere: 5/10 - I truly wish this would have been slightly more scary or moody!\nScenery/Graphics/Illustration: 6/10\nBonus Adventure: 7/10\n\nA few random thoughts for good measure:\n\n- Seriously, what is a spud bar?\n- She clicks sea shells by the sea shore (or river) until the sea shells solved themselves randomly, thank goodness.\n- That rat getting that thing was a bit far fetched, where can I get rats like that?\n- Also that is the weirdest towel rack I have ever seen.\n- The intro screen is fabulous, wish the entire game looked like that!\n- This is apparantely based on a "true" story and a real village: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petar_Blagojevich\n- Finally, I would totally play a game that was just the string puzzle.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vardulon/recommended/414660/","Vardulon","vardulon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vardulon/","1973 products in account","So take the title with a grain of salt. In the first place, I'm relatively certain that whatever happened in Kisilova, there were fewer sliding block puzzles involved than the game would suggest. Still, the game presents an intriguing premise - people are dying in a remote village, vampires are blamed, and it's the job of some Viennese bureaucrats to get to the bottom of the mystery. Unfortunately, the bottom is beneath a huge pile of mediocre hidden object screens.\n\nCriteria 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?\n\nIt's terrible. Every surface in the game is piled with random nonsense for no discernible reason and with no apparent theme. Yes, the titular village is worried about a vampire, but that's no reason to start dumping assorted garbage and priceless antiques on every flat surface. At least the game is decent about keeping the items in question from being too anachronistic - it's set in the early 18th century, after all, so the occasional piece of plastic is incredibly out of place. Rodin's 'The Thinker' even makes a brief cameo, despite being sculpted two hundred years after the game takes place.\n\nCriteria 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?\n\nIt's 12:1 screens this time around, with the player asked to sift through fairly generic locations - dungeons, graveyards, kitchens - for predictably bland items. I would be less hard on the game's HOSs if any attempt was made to link to the story at all. I would even be kinder to them if they were just a little better designed. The graphics are unattractive at best, and while there's not a huge clash in art styles between environment and the items, almost no care was put into the screen layouts. Size and gravity cheating abound, with too-large or too-small items placed randomly around the screen to little effect.\n\nCriteria 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?\n\nThe story is a simple enough affair - there's a murderer running around, making life hell for the inhabitants of Kisilova, the player has to figure out who the vampire is and deal with them. This is accomplished through a decent number of HOSs and some fairly simple puzzles. While the HOSs may not be up to snuff, the puzzles fit the setting quite nicely, reinforcing the myth that old Europe was filled with lockmakers who had entirely too much time on their hands. Also, the villain, who only became a vampire months earlier, seems to have gone all in on their new identity, hiring someone to craft an unbelievably on-point vampire-themed door lock.\n\nVampire Legends is harmless enough - it's not especially long, and the plot has a decent resolution in the bonus chapter. There's just nothing special here, and even the core gameplay is presented without flair or creativity. The most interesting part about the game are the bonus features, which include photos of the present-day Kisilova, and interviews with Serbian government officials about the true events upon which the game's story is based. The 'based on a true story' thing may be a stretch, but it's fundamentally the best thing the game has going for it.","May 13","true","2.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/414660/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1583 products in account","Take a journey back in time to an age of superstition and mysticism. Vampire Legends is a tale of, you guessed it, vampires. Set in the small town of Kisilova, the story revolves around the deaths of the villagers at the hands of a cloaked assailant. The basis of the game is in actual events, the real town of Kisilova had an issue with deaths of townspeople and they blamed it on a vampire. Though I highly doubt such was the case, people in the 1700′s were quick to explain the unexplained with tales of creatures from the darkness. This mystery makes for great material for the game’s story.\n\nThe game takes historic liberties to enhance said story. You play an unnamed character accompanying Frombald as he investigates the mysterious deaths in Kisilova who brushes it off as probably a disease. It doesn’t take long for things to go wrong, your carriage gets damaged and your carriage driver goes missing and then the dead bodies start to pile up. Don’t get attached to anyone in the game, chances are they’ll end up dead. The chaos seems to revolve around a young woman named Rose who has become the object of the vampire’s obsession. It’s up to you and Frombald to protect her and save the town from the evil presence.\n\nMixed in with the intriguing tale of vampires is a very well made hidden object game. The artwork is beautiful and all the scenes are well made, the items are visible enough to be found without squinting. There are also mini games added that offer up more of a challenge, some even to the point of frustrating me. However, nothing new or innovated has been added, it plays well but is very cut and dry. The only different part is at the end of the bonus chapter when you’re actually given a choice, each of which results in a different ending.\n\nMy favorite part of the game was the story, but it also has everything else going for it as well. I’m a sucker for vampire stories so I played the whole thing in one sitting which probably leads to my own complaint about the game, it’s a little short. I’d say it took about four hours or so to complete and that’s including the bonus chapter that I played twice. But it’s a great game so I enjoyed every moment of that time. It also has trading cards and achievements on Steam if you fancy those. I highly recommend adding this game to your library.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","December 28, 2015","true","4.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

However, why do developers of these games still stick to a 4:3 resolution, than stretch the image on 16:9 screens? Awful.

It’s far from breaking ground amongst other Hidden Object games, and veterans of the genre won’t see anything they haven’t seen before. But unless you’ve got some high standards, you’re bound to enjoy this title.\n\nThe year is 1725, and Europe is still licking its wounds after the Black Death. However, most are wracked with paranoia, fearing that disease is soon to strike again. In the tiny town of Kisilova, just on the border of Serbia, reports claimed that nine people have died within the span of a single week. Their deaths can be compared to no other and, fearing the worst, you are sent with a fellow investigator to Kisilova, determined to root out the source of the mystery. But it isn’t long before you realize that there’s no plague ravaging this place… yet something far worse.\n\nThe story does a great job of reeling you in with its constant foreboding nature and atmosphere. I was genuinely eager to unravel the story and solve the mystery. There are a handful of characters, but most don’t go beyond their skin-deep personalities. Had the setting and conflict not been as great as it was, the story would’ve fallen face first.\n\nThe artwork is top notch. Anything from murky swamplands to decrepit castles, all boasting their own shadowy corners and flickering lights. Some backdrops look picturesque, and this game’s soundtrack - which is both simple and very fitting - works heavily in their favor.  The heart and effort put into this artwork is evident, and stands as a major plus in Vampire Legend’s overall quality.\n\nSeeing as how this is a Hidden Object game, most would expect a variety of Hidden Object scenarios. Thankfully, there are, and they all look as detailed as you’d expect. They don’t stray outside the box or do anything too original, but they get the job done. There’s also a ton of mini games, and I mean a TON of them. I’m aware that mini games are commonplace in Hidden Object adventures, but Jesus, Vampire Legends goes way overboard. Way too many of these, and they often hinder the story’s pacing. On the other hand, they are skipable (Thank God).\n\nVoice acting is… pretty terrible. Some are clearly better than others, but none can be classified as “good.” What dialogue there is gets the point across, but it won’t be winning any rewards. It really is a shame, because some pro voice talent would’ve seriously improved Vampire Legends' presentation.\n\nLastly, despite the story being as gripping as it is, its outcome is very predictable. By the midpoint, anyone with a crumb for a brain should know who the vampire is. The ending is unsatisfying, and the game’s bonus chapter does little to build up a proper conclusion.\n\nHad Vampire Legends’ artwork and Hidden Object sections not been of this quality, I really couldn’t recommend it. But, in all honesty, I enjoyed my time with this title, and if you’re looking for a campy, by-the-books HOG, this should quench your desires.","December 29, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And seek games that where not as standard as one would normally find. Now also, i find the second ending rather more ambitious as other games of this ilk. All in all a fun game to while away a few hours and in grin in a recognition of darkness towards the end. I would hoist a glass ofwine to the nature of this game, but I don't drink wine........","May 21","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
