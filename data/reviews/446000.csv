I like the concept.\n\nOverall Scope & Feel: Its "just right" for what I want out of a grande strategic 4x game\n\nUI: As with all games, you have to get used to it but it works very well.\n\nArt & Graphics: Simple but effective. I like the look of it.\n\nMechanics: Core game works and is elegant & efficient.\n\nFleet Managment: This is good. I like the feel and scope of fleet deployment and management. Most enjoyable part of the game for me.\n\nFun Factor: I have found my time with the game quite enjoyable. Having to think about proper allocation of forces to meet threats, advance, etc..\n\nIntrigue and Politics: Much work to be done, but the core idea is good. A great deal of potential here and the core mechanics are already enjoyable.\n\nValue: There are those complaining about the price. I think its a fair value...I have gotten my money's worth out of it    already...Its cheaper than a two hour movie w/ refreshments...\n\nCons:\nFairly Plain Jane: Its a bare bones, early access game.  May features are not working, but it is EA, afterall.\n\nLove it or hate it: I think most 4x gamers will either love it or hate it, depending on what you want out of a 4x game. It is all about grande strategy with little economic/planet managment options.\n\nSpreadsheet game: Since it has minimal graphics, much of the game is about numbers, modifiers, etc.. This doesnt bother me, but may bother some. See comment above.","March 26","true","6.6"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","32","34","0","0"

With that said, as a fan of turn based wargaming and strategy, this has excellent promise to develop into a really solid title and the developer appears worthy of support, being very responsive in the forum (hopefully this may continue through to a successful final release - this is always the gamble for the earlier buyers).  I enjoy games by the likes of Paradox, Slitherine (Gary Grigsby games, etc), and this game fits the bill of a grand strategy game set in a massive universe.  You are the Emperor of an Empire (and you'll only ever play this character, as the developer has said this is purely a one player game, and playing as the Empire only).  As the Empire is massive, you'll have to make all the grand decisions, this means you'll hold courts with people visiting you and you making decisions, you have the power to fire staff at will, and you'll have to tell your ships where to fly to, direct where to explore (if you wish), and choose how to expand the Empire - which planets do you want to colonize?\n\nThis all sounds very promising, but there is a catch that may put many buyers off, the Alpha means key functions of the game are missing, and also means you are free to claim victory pretty much any time you like in this version. This doesn't put me off as I'm the ideal target market buyer for this game, so am happy to support its development and help the developer release this successfully.  It's well worth watching the forum so you can see all the Alpha issues people are having.\n\nOverall positives:\n\nVery nice atmosphere to the game, aided by nice background music.\n\nA beautiful 'grand strategy' game - 100's of unique planets to explore, colonize and fight over.\n\nBasic, but nice graphics and art, in my view (see screenshots).\n\nA randomized starting position each time, with randomized court etc.\n\nAt least 13 races vying for supremacy of the Universe.\n\nThe game is early access, but has not crashed once (how many EA have this stability, let alone fully developed games?).\n\nA game where you can pretty much click through all the turns without doing much, or look to manage things in a bit of detail (e.g. do you want to fire a governer? promote or demote someone in your court? change a planet defence priority? create a new squadron of ships? change tehnology focus?).\n\nThere will be a wide variety of scenarios to play, of around 9 difficulty levels.\n\nI actually dont mind the way battles work.  The battles are automated, all you do is click through the phases and watch the results, you can't influence the battles once they are joined.  But you get a nice battle log showing who attacked who, and the results, and you can graphically see bars on the screen above each squadron to show the strength change over time.  See the screen shots for samples of the battle screens.\n\nSome people will see these as a negative if buying into the Early Access Alpha:\n\nThere is very little by the way of tutorial, only a few '?' to click on throughout each screen.  Many of the functions of the game are therefore not clear yet.  But over time, this can surely develop and guides will start to appear.  I was worried at first I wouldn't enjoy the game because it would be too complex to self learn, but after 2 hours I'd say 50%+ of the features are understandable.  This may not be enough for many players.\n\n'many' features are not implemented, and some seem pretty key to the game, relating to diplomacy, reforms, resources, battle bonuses, rebellion, etc.  This is why the game can't yet be played fully.\n\nLots of features on many screens simply say 'test', and will be of no use to the general player, clearly, more features are to be implemented but not playable.\n\nSold currently at a higher price for the alpha state, yet if you wait until final release, you may well pick the game up cheaper.\n\nAfter playing, you'll be left with 'many' questions about gameplay, features, functions, etc.\n\nIn summary, as a grand strategy fan I have absolutely no regrets buying this game.  I love this game and it could be an all time favorite once fully developed.  If you buy now, you'll have to be prepared to stick out the development, but there is a gem of a strategy game in here somewhere which I very much look forward to experiencing the end result.  I've never had any interest in sci-fi, but this game just really appealed to me as a 'must buy'.  Watch the preview video on You Tube, and if you're half interested in buying this game, give it a go, I would say!   And wait for the full development.","March 18","true","2.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

Tired of designing ships and building farms? This game is for you! This game focuses on the higher-level stuff of being a newly-crowned Emperor in an expansive space empire, and it's just FANTASTIC so far.

I don't recommend a buy unless you're willing to wait for a more complete version and test the game.  Developers in this industry have been known to abandon projects.  Although it looks like the current developer is in this for the long haul, I have been fooled before.  If early access is no barrier to purchase for you, then read on and maybe consider supporting this developer.\n\nAlthough I haven't played much of this yet, I felt begrudgingly compelled to give a positive recommendation for what is here so far, which is mostly in concept and art direction.  I haven't been given a free copy or paid to do a review, so let's nip that idea in the bud right now.\n\nThe art is charming.  Not perfectly drawn, but a charming art style that carries the menu-driven gameplay.  Don't expect giant space battles ala Gratuitous Space Battles, or incredible animations.  This game is a menu-driven experience.\n\nThe skeleton for a cool space-opera-esque 4x is here, though.  The idea of less micromanagement in a game like this is fairly novel.  That you're playing the Emperor of a fledgling galactic Empire and only the Emperor, delegating the main thrust of your expansion to your subjects, is a very cool idea.\n\nI just completed a game at the lowest difficulty.  It was easy as it should've been, but not a total cakewalk even at that setting, but I'm not the best strategy player.  Mainly just moved forces back and forth until I took over enough planets, and played whack-a-disloyalist with my courtiers, officers, and governors.  The audience feature is a fun call-back to the advisors of Civilization games of past years, only your advisors are completely disposable.  If any of them get disloyal, banish/kill/dispose of them.  Ignore competency and corruption in these subjects.  Loyalty is the most important attribute.  Praising the Emperor is the most important activity.  Seriously though, when the rebellion features make it into the game, I suspect loyalty will be far more important.  Which is why I'm working on my whack-a-disloyalist skills now rather than regret it.\n\nTo sum up the early access preview, I think this game is going places.  I really enjoyed my first playthrough, and look forward to the game becoming more feature complete, but not too much.  The abstraction of this game is part of its charm.","April 4","true","7.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Like others, I wondered how true the non-micromanagement part of the game was and it lives up to its tag line.\n\nWhile I agree, the game is new and has many features untouched, I think there is great potential here.\n\nAs the Emperor, you make broad decisions during audience, colonizing a planet, production/research edicts, or sending a squadron to conquer a planet. The military is abstract in that you define what an average squadron's ship complement should look like and the AI does the rest.\n\nI expect the game and storylines to be fleshed out a little more with more decision input from the Emperor.\n\nThe only qualm I have so far is that officials who die of old age are hard to identify (only referenced by name but I have no idea who someone is based solely off of name).\n\nThis definitely plays like Crusader Kings II in space to an extent combined with a space 4X type game. I look forward to additional features and the final product!","March 14","true","3.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The tutorial well, is just bad. It is just a bunch of textboxes, and you get some tooltips after hovering over things. Managing officers is tedious, and still feels micromanagy for what the game is trying to acomplish. Exploration is slow, and I feel that the only way to expand is through war. Which brings me to combat, which feels still a bit to micromanagy (again, for what this game is claiming to be.) Looking through all of the officers, and buildling fleets and all that. Generally the finance, and industry system is a joke. You can only set taxes, and set "edicts" which is just saying what you want to prioratize to be made. I want the game to focus more on internal affairs, more groups then just rebels and pirates, different modifiers on happines, and a revamped finance system. I do like some things in the game, like how the AI is like the AI from Aurora 4x, and is only there to be there, not to beat you. Which is also I thign that I want to see more of, which is diplomacy.\nI still have some hopes for this game, the notes say it will be focusing more on the internal affairs, rebels, happines and all that, but I want to see more things on the finance. Also just general UI things, I want to be able to sift through all of the oficers to find the bad ones, have an independent diplomacy screen (with more diplomatic options,) and also be able to sift through all of the planets. But by far I want to see a better tutorial thing, which is the thing that I want to be implemented the most (lots of strategy games have trouble with this.) Scenario Tutorials and all that. I know designing those can be difficult, and sometimes I try them in other games, but still don't get the game (sometiems this happens, and I end up looking up how to videos on youtube.)\nAnyway, I kind of enjoyed the game, but as you can see I haven't been sinking hours into it, mostly just becasue the lack of content. I don't know though, maybe I just suck at it, but that would be becasue I don't understand anything because those really bad tutorials. This game is has a great idea, but I would try something else (The Last Federation comes to mind, it is also a super great strategy game not about micromanagment. For now, I would wait.","March 9","false","0.6"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","4"
