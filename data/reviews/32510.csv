I love the new lightsaber moves, like throwing it, but am sad they took out the chain of lightsaber moves like in LEGO® Star Wars®: The Complete Saga. :( Those moves were awesome. But I like it and the hub is so big! The character creator still doesn't have an option for changing your character's animation, possibly choosing from any character's. (I really hope this will be a feature in future LEGO® games... The Hobbit?...) It would be a BIG part of customizing your character. (They should add more body pieces to the creators too...) The front texture on the chest piece is pasted on the back when using some chest pieces in creating your own character, (may happen using any chest piece, not sure) after playing as that character in a level. But this game is lots of fun, worth getting. :)","December 27, 2013","true","333.7"," 77 of 87 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","77","87","0","0"

I am a huge star Wars fan and I love Lego Games. This game actually feels more like a Star Wars game than another Lego title. The locations are taken out  from the show and  look very Star Wars like. The only things that look like Lego are the Ships and characters but in terms of background it looks more like a Star Wars game. I recommend you to play this with a pad. With the keyboard it can get really frustrating. The music and sound efects are really good so are the new animations. They look a lot better that the ones from the complete Saga. Even for the full price I feel I have made a great purchase. This game never goes on sale buts its worth it.\n\nI highly recommend this title if you love Star Wars","November 8, 2014","true","12.6"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","51","56","4","0"

I tried out, and I didn't understand the battle mechanism, didn't understand the character switching, it was just so different from the LEGO® Star Wars™ - The Complete Saga.\n\nWhen this was on discount, I read all the reviews, I watched some gameplay footage, and I remembered how much I loved the Star Wars - Clone Wars series. And hell yes. This game is all about the series, the maps are the key episodes.\nAnd in my eyes the Clone Wars is not a cartoon, it is much more Star Wars than the sequel trilogy:\nwhen Ben Kenobi is talking to Luke about the great war, this is it! Yeah, Episode III also shows 1-2 battles, but this game IS the great war.\n\nThe maps are following the events of the series, amd after learning the unique technique of the game, you will enjoy it as much as any other LEGO games. Win battle in the space, siege the enemy base in the ground, and finish the map as following the original Clone Wars story. 10/10 would buy again.\nAnother LEGO game where I achieved 100%.

How well it does, I don't know, as I haven't regularly watched the show. It did, however, let me play through the very few parts of the show I remembered, so I'll have to leave how well it followed the show to the assumption that it does a decent job.\n\nAs for the level design, there are plenty of good levels in this game, but are sadly overshadowed by the abundance of strategic open battlefield levels. You have to destroy enemy bases and build your own. It's fun and makes for a great side activity to be included (as it did in the game's Republic Assault missions) but it's also put in place of some of the actual story missions which just seems a bit lazy to me.\n\nThe controls feel like the other Lego Star Wars games (I used a gamepad controller) but with what I would consider a major improvement. They removed the short combos from the previous games and replaced it with the ability to fight indefinitely. One thing I do miss, however, is the ability to use stronger lightsaber attacks by timing your next move instead of button mashing.\n\nOverall, I love this game but wouldn't give it a perfect score.","December 28, 2015","true","39.3"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","30","32","0","1"

If you like the LEGO games already, you'll enjoy this a lot. Way more fun that LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga, mostly due to an increase in variety, particularly in terms of the Jedi character's fighting styles and abilities. Only draw back is it's short, three storylines of six levels with four additional ones as opposed to the 6 sets of 6 in TCS. 30-40 hours to reach 100% completion and after that point you'll likely lose interest. Probably best to buy when on sale.\n\nAlso fun to play local co-op if you have a friend or sibling to do so with.\n\nIf you don't own a controller, don't buy.

Maybe I'm just spoiled on what Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga already delivered...\n\nNaaaaaah!\n\nLego Star Wars III- The Clone Wars is the next game Traveler's Tales was contractually obligated to make from Star Wars, before they'd lose the rights, which I'm sure they're refreshing with their new release for The Force Awakens. And, as always, there's a problem with the Traveler's Tales Lego games that seems to have started with this entry...\n\nTraveler's Tales doesn't believe in patience. At all.\n\nWhy wait for us to do a complete Indiana Jones, when we could release two? I know! Let's also release Lego The Hobbit within months of Battle of the Five Armies, but not include it in out game! Wait! I've got another idea! How about we make Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, before the other two entries are even made!\n\nIt's sad, honestly. I really like certain elements of LSW III that I do like. The new characters and locations inspired from the Clone Wars film and TV series are all fun to play as, beautifully animated, and great to control. There's tons of new abilities available, allowing tons of new opportunities for puzzles, such as mnigun targets, grappling, and precise Force movements.\n\nHowever, this feels like a really shoddy attempt to give these new abilities so light to shine in. There were a fair share of puzzles in the original LSW games that didn't outright tell you the answer, but you could figure them out with your own deduction skills. But with the way the puzzles are set up for the new abilities, it's always obvious what you have to do next.\n\nOn top of that, if Traveler's Tales had waited for the ENTIRE series to finish its run, they would have had a lot more opportunities at their hands. Hundreds of characters, tons of new planets to choose from, and even more abilities you could create.\n\nBut it really feels like they chose the most boring planets to visit. Out of all the levels I played, I only liked Ambush, Rookies, Lair of Grievous, Hostage Crisis, and Castle of Doom for their aesthetics. 5 out of about 25 levels. Because most of them are either space levels, running around dark, metal corridors, or battlefiels in the middle of a desert.\n\nWhere's the snowy tundras of "Trespass"? Where's the swamps of Rodia from "Bombad Jedi"? The massive fungal world from "Bounty Hunters"? It doesn't feel like TT chose the most creative or unique planets from the show to focus on.\n\nAlong with that, I'm not the biggest fan of the massive battle levels. They might have been better in the match mode, but from the story mode, it's a very one-sided fight with some simple building mechanics, that would've worked better if you could select bases at once, instead of running to the base you want to build on, and then building there.\n\nHowever, I did enjoy the space levels for their new enhancements to the original level design set up in LSW II. Now, you don't just fly around and shoot down enemies, you also can fly into cruisers, and take out individual droids and solve puzzles as a normal character. It has the Battlefront II feel to it, that I enjoy.\n\nI also enjoy the new minikit feature, where they actually unlock different character to play as... but that leads into one of my biggest complains for the game...\n\nThe Hub. It sucks. It absolutely sucks. It's far too large. Everything is spread too far apart, so it's a drudgery to get to another side of the ship to buy a new vehicle you unlocked. Or if you forgot a specific character to solve a puzzle, you'll have to find another character-selector and then return to solve the puzzle.\n\nI mean, hell, there's an entire space zone between the Republic and Separatist cruisers, if you want to go all the way to the other side of the Hub to unlock the villain characters. In layman's terms, this sh** is spread too far apart.\n\nAnd while I do like the new minikit feature to unlock character, I don't like the lack of creativity spent in hiding the minikits- especially in the battle levels. It gets so predictable, that it gets flat out boring to collect all the minikits, or frustrating if you make a small mistake, and suddenly a section of the level is blocked off and you'll have to reset (but you can save what progress you've made- which I do like).\n\nI'm giving Lego Star Wars III- The Clone wars a 5/10. It's a massive mixed bag filled with tons of new things I like a LOT... but a ton of other things that felt like Traveler's Tales was just going through the motions in making another Lego Star Wars game. It's not bad, per se, but it doesn't have enough good features to make it distinguishable from the rest of the Lego video game library.","May 12","false","18.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

When I saw this game, I decided I would give it a try... once it went on sale. May the 4th sales finally came and I bought it. What a disappointment. The battles are not nearly as fun as the Complete Saga because they have replaced the lightsaber block with a lightsaber throw which means you are just mindlessly swinging a lightsaber instead of trying to deflect blasts. The battlefields are huge and monotonous to traverse (not to mention they have terrible camera angles.) The whole system of how you destroy blocks is extremely annoying: Only explosions work on silver. Only rapid fire units (which are rare and annoying to use) work on gold, and its not just blocks, but vehicles too. You spend most of you time trying to find a vehicle or weapon that will destroy the one target you need to capture a base. The whole "squad system" and the fact that you must coordinate multiple units to destroy one object is unnecessarily cumbersome in a game that should have simple play mechanics. My biggest gripe, however, is the fact that this game is WAY less intuitive in level design than its predecessors. I've encountered multiple scenarios in most of the missions (including the very first one) where I am completely lost and have no idea what the game wants me to do. This game is just not rewarding enough for me to even consider free play mode.\n\nOn the plus side, there are numerous jokes and visual gags in the cut scenes typical of a LEGO game.","May 1, 2015","false","6.8"," 20 of 51 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","20","51","0","0"

My brother who I co-oped the whole thing with hated it as well. We were actually sort of excited to play it too after working through the entirety of The Clone Wars show in November/December. I didn't think Lego games had changed too much over the years, but this game changed my stance on that. There were just so many awkward moments of level design that left my brother and me bewildered as to what the devs actually wanted us to do to progress forward. They also did this half-♥♥♥ RTS level experiment that is simultaneously dumbed down for the age-group of the target demographic and bit too complicated and irritating for that same age group. As an adult it's hard not to wonder what the hell they were thinking when they put those levels together. They also decided to dump them all into one of the level arcs too, leading to some bizarre pacing where we were stuck playing a bunch of them back to back (boy were tempted to co-op the delete button there). The game makes almost no effort to make good use of the source material- they skipped over a lot of episodes that had good potential and opted for some of the weakest ones. I do recommend checking out the show on Netflix though. It is the proper 2:35 presentation and has a lot of story arcs that are the some of the best Star Wars stories out there.\n\nVerdict: Hard pass.","February 12","false","6.1"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

While the characters feel much more realized compared to their LEGO Star Wars 1 and 2 counterparts, the game inherently fails in the gameplay front. Levels are really poorly designed with puzzles very obviously forced upon the player, as they make no sense in the context of not only the story, but the setting themselves. While I respect the fact that the game experiments with the wierd army/base levels, they eventually become driving into the enemy base with your mediocre vehicle to shoot down the turrets as no one attacks you. This failed experiment unfortunately makes up a third of the game. The hub is also an absolute travesty. Places are hard to reach and it is never clear where anything is. You can't even get a bounty hunter character until you make a spaceship and fly to a different base. I can go on and on about why this game isn't good, but to me it's clear that Traveller's Tales didn't really know what they were doing here.","May 5, 2015","false","24.6"," 8 of 28 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","8","28","2","0"

I'm not saying that the game itself is bad, I can see it is highly regarded by others as a good game. The puzzle solving concept with a lego, star wars theme is right up my street. The problem I have with this game is that I don't feel it is a great choice if you are new to the lego game series. This is the message I wanted to get across to people. I understand that it is a sequel to existing games, however, I would have liked there to be a simple (perhaps optional) tutorial that gently walks a person through the games concepts so that I could play this game without having played any others in the lego series.\n\nConsider my situation and then my experience with the game.\nI am someone who has never played any lego game before, I do not have a spouse or sibling here with me to give me a brief overview of how to play the game.\nThe first thing I do is click start game. I then watch a 2 minute video that sets the scene and the game begins.\nThe game expects me to know\n(1) what the game controls are (I think a lot of people will tend to have a brief look before they play, like I did, but I expect many will like to figure most of this stuff out as they play).\n(2) Knowledge about switching players\n(3) What actions each character can do\n(4) Know how the use special actions with certain characters (e.g. using the force to push an object)\nI feel that this is already quite a lot to have to know about, and then on top of all this, if I don't figure all of this out within a 3 minute time period, the characters get attacked by monsters and I failed that bit of the level.\nI then get put back to the start menu and click play game, I have to sit through the same 2 minute video again because there didn't appear to be an obvious way to skip it.\nI do this 3 or 4 times, before I google how to escape this first scene. I would say that’s a pretty poor introduction to a game... And the game goes on, without the time pressure element, but still there is little guidance for the kind of things I'm expected to do. I would say that the game hasn't given me the right opportunities to established a thought process that I need, that will allow me to explore the ideas ive already been introduced to, and using what ive learnt to complete new challenges.\n\nNow, I believe that if the game designers target audience were new players who had never played any lego game before, this first sequence would never have passed testing! I think they would have put greater focus on a step-by-step learning process within the opening challenges of the game before the player is thrown in at the deep end. There are no tutorial level and very little in terms of introducing players to the game concepts. I therefore have to assume that the designers of the game were intending this to be a game for more experienced players.\n\nThat is all there is to it. I think that if I had known this before purchasing the game, I would definetly have bought a different game from the lego series. One that would allow a beginner to have a good time.","July 5, 2014","false","1.6"," 15 of 173 people (9%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","9","15","173","11","6"

Despite using a weaker part of the franchise as basis (Clone Wars, compared to the actual Movies), the game is surprisingly diverse, even introducing a new gameplay element: RTS sections that end up being very enjoyable, despite the "hands in" approach (no god view, no micro management). Strong character and powers roster, a lengthy campaign (though only covering the first season of the show), many side missions and hidden collectibles make for a most fun game!\nRecommended to: Fans of LEGO® games, fan of Star Wars® games, anyone wanting to pass a good time!","January 11, 2015","true","73.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played any of the other LEGO games you pretty much know a lot of the basics you're gonna find here. It's a great time, although I did find it infinitely more frustrating than any of the others. You can play the game in pretty much any order you want. There are three branching "chapters" if you will. One centered around Count Dooku, one centered around Asajj Ventress, and one centered around General Grievous. There's no specific order you have to play the levels in, but it almost feels like the game wants you to play them in a certain order, and I can't figure out quite what that order is. There were levels I would play and feel almost lost. There is very little explanation of what you're supposed to do, which is a surprising rarity for the series. While I like not being obnoxiously prompted toward everything and enjoy some challenge, there have already been some times I've had to check game guides to figure out how in the world to do certain things. Destroying gold structures, for instance, requires you to hit them with rapid fire or a consistent laser beam. And I only know that because I looked it up. Not once in five hours has the game told me that, which seems a detriment, especially since the game is meant for kids. However despite that it is a load of fun, and the newly added RTS levels feel very thematically appropriate, since the Clone Wars is, well, war. It works well with the story, and once you know what you're doing it's an absolute blast. Honestly my biggest problem is that it's really buggy for me for some reason, which has kept me from being able to complete certain levels. In one R2-D2 wouldn't hover no matter how hard I tried to make him, and in one Captain Rex completely disappeared after a while, right when I realized he was the only character I had who I needed anymore. But I imagine at least that last problem is something that will be fixed by restarting the level, so while it's annoying I'm assuming it's not too game-breaking.","April 30, 2015","true","51.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I started playing however it was apparent that there have been significant improvements. There was a colourful and varied range of characters that seemed to have more personality to them; the tedious challenge mode and super story modes had gone; there was a nice level hub with plenty of things to unlock; the levels were enjoyable. So all in all it was going well and it didn't matter that I knew nothing about the plot of the clone wars. Then came the ground battle levels. These kind of RTS type levels are quite frankly terrible, the units you build do nothing significant, the two sides just keep ineffectually sending wave after wave of troops at each other. The only reason to build up your base is to get the more powerful vehicles needed to destroy the gold and silver buildings then once you have those you can ignore all your units and go and destroy the enemy base on your own. Then there is the sheer quantity of these levels outside the main story line there are about 15 of these that you have to compete twice, once for each side. It is like they removed the tedious parts of the first game then felt they had to fill the void with something doubly tedious. Once you have the super speeder red brick you can churn your way through these a little more easily. So overall I'm giving it a thumbs up because it is enjoyable and a little better than LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga but it does not measure up to most of the other LEGO games.","October 24, 2015","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are funny, family friendly and were able to tell a story simply with the character's grunts an giggles. Does Lego Star Wars 3 live up to the expectation?\n\nThe first thing you will notice is that the animations have been significantly overhauled which some may consider a good thing and some won't. The characters don't feel or look like toys anymore which I like. There's enough cartoon like momments that make the game feel like you are playing with one massive Lego set but I would have prefered they had just made the animations more realistic and left the character designs like they were in Lego Star Wars 1 and 2.\n\nThe game is quite like an RPG. The hub is no longer a small cantina, it is two massive spaceships (republic and seperatist) and a big chunk of space in between the ships. You can hop in mini lego spaceships (and some classics like Slave 1) and defeat the enemy which will convert the planet you are fighting over to your chosen faction.\n\nThe levels are what you would expect from a Lego game, simplistic puzzles that an eight year old could solve, straightforward bossfights and lots, and lots of jumping!\n\nLego Star Wars 3 is a good game but has taken Lego characters to the point were they look a lot more realistic, the animation overhaul is well done but there really isn't much of a challenge to be had.\n7.75/10","February 20, 2015","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can make review for you as score:\n\n+Playing: 10/8 (Just 6 different move)\n+Characters: 10/10 (With every detail)\n+Graphs: 10/10 (If you don't want graphs like GTA V :D)\n+Scenario: 10/9 (It have enough story time)\n\n-You must collect to many object for finish game 100% so it's too long.\n\nAs you see it deserve this money but i recommend buy this game on discount :) Have fun with this amazing game ;","February 13","true","60.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I started playing however it was apparent that there have been significant improvements. There was a colourful and varied range of characters that seemed to have more personality to them; the tedious challenge mode and super story modes had gone; there was a nice level hub with plenty of things to unlock; the levels were enjoyable. So all in all it was going well and it didn't matter that I knew nothing about the plot of the clone wars. Then came the ground battle levels. These kind of RTS type levels are quite frankly terrible, the units you build do nothing significant, the two sides just keep ineffectually sending wave after wave of troops at each other. The only reason to build up your base is to get the more powerful vehicles needed to destroy the gold and silver buildings then once you have those you can ignore all your units and go and destroy the enemy base on your own. Then there is the sheer quantity of these levels outside the main story line there are about 15 of these that you have to compete twice, once for each side. It is like they removed the tedious parts of the first game then felt they had to fill the void with something doubly tedious. Once you have the super speeder red brick you can churn your way through these a little more easily. So overall I'm giving it a thumbs up because it is enjoyable and a little better than LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga but it does not measure up to most of the other LEGO games.","October 24, 2015","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for me there is one con, controller support. This game has partial controller support but you need special logitech or whatever remotes to play with it, you can't play with an Xbox or PS3 controller which is quite dissapointing. I don't understand it either because Saga had full controller support and this doesn't even though the controls are almost identical, plus it makes it even worse so you can't use your mouse in this either, I don't believe that this review will make them try to add full controller support since it is so old now but it's worth a try :/\n\nEDIT:\nFor some reason when I just re-opened the game my wired Xbox One controller was working with the game, I have no idea why this has happened but I'm really happy about it :) maybe it does work with these controllers after all...?.","October 24, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love them. For me, they are my "relaxer" games.\n\nSo it is without hesitation that I recommend Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars to any and all Lego fans and Star Wars fans, as well as fans of goofy, exciting fun that isn't too much of a challenge.\n\nPros:\n- Fun, colorful graphics.\n- Loads of entertainment for anyone of any age.\n- Hours and hours and hours of playability and replayability.\n- Legitimately funny cutscenes and Lego antics.\n- A HUGE central hub.\n- A huge number of characters to unlock and play around with.\n- As best I could tell (based mainly upon the fact that I am not quite caught up with TCW television series at the time of writing this review), the missions are faithful to the series.\n\nCons:\n- Literally the worst Lego character creator I have seen yet. I LOVE to make my own characters in the Lego games and roleplay through the levels with them. I was, however, unable to create a cunning, bad-to-the-bone, bounty hunter or Magna Guard-turned-Dark Jedi to my liking. Shame on you, Tt Games, shame on you.\n- Occasionally the graphics would hit a weird hitch where, during the cutscenes, the characters would be invisible.\n\nBut, despite these (very few) failings, I would absolutely, positively recommend this game. But do yourself a favor and get it on sale, like I did. The price is a tad steep for a game from 2011.\n\nCheers.","February 17","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
