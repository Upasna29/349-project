That alone should say something.\n\nThis game, like many others have said, is a dwarf fortress clone.  But unlike that game you don't need to feel like you are looking at the matrix to be able to play it.  The developer has taken the time to create simple yet fairly good graphics (considering the fact he's basically doing this by himself) that quickly gives you an idea of the state of the world as it exsists.  No two games are really alike due to random happenstance, layout of the world, invasions by annoying goblins and mants, etc.  Difficulty can be changed at the start, so toying with the options will quickly create either amazingly simple worlds you can craft to your hearts content... to war torn worlds where your gnomes will likely be missing body parts in a matter of days.\n\nThere are some physics in this game, mostly dealing with water.  There are alot of worries in this game, mostly dealing with food and safety.\n\nStandard pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nYou get to build a gnome city/village/fortress/slave labor camp\nSaid gnomes are independant but will take ques from you\nCombat is entertaining to read, especially when limbs start flying\nSwords and guns.  Steampunk at it's best\nYou can build epic wonderlike structures\nYour gnomes can starve if you are overzealous with expansion\nYou have to actually care about placement of structures\nYou can make pet rocks\nDiplomacy was added recently to add some options to irritate your neighbors\nIs somewhat modable, mostly just graphically at the time being\n\nCons\nNot as advanced as dwarf fortress\nNo sickness/diseases to combat\nNo magic system\nNo cannibalism\nNo annoying elves to get to chop up\nNo vehicles\nNo animations (once again, one man show here so give him a break)\nNo moral system as of yet\n\nBasically if you like the idea of Dwarf Fortress but can't stand looking at ascii all day, gnomoria is definitely the way to go.  It's easy on the eyes, easy to figure out (if nothing else go on the web page and look up a basic tutorial, lots of them exsist and all you really need to know is the standard build order to get you going, the rest is there just for you to learn on your own and die alot.  Alot.)\n\nThis is the kind of game I wish exsisted back in the 80s-90s when I was in school.  Me and my friends used to imagine building forts/castles with various creatures and defending them from hordes of annoying goblins and the like.  In this case, it's not on paper, it's a living breathing world where you hope that your gnomes armor isn't going to break when that ogre swings at him, seeing as he's your best builder.","October 15, 2014","true","768.1"," 133 of 136 people (98%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","98","133","136","21","2"

It manages to bring much of what I loved from DF to a sensible, usable, but still powerful user interface, along with having a unique flavor of its own. in particular, this game has the best crafting system of any builder that I've ever seen, combining flexibility and ease-of-use.\n\nThe developer is extremely professional; every bug I have reported has been fixed within a week or two, and he frequently implements awesome suggestions from the forums when they agree with his vision of the game.\n\nIf you are not coming from a DF/city builder roguelike background, expect a steep learning curve. Well worth it in my opinion, that is not to say that the game is extremely challenging, in default difficulty the world is forgiving enough that you can probably get by.\n\nThe early and mid-game are extremely interesting and fun, but unfortunately late game variety is limited to training yet more powerful soldiers to curb stomp goblins, mining ore to train your blacksmiths and then smelting it down for better quality weapons, and building giant temples or awesome structures. While this is enjoyable, I do feel like a late game should be fleshed out. Given the developer's track record however, I have every confidence this will occur. I don't know how he will do it, but I do know it will be awesome.\n\nEasily worth $20 in current form, $7.99 is a steal.","April 13, 2014","true","197.2"," 117 of 128 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","117","128","0","0"

Especially UI that is a lot better and easier to navigate than DF one. Graphics is also nicer (if only DF had this it could be a lot more enjoyable for casuals and newbies ).\n\nGnomoria lacks content  and you get bored pretty fast, it gets update's very often but still DF is years ahead of Gnomoria's content.  So that means at this rate Gnomoria will never catch up to Dwarf Fortress.\n\nAlso this 	 game is very easy , sieges are boring and monsters level up as you progress and get more wealth.  I don't feel any threat, its only hard in the beginning later when you get your gnomes a decent gear and experience nothing will stop you.\nMeanwhile in DF ; you get werebeats, undeads, necromancers, vampires, megabeasts and you get also a threat from the inside like tantrums or a lot more surprises.\nAlso you can't tame or capture monsters in this game. Really Gnomoria? Why I can't capture the mantis, train him and use him against neverending goblin waves? Or capture goblins and use them as a live targets for my beginning marksgnomes?\n\nDon't forget its an early access game  but it stable and enjoyable so far.

The game has a fully destructible environment where you can break down anything and build it somewhere else if you wanted and there a ton of crafting items as well as all kinds of building material.

Basic tools, basic foods, basic livestock, basic weapons, basic combat.  It does basic very well.  What innovations it has that sets it apart and above some of the other games of its genre is how it presents itself.\n\nAs a small collective of 6 Gnomes settling the hilly (or flat) wilds of Gnomoria, you are allowed to destroy and build as you please.  The ground can be dug up and used to build homes or sifted to find rare metals to make weapons or gems to make jewelry.  Cotten can be grown in farm plots to make bandages, bags or armour or the fields can be used to grow food.  How your Gnomes live and work is up to you.\n\nInitially, you are left to yourself, but eventually you will have to deal with Goblins, skeletons and other beasts bent on your destruction.  Build up your defensives and research new tools, like guns and steam-engines, to protect your Gnomes.\n\nThough well-balanced and well-coded, there are some things missing.  For example:\n\n1.) If your livestock gets hurt, you cannot heal them and if all your livestock die, you must establish a trade route with a neighboring kingdom to buy new livestock\n2.)  Livestock is also the only reliable way to get meat and leather, as there is no hunting of wildlife in the game.\n3.)  The only way your population can grow is through Gnomads, who will only come to your city if material worth of your city is high enough to merit a migration.\n4.)  Determining what job your new Gnome is best suited to perform requires you to scroll through their entire talent list.\n5.)  Distant kingdoms only exist as text on a menu screen and visiting diplomats don't do anything but wander around (and in my case, get killed by bears)\n6.)  Trying to do anything more complicated than "All units kill this thing" makes the game look at you funny.\n\nBut, these are minor considering the price and the over-all feel of the game.  For $8, it is a decent but basic game.  The creator hopes to have the game released as "complete" by the end of the year and raise the price to $14.99 and in that case I would ask for, at the barest minimum, the option to bred your Gnomes to increase the population and a way to heal my livestock after a goblin raider has tried to carve its buttocks off.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nOriginl Post\n\nFAIR WARNING!!!!\n\nAs of October 6th, 2015, the creator has removed the game's development plan from the website.  He is only focusing on optimizing the game as it is right now, fixing bugs, and on improving mod-support.  He is NOT going to add any new features or content.  New content MAY be added after the game is released, which he is hoping to do by the end of the year, at which time the price will go up to $14.99, but he has said the best place to find new content is from the community.\n\nThe game is fun, I will not deny it, it is both challenging and creative, but it is not complete.  It is missing content and the creator seems content letting the community finish his game for him.  Now, maybe he has a job and this is just his hobby or he realized his original plan was just too ambitious for him to do alone; maybe he has a good reason to turn the reigns over to the community.  But as someone who cannot create mods and whose computer automatically deletes them because of some security setting I don't know how to disable, being told I finish the game myself using mods is like being told to write the ending of the book I am reading.\n\nAgain, this is all the game you are going to get.  So, if you have been wanting it, get it for the reduced price.  As it is, this game is NOT worth $14.99","October 6, 2015","true","121.7"," 117 of 136 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","117","136","5","3"

As a DF fan, I decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed. It's far more streamlined than DF, such as having fewer animals to herd, fewer types of soil, fewer types of stone, etc, yet there is beauty in this simplification, as it significantly decreases the learning curve. Gnomes are also much easier to manage, and can be done without a third party application (i.e. Dwarf Therapist). Some skills have been combined into one skill (such as masonry and stone crafting), which helps to make the game easier to play. No longer does every aspect of a job need be managed (such as which particular type of material does the dwarf haul), but with Gnomoria gnomes can simply be told to haul. You are also given several professions to start with, which work well. The game also relies far less on the keyboard, and more on a mouse, which is a great feature. It's also easier to decide which material is used to create an item.\n\nThe simplification, however, does go a bit too far sometimes. Many skills are simply taken out, such as fishing and hunting. This makes it so that meat must be acquired through ranching, by killing the occasional animal that appears with military troops, or by butchering goblins. Also pets have been taken out of the game. Apart from animals, trading has also been too simplified. Gnomes may now only trade with other gnomes, and the player is initially only able to trade with one other settlement. Others may be unlocked, but it takes years to do so. The other gnome settlements are given types, such as agricultural, which makes some variety, but it still feels lackluster in comparison to the difference between dwarves, humans, and elves in DF. Also, biomes are gone. Instead of being able to choose which type of area you settle in (which can lead to big differences in DF playthroughs), gnomoria has the player settle in the same type of area every time, which has the exact same plant and animal life. Water also needs serious overhaul, and the developers need to decide to make its physics easier to manipulate and give it more purpose, or be simply used as a potential hazard. Lastly, there is still a learning curve in this game, as the developers give no form of tutorial. Players must instead watch Let's Play videos to learn how to play the game.\n\nWhile the game does have drawbacks (most notably DF is free to play while this isn't) it is still a great game. The game is still not in it's final version, and some problems may be addressed before it's released. The difficulty is still here, a player should expect to fail totally several times before they begin to understand what they're doing, but it's a much, much easier game to learn to play than DF, while still offering the enjoyment. Anybody who likes city builders, particularly the Dwarf Fortress-like sub-genre, should add this game to their library.","November 17, 2014","true","68.2"," 73 of 79 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","73","79","0","2"

And it's great!\n\nOther than appearance of a gnome without armor, you can customize everything about a gnome, even its name. Want a Miner to tend to the Farm when no stone-working is needed? Sure thing! Want the warriors to do menial Hauling after training for half a day? You bet. Want a guy who does nothing but slouch around all day? That too!\nCrafting stations can also be assigned to a specific gnome, so no other gnomes will take jobs from him. Great if you want to train a single gnome in a job. Gnomes need water and food though, else they die. Make sure those jobs are a priority.\n\nGnomes can also be given default uniforms, which means any armor and weapon you want. You can design a military formation with ranged and melee gnomes, which has their own custom uniform as well, even the quality grade can be set, keeping the best armors and weapon for your best gnomes.\nThere are Position Perks which give you bonuses to almost whatever you want, and there is synergy between perks. You can set one position to Knock Em Down, which will result in more knockdowns, and another position can have Finish Him, which does more damage to knocked down enemies. Ranged units can be set to aim for the eyes, making it easier for your melee units. Having at least some diversity is important, and that counts for weapons as well! Enemies are stronger and weaker against certain weapon types.\nLastly, putting gnomes in a squad will allow much, much greater control over them, and a squad can be given a Perk as well, which becomes more powerful the more gnomes are in the squad.\nLastly, a gnome have skills in every weapon and every profession, but they need to be trained. Your starting gnomes start off with good skills in their profession, making the beginning a bit easier, but nomadic gnomes who want to join you have random skills. If you want someone to be really god at a specific thing, you need to train her by setting her to train or work as often as possible. Don't allow your gnomes to idle!\n\nPersonally I take it slow, and just build stuff. I really like the building aspect of the game. Gnomes just chop down, mine ore or stone, and you can use these to build block walls, effectively allowing you to create your ideal fortress or any other building you want. There is a huge variety of trees, farmables, stone types and ores as well. And everythinghas value of different kinds. A Gold sword will be worse than a Steel sword for instance, but will sell for more. That's right! There are merchants who can visit from time to time!\n\nThere are so many, many, many more layers to Gnomoria, so I recommend going to the steam community and read some while you play. The controls become very easy after a while, so study them a little to avoid annoyances. There is also a gnomoria wiki online with valuable information. Also, watch some videos on youtube; some of the castles and creations are really good.\n\n9/10 would read bloody combat log again!","June 13, 2015","true","622.8"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","55","57","5","2"

In short, this game is now MODware, and even the origianl Modders didn't stick around for long because there isn't much about the game that's modable aside from the appearence of items, resource requirements, and growth timers.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear about this, as many continue to attack me over the issue. You WILL NOT realize how incomplete the game is until you have played for several hours, at least. Much of the incomplete content and game balancing issues rear thier ugly head only after you have played for around 4-8 game years. Those years generally take around 2+ hrs each depending on how meticulous you are with building and how grand your designs. I cannot be more honest in telling you that the game becomes an absolute bore as a result, even to the point it effects your later playthroughs, because you realize there is just so little to look foward to.\n\nPeople have asked for a list of Pros and Cons so I made one.\n\nPROS:\n- Closest thing to Dwarf Fortress on the market\n- A solid early game balance that's fresh every time.\n- Excellent building customizeability that's sadly rare in many DF clones\n- A solid (if simple) in game economy that requires all of your gnomes working together in order to progress.\n- A cusomizeable military\n- A gadget research path that allows the use of advanced player made mechanisms, ranged weapons, simple and complex traps systems, and automoton population replacements.\n\nCONS:\n- Closest thing to Dwarf Fortress, still far from it in terms of depth and gameplay\n- Late game is incredibaly boring due to balance issues and stale enemies.\n- Enemies are easy to manipulate. Even on harder difficulties it is easy to control how many and how much they attack you.\n- Enemies have no ranged attacks, making gnome ranged weapons OP, especially from behind walls or on cliffs\n- Enemy and gnome AI is very basic. Enemies will never try to avoid trapped entrances or find another way into your fort.\n-The military customization becomes pointless in late game. Many perks and traits are just not worth taking, or are for a game with considerably more advanced enemies (heres a missing content hint). Eventually evey melee gnome will simply have plate armor. There's just no reason to do otherwise.\n- Combat gnome training becomes rediculous to the point your soldiers become combat gods. Goblins, mants, and skeletons become limbed in seconds and the only way the enemies remain a threat is if you intentionally overwhelm yourself or your army decides to sleep through the attack.\n- Farming options are INCREDIBLY limited. You have 3 types of livestock. 2 types of fruit trees. 2 ground fruits, Cotton, Wheat, and underground mushrooms. If you want to build underground, your stuck with just mushrooms.\n- Music becomes very repetitive for this type of game. You'll eventually mute it and play something else. Unfortuneatly, goblin warnings are tied to the music, so preventing yourself from going crazy gimps you. Not that it matters after a few playthroughs.\n- Building is virtually limitless but the blocks used to decorate it are incredibally limited. Again, this is more of a veteran issue and some may have no issues with it at all. Also solvable with mods.\n- The gadget research is also limited. You learn everything there is to know in about 2 to 3 yrs of in game time, with just one researcher.\n- Heres one many don't know about, but as a deep dweller I'll tell you. The bottom 2/3 of the map is ALWAYS the same. Every playthrough I've had has had the same layout of rock formations at level 50, the place I started building kingdoms after getting bored with how easy the surface is. THIS GAME IS NOT TRULY ROUGELIKE\n\n\nTLDR: The game is missing content such as diplomacy, enemies, and building/farming options, that are required to keep one's interest beyond the first two or three playthroughs. Even after release, I just couldn't get back into the game given how dull I knew it would become. Some of the game breaking bugs have been ironed out, but I just can't play it long enough to test all of them, so I'll assume the game is considerably less buggy than it used to be. Again, the developer abandoned his project before release. This is now MODware. Whether its worth the $15 or not is up to you, but I can't in all honesty reccomend a game I know is incomplete.","October 18, 2015","false","526.2"," 333 of 473 people (70%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","70","333","473","13","64"

It's that good.  You can create limitless amounts of new kingdoms with each new game, set difficulties, peaceful or not, metal/gem/coal resource abundance etc.  There is much more than meets the eye of simple gfx and sound.  After a while you figure out that if you want to build a stone temple, you have to dig a hole down and get stone, turn it into stone blocks (with workshops for each type of thing) and craft the blocks and tell the gnomes where to build.  It's total freedom but with that comes the complexity of running your own little kingdom.  Are you up to the challenge?  It's like simcity or warcraft meets minecraft.  For those that don't like FPS games or need a break from them, this is a great break.  Actually... it is more like a black hole from which you won't want to escape.  It is that fun.  Oh, and development is constant.  No fears as with some in-development games... the dev is at the ready and giving many new features on a consistent basis.  Don't starve, die of thirst, or get killed by bears, or anything that spawns below level -7 (that is where monsters can spawn, at level -8 and below).  Monsters also spawn on the surface but they are usually wild animals only.  Occasionally, depending on difficulty you get goblin raids (not too rough at first, again depends on your settings), but after a while they can get pretty tough.  You will have to grow your own food, or forage from the naturally occuring fruit trees, or clip and plant some more of your own to make sure you always have plenty of spare food.\nPerformance, for most this won't be an issue, though this game is entirely cpu-dependant ghz-wise.  SINGLE CORE\nAny relatively recent CPU will run this game on anything up to including a medium sized map, but for those that want to build on large or huge maps with many gnomes (40-50+) and mine deep, a pentium-anniversary edition OC'ed,  i5k or i7k cpu is recommended.   At 4.2ghz on an AMD FX will run a small or a medium kingdom up to 60 gnomes.  On a 4.6ghz i7 4790k cpu a large and huge sized map will run well with the same amount of gnomes at a better frame rate.  Older cpu's such as Athlon II's will incur stutter a bit when mining deeply (past -50 or -60 deep) when you have.  A newer i5/i7 overclocked past 4.4ghz will pretty much let you build anything without too much framerate lagging associated with mature kingdoms.  Don't let all my talk about performance scare you away, but this game is so awesome, you might just want to upgrade your computer if it's a few years old just to build more :)  A fancy video card won't do you much justice with this game so if you video card isn't too recent don't worry a bit.  Just give this game a shot.  In it's current state, it rarely to almost never crashes, and with autosaves, you wouldn't lose much progress even if it did.  It is feature-complete enough to surpass most other early-access (and some fully released) games.\n\nThis game, at it's price, is an absolute steal.  The community on steam discussion forums here is very helpful if you have a question to ask or some hurdle you cannot overcome (expect to lose once or twice, or three times even when you first play, this is how you learn!).  For those wanting to build more above ground instead of living in a hole in the ground I personally have made a simple gfx mod that adds windows to some of the game textures, you can look it up in the steam discussion forums under 'mods' for this game.  Visit http://www.gnomoriawiki.com/ for help with various ambiguous parts of the game, and see youtube.com for some (RECENT!) let's play videos.  RECENT being the key.  You want something from spring 2014 or newer since this pre-release game is still-a-changing.  A demo of this game is available.\nTHIS GAME HAS NO BUILT IN TUTORIAL.  EXPECT TO DO SOME READING ON THE WIKI (or on steam discussion forums) FOR HELP.  I have been playing this game for almost 18 months, it's a vortex that sucks you in like no other, and if you need a game that you can just quick walk away from (to tend to the pets, or your kids, or do the wash) then this is the kind of game for you, things will still be (usually) where you left them.\nNew features added just this past month include AUTOMATONS!  Yes!  Gnome-cyborg-robot things that do the work for you!  Prosthetic Limbs can now mend limpy gnomes back into action again.\nDid the goblins attack your kingdom and now you're angry and want to throw a stone back at them?  Do one better, have one of your gnomes hand-deliver 1000 Goblin-meat Sandwiches to the Goblin kingdom and watch the mayhem ensue!\nBuild a mud temple that Adam Ant would long to live in, a Stone temple or pyramid reminiscent of civilizations of yesteryear.   ... or just a bunch of red brick townhomes that look like a gov't housing project!  It's all up to YOU!\n\nCombat is handled in the beginning with sticks, stones, logs, soon onto swords of various materials (yes, material each has different strenth), bronze, iron, and steel being the best options.  Research can be done via Tinkering at a specific workshop to research various new technologies.  Just a few are ranged weapons (bow and arrow, blunderbuss, pistol), prosthetic limbs, traps of various types, power-plant type devices to power mechanical walls, and now automatons.\nYou can (after researching) even build pumps to move water, make water, or move LAVA and make a volcanic eruption!\nWater+Lava=Obsidian, a very very tough stone.\n\nBasically, the skinny on all of this is, no matter what you want to build, if you like a game where the goal is only to survive and the rest is up to you, this is totally it.  You are limited only by your brain, and ability to cope with situations that arise.  A little bit of simcity, a little bit of warcraft (1 and 2), a whole lot of inspiration (admittedly so) from Dwarf Fortress... and new features all the time.\n\nAfter you spend a few dozen hours figuring things out and getting yourself adjusted to this game, to peruse the discussion forums for cool kingdom seeds and figure out how to use the custom-map-generator in the game,  With the right digits and a bit of trial and error you can have a map that's 40-50% water and easily surround your kingdom with a moat... or dig enough small holes on any map and eventually they'll fill with rain water and you can make it that way.  This is what makes Gnomoria so fun...there is just so much to it.  So deceptively simple, yet so deep.  The combinations are endless.  Smart Kings can also make their kingdoms self-sufficient to a point, or just wall in for total safety and stand atop the kingdom walls to watch the wild animals beat each other up.  Either way, give it a shot, it's only a few bucks and what's a few bucks for what may very well be thousands of hours of fun.","December 14, 2014","true","793.4"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","56","59","3","3"

As for artwork, it depends on you, how much you like retro-styled art, it certainly pleases me ... I fell in love with that game, and it's only early alpha.\n\nBasically you "kinda" take control of very loyal dwarves and you have to do everything in order to keep your dwarves alive, since getting food and drink to defend them from goblin attacks.\n\nIt's not that sort of game that you drag a selection area and command the selected units to build something: no!

It is a settlement sim, where you create a settlement, design the layout, dig it out or build it up as you prefer, and try not to starve or get slaughtered.\n\nHeavily reminiscent of Dwarf Fortress, but far more accessible, you don't actually control any of your gnomes. Instead, you give them jobs (which you can customize), and put orders on the map for gnomes with the appropriate jobs to do. The ability to define the jobs, combat roles, and priorities gives you a lot of control over the behavior and efficiency of your gnomes.\n\nLike many similar games it is a balance between expanding your economy and taking care of your defenses. Gnomes that are learning to swing a sword better are not helping you shear sheep, harvest fruit, or brew wine... and if you don't have enough food and drink for you and your livestock to make it through the winter then starting over is pretty likely.\n\nThe game recently (~8 months ago) added modding support, and already several interesting additions to the game (like Glassworks) have been added. Now that the game is public, more are likely to come.\n\nSome downsides:\n\nCombat is unsatisfying to watch, and unless you look through the text logs it's hard to tell what happened.\nBuilding large structures can be tedious, as you can't order all the steps at once and trust the gnomes to do them in the right order. Having gnomes trap themselves is not uncommon, though relatively recent changes have made it not happen constantly.\nI bought the game for $9, three and a half years ago, it's gotten vastly better since then. I'd happily pay $15 now, as the game is far more than twice as good as what I originally purchased.","February 23","true","328.5"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","50","61","3","2"

I'd really like to give this game a neutral. It's not the greatest, but it's not the worst\n\nIt's fun when it works right. Currently it's an unoptimized bug ridden mess that came too soon out of Early Access. The further you go along, that laggier it gets, to the point where you're hitting the keyboard in frustration trying to get it to pause.\n\nThis is another game that suffers from the 32-bit curse, the bigger the kindom, the more the lag. the more the frustration.\n\nThe game does have mod support, well, that is when the mods actually load. I've not had much luck in this, only have gotten the mods to load twice in 10 games. I typically end up abandoning games due to 20+ minute loading times or the lag that piles up after about the 8th year. Oh and it only supports one mod per game.\n\nThere are a lot of behind the scenes that aren't explained anywhere or shown. For instance armor affects your gnomes ability to make items. Depending on the armor is how fast they make items. Or what exactly do automations need? Do they need their own personal quarters? How are they powered? How do the different cores afftect them? And the list goes on and on.\n\nIf you're wondering, updates comes about every 6 months. In the August 2015 patch, ores was made very scare to the point of not being able to find any. I managed to wait 4 months before I ended up hex editing the terrain file to make more ore. I don't know if this was fixed or not. But at this point I just don't care anymore until the rest of it gets fixed.\n\nI currently really can't recommend this game.

I'm made several tries at Dwarf Fortress (DF) in the past, and each time I'm just bounced off.  Though Gnomoria lacks some of the intricacy DF is always credited with, its user interface is really quite friendly once you've spent a little time with it, and it puts solid tools at your fingertips for competent Gnoministration.\n\nIf you enjoy more personalized, hands-on management games, particularly those with a fantasy setting, I can't Gnomoria strongly enough.  Also, in terms of return on your purchase investment, there are few games out there that can rival its bang-for-the-buck.\n\nI'd also like to tack on a shout-out to the music track for this game - it's extremely pleasant to the ears, and I find it very soothing for those late night Gnoministration sessions.","August 20, 2015","true","110.3"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","26","28","4","0"

I can recommend you watch youtube videos, there are some excellent let's plays that will teach you the basics. You're also able to turn off enemies if you want to go through the learning steps a few times.\n\nSome cons though: Now let's be fair, this doesn't have the complexity of Dwarf Fortress, I don't know if that's possible for any game right just because of what I know about DF. But it doesn't say that it's trying to be a DF clone so that's OK. One other thing is I hope the developer continues to develop the game and add new features, such as more workshops, more armors, more weapons, more traps, etc...right now the game has JUST enough material to justify $15, but I can only say that because I've played it.

You gather resources and start digging, making your own underground base. As I'm huge fan of Terraria, I bought Gnomoria on Steam Sale. And you know what? I don't regret it! It can be unfinished, it may need to be polished, but I like it! Without in-game tutorial it was quite hard to understand how things work and yet I enjoyed thinking what I can do and how. Now, I am able to defend myself from randomly spawning enemies, make huge caves and nice looking houses. If you're looking for something similar to Terraria but with managing people — get Gnomoria ASAP.

Even in it's early access stage, this game feels very complete. Harvest resources, build your empire and vanquish your enemies. The foundation for a great game. A little imagination and you're there. You'll find yourself becoming attached to your Gnomes, caring genuinely for the welfare of those under your command. You'll start naming things, creating the story yourself, in your head.

Within the first couple hours I enjoyed myself much more than I'd expected.\nThat being said, I HIGHLY recommend Gnomoria for any fan of civilization/kingdom management games and other simulation-type games that similarly inspire creativity, planning, and fun.\n\nThe Pros:\nThe devs are very active, which is a pleasant surprise considering my track record of getting suckered into early access traps where devs just plain quit or worse.\nGameplay is very enjoyable, and will definitely put your micromanaging to the test if you aren’t one for using pause buttons frequently.\nDifficulty is easy to scale to your desire. Whether you want the hardest experience possible, or if you want to just cruise in a peaceful kingdom is up to you.\nLarge variety of items, tasks, and things in general to learn about maximizing your kingdom’s productivity and prosperity. I would even call the game immersive, to some degree.\nThe Cons:\nA little buggy, but it’s early access. What’d you expect? The game is mostly pretty clean and well-functioning. The only real problems I seemed to have ran into are outfit/equipment management bugs. Nothing an exit-reload of the game and some fiddling with settings won’t fix.\nSome of the terrain-reconstructing options have poorly managed AI, but if it didn’t it would just mean you’d spend more time sitting and waiting than doing anything. So that isn’t really that bad either.\nAll in all, I absolutely recommend this game. Great aesthetics for the type of game it is, great music, great development history 10/10. One of my favorite games!\n\nAlso, I never played Dwarf Fortress. So I went into playing Gnomoria with zero similar experiences, it's not too hard to learn and if you experiment enough you will get the hang of things pretty easily. Some mistakes in the game aren't easily remedied, so you may want to expect to restart your playthrough in some cases.","December 23, 2014","true","471.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

It needs a Neutral review. If you are going to rate this, at least read it first-Thanx\n\nIf you know what Dwarf Fortress is, and liked it, you will love this game. The learning curve is more of a cliff face, it's a long, hard slog to figure out what everything does, what order you should craft in,  learning how to use the dwarf professions, Military, Stocks tabs, and how to use Priorities to create effective farms. I suggest that 6-10h of play time will get you to a point where you are proficient enough to be able to enjoy this game. Be aware of that going into it, and you shouldn't be dissapointed.\n\nBeing Early Access, one needs to remember that bugs that I mention here, will likely be fixed by the time you read the review.\n\nSo the screenshots that you see of vast  fortresses? don't expect to get that far in the game for  a long, long, long time. What you are looking at there, is beautiful, but it takes a lot to get there. I'm sure I'll persist with it one day, I will manage it myself, but not today.\n\nThere is one particular thing in this game that I dislike above everything else I want to say about it, good or bad; Mining isn't as intuitive as it needs to be to make this game align with more casual players, such as myself (I'm not really a casual gamer, but I play this game with a Casual mentality). This game is not ready for casual players. Read the reviews, and you will see they are filled with fanboi's. This is fine, as it can be a great game, and it deserves it's positive following. All I am saying is, prepare for something hardcore, or look elsewhere ATM.\n\nMostly, I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing OK with this game, and the more I persist with it, the better I get at not having my Gnomes Derp out. It's the ONLY realy frustration that I have right now, otherwise I would say it's an OK game.\n\nControls\nYou dont control Gnomes directly. you give sets of instructions, and they prioritise their tasks. So if a Gnome is hungry, he will go off and eat from the Food Stockpile, before he will pick up that strawberry off the ground. (its just a bug that needs to be looked at.) mostly they manage their own sleep/food/drink needs and you ensure they have enough supplies. I actually like this idea.\nThe UI is clunky and slow. it uses the same system as Win95 where you have to track your mouse across several dropdowns to get what you want. you have to double click lots of things that should be single click. you have to click - move click to select, rather than click drag. I keep hearing from fanbois "it's better than DF (Dwarf Fortress)" That may be true, but it doesn't make it OK. You can't pause if you have a menu or context box up. you can only pull up the context menu if you click on a blank area of the map.This is understandable, as designated areas/ objects/enemies are interactive via said rclick. but still annoying.\n\nGraphics.\nAlthough I get it, i do - it's a throwback nod to the 8bit era of DF, it's not right. I feel the art style is archaic and unclean. tiles have a lot going on in each one and it can actually make it hard for less experienced players to 'read' the layout of the land, especially as we are talking about a mining type game with multiple layers of rock face and myriads of tunnels. I feel that this game would benefit from a clean, crisp tile set. I just looked at the gmae Project Zomboid, and it's graphics are simple, but clean, allowing you to focus on the gameplay. I feel this title here would benefit from such a make over.\n\nSound.\nTurn it down, turn it off. Play your own. It gets tired quickly.\n\nGameplay.\nBack to the brutal. I think this game is meant to be fun, but I'm not having any. I think that once I figure out how to mine without getting my miners trapped with no way out every 5 mins, I will like this game more.\n-->Pathing: gnomes getting stuck is because it's possible to work them into a corner. If, say you were to ask them to dig a pond by selecting an area that is wide, they will potentially dig themselves into a 1 tile island. because they have done this, the dirt that they need is down below their reach, so they can not build themselves a bridge out... you have to get another gnome to come resue them, and this may mean retasking a farmer to become a miner for a little while, etc etc. The pathfinding itself seems not too bad, but it pays to dig / mine in small areas/strips..\n\n-->Mining;\nIt's hard work. not from the perspective of it's a grind... it's actually very accessible, and you can get pretty deep, pretty quickly... just remember that depth = harder monsters. Monsters Spawn anywhere that is dug that is within about 12 tiles of a gnome that is not lit by a torch. Pro tip, right there. Anyway, what I find hard, is the pathing. building stairs up/down isn't always easy. gnomes get stuck/freeze. they can remove their only way out, and then they don't build stars back up afterwards. Maybe I found a glitch, maybe I'm doing it wrong. It's annoying. There is a key (E) to make all uncovered tiles invisible, so it's supposed to make deep mining easier, and in some ways it does, but it's still really easy to lose track of where your little minions are. Then there is the whole stock piling and stacking mechanic, which is currently broken. EG. Dirt can be stockpiled, and can be stacked to 64... but gnomes will not stack dirt on a stockpile. you have to make a stockpile, get them to fill it, then destroy your pile, and the game will then stack your dirt for you. I hope this is addressed in the future.\n\nSurvival.\nIt's meant to be a Rogue-lite Procedurally Generated Crafting Survival Game With Permadeath. this is achieved with map generation at the start of the game, and a Save feature, but no Load... so youcan't go back to previous Save games. really it just feels like it's missing the load feature. I think it's because the game talks about saving so much that it becomes a thing, something that you think about, rather than just lettign it happen so that you can focus on gameplay.\nOn enemies; figure out how to craft a bone needle, and make yourself some bandages. Minor cuts during combat will have your gnomes bleed to death if not treated. Enough Said.\n\nCrafting.\nI like the crafting in this game. You can see what the prerequisites are for items, you can even order an item, and your gnomes will make all the prereq's for it... if you have created/farmed all the needed Craft stations / ingredients for those (wood, stone, bone, cotton, etc) you can see what can be created and what's needed. I Prefer this to the Terraria / MindCrap style of play where items only become available to craft (aka you know of their exsistence) once you already have all the items needed to create it.\n\n\n\nThe Negative Reccomend is mostly because I feel that this game is not yet ready for the Casual gamer, even though I will likely persist with it for now.\n\nCasual: well, it's Don't Starve again, but with a steeper learning curve at the start - a science machine in DS wll get you through winter if your an OK player... so, one crafting table, basically. In Gnomoria, you craft 1 table specifically so that you can craft the next 6 that you will need for winter / food / drink / stone / wood / butcher etc etc. And i pretty well need them all. Then once I have them I need to use those tables to build a loom and a  tailor, just so that I can make bandages for when my guys get injured in battle. That's 8 crafting tables in the first 6-10 days, pretty much.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orillion/recommended/224500/","Orillion","Orillion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orillion/","182 products in account","This game can be correctly called "Dwarf Fortress lite," but it has several rules and mechanics that prevent it from perfectly capturing a lighter version of that experience.\n\nThe big one, I feel, is that there's no real way to avoid the overworld. Dwarves can stock up on an absurd amount of wood, then bid the sun goodbye forever. Gnomes are not so lucky; They can grow mushrooms underground for tea, but underground pastures are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to make and there's no other way to grow crops purely underground. Also, most furniture can only be made from wood, meaning you will have to leave eventually. This is okay; it gives the game its own sense of identity, but it's important to know that strategies that serve in Dwarf Fortress are often not replicable here.\n\nAlso of note is that, while the interface is substantially easier to use than Dwarf Fortresses', it's still awkward as hell. Most commands are selected mainly from a right-click drop-down menu that has a habit of closing menus if your cursor drifts off for even a second. The placement of a lot of tools is also questionable at best, making large projects of mountain-levelling and fortress-building take much longer than necessary as you need to remember the logic the game uses for its tools. I suggest Tacyn's Base Mod, located in the Steam Workshop, to fix this. It adds a lot of content, but much of that is cosmetic choices (such as new tree types which result in different coloured wood) but it mostly feels well-implemented and the alterations to tool logic are, in my opinion, hard to live without.\n\nFinally, this is sadly a game you can't really help but play with the wiki open; workbenches are used to craft every type of good in the game, but they follow a tech tree which the game itself does not really offer for viewing: Crude workbenches can be made without processed materials, and are used to craft your first few real benches. You need to make a stone cutter to process stone into the form used by the stone mason. You need to make the stone mason so you can craft the cutting blade required to craft the sawmill. You need the sawmill because crafting a single plank with a crude workbench takes ages, and only after you have one is it worth building your carpenter bench.\n\nThe more infamous example is the creation of beds: You need a loom to process cotton, a carpenter to make bed frames, and a tailor to make matresses. To craft the tailor, you need a bone needle. To make a bone needle, you need a bonecarver. Bonecarvers have -very few- uses beyond crafting a bone needle; just creating trade goods and low-grade armour. To make the stone needle at the bonecarver you need a butcher to extract the bones from a corpse. To get a corpse for the butcher you either need to have had your yak pastures up and running for a full 12 days or you need to luck out and win a fight against goblins or honey badgers, which is far from guaranteed when you have so little armour and no experience. That means that, before you can make your first bed, you need to have eight different workbenches and either a ranching industry or a large amount of luck.\n\nThat said, if you can accept the minor niggles of the tech tree being what it is and the interface being sort of screwy, Gnomoria is definitely a game worth your time. Whether it's worth your money is another story; I would probably not buy  it for over $10 USD.","March 10","true","43.5"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Music is catchy, visuals fit the setting perfectly but the UI can be a little fiddly if you're using the right click menu. Massive amounts of detail, furniture will be a different tint based on the materials used to build it, items have different quality levels which means that you want a gnome with high jewel smithing to make good jewelry to sell for a higher price.","October 5, 2014","true","235.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

[These bugs will go away eventually, the game is still in development at the time of writing]\n\nGnomoria is a game in which you manipulate, rather than order directly, your colony of gnomes as they reshape the landscape into their kingdom. Farms, groves and pastures, workshops built underground or in buildings, forts and castles, crossbows and rifles, swords and hammers, armors and ... well other types of armors. Mines. Lots of mines. Dangerous mines full of skeletons, zombies, spiders, beetles and the occasional golem. Also gems, valuable metal ores but mostly less valuable dirt and rock. That you can bake/chisel into more valuable ceramic blocks, bricks or crafts for trade or showing off.\n\nThe essence of the game is manipulation. Each gnome can be assigned a profession which can be entirely customised by the player. Dedicated chefs, carpenters that double up as farmers, jewelers who also help tend the wounded or build things when there's no jewels to make or wounded to tend. Both the specefic jobs for a profession and their priorities can be customised and here is where the learning curve comes from.\n\nEven though the game is still incomplete, there is much to discover and learn about how to best organise and grow your workforce. Giving orders is relatively easy, but seeing them carried out sensibly and efficiently is an entirely diffrent matter.\n\nThe game is difficult yet mostly peacefull at the same time. Expect lots of restarts but also expect your next kingdom to fare better than the last.\n\nThere is maybe little point past survival, or survival in the prettiest and most efficient kingdom you can build, but in that regard Gnomoria is similar to Lego bricks. You don't play much with what you create, you reach a point of satisfaction (or more likely late game instability) and start thinking about how to build another world.\n\nHave loved ones on standby ready to hit you over the head with something sturdy but loving, preferably a hammer. The game is far more addictive than it seems.","December 20, 2014","true","92.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Since then it has mostly been bugfixes and and mod support for a game that is basically dead in the water for development. (Its still buggy and sometimes quite annoying to play.)\n\nPositives:\nA lot of the basic features are complete, you can build a decent enough base for your gnomes.\nGnomes that have fought in battles can lose limbs that impair thier abilities which helps give some of your gnomes some character which they otherwise lack completely.\nSo long as you only build unerground, building can be quite fun and easy to do, planning storerooms and workshops seperate to your living quarters and dining halls.\nThe visual style and overall presentation including the UI is nice to look at and faily easily interpreted.\n\nNegatives:\nBeing that no preferances exist for food and drink, there is no incentive to vary production and create a variety of food and drink and instead produce the same stuff for the entire playthrough.\nControlling your gnome squads is difficult too, only being able to give vague suggestions of what you want them to do which can be frustrating when combat often leads to serious injury a single gnome can run into a fight before everyone else and die immidiately leading to an entire colont collapsing because you no longer have enough gnomes to fight back and the few remaining goblins take down your civilians with little resistance.\nGnomes get stuck a lot unless you remove tiles in a very specific order to prevent them removing thier only escape because they can't walk on solid blocks if they have no tiles on top. Sometimes you dig down and get them stuck or they construct something in the wrong order and get stuck on top of a wall. You have to micromanage them as best you can despite only being able to designate jobs to be done, this leads to a lot of watching them do a job then designating the next tile(s) for construction or deconstruction, the larger the project you intend to build, the more tedious the process gets.\nThe games hospital area just does not do its job, gnomes do a better job of patching themselves up after a battle. I have had gnomes who would otherwise have lived die in hospital of thirst despite having plenty of drink available. Plus they stay in hospital untill they are fully recovered and since there is no medicine in game this takes a very very long time, time which would be better spent doing work so we don't all starve.\n\nCurrently missing or lacking features:\nNo animal taming.\nNo personalities, life goals or religions.\nNo magic or enchanting.\nDiplomacy overly simplistic, either friend or hostile monster kingdom with no way to change thier disposition. Friendly kindoms exists purely for trade and hostile kingdoms will only attack you. No communication and barely any interaction outside of trade or fighting.\nItems, plants and animal variety feels lacking, very few rare plants and animals exist.\nI've never seen a random event besides being relentlessly attacked by goblins and the Mants have never attacked because I don't make too much food.\nMedical treatments besides bed rest and bandages, without any other forms of treatment the hospital is pointless. (Artificial limbs exist but they are quite late in the game and are not produced at the hospital.)\n\nThe game is fun enough to pick up on sale but not worth a full price purchase.","February 24","false","37.8"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","30","48","0","3"

Lead a small band of adventurous gnomes into the founding of a new colony, and defend them not only against starvation, but also hostile goblin raiders and hungry beasts!\n\nThe Good\nSimple and fun once you get the hang of it, with a basic 'dig and build' approach to the world controls.  Randomized terrain and gnome stats make this a slight blend into roguelike, which has both ups and downs.  The in-game orchestra sound track is quite nice, and the game sounds are decent quality for a beta.\n\nThe combat is not difficult to understand; you can give instructions to your gnomes on how to conduct themselves in battle (I favor a kamikaze rush), and the enemies present a bit of variety in tactics as well; animals will run if hurt, and goblins will happily test your defenses.\n\nThe Bad\nPoor graphics* and terrible default sound track.  There's not very much to do (still early access at time of writing), and so the game can be very slow after a while.  Strong learning curve with no starting instructions, and at time of writing resources can be difficult to get together for items needed for the game.  Few explanations and warnings for events makes some facets of the game a bit challenging.  The pathing AI can be a bit funny.\n\n* 8-bit, might be your thing.\n\nThe Ugly\nThere isn't any.  Nice game, still in beta.\n\nSuggestions\nAn in-game recipe book would be nice (even if such was populated only by things you had discovered and 'theorized').  A gnomish flavour to menus would be good, perhaps naming the weaponsmith a swordificationator or something.  More in-game notices that a gnome has just dug himself onto a cliff that he can't get down from and is at risk of starvation would be something I'd like to see.\n\nThe Summary\n7/10, 8/10 if 8-bit graphics are your thing.

The game is charming in its own way, the varety of gnome sprites brought a modicum of life to what would otherwise be smiling icons. But aside from Gnome looks there isn't much else varied in the game.\n\nYou have your standard farms and produce, your varieties of stones, a smattering of metals, a few AI 'kingdoms' to trade with and that's about it.\n\nNo, really. Unless you count the monster varietes, all of which but three can be countered by simply lighting your mines with torches. Skeletons, Zombies, Beetles, and Spiders simply aren't a threat to any player (read: most) capable of planting torches on the floor. The rest are periodic goblin & ogre invasions that scale in size and armament with the 'wealth' value of your realm. Not that the scale of these will kill anything other than your framerate when you reach a point where you can trap them in corridors and let them starve to death. The last enemy is the mant, chitinous men-ants who spawn in numbers based off your food storage and can be completely circumvented by killing a scout spawned a day or so before a raid.\n\nThese threats do not become more challenging over time as much as they become higher in number. Attack frequencies never increase, there are no bigger threats, and they're routine enough to be completely predictable. The difficulty curve in this game stems from the lack of a tutorial and the creeping FPS death and bugs (both beetle cascades and crashes).\n\nIf you're wondering if the game has any mystical or otherwise big events/features/content, I can say there's none. Once you learn the mechanics (and the gnomish mechanisms), the game becomes trivial in the extreme. So yeah, 'Dwarf Fortress Lite' in the negative sense of the phrase.\n\nThe game lacks in significant and essential content it sorely needs to justify itself as a finished game, such as a deathcare system, expanded economics and management(No royalty/nobility! Though you might consider that a good thing) , and a meaningful way to interact with the game world outside your kingdom.\n\nTo top it all off Gnomoria does not support resolutions higher than 1080 and the developer has not and will never make any attempts to ever support them. Enjoy playing in windowed mode if you've a higher resolution monitor.\n\nGnomoria was good for an early access game. It is not a finished game worthy of release.

Repeated cases of removing a floor with a solid tile underneath it and the tile was deleted. It's extremely frustrating spending 90% of the game time trying to get gnomes un-stuck and having them largely ignore jobs. Game developer(s) have not built in much protection for Gnomes getting stuck at all which makes me feel it's a working as intended feature which makes the negative review all the more justified.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=632277756\n\n\nAfter further playing the gnome stuck issue can be assuaged by refraining from removing floors if possible and instead using the "Replace Floor" function. In addition instead of digging holes or mining into surfaces instead use the "Mine Ramp Up" function on each indvidual tile you want to remove.\n\nThat said Gnomes would ideally be able to climb up the small gap between dirt and floor. It is very tedious to terraform large groups of land because of risking Gnomes getting stuck There doesn't seem to make sure for example a 20x20 area you want to dig 1 block down is done in a way that the Gnomes will not get themselves stuck on a pillar of terrain.\n\nAlso Gnomes seem to be incapable of quenching thirst with an abundance of fruits around them.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=632298416\n\nThere's a definite rush to find ore in this game. A process made tedious by only starting with 2 Pickaxes. It is impossible to make bandages without a needle made from a bone carver which requires a knife which requires several buildings to smelt and smith ores. Enemies will arrive and Gnomes will bleed out from any kind of combat without bandages. Unfortunately like many sandbox games it is not possible for low technology alternatives to be implemented in place of full smithing and mining infrastructure. A stone knife should work fine to carve a needle from bone or wood (needles are only made out of bone in Gnomoria) that could be used to knit cotton into a crude bandage. Sandbox games often make the mistake of requiring players to jump through hoops for basic survival materials when such complexity should be reserved for making higher quality goods.\n\nOh and it crashes pretty consistently. For a game at release it really shouldn't crash every 20 minutes. I can't use two of my saves because the game crashes to desktop the second an enemy dies. I am not playing with any mods installed. Getting Gnomes stuck is one thing but repeatedly having 6+ hours of progress get completely trashed by an unavoidable crash is unacceptable.\n\nReally want to like this game but in the current state it just seems like a good concept with a very buggy execution.","February 25","false","17.0"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","26","43","0","7"

I love this game and have played many hours in it. It is in my top five games of all time. But that is where the good parts of this review end.\n\nThis game is a backstabber. It is like one of those people you meet in high school or college. They seem to have everything together, and you can't bear to be away from them. Any flaw you can see is outshone by their shear awesomeness.\n\nThe trouble comes after knowing these people for a while. The quirks and the minor flaws start to dominate their persona. They can't get out of the frat boy phase. They never seem to have found themselves on that soulsearching trip they were taking.\n\nGnomoria is the same way. It promised a fun game and sure it was fun. But when you build up in those first few years you ignore the bugs where the gnomes stop to pick up something on a tile where there is nothing. You ignore when the gnomes don't seem to understand that they can't pile an entire mountain of stone on a single tile without spawning golems. You ignore when items become glued to the ground and it seems you have found the sack that arthur will have to come pull out and become your king. You ignore this until every minute you have to go and change a profession or else a gnome will die of thirst trying to pick up that sack.\n\nI used to play this game almost every week, but I just can't stand it any more.

And then there was my complete and utter lack of patience for the tedious micro-management and brutal difficulty of that particular game. (Read: I love it, but sometimes lack the attention to detail it requires.) This began my search to find a similar, but somewhat less dense version of Dwarf Fortress. I came across them in droves. Rimworld, Timber and Stone, Prison Architect, and of course Gnomoria being foremost among them. Gnomoria is a game, that while being more limited in its options and features than Dwarf Fortress, still manages to capture its charm and fun.\n\nTo say that Gnomoria is a blatant clone of Dwarf Fortress, does it little justice, though there is no denying a certain amount of inspiration must have certainly come from that title. This much is evident as you first embark to your new settlement. After naming your map (or fortress, or whatever you may want to call it), and choosing some options for difficulty, Gnomoria plants you into a procedurally generated map. You're able to determine if the map is mountainous, flat, or perhaps even a bit hilly via a few sliders if you choose to customize the advanced settings. This all ensures you'll never have the same map twice.\n\nYou'll only have a handful of gnomes at first as well as a very limited number of supplies. Now from here, it's up to you to determine the fate of your gnomish minions. While you can't directly control your gnomes, there are a number of ways to determine how they will behave. You're able to designate professions which will determine what sort of generated tasks your gnomes will be able to complete. Gnomoria even allows for you to create and name custom professions which will then carry out specific tasks. This gives you pretty solid control over how your colony prioritizes work. I've found this feature to be particularly useful in the beginning as gnomes are not apt to doing things efficiently using only the default professions. If you wish, you can create professions that will only carry out military tasks. Assign them to squads, train them, arm them. If you master these menus, which is not difficult by any stretch thanks to Gnomoria's simple but effective UI, you will be much better off for it.\n\n\nGnomoria really shines in its ability to let you sculpt the land. For anyone who has played any of a number of voxel-cube based games (Minecraft, Space Engineers, etc.,), this part will be quite familiar. However, in this instance, you will be viewing the world through an isometric perspective rather than first person. You can tunnel and dig anywhere and everwhere, but be warned, unlit tunnels sometimes spawn deadly enemies such as skeletons and even zombies. Use raw stone to craft blocks and then you can begin building a fortress. One of my favorite features here is the 'replace' tool. Using this you can easily replace any block with any other type of block. I'll often find myself following the natural geometry of the landscape to determine the layout of my settlements and simply replacing the dirt walls and floors with more permanent stone or wood. It's been quite a lot of fun being the architect of some pretty grand fortresses. Players should be careful to not get carried away with doing too much at once though as it will keep your gnomes from completing other tasks of higher priority to you.\n\nGnomoria has a lot of great features. You can craft arms and armor for your gnomes, or craft trinkets and statues for trade. You can farm food and brew drinks to keep your gnomes alive through the winter. Fend off goblin invasions, endure monster and animal attacks, and brave the deepest caves. There is, undeniably, a lot to do in Gnomoria. If any of that sounds fun to you, I think that you'll find this game to be worth the modest price. I've enjoyed Gnomoria, that much is true, but what's more is that I will definitely continue to enjoy it for some time.","October 12, 2015","true","110.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Clearly comparable to Dwarf Fortress, but much simpler to use and play.  Much lighter on detail and immersion than DF, which could be seen as either pro/con.

They dont have absurd passions or phobias.

Think Minecraft meets the Sims, but instead of a house, you build a small settlement (or a huge sprawling, multi-level fortress that goes 40 stories below the earth).\n\n+Begin with a small group of workers with various skills.\n+Assign them tasks, giving priority or preference to those you deem more vital.\n+Watch them execute the tasks and make logical adjustments, altering terrain and tasks to meet needs.\n+Harvest resources, build structures, and defend your settlement until new immigrants arrive.\n+Defend against enemies, both natural and fantastical, preparing your workers through acquisition of resources, trading, and training their skills.\n+Workers get better at tasks the more often they do them, with each having their own hunger, thirst, and stats. Can change occupations or create your own custom classes using a system of priorities for each task (Agriculture, Smithing, Mining, etc).\n\nIt's one of those games you begin at 1800 and take a break, check the clock, and curse the fact that somehow it's now 0600 the next day and you only get 2 hours to prep for work.  Strongly recommended for weekend play only!\n\nDeveloper is regularly updating this game, putting it beyond the immediate competition in that regard.

Depth of features such as animals, and lore, as well as late game appeal(plus it's free), put DF in the lead. If you don't mind a "learning wall", Dwarf Fortress offers unmatched gameplay in the genre. However, if you want to get into a game without having to read wikis, and you want an easily approachable and understandable interface, Gnomoria gives you what DF doesn't.

This game has been described as "Dwarf Fortress Light with a twist", which is... honestly really accurate.  If you've ever wanted to try DF, but couldn't get past the ASCII, then this is a good way to start.\n\nThat said, it still doesn't hold your hand by any measure.  In fact, since it tries to be more "gamey" than DF's bent towards "realism", it can actually be somewhat harder to start, since there's a real penalty to just walling yourself off, and you can't just go with pure traps and crossbows behind fortifications from day 1.\n\nFor those of you that don't play Dwarf Fortress, the nature of this game is that it just plunks you down smack in the middle of some randomly-generated grassy field with no particular instruction but to try not to starve.  Dash for the tutorials/guides/Let's Play now.  If you want to live, you better be planting some wheat, pronto, and it's not a bad idea to do a little foraging and deforestation, while your miners dig a ditch around your encampment and burrow into some hills to set up a little cave to huddle in.  If you find some stone, congrats, you can make a "crude workshop", which bootstraps your economy from pounding rocks together to having a couple basic workshops like the sawmill and carpenter to finally getting basically one of every workshop in the list as you can find the materials it takes to make them, and have the space to squirrel them away.  After that, goblins come to kill you, so hopefully, you created a military and trained it, or you die.  You didn't? Oh, well, it's your fault for not taking time out to train your troops, rather than using their labor to farm to survive the coming Winter.\n\nThat said, it's not THAT hard, and there are difficulty sliders, but it's not a walk in the park, and there's basically nothing there to tell you when things are about to go seriously wrong.  (Kingdom Wealth, determined by what goods you produce, brings stronger enemies, and at 30k wealth, which is VERY easy to hit, you get very strong enemies starting to spawn in seiges... fanatically keeping wealth down is critical to survive.)  At least you have options to tone down the enemy...\n\nThe crafting system is also somewhat detailed to a somewhat pointless degree.  There are intermediate steps for many crafting projects that seem redundant.  You can't simply make a torch out of some log you chopped down, you have to first saw the log into a plank, then split the plank into a stick, then turn one stick and one coal into a torch.  Making a shield takes two intermediate products, a shield boss and a shield backing, the shield backing only being used in that one specific recipe, so there's no reason to stockpile them.  Hypothetically, it can make certain projects take longer, but why not just make specific workshops slower to compensate?  It can wind up with clutter, both on the map, and in the menus.\n\nThere is a significantly drop in variety from Dwarf Fortress, but they do at least make the individual monsters, creatures, and plantlife mostly unique.  Goblins attack based upon kingdom worth.  Mants (giant ants) attack for food. Golems are created inside your mines when you don't clean up your mine debris. Skeletons, zombies, and beetles are found in unlit deep mines.\n\nThat said, there's definite room to grow here.  The game seems mostly focused upon the survival aspects, so the game is more based upon offering harder and harder fights at this moment than DF does.  However, it is not (yet) as sophisticated when it comes to engineering/physics exploits, or the capacity to create a compelling story.  Dwarf Fortress is such a great game because it allows for drastically different playstyles, from the challenge of modded super-invaders to crazy terraforming to creating a narrative from randomly generated characters.  The challenge is here, but the story is missing.  Gnomes differ only in what skills they have power-pumped so far, and there's no sense of a world beyond the boundaries on your play map.\n\nIn total, it's more akin to what Dwarf Fortress was back in the 2D era, where it had more obviously "gamey" elements, and a clear sense of progression when you cleared obstacles like chasms that spit out tougher monsters as you progressed, but rewarded you with better ores to build weapons.  DF has gone on to be more a "Performance Art Project" about being a simulation, while Gnomoria tries more to be a game with a difficulty curve.\n\nIf you want to have challenging fights and a sense of progression, Gnomoria has what you're looking for.  It's yet to even start on the epic world-building that DF has, so if you're more into playing a game to grow attached to some of the characters or see a story play out or play dollhouse or pretty princess dress-up, it's not there yet.  It has yet to even offer any terrain but grassy hills...","December 5, 2014","true","201.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Sorry.\n\nIt's still frustration prone and a huge time sink - but I didn't have 'fun'","March 31","false","21.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

That is how most people explain Gnomoria and I can't disagree. It's more accessible and easier to manage than DF, it already looks better with no need for mods, it's a similar principle without the headache and massive learning curve. Where as DF takes a very long time to master and is ultimately worth while, Gnomoria fits into that gap between a game that wants to be as good and deep as DF but for more casual players, or, a wider audience.\n\nI enjoyed this so much that I made 2 Gnome forts.

I had this title for a long time and only graced it with my attention recently. Honestly I did not think much of the game but somehow I ended up sinking into it a few days straight and still play it.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=201691160\nThe reason for that is... eluding me. So prepare for more of a rant than a well laid-out impression.\n\nGnomoria seems to be done well enough for an Early Access title - what's there is good enough. What's not there, well, is a huge pile of features that hopefully will be added one day. Seems fairly lackluster, right? But somehow Gnomoria plays good enough to drag me in. Building structures and designing layouts in the isometric view is enjoyable if a little limited for now due to the small variety of blocks. The camera can be a little awkward at times but the basic 4-way rotation saves the day in most cases.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=151089111\nThe economy is reasonable in terms of the supply chains - there are only a few basic resources to keep track of - making it easy to grasp the basics. But the dozens of ways to process and utilize those resources make for a deeply-interconnected web of processing pathways and making the most of available time and resources can be a challenge, as it should be! Nevertheless, it can also be a god-forsaken nightmare to manage the economy, mostly because of the Gnomes. There is no direct control over the peons and their activities, and even though a task priority system is in place it lacks fine-tuning and control within each task group (e.g. prioritising construction of one building over another). That's made even more difficult by the fact that there are way too few Gnomes to fill all the roles much less do it efficiently. Gnomes only join the settlement at the beginning of each season, their numbers and skills random, and the total population is capped with regards to the total worth of the settlement.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=226598146\nNow it'd be alright if time was not your enemy and Gnomes never died - sadly, neither is true. Unless playing in the Peaceful mode which disables enemies your Gnomes WILL BE KILLED by the dozen each season. Enemies are merciless, spawn with no regards to your wishes or objections, and even on Easy combat difficulty the game is god.damn HARD. What this means is that on top of managing the basic economy with way too few Gnomes at your disposal you still need to keep up the military production (weapons, armors, bandages) and training (which takes Gnomes off other tasks, naturally). Did I mention the game was difficult? No? Well it is!\n\nFor a brief summary I'll say Gnomoria is a decent sandbox title that has a lot of potential. It is also god.damn hard. If you like sandboxes and/or difficult management sims Gnomoria is a good choice.","February 25, 2014","true","126.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stupid_egg/recommended/224500/","stupid_egg","StupidEgg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stupid_egg/","376 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst, I would like to confess that I used to pirate games, lots and lots of games. Until one day I came upon Gnomoria, and I pirated it.\n\nThis was the game that make me feel guilty about myself, about the fact that I had pirated games. This was the game that help me realize how much efforts and love the devs had put into their games, especially the indie devs, and that having their game pirated is not what they deserve.\n\nI then uninstall the game and swore to never pirate another game again. Unfortunately although I can afford the game, it was difficult to make direct purchase where I live, so I had a friend gift it to me.\n\nWith the confession out of the way, now I would like to state the love I have for this game. This is a management game where you "program" the gnomes to build an empire of your own. That alone in this game is challenging enough and offers huge replay value, the enemies are just icing on the cake IMO.\n\nWhen I said "program", I really mean it. You don't control the gnomes. You can't even if you want to. The game has a special programming language of its own, which unfortunately still has no official tutorial yet, that you have to learn. Learning takes time, and during that time, your gnomes will die, and die, and die, and die... As soon as you figure out how to use the language, everything becomes much more easier and you will see your gnomes "operate" as you however you wish. There might be flaws in your programming, which you could only see the results of it, and when you do, you have to dig through all of your codings to find that little tiny error. It is frustrating, yet very satisfying when you found it.\n\nThe results of the errors might be manageable, however that is usually not the case. The thing is that the game is really unforgiving. The time you realize that there are flaws in your programming usually is when your gnomes are starving with crops not growing in the winter, or when your gnomes are dying of thirst and you are playing on a map with no water, or when your gnomes are being bitten and clubbed to death by angrily goblins, ogres and mants while your are busy decorating your great hall... and there goes your empire.\n\nAnd that is only the very basis of the game, which IMO already worth the price you paid for it. There are many more advanced mechanics in this game such as diplomacy, biting, trading, biting, gnome stats, biting, perks, biting, power and traps, biting, professions, biting... did I mention biting? Yes, there will be a lot of biting. And the fact that you can CUSTOMIZE ALMOST EVERYTHING SINGLE THING, which is my favorite aspect, brings the game onto a whole new level once you have mastered it.\n\nI've spent more than 100 hrs on Steam and many more in offline mode, which is almost all of my free time ever since I discover this gem.\n\ntl;dr. This is Minecraft in a much larger scale, with the same level or even more detailed micro management.\n\nPlus you can craft pet rocks.","January 28, 2015","true","152.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I played about 150 hours before I activated my Steam key. Since activating I've played almost 180 hours more. The developer has been diligently churning out regular updates and solid communication for the four years I've owned it. He has listened to the community and truly shows how early access can work well.\n\nGnomoria is one of the greatest base-building games ever. The random start conditions (and extensive options for customized starts) result in a new challenge each time. It's frequently punishing, occassionally frustrating, and consistently fun. Players can enjoy a complex village sim with emergent gameplay that rewards patience and perseverance.\n\nThere have been many who have described Gnomoria as "Dwarf Fortress Lite," which is not entirely inaccurate, but it's (mostly) modern UI and colorful sprites make it far easier to overcome it's learning curve. It's easily one of the friendliest dwarves building fortresses games out there.\n\nI highly recommend Gnomoria.","February 24","true","150.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

On one hand, i've gotten a decent 20 hours or so of actual play time out of it. On the other hand, I've completely discarded it and returned to Dwarf Fortress, which is free.\n\nI suppose I will recommend it based on the fact that it is decently enjoyable. For me the game was painfully easy to learn and master, which is the only real issue I have with it. There is no real end game. Once you have a sizeable fortress and a decent number of gnomes, all manner of goblins, ogres, beetles, and skeletons will become trivial.\n\nI suppose for 8$, 20 hours is acceptable. Keep in mind that I love this type of game, and have sunk hundreds of hours into games such as Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, Majesty, The Guild 2, etc.\n\nHowever, I loathe Minecraft which has a similar draw of "make structures that look pretty."

One thing I would love to have though is an "ultimate" job queue, a menu where you can access all ongoing jobs and order them(in the kind of fashion the Workshops do it but globally) and the information page on the individual tasks could be a bit more detailed i.e.: instead of just saying crafting item it could say something like "Crafting X item for Y task"(e.g.:Crafting chair for Task:Build Carpenter, etc...).\nThis way you can keeps track of what is going on and you could prioritize certain tasks.","August 15, 2014","true","26.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On one hand, i've gotten a decent 20 hours or so of actual play time out of it. On the other hand, I've completely discarded it and returned to Dwarf Fortress, which is free.\n\nI suppose I will recommend it based on the fact that it is decently enjoyable. For me the game was painfully easy to learn and master, which is the only real issue I have with it. There is no real end game. Once you have a sizeable fortress and a decent number of gnomes, all manner of goblins, ogres, beetles, and skeletons will become trivial.\n\nI suppose for 8$, 20 hours is acceptable. Keep in mind that I love this type of game, and have sunk hundreds of hours into games such as Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, Majesty, The Guild 2, etc.\n\nHowever, I loathe Minecraft which has a similar draw of "make structures that look pretty."

It's an attempt at a more accessible version of the legendarily complex Dwarf Fortress. If you've been following my reviews, you probably know that I place a fair amount of value on accessibility. Adding cute graphics and a, if not modern, at least mouse controlled interface are things I'm very much in favor of.\n\nUnfortunately, the similarly stripped-down complexity ends up losing the unique charm of its inspiration, without actually making the game friendly to those not initiated in the Dorfish ways. Like Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria is a game about systems and trying to keep them in equilibrium. Unlike Dwarf Fortress, it has systems simple enough to solve.\n\nThat wouldn't necessarily be a problem if Gnomoria's design moved further afield. But it retains the one save per world and glacial pace. As something to set running in the background and check in on intermittently, it can bring you some entertainment. But it's too slow and too punitive, for too few interesting decisions, to pour the kind of time into that it expects.","June 3","false","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I feel like there needs to be a triple speed function instead of just normal and 2x. Your gnomes won't really think of using other workshops if you build them after starting an order and they usually try to make everything out of wood. The mason shop will sit empty as they furiously use one carpenter bench to fill out an order for 8 chairs and tables. The UI is pretty good, only thing that bothered me was you can't right click for orders when you're highlighting a stockpile. Combat is alright but you have to manually access the event logs to read the fight details in a tiny window.

If you've ever been curious about Dwarf Fortress, but were intimidated by the lack of UI and graphics, Gnomoria is a fantastic game to jump into. Orders you give to your gnomes will be followed according to the guidelines you set. You do not directly control them, but you affect how they behave by determining the gnome's professions, priorities,  and other parameters you impose. It becomes an extremely fun balancing act of figuring out exactly how to acheive true efficiency while also struggling to plan ahead. The more expansive and 'worthy' your empire becomes, the greater dangers arrive to destroy it. It takes hours to finally feel like you've gotten a foothold in the world you've generated, but when you do, you feel a great sense of pride in what your tiny gnome society has accomplished.\n\nThe only gripes I would have would be the lack of variety in environments as well as the flora and fauna. New biomes as well as new animals and trees would make this game way more replayable. Also, this game has no form of tutorial so the learning curve is quite steep. It took me 3 different restarts before I fully understood the importance of key aspects of the game like action priorities, training a strong military, and proper item storage to name a few. The wiki and video tutorials should definitely be used when first starting off. Beyond that, the game is definitely worth the eight dollar inevestment and is worth your time.

This is indeed very similar, yet it's very worth your time in its own. Think of this as DF a hundred times more relaxed and less complex, but a thousand times prettier. I would call it a friendlier Dwarf Fortress.\n\nNow, if you really don't know anything about either game, this is a management / sandbox game. You start with a crew of settler gnomes, and that's pretty much it; you're thrown into the wild and after that it depends on you; these gnomes can and will use materials around them at your command, build structures as complex as you can imagine, fight your battles and of course, deplete your alcohol and foods. Doing these simple things plus all the intrincate delicacies will take most of your time, and as you expect from any good game... you won't know how much time you have sunk in here.\n\n10/10\n","October 8, 2015","true","434.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Still recommended, just less so. I've probably spent 2-3 times the hours played in Dwarf fortress than Gnomoria since I last wrote the Gnomoria review, so I definitely prefer DF.\n\nIf you loved Dwarf Fortress, but wish it was just a little easier on the interface and the eyes, look no further than Gnomoria.\n\nGnomoria vs. Dwarf Fortress Comparison:\n\nInterface: Average versus Horrible.\nGraphics: Average versus Horrible.\nOverall Depth: Good versus Amazing.\nCombat Depth: Average versus Great (Upgraded DF's combat depth due to recent release that have mercenaries and more usable war animals).\nMechanism/Trap Customization: Average versus Amazing\nSimulation/Realism: Average versus Amazing.\nLearning Curve: High versus Colossal. (2 hrs versus 12 hrs)\nPacing: Superb versus Good.\n\n-----\n\nFurther comment on pacing: Gnomoria imho has amazing pacing, it takes forever to achieve things in Gnomoria, but it doesn't feel that way until you stare at the clock and realize you just lost 5 hours setting up 5 rooms because of the four intervening goblin raids with Ogre support and food shortage. Yet, you were having a blast and didn't notice how much time went by.

Dig holes, carve stairs, collect and smelt ores, harvest trees, collect food, create tools, weapons, armor, traps, furniture, and more.\n\nYou don't do things, you tell your gnomes to do it, kinda like the Sims.  And the best part is, you can set the task or an area of tasks and the best qualified gnome or gnomes will do it.  Clear cut that forest!  Mine that 10 x 24 area!  Make 20 chestplates!  And the more robust your kingdom, the more likely you are to attract more suckers!  Ahem.  Gnomes, more gnomes.\n\nInvasions, enemies, death and dismemberment.  The combat logs show quite a bit of data and some rather unexpected things can happen, unexpected and permanent things.\nSo and so slashes the goblin's left arm.  Goblin drops its shield.\nGoblin stabs past the cuirass, through the chest, through the ribs, and into the heart.  So and so is bleeding.  So and so is dead.\nHoney Badger bites so and so's leg and tears it off.  So and so lost their left leg. (permanently for now)\n\nBut dismemberment doesn't mean death, but it does mean limited functionality for your gnome.  Do you let the one legged wonder hobble around and craft in the workshop, leave their job as is and wonder how good a one armed woodsman is, or do you tell them to strip and go attack that bear's stomach from the inside?\n\nIt might look limiting at first because the surface world doesn't go on seemingly forever like Minecraft, or all that far at all.  However, it does go down quite far (-100 and still digging).  I haven't seen how far myself, but think the Mines of Moria from LoTR.  Yes, treasures can be found deep, but so can other dangers...  Bring lots of torches!\n\nAnyway, I've logged roughly 40 or so hours, and even in its rough and unfinished stage, it is a blast that I can't get enough of.  Well worth the investment in this indie title.","January 7, 2014","true","440.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/revolutehell/recommended/224500/","revolutehell","[KOR] Jake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/revolutehell/","150 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI recommend this game for those searching for a game similar to DF (and a lot of patience). Among indie games, I find this more polished and fun than others. Recently, I've seen many early access games on managing a town/castle like this but Gnomoria is the one that has basic features implented for now.\nGnomoria is also quite challenging, 45 hours of playtime is merely at the stage of grasping the basics of this game. For me, it took 5 hours to understand digging and building, 10 more hours to understand creating items and extra 25 to know I was doing it all wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, this game is rather unfriendly; no tutorials, no explanation except a little bit of text that can be found in Help menu. Around 30-40 different buttons to utilize, yet without any description on what it does. Some are straight forward, setting up a farm area is one. But other buttons such as Dig Stairs Up and Mine Stairs Down may be a little bit confusing combined with 3D textile map in which tiles overlap each other.\nFor those who likes to rage quit or play very casually (playing most games on normal or easy difficulty), Gnomoria is not recommended.","January 11, 2014","true","112.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I say simplified because the starting supplies and location are pre-defined based on starting conditions when rendering the world.

There are plenty of options to customize the game to your liking, and mods are also available.\n\nIf you're not too familiar with this type of game, I strongly recommend trying the demo first.

But everything in this game is built with a reliance on something else. Learning those relationships and how to maximize your productivity is exceptionally fun (in my opinion) especially when the game is so fair.\n\nEvery time I've lost a gnome, starved out my colony, or dug too deep too quick (you'll see why) I would sit back, cry a little about the last 20 hours that I just burned into the ground, and say "ok... that's fair... lets try again."\n\nIf you've ever sunk 200 turns into Civilization after swearing you'd go to bed this game is no different. "Just another 10 minutes" always turns into hours of doing things! Alot of these games have moments of busy work then a sit back and watch factor but I have ALWAYS found something to do with every minute in Gnomoria.\n\nI know this might just sound like a gush about the game but I absolutely love this title and the dev is still updating frequently.

You need to have them build a kingdom ( or queendom dempending on what you want) to thrive and prosper through the peralis world while defending yourself through theifs and monsters that want to plunder your materials and crafts or just murder everyone. You can also have them build stalls to attrack merchants as your kingdoms wealth increases and buy and sell things like animals food and materials. Although its a pretty neat game the gnomes AI on how to complete tasks like replacing floor tiles is a bit wonky. Your gnomes will comonly get stuck and die if left to there own devices so you do have to mannage them frequently. Plus they dont like to build things like workshops if theres other jobs that need to be done. All in all it is a decent game with a few major bugs that will be worked out eventually and so on.","February 17, 2014","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hear what people are saying about the devs giving up and how it could have been so much more, and all that is true. However the reason they dropped it was because the game was not getting enough attention. They were tanking on money so they had to move on. Maybe if enough new people started showing interest then they would pick it back up? I dont really know though. Even still what they have left is a great game and I think people are being a little narrow minded in saying it couldve been more. I mean look at it. Enjoy what you got guys this game is fantastic.

Wheelbarrows don't work, gnomes will pass an unused wheelbarrow hundreds of times that I carefully placed between the Item they're picking up and the stockpile they're taking it to.  Goblins can't find the door to my settlement so they bring tunnelers, this would be more of a problem, but they can't seem to find the tunnels they dig either.  When goblins can get in you're screwed, soldiers won't pick up or wear armor even though I told them to retreat to get armor, gnomes like to attack one at a time and fan out instead of all attacking the same target like I selected.  Production will stop waiting for applewood logs, despite specifically telling the workshop to build it with pine boards instead of applewood boards, my sawmills are set to only make pine boards because I don't have apple logs; but the game has decided it wants applewood so I have to delete and re-enter my instructions and hope.  Workshop build queues are a suggestion instead of a rule, it doesn't matter that I have sticks and coal and have torches on the top of the queue, the workshop decided now was the time to make a barrel out of applewood because the last thing in my queue was pint barrels.\n\nThere are zero instructions within the game.  You have to go to a wiki that's security certificate has been expired for three months.  Then the info there is often out of date.  The guides on the internet by other players are all old from non-relevant versions of the game.\n\nYou can navigate three menus deep or use a shortcut to the exact thing you want.  If you're in the build menu you can't go to the mining menu, you have to go all the way out and then all the way back in.  You can setup hotkeys for things like "mine wall" or "dig ramp down", but if you want to "dig hole" or "dig ramp up" or "dig stairs down" you would have to have a separate hotkey for each of those commands.  You can't go to the dig up commands or the dig down commands you have to go through the hole menu again.  There are three dig up commands and three dig down commands, but these are on different menu bars despite there being enough space on one bar.  You can't mine more than one level at a time, if you want to make a mine shaft 10 layers down, you have to manually dig on each layer and hope they line up, otherwise a section of your shaft is now one square off.  You should be able to click and drag on more than one layer.\n\nYou can't copy professions or their task priority, if I want to make a mason that's exactly like a miner except he does workshop tasks before mining you have to re-make the entire profession from scratch and hope you get it right.  You can make a new profession in the character menu, but then you can't give that new named profession to anyone else, you would have to re-created it in the correct profession menu.\n\nThe game is out, but we still need immigrant gnomes, no new gnomes can be made in your kingdom you just have to hope you get enough new gnomes to cover from your last goblin attack.  No baby gnomes.  No copy and paste, Gnomes still ignore dirt piles while putting seeds in my stockpiles to just let dirt golems spawn.  The problem isn't just that you don't have any control, but that the game gives you options to imply the illusion on some kind of control.  I know you can't control the Gnomes directly but I said to pick up dirt piles and ignore those seeds!!!","June 6","false","302.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said i'm a big fan of every city-building or strategy games of quality on steam and this one is definitely part of them.  At first, don't be fooled with the early access tag, this game feels much more complete then a few other titles i bought that claimed to be a finished product.  Add to that the fact that the developer constantly update the game.  Now for the gameplay the game can be confusing at first but the help tab in the main interface can answer most of your questions and will teach you the basics.  For the rest well it's up to you to discover the deeper features of the game which from my point of view makes it interesting.  The also have a very adjustable difficulty, which allows you to play the game as a city-building sim without any combat or harm to your growing city to an extreme survival experience where the threats to end your fledling settlement are plenty.\n\nIn short, gnomoria has all you need to please all kind of strategy/city-building type of players and it's replayabilty with it's customizable maps, various difficulty levels and frequent new content makes it worth every dollar spent on this game.","April 27, 2014","true","193.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(For example the failures of Citadels and Stronghold 3).   It was perfectly stable, clean and best of all, fun.  This gnome management game has only improved since then.  Gnomoria is a top down, micro management game all about the balance between defence and your economy.  To help describe this game, it may be easier to think of it as a simplified dwarf fortress.  So far Gnomoria has recieved numerous and frequent updates throughout the entiety of its developement.  (As you may have noticed, this fact is quite rare.)\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics in this game are nothing special.  That being said, its simple, 2d and nice to look at for quite some time.  It fits the gameplay and overall feel of the game.  It doesn't become an eyesore after a few hours like a bad minecraft texture pack.  The only real complaint a perfectionist could have with the graphics is the animation of gnomes moving through tiles, But trust me when i say it irrelavent for this type of game.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nThis is why you play this game.  All the way from the growth rate of trees, to the construction pathways for needed tools and weapons.  The only item that needs work is the settable priority for starage zones and work benches (which the developer has been and continues to work on.)\nThe core gameplay is all about setting tasks and then the allocation of gnomes to that type of task.  More like running a business than a typical rts.\nI must advise all new players build a terrain wall around thier settlement and get the basics before managing combat.\n\nStrengths.\nAs addictive as minecraft.\nOnce you set up your economy and defences, its quite easy to play whilst watching a movie or anime.\n\nWeaknesses:\nFor those who are not patient, do not bother. Completing a task can take days ingame and real time hours.\nCan be annoying to debug why a specific task is not being completed.\n\n\nSummary:\nOne of the most unique games that i have played in the genre.  Once you get the hang of it, its an excellent game. (just do not expect your first try to do anything other than fail miserably.)\nI have easily put over 50 hours into this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theophrastusbombastus/recommended/224500/","theophrastusbombastus","Theophrastus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theophrastusbombastus/","734 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGnomoria is a game in which you start out with a small team of 9 Gnomes and are tasked with giving those Gnomes various jobs with the ultimate goal of turning the wilderness you start off in into a bustling kingdom. As the value of your kingdom increases, you will attract more "Gnomads", and gain the attention of other kingdoms, both friendly and hostile. If you don't want to deal with the latter, you can set the difficulty to "Peaceful", which eliminates enemy spawns. The game only ends if your kingdom is completely wiped out, or if you get bored and give up. This might sound a bit familiar to some people, as Dwarf Fortress (and Dungeon Keeper, The Settlers, and Anno) was a big inspiration for the game. The developer clearly states this in the FAQ on the game's official website. This game does not have the sheer, unbridled complexity of Dwarf Fortress. It makes up for this by being much more accessible while still having a good amount of depth, and having its own innovations and ways of doing things compared to DF.\n\nNow, the game currently lacks a tutorial, so you will need to either spend the first few hours experimenting to get a feel for things, or consult a guide/wiki while you are playing to speed things up. If that's a dealbreaker for you, I'd suggest waiting until the tutorial is actually implemented, whenever that is. That all being said, the game is still more immediately accessible than DF in my opinion due the graphics and simple mouse-based interface. The game also does not have any actual animation for character movement, somewhat true to its inspiration, but I have personally never found this to be an obstacle to my enjoyment. All it means is that the sprites "jump around" from one tile to the next rather than spending frames actually animating their arms and legs moving, which actually speeds everything up. There's also only one biome available right now, but there are plans to add some more eventually (the two specifically mentioned in the development roadmap are "Desert" and "Jungle").\n\nThe game is under active development, with updates coming fairly regularly with a schedule of one update every 2 weeks (minus the occasional hotfix). New features are added often, and as is often the case with such things new bugs will pop up. That being said, the game is very stable and the vast majority of bugs are a mere annoyance. There's nothing truly gamebreaking to worry about.\n\nA common question that comes up on the Steam discussion forums is "how does this game compare to Towns?". I have not actually played Towns, but I know enough to at least say that the gimmick of "attracting Heroes and having them clear out a huge dungeon for you so your citizens can bring up the loot" is not present in Gnomoria. You have to dig your own mines, and you'll have to organize your own military to deal with the problem if you find yourself encountering monsters while you're doing it.\n\nBottomline: If you're the type of person who is enamored by the idea of Dwarf Fortress, but really just don't want to deal with learning how to wrangle with DF's unintuitive keyboard interface, or if you find DF to be essentially unplayable without throwing a bunch of mods on top of it and just don't want to deal with that, I cannot recommend Gnomoria enough. If you have no idea what Dwarf Fortress even is, but like the concept of the game described at the top of this review, I'd also say it's worth checking out.","May 1, 2014","true","173.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I used to play "Towns" which in some senses is about the same... but "Towns" lacks a LOT of what this game has to offer.  Especially love the raids of goblins, mants, etc to keep you on your toes. (Giving you don't CAREBEAR a wall on the outside borders to prevent spawning lol) Plus each game has a lot of ability to customize various settings to go from easy, carefree living to tooth and nail blood bath scraping by to survive.\n\nBest of all, this game is still under active development and very playable during that time. Each patch normally comes with some pretty good updates to increase and enhance various aspects of the game.\n\nSome things I would like to see?\n\n# More Kingdoms, with ability to go to war with more than just the Goblins\n# Ability to send a war party to other kingdoms to raid for supplies, with settings to determine when to pull back so you dont lose all your Gnomes\n# Ability to incorporate player created modifications to the game to massively expand the creavity of the game\n#Ability to control gnomes to give direct commands (Toggled option, as some people probably wish to stay with the default roaming gnomes)\n#MMO Server with kingdoms that you can trade with and go to war against to raid (Far off dream I'm sure, but hey I can dream)\n\nThere are other things I could think off, but I'll just sit back and enjoy the game while I watch what unfolds in due time.\n\nRecommended purchase? Certainly, as long as you are paitent and willing to learn a game that may have a somewhat steep learning curve.","May 9, 2014","true","114.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(For example the failures of Citadels and Stronghold 3).   It was perfectly stable, clean and best of all, fun.  This gnome management game has only improved since then.  Gnomoria is a top down, micro management game all about the balance between defence and your economy.  To help describe this game, it may be easier to think of it as a simplified dwarf fortress.  So far Gnomoria has recieved numerous and frequent updates throughout the entiety of its developement.  (As you may have noticed, this fact is quite rare.)\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics in this game are nothing special.  That being said, its simple, 2d and nice to look at for quite some time.  It fits the gameplay and overall feel of the game.  It doesn't become an eyesore after a few hours like a bad minecraft texture pack.  The only real complaint a perfectionist could have with the graphics is the animation of gnomes moving through tiles, But trust me when i say it irrelavent for this type of game.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nThis is why you play this game.  All the way from the growth rate of trees, to the construction pathways for needed tools and weapons.  The only item that needs work is the settable priority for starage zones and work benches (which the developer has been and continues to work on.)\nThe core gameplay is all about setting tasks and then the allocation of gnomes to that type of task.  More like running a business than a typical rts.\nI must advise all new players build a terrain wall around thier settlement and get the basics before managing combat.\n\nStrengths.\nAs addictive as minecraft.\nOnce you set up your economy and defences, its quite easy to play whilst watching a movie or anime.\n\nWeaknesses:\nFor those who are not patient, do not bother. Completing a task can take days ingame and real time hours.\nCan be annoying to debug why a specific task is not being completed.\n\n\nSummary:\nOne of the most unique games that i have played in the genre.  Once you get the hang of it, its an excellent game. (just do not expect your first try to do anything other than fail miserably.)\nI have easily put over 50 hours into this game.  Its amazing to see a game in beta that is already near the top of its genre.\n\n","November 26, 2013","true","46.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's that game in the center of the scale, balancing between Dwarf Fortress and SimTown in difficulty. Aside from that, Gnomoria is a quaint little title, that is decently good. The game (As said by the description in the Shop) Is a game where you manage a small group of Gnomes who've left their past residences to form a new kingdom, and you must play that "God-like" Entity and help them thrive in this dangerous new landscape, by giving them orders to designate an area living quarters or Farm and have them construct such. However, the game is a bit stiff in that it's a tad difficult figuring our how to mine at first, as well as finding a source of water and how to stop a Gnome from building somewhere they should not.\n\nOverall, Gnomoria is a fine little game, not as good as others of it's genre (It's still in the begining phases) but it is getting there.\n\nOriginality: 7\nMechanics: 6\nPolish: 6\n\nRating: 6.3/10\n\nTips for New Gnomes!\n\nTo mine use the "Mine Wall" option under "Terrain"\n\nTo stop someone from building a designation where it shouldn't be, use "Cancel Job"\n\nAnd don't dig further than depth 7.

I'm a fan of strategy games and building sims and was looking for a new one to get into.  I read that Gnomoria was like Dwarf Fortress light and I was intrigued.  I've wanted for a long time to get into Dwarf Fortress but have been repeatedly thwarted by the downright arcane interface.  I just can't get past it.\n\nThat being said, this game still does not hold your hand.  There is no tutorial at all, you are simply dropped into the game and expected to figure it out through trial and error, or lots and lots of internet research like I did.  It reminded me a lot of my time learning to play Don't Starve, another game that I absolutely love.\n\nI'm not going to talk too much about the details of the game because honestly nobody is going to read this anyway and there are plenty of other resources that discuss that, but I am going to say that I like how the game does not really force you into fighting.  The enemies do not get stronger as time goes on (though you can switch a setting so that they do if you want) but rather they only get stronger as your kingdom value increases or as you dig deeper (depending on enemy type).  This means that there is no "ticking clock" component to the game (again, unless you want there to be) and you are free to just build if you want only really running into danger if you let your military fall too far behind the other aspects of your kingdom.  If you dig too deep too fast or build too much too soon without developing your military you are in for a bad time.\n\nOr, you can just turn enemies off and ignore combat altogether.\n\nIf you are a fan of strategy games, building sims, economy sims, and just sandbox games in general where the only objective is really just to build what you want, then I think that the $15 is stupidly cheap for the number of entertainment hours you will get from Gnomoria.

Once I did though, it was worth the effort.  It’s a great mix of exploration, building, and managing your population of gnomes.  The menus are sometimes difficult to use (especially trading with merchants which requires scrolling through long lists) and I’ve seen an update cause my gnomes to ignore their thirst until it kills them, but it’s also under active development so things are changing and new stuff keeps getting added.  Despite it being an early access game, I think there's enough there already to make it worth its full price.","April 21, 2014","true","429.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has a steep learning curve, but is very rewarding once you learn the basics.\n\nWhen starting your game you have the option to choose how large the map is, how flat it is, and how steep the terrain is.\nYou also have the added bonus of choosing a difficulty to start on. I say bonus because not only can you select basic difficulties but you can also go into the settings and mess around with the types of monsters (you can even remove monsters altogether), their strength, how many come at a time, and how often they come.\nThis is just the customization for your map, I haven't even gotten to the game itself yet!\n\nIn the interest of keeping this brief I will list just a few different things I like about the game:\n- Great customization (pretty much everything you do will be unique to the way you like to play)\n- Changeable music styles (It's actually the same music but you can change it between an 8-bit "classic" style and a more modern "orchestral")\n- Good for casual or serious gaming (With the difficulty settings you can make the game relatively easy and peaceful or very hard and challenging)\n- Lots of replayability (I play the game quite a bit and have created many different levels, I have yet to run out of things to do or new ideas to try)\n- Sandbox (If you can think it, you can build it. Making a kingdom? I suggest the "Huge" map size)\n- Early Access Game (Unlike numerous abysmal Early Access games, this one feels very finished and the developer is still working to make it even better)\n\nI might also add that there are many guides on Steam and the internet that can explain some of the more difficult parts of the game. Aside from a few minor bugs that still need to be ironed out, this game is very entertaining and well worth the price.","January 20, 2014","true","486.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

As you improve their new home, more Gnomes will arrive that you must feed, provide shelter for and issue orders to.\n\nI'm really enjoying this game when I play it. I can pause at any time and issue orders, which is a real plus for me because I can use all the time I wish to plan several moves ahead. The pause feature also allows me to play this game as I do other tasks around the house or while at work.\n\nBe advised, there are no animations as of the last time I played it. Also, the control interface still needs polish. Once you get used to it it's not too bad, but it's takes some time to achieve that comfort zone.\n\nI also have some issue with the 2D terrain where I'm not always sure how terrain on one level will interact with the terrain above and below it, particularly with trying to place/remove dirt and stairs. Might just be me though.\n\nDevelopers are making progress and have not put this one on the back-burner as is happening with too many pre-releases on Steam lately.\n\nUsual advice is that you should peruse youtube for as much footage of the game, filtering for the most recent videos for the latest release versions, before you buy. Also try to get it on sale. When it's on sale, it's a no brainer.","April 6, 2014","true","105.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most games that have "crafting" development, require a player to micro-manage each step of a raw material extraction - refinement - multi-stage construction.  In this game however, if the player has provided the necessary tools and labor allocation, the workers actually can work, automatically all the way through the proccess on their own, with blacksmiths, stone carvers, and carpenters each doing their part to make your "ordered" final pieces constructed.\n\nGreat game, great attention to detail - perhaps a bit overwhelming at first - to which I suggest watching a couple of youtube videos.","May 3, 2014","true","34.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You eventuly start to develope a gnome community weather in an underground fortress, a sprawling castle, or even a village where everyone has their own home. From developing and training an army to defend your people from Animals, Goblins, and many other mythical creatures, to playing peaceful mining rescorces to build the bigest collest thing you can think of. In Gnomoria the possibilities are endless.\n\nOn top of all that, it is under $10! It is pretty much what Towns could have been and it isnt even finished yet!

If you're not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria is a game about building a place for your gnomes to work, eat, drink, sleep, and live their lives. Some improvements on Dwarf Fortress are that the UI is very intuitive, and I can craft goods out of a specific material and automatically set workshops to craft missing components of an object I'm building. I've also been happy with the regular update pace, although unfortunately this game is not moddable (at least at the moment).

Gnomoria is still under development but that doesn't stop it from being fun. Updates are frequent and the developer is ingratiated with the community, often seen discussing game mechanics on the forums with other users. As for the game itself, it's virtually Dwarf Fortress with a mouse GUI. Features an 8-bit or midi-orchestral custom soundtrack which will graft itself into your grey matter.\n\nFor all the building you will be doing, the meat of the game lies within the combat, and squads. Uniforms are made(you designate the material and quality of each piece of armor and weapon that uniform will use), soldiers use these uniforms and perks, formations use soldiers and their own perks as well, and finally squads are made designating formation, and what gnomes will be in what position.\n\nNow to clear up my earlier statement, this game doesn't try to become Dwarf Fortress with mouse support, but it is obviously heavily inspired. Do not come looking for the complexity that DF contains, though for finished releases and beyond, I can't say. Enemies are unique in their own way. Golems spawn underground in the dark, with their strength determined by the depth. Goblins and the like will spawn ground level at the edge of the map. Animals as well, but you typically see goblins during night or morning whereas animals are more popular during the day. Mants will raid you with strength and numbers based on your food stockpile.\n\nI've followed the development of this game for over half a year and I can honestly say it's been one of the few early access games(had it before it was on steam) that I've never had one regret purchasing.","November 28, 2013","true","28.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I come back to you again and again and can't get enough.  You suck up my time.  Time that I meant to use to get to know other games.  Yet, I always return to you...\n\nI love the idea of Dwarf Fortress, it's fantastic and quirky.  But ASCII graphics?  I put up with ASCII graphics back in the early 80s.  Gnomoria removes that problem.\n\nPros:  if you like sandbox village management games.  Yes.  You should buy this game now.  Why are you still reading this?\n\nOther Pros:  I realize Gnomoria is defined by Dwarf Fortress (they are the same game) right down to the quirky names for legendary items.  For instance, my cook creates a legendary sandwich.  The sandwich gets a name.  That name is the Hateful Spite.  You build your underground (or above ground) village.  You start up production of tables and chairs and various and sundry things that you will place in your Gnomish Colony (it's had to call it a city because I've only ever got up to 45 gnomes) to raise the value of your little colony to attract more gnomes...and badies who come to steal, kill, and destroy what you worked so hard to make.  (you can turn that off by the way)\n\nCons:\nDon't expect amazing, splendiforious graphics of amazing splendiforousness.  Minecraft graphics and Gnomoria graphics...it's kind've a toss up as to which is better.  I think Minecraft has an edge in my humble opinion.\n\nThe balancing of attackers to defenders and the rate at which they appear is...not good.  If you approach the game knowing that the badies will eventually beat your gnomes to a bloody pulp you're golden.  I dislike putting myself into that mindset.  It would be nice if the developers put in an in-game adjustable scale for those times you just want the badies to leave you alone, but still allow for those times when you're ready to let Gnomeggedon begin--and see if you're preparations can handle it.\n\nThe interface does take some getting used to.  I suggest using the menu at the bottom instead of the right mouse menu.\n\nAt the moment 3 December 2013, the game has some serious lag issues once all your items approach 8-12k.  I do hope that gets fixed.\n\nSummary:\nIt's amazing!  This game, in my opinion, is better than Drawf Fortress, mostly because the graphical user interface allows for easier access while still keeping most of the concepts, quirkiness, and spirit of the original.","December 3, 2013","true","312.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is, overall, a simple graphic update to dwarf fortress that is a tad dumbed down. That said it is one of the most complex town/ colonization sim I have played that keeps you entertained for a long time. I played it before it was on steam and was excited to see it come out finally, but since it got on steam there hasn't been a whole lot of development. I'm really waiting for the end product to show up. As it stands once you have built everything you run out of things to do because you can literally walk away from the computer and your town will do fine most of the time. Its worth buying as is, and I can really see the potential in the end product. But its like getting halfway through a book and finding out the author of the series you are halfway through died without writing the last books, and unlike Robert Jordan, the author didn't leave notes that someone else could follow to write the ending to a monumental series.\n\nPros\n-Manage a settlement of gnomes\n-You can micromanage as much as you want\n-Simple graphics, but not a text game\n-Addictive, way too much of my life\n-Challenging\n-Customizable difficulties\n-Diplomacy looks promising if it ever gets improved, like maybe I want to conduct a raid on a neighboring goblin kingdom instead of just insulting them\n\nCons\n-Stupid zombies and beetles\n-Steep learning curve\n-Not much developement on the game, snails pace\n-Produces a lot of activity that I never get from other games on my CPU\n-No tiered crafting system- the Gnomes can make everything as soon as there are materials and the skills involved don't change the end product enough that it matters- only skills that improve anything are fighting skills, and farming.\n-Trade doesn't really change over time- you get wealthier but your neighbors stay the same\n\nI realize I have a lot of cons but some of them I enjoy like the steep learning curve, and just the way the game works.","June 12, 2015","true","247.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So in Gnomoria, no gnome is going to craft a goblet and then encrust it with a certain jewel that's associated with an anchient dwarf hero who's story is depicted in engravings on that cup.\n\nSo you can't make a sprawling dwarf fortress, play for centuries, then make 1 single mistake involving lava, and the fort falls into ruins.

Often remarked as Dwarf Fortress Lite, it is a game that puts you in charge of a community of gnomes, and gives you the task of making sure they survive and thrive. Sound easy? It's not. There are many things that need to be managed, and your first few communities are almost guaranteed to die off. The control scheme and menus are at first daunting, but once you figure out the HOW of things, it's surprisingly intuitive (Hint: Right click controls almost everything). But no matter how skilled at controlling the game you become, there will always be new things to learn. From base defense against goblins biting your hearts, to properly lighting your mines so golems don't come out of the deep, there will always be new challenges, and new ways to solve those challenges. As you attempt better structures and more elaborate designs, the enemies will react to your increased worth and start bringing armor, and bigger friends, though you will also attract more gnome migrants (Known as gnomads). So if the controls seem oppressive, don't lose hope. Look up a let's play of the game, watch for a bit, then mimic. You'll quickly figure it out, and have the time of your life.","March 19, 2014","true","202.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As you improve their new home, more Gnomes will arrive that you must feed, provide shelter for and issue orders to.\n\nI'm really enjoying this game when I play it. I can pause at any time and issue orders, which is a real plus for me because I can use all the time I wish to plan several moves ahead. The pause feature also allows me to play this game as I do other tasks around the house or while at work.\n\nBe advised, there are no animations as of the last time I played it. Also, the control interface still needs polish. Once you get used to it it's not too bad, but it's takes some time to achieve that comfort zone.\n\nI also have some issue with the 2D terrain where I'm not always sure how terrain on one level will interact with the terrain above and below it, particularly with trying to place/remove dirt and stairs. Might just be me though.\n\nDevelopers are making progress and have not put this one on the back-burner as is happening with too many pre-releases on Steam lately.\n\nUsual advice is that you should peruse youtube for as much footage of the game, filtering for the most recent videos for the latest release versions, before you buy. Also try to get it on sale. When it's on sale, it's a no brainer.","April 6, 2014","true","105.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

People usually compare this game to Dwarf Fortress. For people who have never played or heard of Dwarf Fortress, let me explain it for you. It's a survival game, with a twist. The twist is that you control groups of people instead of being your own person.\n\nPros:\n-Easy to get into. There is no tutorial, but a few youtube videos will get you started.\n\n-Good graphics that don't hurt your eyes (I'm looking at you DF)\n\n-Amazing soundtrack. You can choose the classic 8-bit songs, or remixed orchestrated songs. There is something for everyone.\n\n-In depth job/skill system. Some gnomes are better at tasks then others. Gnomes that are bad at a skill will improve if you give them more experience.\n\n-Trading with merchants.\n\n-Good survival elements. You have to keep a steady supply of food and water depending on your population. The game also has all four seasons which bring challenges to overcome.\n\n-Plenty of things to do and never gets old. You can keep a game going for hundreds of hours. It's up to you.\n\nCons:\n- Only complaint I have with this game is that there are very few mods. Recently the game added workshop support, but mods are very small and you can only enable one mod at a time.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like survival or city builder type games, then this is the game for you.","October 11, 2015","true","20.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd say this game is the best in it's class, but there really isn't another class quite like it.  It is one of my favorite games of all time.  A pretty incredible effort from a small development team.\n\nThis game is basically a Gnome civilization simulator.  It's unique, because you instruct your gnomes where and what to build, mine, farm, defend, patrol... in an entirely open world, and then give them specific specializations with detailed instruction lists of what to prioritize, by specific class of gnome, and then sit back and watch them do it.\n\nIt's so detailed, you actually benefit from having a dedicated brewer, that makes higher quality beer faster.  That pretty much sold me.  But that's just the beginning.   There isn't any other game I've come across with this much detail.\n\nYou will actually get pretty attached to your gnomes, and you'll inevetabily make some mistakes that will get a few of them killed, but you can just restart from a recent save file if you want.  There's virtually no limit to the creativity you can use designing your fortress, and you can make some pretty elaborate designs.\n\nThere are some con's to the game.  The graphics are pretty much sprites.  There's a lot of variety and honestly it does a great job adding to the feel of the game, and honestly you're probably not interested in this type of game for the graphics.\n\nSecond, the updates have slowed down quite a bit.  The game is still being developed, but by a single person or a very small team, and honestly it's just really slow.  In it's current state though, it still is an incredible game.  There's a few little bugs still, but nothing you can't easily work around.\n\nThird, after surviving a few years, it becomes less dangerous.  Especially if you've researched and are smart enough to design mechanical devices to mostly insulate yourself from the progressively more dangerous monsters that continue to appear outside your door.  From that point forward, it become mostly about digging very deep for some of the best metals to be found in the game, to forge some great weapons and  armor, but at that point the mechanisms you've designed pretty much take away most of the danger....  so the end game is somewhat anti-climatic.\n\n","October 15, 2015","true","524.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So in Gnomoria, no gnome is going to craft a goblet and then encrust it with a certain jewel that's associated with an anchient dwarf hero who's story is depicted in engravings on that cup.\n\nSo you can't make a sprawling dwarf fortress, play for centuries, then make 1 single mistake involving lava, and the fort falls into ruins. Wars happen, and then you pop into Adventure mode and go dungeon seeking to find that legendary quality cup that your favorite dwarf crafted (but died in some hysterical accident.\n\nBut, I suck at DF. I play DF like this, I create a world with wierd parameters, then embark my 7 dwarves. I start by building a tomb and coffins and I'm usually able to finish before all my dwarves are dead and buried.\n\nSo for me Gnomoria, is going to be training wheels for DF. I'm not comfortable with planning out z-layers, but Gnomorias visuals make it easy. I love how I can see what's in the ground on my z-level and all the terrain in z-levels below me. I'm going to practice making my forts (and tombs) in Gnomoria, and then I'll learn to be more proficient in DF.\n\nBut, I can't stay in Gnomoria forever, I think. Brcasue I love the depth and richness and Dwarftalks.mp3s with their awsome music and commentary about the game.\n\nSo...

As far as I've played it, I did run across some bugs, mainly crashes because I was repeatedly pressing Alt Tab to get in and out of the game. That one was solved by putting it in Window Mode. The gameplay, for me at least, is quite good; some of you are complaining about the replay value and that the game doesn't have consistency alongside the boring end-game. Look fellas, I don't know what you were expecting from this, but giving its state and growth, I myself am contained with what I bought. Let's not get into the fact that I've created tens of maps just to get things right and I'm not saying that as a bad thing. As for the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, yes, they do sometimes run across some difficulties, mainly the floor bug confuses them but if you're careful and give the ♥♥♥♥♥ one order at a time, you won't have any problems. I've watched the developers too, just check how many bugs fixes and things they've added on the last update http://gnomoria.com/news/ . For me, as a casual player, I find this game a gem in the mud. It has tons of potential and even now it has tens of hours of gameplay waiting for you to sit your ♥♥♥ in a chair and curse at the next goblin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s diggin' a tunnel through your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

People usually compare this game to Dwarf Fortress. For people who have never played or heard of Dwarf Fortress, let me explain it for you. It's a survival game, with a twist. The twist is that you control groups of people instead of being your own person.\n\nPros:\n-Easy to get into. There is no tutorial, but a few youtube videos will get you started.\n\n-Good graphics that don't hurt your eyes (I'm looking at you DF)\n\n-Amazing soundtrack. You can choose the classic 8-bit songs, or remixed orchestrated songs. There is something for everyone.\n\n-In depth job/skill system. Some gnomes are better at tasks then others. Gnomes that are bad at a skill will improve if you give them more experience.\n\n-Trading with merchants.\n\n-Good survival elements. You have to keep a steady supply of food and water depending on your population. The game also has all four seasons which bring challenges to overcome.\n\n-Plenty of things to do and never gets old. You can keep a game going for hundreds of hours. It's up to you.\n\nCons:\n- Only complaint I have with this game is that there are very few mods. Recently the game added workshop support, but mods are very small and you can only enable one mod at a time.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like survival or city builder type games, then this is the game for you.","October 11, 2015","true","20.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd say this game is the best in it's class, but there really isn't another class quite like it.  It is one of my favorite games of all time.  A pretty incredible effort from a small development team.\n\nThis game is basically a Gnome civilization simulator.  It's unique, because you instruct your gnomes where and what to build, mine, farm, defend, patrol... in an entirely open world, and then give them specific specializations with detailed instruction lists of what to prioritize, by specific class of gnome, and then sit back and watch them do it.\n\nIt's so detailed, you actually benefit from having a dedicated brewer, that makes higher quality beer faster.  That pretty much sold me.  But that's just the beginning.   There isn't any other game I've come across with this much detail.\n\nYou will actually get pretty attached to your gnomes, and you'll inevetabily make some mistakes that will get a few of them killed, but you can just restart from a recent save file if you want.  There's virtually no limit to the creativity you can use designing your fortress, and you can make some pretty elaborate designs.\n\nThere are some con's to the game.  The graphics are pretty much sprites.  There's a lot of variety and honestly it does a great job adding to the feel of the game, and honestly you're probably not interested in this type of game for the graphics.\n\nSecond, the updates have slowed down quite a bit.  The game is still being developed, but by a single person or a very small team, and honestly it's just really slow.  In it's current state though, it still is an incredible game.  There's a few little bugs still, but nothing you can't easily work around.\n\nThird, after surviving a few years, it becomes less dangerous.  Especially if you've researched and are smart enough to design mechanical devices to mostly insulate yourself from the progressively more dangerous monsters that continue to appear outside your door.  From that point forward, it become mostly about digging very deep for some of the best metals to be found in the game, to forge some great weapons and  armor, but at that point the mechanisms you've designed pretty much take away most of the danger....  so the end game is somewhat anti-climatic.\n\n","October 15, 2015","true","524.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can't believe it is still in early access though. Does not have a tutorial, so you may have to watch videos on it or read some guidebooks to get the hang of it.

As far as I've played it, I did run across some bugs, mainly crashes because I was repeatedly pressing Alt Tab to get in and out of the game. That one was solved by putting it in Window Mode. The gameplay, for me at least, is quite good; some of you are complaining about the replay value and that the game doesn't have consistency alongside the boring end-game. Look fellas, I don't know what you were expecting from this, but giving its state and growth, I myself am contained with what I bought. Let's not get into the fact that I've created tens of maps just to get things right and I'm not saying that as a bad thing. As for the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, yes, they do sometimes run across some difficulties, mainly the floor bug confuses them but if you're careful and give the ♥♥♥♥♥ one order at a time, you won't have any problems. I've watched the developers too, just check how many bugs fixes and things they've added on the last update http://gnomoria.com/news/ . For me, as a casual player, I find this game a gem in the mud. It has tons of potential and even now it has tens of hours of gameplay waiting for you to sit your ♥♥♥ in a chair and curse at the next goblin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s diggin' a tunnel through your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

This is your Population/Kingdom management game, where you build brick by brick, The only templates you're looking at are the workshops where you craft the materials you need to make better gear, weapons, and asthetics. You can shape the very land you live on.\n\nThe Learning curve, is pretty steep at first. When you start the game, you have nothing really guiding you on how to begin. There is help menu that provides some information, and a context menu that allows you to generate jobs for your gnomes. Here is where the game struggles a bit. As far as I can tell, Everything is great while you're above ground, dealing with your farms and animals. But once you start digging, the AI tends to hang and you have to figure out where the hang up is before your gnome decides to stop drinking and die.\n\nThen there are the mobs... I feel that the mobs are a bit over powered in the beginning. Even at the easiest, lowest setting, a Honey Badger for example, does so much damage that while you might survive this fight, you'll have slim chances of surving the next as a beginner. Later on, there are these beetles that multiply like tribbles (StarTrek reference), and can cause your game to lag/crash. So there are still some issues that need to be worked out as far as mobs go.\n\nOnce you've gotten passed the learning curve and you've tempered your patience with the faults in the AI, you'll be able to build bigger better kingdoms.","March 26","true","55.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

NO\n- Is it still a very good game easily worth the pocket money price? YES\n- Is it dissapopinting that magic, better enemies (and logic for combat)  and more personalized gnomes (among other things) aren't present? YES\n- Can the modding community fix all these things? MOST BUT PROBABLY NOT ALL\n- Should they be expected to? PROBABLY NOT\n\nSo a good solid game that falls short of what it should have been - but still a good game? YES\n\nAre these unfulfilled promises good for the reputation of EA on Steam in general? OF COURSE THEY AREN'T\n\n\nAnd that's the rub. Robobob's own roadmap for the game that was up until sometime in 2014 had 4 of 5 killer features down to be added and a collection of smaller stuff that would have made a difference.\n\nIn the end I think it was some design decisions very early in the game that stopped it.\nThe single threaded nature of the programming meaning that, with 30 gnomes, dozens of animals and perhaps 100 skeletons, goblins, mants, spiders and zombies roaming the game, it crawled to a halt and lagged.\n\nPlaying the beetles turned off helped,  lighting everywhere helps a lot. Unlike most games where lighting calcs destroy the frame rate, in this game good even lighting seems to make it run a lot smoother. Get those torches going!\n\nA good PC can play indefinately if you sell your excess, don't encourage massive goblin invasions with ever larger taunts, turn beetles (and maybe spiders) off and keep your automaton population down.\n\nInterestingly games like this (Clockwork Empires) that have big ambitions have developers who come right out and insist on a MINIMUM of a 4 core machine and as many threads capable of running as possible. Although Robobob has never said as much, I think it's the single core nature of the game code that hobbled it in the end.\n\nA good game that falls short of a great game but still worth every cent of the measly 10 bucks it costs.","March 21, 2014","true","736.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Besides food and drink you don't know how much\nresources you have and besides that, you have no idea, how to get the resources for most of the buidables.\nThe ones who like to figure out the game mecancis by themselfs may give this game a try.\n\nAfter about an hour you know the basic game mechanics. Build stuff, cancel jobs, modify the terrain according to your needs (which is not that easy) and how to get the resouces you want.\nAt this point, this game can be quite fun.\nYou will start to plan your empire and you'll start a new game with the largest map this games offers.\nAt this point my motivation was at the highest level.\nAfter that, the game became more and more frustrating to me.\nThe main reason again are the UI, the game mechanics and the bugs.\n\nGnomes get stuck so often, because of a task which they can't handle.\nYou to figure out whats their problem and fix it. Sometimes it is enough to cancel a job,\nsometimes you have to build a whole new tunnel to rescue them.\n\nAlso the order/categorization of the action annoys me.\nFor example everything about removing terrain is under the terrain tab.\nBesides that there is a fill hole action, which construcs a wall and a ceiling.\nBut there is no way to fill up a tunnel in the terrain tab. It's under the build tab.\ncause you build a soil wall. Also the fact that gnomes can walk on a ceiling out of soil is pretty strange.\nIn my opinion, the ceilings are useless and destroy the build flow.\nMinecraft has shown, that building with blocks works flawless and super easy. This is not the case in this game. Everything simply takes to long in this game.\n\nBesides that, you notice after a while that this game has a very limited content for a game which was in development for such a long time. An I don't see hope that more content will be added, cause this game was offically released.\nFor example you have got 3 tamed animals, 4 trees, 5 cops and a pretty limited amount of furniture.\nIn my opinion not enough for a game, which just focuses on sandbox settlement building with super simple graphics.","February 26","false","4.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","1"

Don't get me wrong, it's not just a DF clone. It's got a flavor all its own and the learning curve is significanly easier than DF.\n\nThe developer communicates with the community regularly via the official forums and updates to the indev beta branch are pretty regular. Right now the dev is working on getting the modding platform all worked out so there haven't been content updates in awhile, but the game has a lot of depth already.\n\nReally, this game is incredibly fun and you should pick it up.","December 17, 2015","true","46.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I am usually a stickler for graphics in today's age of technology in games. Even with the graphics it is a very indepth game of managing and stragery. I love how you have a choice to play peacefully or have the option to defend from mobs both inside and outside of the area you are building. Of course I chose peacefully, because the biggest downfall I've seen so far is no tutorial. It just throws you out there with a not so helpful help tab once you click Esc. Knowing this I would suggest a good beginner's guide, Youtube Let's play, or Wiki. Wiki helped me more than the others.\n\nPros for me:\nThe choice to play just building or have combat.\nYou can micro manage like heck in this game.\nThey have Yaks (Dang you Guild Wars 1)!\nA wide variety of things to buildfrom chairs, floors, walls, decor...and on and on\nWhere you can take your imagination and create some interesting Castles, underground city, and the only limitation is your imagination, water, and floor allowance (which I've not run into yet), Um and if you have resources to do such.\nThe price. Great price for the game style and the amount of choice you have (seen more costly games that way less choice).\n\nCons:\nWell to be honest, only few so far.\nThe graphics (that's me and my fickle self)\nHow slow things are done\nAnd it's addictive and I lost time playing it (You play it and you say just a few more things and the next thing you know it has been literally hours since you took a break).\nAnd the rough way they slap you in the game with no tutorial, the help tab is pretty much useless in my opinion.\n\nAnd there is not enough hours in the day to play it....oh wait..not the game's bad..my bad!\n\nI would honestly rate this game an 8.5 out 10.

The mechanics are solid, for the most part, and have much more depth and complexity than similar releases these days, plus the developers fix bugs quickly, so if youre into city builders and resource management games, youll dig Gnomoria.\n\nThe first several times you play it you will be slaughtered brutally, and learning how to balance combat with economy is fun. The only real problem, which i mostly attribute to it being "early access", is that you dont have alot of variety when it comes to decorating and personalizing your kingdom. Creativity helps of course, but you really are just working with different colored cubes and a handfull of furniture items.\n\nI played the crap out of this game, and loved it, but once i became compotent enough to stop worrying about survival, i didnt have anything else to do or worry about, and it all became repetative and slow. If the developers add more decorative items, or fun things to mess with after youre kingdom is established, then this game will become a real gem, but untill (and unless) that happens, its only half awesome. It's worth the price at $8, but i probably wont play it again without more vanity/decoration.","March 13, 2014","true","147.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game is not as deep as dwarf fortress but has one MAJOR advantage; The game is designed to not fry your brain with ASCII and fey moods, tantrum spirals or catsplosions.\n\nIt has some nifty automation features and an isometric GUI with mouse navigable menus . Not DF's arbitrary keyboard shotcuts and terrible ....... can we call them graphics?\n\nIf u had any love for DF at all, but just didnt want to commit weeks to learning WTF you are looking at, then Gnomoria is worth a go. You could even get this to warm you up for DF :P.\n\nThe game is perfectly playable in current state and updates are very regular and well documented. The developer is friendly and makes time to answer questions about updates or technical issues. With time i hope its depth will rival DF's!\n\nAll round, a nice little management game. 7/10\n\n(P.S. my steam playtime is 0hours as i bought the game before steam early access but much time has been invested into this game)","April 20, 2013","true","106.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is essentially Dwarf Fortress Lite, and therefore a micromanagement game.  This means you will spend a lot of time in menus, messing with lots of stuff to get your dudes doing what you wnat them to.  However, where Dwarf Fortress has a learning curve about like a brick wall, This game's curve, while still steep, is not near as bad.  The UI is fairly intuitive, and once you have an idea of what you want to do, getting it done is usually fairly straightforward.  A starter quest system or some other form of tutorial for the game would be extremely useful in indicating your priorities and helping fortresses to actually survive their first year (my first didn't), but unfortunately all that is availabe at the moment are youtube videos.\n\nAll in all, I would reccomend Gnomoria to anyone willing to take the time to learn how to play, as it is quite enjoyable at that point.","February 22, 2014","true","109.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can build all kinds of rooms and furniture.\n\nOne thing I strongly dislike about it, though, is that it is very hard to learn the controls and how to play the game in general. I had to watch a 30 minute tutorial video on YouTube to even start playing. But once I did get the hang of it, it is pretty straight forward. (I recommend changing your hotkeys in the settings!) Also, music gets annoying.\n\nI think many things can be improved. This game is, however, still under development! Considering, this game is awesome and has so much stuff! It's hard to tell how long certain tasks will take. Your crops have no timer, so you can't tell how long until fully grown, not even a graphic to show growth level. One day, they just pop up fully grown. Mine took like....8 or 9 game days to fully grow...I thought this was a bug at first, preventing my crops to grow! Same with your gnomes sleeping, I thought they were glitched and wouldn't wake up....turns out they just needed to sleep longer.\n\nAll things considered....the game is worth the money to me so far. I have just purchased it today, though. I'm looking forward to future game updates, and hoping the developers make a lot of needed changes!","May 8, 2014","true","96.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's got some great balancing and challenge mechanics that allow you to take your time and progress at a pace you can handle. Get too greedy with your digging or grow your city without proper protection and deal with the consequences. Some features I really love is having individual gnomes with names that you can assign jobs, track their lives and achievements through the seasons. See how many goblins they can slay and keep them alive when they get injured.\n\nI had a gnome called Jazz that had an arm and both legs cut off. He had served my kingdom well since its inception so I built him his own bedroom and workshop right next to each other. He then became my kingdoms master jeweler until my entire kingdom was wiped out by ogres and goblins. I was getting worse and worse attacks because master Jazz was making the best jewlery in the lands, which raised my kingdom value enough to see hordes rushing me.\n\nYou can farm crops, tend to livestock, craft all kinds of furniture and weapons and armour all which take into account minute details about what its components are and the quality of construction.\n\nYou can also terraform the lands to suit your purposes, make a base inside a mountain or build a castle whatever tickles your fancy.\n\nYou do not control your gnomes directly, rather control is done in 2 stages. First you give gnomes tasks they are allowed to perform like chopping trees. Then when you assign a tree to be felled the most available gnome runs over and does it. This cuts the micromanagement to a level you can decide which is great. You can micromanage every task to happen straight away or just set a task and forget about it, someone will fix it later. This is the opposite to facebook/browser style village games where you have to do every little thing yourself.","February 20, 2014","true","177.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

RoboBob updates the game twice or thrice per month and is in direct contact with the community. While it takes some time to get used to the game mechanics and UI, once you are there it plays very good.\n\nGames like this are the reason why Early Access and Indie games are good for the PC gaming industry.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omgabee/recommended/224500/","omgabee","Omgabee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omgabee/","14 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA very fun little game. Awesome how you can have almost total control over your map settings, like how big it is and how strong your enemies are, etc. This makes it so you can play the game exactly how YOU want to play it. Love how many different possibilities to build there are. You can build all kinds of rooms and furniture.\n\nOne thing I strongly dislike about it, though, is that it is very hard to learn the controls and how to play the game in general. I had to watch a 30 minute tutorial video on YouTube to even start playing. But once I did get the hang of it, it is pretty straight forward. (I recommend changing your hotkeys in the settings!) Also, music gets annoying.\n\nI think many things can be improved. This game is, however, still under development! Considering, this game is awesome and has so much stuff! It's hard to tell how long certain tasks will take. Your crops have no timer, so you can't tell how long until fully grown, not even a graphic to show growth level. One day, they just pop up fully grown. Mine took like....8 or 9 game days to fully grow...I thought this was a bug at first, preventing my crops to grow! Same with your gnomes sleeping, I thought they were glitched and wouldn't wake up....turns out they just needed to sleep longer.\n\nAll things considered....the game is worth the money to me so far. I have just purchased it today, though. I'm looking forward to future game updates, and hoping the developers make a lot of needed changes!","May 8, 2014","true","96.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sure, you don't have the deep of DF (yet!) but it's a fun game and by no means a casual one, even if it's easier.\n\nAs the game still is on 'Early access', the game don't have the deep of the DF (nor the years and years of development) but keeps improving with every patch (expect a patch every 2-3 weeks period).\n\nFor 6€, or even cheaper on sales, this game gives you lots and lots of fun.","February 25, 2014","true","80.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Want more graphics? Like a active modding community?  Then get this. You can play completely with assignable hotkeys and/or GUI mouse controls.\n\nYou start off with area to start your gnome colony in.From there you have to assign jobs for your gnomes,set up farms,plant seeds,gather resources,etc. Build your homes/kingdom both above ground and/or below.Mine materials,craft them into various things,keep food and water stockpiles etc. Its pretty much like what any new colony would have to do in order to survive.\n\nLots of fun,(remember its still in alpha/beta) a good amount of growing content,responsive Dev that tweaks the game based on community feedback,weekly -biweekly updates. Lots of fun for hours on end. Your choice of playing pure survival with no hostiles (peacemode) or switching to or started normal mode which has everything in peacemode but with hostiles.\n\nif you like what you read then do yourself a favor and get it.","June 13, 2013","true","15.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Take what you have, change one thing, that trainslates into a completely different game.\n\nTerraria went into a 2D side scrolling game that is better than what it was based on (Or at least now it is) The thing is, even if you knew nothing about how to do things, it was still easy to learn through the gameplay.\n\nThis game took the idea that Terraria had, mixed it with a bit of the Sims, and added a top down perspective.\n\nIt worked out, but the problem is it needs a tutorial, it falls flat without one and not wanting to try and learn how to play it mostly due it being hard to understand (Like Towns is.) It's makes me feel lost, alone, confused, and a bit frustrated.\n\nIt's not that I don't WANT to learn as I play, that's real fun to do, it's just that you leave me with nothing but my own thoughts, like trying to figure out how to lockpick a door, I need SOME form of a hint.\n\nOverall, it looks good so far, I can't give an opinion, I'll change my thoughts and the review when I learn and play this game more extensively, right now I'm not in the mood to spend an hour trying to learn how to get the people to do things.\n\n\n(Due to alot of backlash towards most of my reviews because little kids can't seem to understand what an "opinion" is and get angry and overreact at something sticking out of the pervervial line, I must leave a warning. Thanks kids!)\n\nThis is my opinion, I make these reviews to get my opinion out there, if you disagree, I'm not saying my opinions are fact, in which case, no need to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at something as trivial as a "review" or "opinion" I have an opinion and a mind that proccesses things and I like to let them be known rather than sheltered, weather it be good or bad.

Even if you have all of the base materials Queue'd up, it still manages to find a way to take a long time.  You literally have to go one by one building this thing here and then that thing there.  God forbid if you Queue up a few beds and then try to make 2 pieces of armor.\n\nMonsters can spawn from dark areas within the inside of your town. I don't agree with this choice because it forces you to build torches EVERYWHERE.  Plus I feel as if it loses the immersion for me.  In Dwarf Fortress there was always a reason for everything.  Goblins came from the town nearby and raided you.  If you picked a location close to a haunted mountainside Cavern then you can bet that undead monsters will begin to appear by your Fortress.\n\nGnomoria has no tutorial or anything that tells you what you need to play this game.  New players will be absolutely LOST.  Even if you have played Dwarf Fortress before you will still have some learning curve as this does not play exactly the same way.  If you haven't played Dwarf Fortress, you better start reading the wiki and learn to ask nicely on the forums how 2 play game.\n\nYou don't know what is going on during the fights.  You have to click on the events and find out what is going on by pausing the action and read through a few menus (at the top of the screen).  Even in Dwarf Fortress with its lack of graphical representation still allowed you to see how well the fight was going by simply making your character blink and blink faster if they were dying and cover the Dwarves with blood.   Loads of times I have lost a Gnome simply because I thought the fight was going well, but in fact it wasn't.\n\nI know that the more worth your Great Hall is the greater your chances of getting more Gnomes to come settle will be.  However I went and I built that stupid Great Hall up and I received 1 extra Gnome.... just 1.\n\nBut there are a couple of positives:\n\nThe graphics are prettier than Dwarf Fortress.\n\nI do like the military system in which you gain perks for certain formations and also what type of soldier you want them to be.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/B8xYjPF7Pnk\n\nTLDR: Playing this game actually makes me feel like going back to playing Dwarf Fortress.  I hate comparing any game to another but the comparison has to be drawn since these 2 games are extremely alike in a lot of ways.   In fact just do yourself a favor and instead support the guys who are developing Dwarf Fortress and play that game.  It's way more immersive and there are plenty more things to do in that game without feeling bogged down or frustrated.","March 4","false","30.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

As of 25/05/2015\n\nThe game has been in development for years and frankly it still needs years given the current progress being made before it's ready for release in my opinion. A fun ride but it's very bumpy.\n\nThe cons.\n1. Some crashes still exist (although I haven't been plagued with them myself)\n2. Pathfinding is awkward at best due to the next problemVVV\n3."Fail states" exist, if you deconstruct a well sometimes the gnomes bug out trying to pick up the deconstructed parts or something. Or if you mine in the "wrong" way you can isolate your miners who eventually die of thirst, thus killing your colony before it even begins.\n4. Lack of information about what things do. It's hard to know when it's a good time to "tech" up and when the build defenses, do I want extra armour? I don't know. Do I want to fight that bear? I don't know.\n5. Learning curve is steep and doesn't show signs of slowing down after 14 hours of play. Yes this is a con.\n6. Under constant attack, dealing with constant attacks from things gets annoying, and feels like i'm on firefighting duty rather than building a colony or town.\n7. Combat system is bad sad bad, lots of little things you can forget can bite you in the behind later on. The lack of individual control over the gnomes feels especially frustrating here.\n8. Animations are incredibly lacking if even present. Understandable but not acceptable.\n9. Camera view is awkward. Not a huge problem but at times it becomes a hindrance being stuck in diagonal view.\n\nPros.\n1. Very satisfying figuring out problems and optimising things.\n2. Lots of replayability, if you can figure out the issues with the game it's not that bad to play.\n3. Balancing what to build and when is quite fun, and is probably one of the main reasons people play the game. Just because I haven't figured out the optimal way doesn't mean you can't.\n4. Customisation options are quite varied, provided you can survive long enough to reach them.\n5. The game is still being worked on despite being several years in the works which says something about the dedication of the developers.\n6. Lots of ways to play the game...after a certain point.\n7. You have a lot of control over how the gnomes behave, granted the interface for controlling them is very very awkward, you do technically have a lot of say over how they behave.\n\n\nConclusion clunky controls, annoying combat mechanics and general lack of polish means this game should be avoided until it's complete.\nLack of information to the player and any real feedback on what they're doing increases the learning time required to get the basics understood.\nProceed at your own risk to investment in time.\n","May 25, 2015","false","15.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

This game has been completely playable for a couple years, and has been getting updated/bug fixes and new features regularly for years.\n\nThe game was originally posted on Desura(Where I bought it), but desura has gone defunct, and now its here on steam.\n\nTo be honest, Im not sure why its designated early access.  The game functions as well as any finished product.  Possibly because the developer still has big plans for this game yet.  I dont know.\n\nThere is no reason not to get this game.   Its underpriced at $7.99.   I think I payed $20 for it over a year ago.\nNo regrets. no complaints.\n\nAbout the Game:  It does have a a somewhat steep learning curve, and you will find yourself starting over alot until you get a system figured out.  But you wont find it discouraging at all.  Its actually gratifying to come up with your own methods of survival.  Do you build farms right away? Or rely on foraging for food in the first year.  Do you build a well?  Or rely on yakmilk for drink.  Do you build a wall and limit your resources in exchange for safety?  Or do you risk your gnomes to dangers of the wild to have access to to everything.  Do you begin training your militia right away or wait til you have secured your sustenance for the coming years.   How deep do you delve early on to find minerals underground? because the deeper you go, the more dangerous it becomes for mining...\n\nOnce you have secrued your sources of basic sustenence for survival, and trained up a basic militia to guard against wild animals and goblin attacks..   you can then begin constructing your ... whatever you can imagine.  Castles....  underground complexes...    This game is like a minecraft meets dwarf fortress...\n\nI have one friend here on steam who I showed this game to. He now has over 900 hours of playtime in Gnomoria.

You can trade with other kingdoms once you have a trading stall. I'd recommend starting a house in the mines, so its easier.\n\nPros-\nNice and fun gameplay\nOK graphics\nEasy to play when you learn controls\n\nCons-\nWhen you battle a hostile mob with 5 gnomes, you WILL lose 1 if its early game\nControls are hard to get used to\nSoundtrack isn't the best thing in the world\n\nI hope you found this review useful!\n\n-Mineman021\n\nP.S.

The concept is great, and I was in love with the idea of building, staffing, and defending my own fortress city.\n\nUnfortunately, the AI is just not there, and without the ability to directly command the gnomes, it is often difficult to complete tasks.\n\nIn the mid to late game, you will find yourself frantically trying to get your gnomes to do basic tasks like craft critical ingredients, and nothing you do will convince them to do it.","March 25, 2015","false","45.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It's fun, but still game-breaking bugs and, worstly, several design issues. No depth in the game. As some other reviewer perfectly described, Gnomoria is just a paid tutorial to Dwarf Fortress (even when Gnomoria has no tutorial itself).\n\nOld review:\n\nGreat potential, specially if you are planning to learn something more affordable before jumping to Dwarf Fortress, but too buggy at this present state (0.9.17). It's frustrating when you spend hours trying to do a thing that you are doing it right but it's just a bug in the game. My gnomes nearly die of thirst even when I had a brewery, nearly 200 fruits, an order of making a minimum of 100 wine, two or three gnomes with the brewery profession, and brewery at highest priority. Assigning to a gnome didn't work, the one who made all the wine in the settlement before, so I had to manually delete all his other profesions. And this is only one of workshops that suddenly stops working for no apparent reason.\n\nI'll check again the game when it's 1.0. This game will be a joy when everything is working. But until it's fixed and playable, better spend your time learning Dwarf Fortress.","March 27, 2015","false","117.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

While not nearly as in-depth as DF(as one might expect), it does bear a similar "feel" to that game, The main strengths Gnomoria has in comparison are its graphics and interface. Both are much improved and more intuitive.. The game suffers from its combat system, however; enemies are universally much stronger than many of your citizens put together. Seven of my gnomes, even with metal armor and military training, were unable to best a monitor lizard.\nThe result of this is that combat is futile and therefor pointless, and the best way to protect your citizens is with traps, the more useful of which come at the very end of the tech tree. Ultimately, however, with infrastructure then conquered and enemie tamed, the game becomes one less of one against an antagonistic force, but your own patience, as you wrangle resources to keep gnomes from starving and making torches to keep even MORE unstoppable enemies from spawning in the depths of your fortress.\nOn a personal note, I gain enjoyment from this style of game in the form of creation of sprawling urban centers and impressive mega-projects. Lacking the first, the second stands by itself, relegating Gnomoria, for me, into being a rather slow and program for making isometric art. Perhaps the game could be improved by combat balancing and more engaging character behavior.","January 15, 2014","false","34.3"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","14","33","0","0"

Very slow gameplay. Gnomes only seem to work when/if they feel like it. You will constantly have to micromanage every gnome to get them to do the jobs you want. Could use a much better interface with more feedback to the player about why things are or arent happening. Pacing should be sped up, it takes so long to start that you lose interest before anything really happens.","May 8","false","9.1"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

It released this year finally. It took 4 minutes to generate a map that had graphics similar to an early 80's videogame console system. It looks like it is running at about 1 or 2 frames per second.\n\nThere is no tutorial. There was supposed to be a tutorial. Don't buy this game unless you already know how to play this game.\n\nIt took 20 seconds to save my game before exiting.\n\nMaybe when I load it up next time to get my last 2 trading cards, my gnomes will have figured out how to pick up the logs from the trees they cut down. If the tutorial has been put in by then, maybe I will figure out how to make them do it.","April 11","false","1.2"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","2"
