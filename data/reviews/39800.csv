"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/39800/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Looking at the store page Nation Red looks cliché, yes, another zombie survival bloody shooter with nothing particulary new (or standout) in game design. It's a few years old & easy to overlook, but I am glad I tried it. It is reasonably priced & surprisingly looks & plays gruesomely well!\n\nImagine a claustrophobic top-down arena, twin-stick shooter with a bit of a Left 4 Dead flavor to it. No story, just a smörgåsbord of Power-ups & Perks, to accompany the never-ending horde of thousands of mindless zombies to slaughter "cooperatively" with your friends .. this is Nation Red!\n\nIt's simply addictive in its psychopathic repetition. This is accomplished by offering simple responsive controls, with unique classes that can be greatly modified with the perks, weapons & power-ups each  session. Then combine this with inherent co-op multiplayer mechanics in reviving dead players, covering each other & the like, and you have a lot of variables to change the outcome of the game. It might be the same map you have played 100 times already, but every session has randomness & feels unique to a degree.\n\nDifficulty is very scalable, but with an experienced group it can feel like it becomes a 'war of attrition' sometimes (as in they can go for a looong time!). Controls you will understand after a min or two of gameplay, but as you last longer you need to start working on your crowd control & aiming, plus using the right power-ups or weapons for the situation. If you want go all 'hardcore survival nutter' into it, you will also need to learn to work closely as a team! All this can take a bit of practice, but does keep you wanting to come back for more to see if you can survive longer!\n\nThere are also an extensive list of achievements to challenge you - some really cool ones too, kudos to the devs for their creativity! Thankfully as well, the devs saw fit to let you Lock your favorite weapon so it doesn't get replaced by a new pickup you run over (Lifesaver!) - nothing worse than having your assault rifle replaced by a crowbar in the thick of taking down a boss! Something all new players should know about :).\n\nThere are really no in-game annoyances at all, its all well balanced & easy to distiguish visually amongst all the blood & guts. Meaty Metal/Rock riffs keep the adrenaline pumping throughout! Soundtrack & effects complement the style of game perfectly.\n\nSolo mode offers a few more tailored challenges too in a series of missions. You can also play all the Multiplayer modes in Solo. Solo, I would argue, is harder than co-op but both have their merits. The pure Survival mode I found to be the toughest out of them all.\n\nEven though the game is over 5 years old, I was still able to find some online games without too much trouble. Even if you don't see any games hosted, you can start a public match yourself, & others can drop in and out whenever. This makes online mode a breeze to use & keeps you from waiting in dreaded lobbies.\n\nNation Red reminds me of earlier times .. classic gaming days. Days when FPS weren't trying to be an action movies, when RTS (not MOBA) was popular & when 'simulation' in the game title actually meant the real deal. And most importantly, when shoot 'em ups were .. all about the survival & scores. Refreshing, addictive, simple & fun!\n\nLet the power-up gods grant me my Mini Gun, my Machette  & let's paint the Town Nation Red!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","January 4, 2015","true","9.1"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","3"

However, as realistic as the weapons and characters may lead you to believe, you'll soon be summoning clones with shotguns, calling down orbital lasers and splitting the Earth in two with a wide variety of power ups and perks fuelled by your killing spree.\n\nNation Red has a wide variety of maps and modes for players to try, ranging from no-perks single player to a holdout mode with four players desperately defending an encampment of minigun weapon stations from an ever increasing horde. For what's more or less a one-man-band project, Nation Red has grown massively since its 2009 release and continues to do so even now, with new achievements, maps and perks being added at somewhat irregular, but extremely welcome, intervals.\n\nAverage Game Length? Depending on skill, games can range from a few minutes to over an hour.\n\nA Bit Like? Crimsonland, Smash TV\n\nIs It Fun? The perks make this game beyond entertaining, and four-player modes add a chaotic atmosphere like few others.\n\nWorth The Price? £7.99 may seem a bit steep for those looking at the screenshots and video, however playing the game is completely different and provided you like other similar games, you will certainly get your money's worth.","November 26, 2013","true","37.5"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","35","42","0","0"

The perks system is very extensive and the variety of the combinations you can manage just serve to enhance the gameplay even further.\n\nThe game excels both in single player and multiplayer and you can even play local co-op with up to 4 players as long as you got enough gamepads to accommodate them. I have to say if you are a fan of classic arcade shooter action this game is one of the best values in gaming in my view. For those with competitive juices the varied leaderboards and achievements will serve as an impulse to replay the game to see just how much further you can survive and better your personal best in the different game categories.\n\nIf you like what you read so far just get it as soon as you can and enjoy it by yourself and with friends... repeatedly.","January 19, 2012","true","87.5"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/39800/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2492 products in account","Ah, zombies. We're all sick of them in games, aren't we?\n\nNation Red is a game with a simple premise. You're one of four classes each with their own perks and you have to fight off the zombie horde! That's basically what this game boils down to, it's almost exclusively a horde mode. Even the "Mission" mode is just fighting off a series of hordes except the match changes after you hit a certain amount of kills.\n\nWhat makes Nation Red unique and rather fun is that it's very comparable to twin stick shooters/shmups. The zombies keep coming at you and your goal is to stay alive. Like most shmups, as you kill zombies there are weapon drops, perk drops, and you successively upgrade your character to help you defeat the horde of zombies.  There are a couple of maps and modes and the game is excellent fun solo, but when you have four people on your fireteam, that's where the game shines.\n\nThis game is excellent for killing some time and the style (twin stick shooter) is a style I particularly enjoy. If you enjoy shmups, if you enjoy zombies, and if you enjoy testing yourself to reach a high score, Nation Red is an interesting twist on tried and true gameplay experiences. It's fast paced and has a couple of modes and maps to make you want to come back.\n\nAs a caveat, I cannot really suggest it at its full $9.99 pricepoint, but if it hits a sale/bundle and the style of game is up your alley, you may find Nation Red is just your ticket. I'd also suggest playing with a controller, because, well, its a twin stick shooter and you're far more lethal with a controller in this kind of game than you are with a mouse and keyboard.","July 15, 2014","true","10.3"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Partly because of the the SOUND! The guns sound great and powerful. Combine that with a great and well fitting soundtrack and it gives you those 'f*ck yeah' moments.\nThe game has a brilliant perk system. Not only you have a huge collection to choose from, there are also different modes. With Auto Perk Mode, you can predefine the perks you want to use during play and let the game enable them automatically when you level up within a game. You can use Strategic Perk  Mode, to choose a perk yourself during play. And there's Random Perk Mode, wich gives you a random selection of perks to choose from. Besides perks there are also a lot of powerups you can pickup while killing zombies. These powerups last for a certain amount of seconds, while perks stay active until you die. You can choose between various profile classes, wich are different types of soldiers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.\nBecause this game came out years ago, the multiplayer isn't as active anymore. However, a feature I particularly like is the ability to start a multiplayer game solo and let other players join you. In this way there are MP games available to join on a regular basis. So you don't always have to arrange a MP session with other players first. If you are a little lucky, someone will join you. But it's still a good idea to look on the forums for co-op partners. If there isn't anyone available, there's also enough to do in various single player modes. It's still a blast to play on your own.\nMaybe you are doubting whether you should give this game a try after all those zombie games you've seen. Well yes, Nation Red is one of the older ones out there but still one of the finest in my opinion. If you like the genre, this game simply belongs in your collection. And you can always download the available demo and let that convince you.","January 6, 2015","true","24.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","1"

I have just done 100% achievements! It was fun :)\n\nAs achievement hunter I can recommend this game too, 'cheevos were challenging and innovative (achievements in this game = ideas of people who play it - you can suggest in steam discussion), but nothing what you wouldn't be able to do, especially when you have some hours behind you. I have finished all achievements in around ~50 hours, all without 3 cows, which means killing 500k, 750k & 1kk zombies and generally it was the most boring part of this game when I have finished everything else (killed ~330 000 when I was done with rest achievs.). Unfortunately Multiplayer will be dead till the end of this year, I had problems now with finding players, sometimes was lucky, mostly weekends evenings.\n\nThe game is interesting as it gives you many weapons to use and lots of nice skills (in the end you will use ONLY ak47 or Jack Hammer and skills - PowerUp Hook & Snare, but it took me almost 25 hours to find out that those are most effective :P). Also many game types, all are the same generally and missions were most boring as you just must complete every mission 15 times, what forces you to play 15x 18 missions = boring!!!\n\nConclusion: The game gave me most fun when I was doing those innovative achievements, first ~50hours.\n\n\nTo creator: if you read it - stop adding achievements, I finished this game once and don't want to come back - at least when you will try to force me with new ones to do xD and seriously: Multiplayer is going to be dead soon, it will be just painful to do. Yes, I'm evil, I'm cruel. Muahahaha. But face the reality and try to bring this game back to life.","March 4","true","105.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

And a good one!\nIn several different Game Modes like Barricade (you need to hold a point, have some support from Sentry Guns or Soldiers) Survival (show them how long you can keep going) or the Classic endless mode. Every Game Mode offers you a different Challenge.\nOn top of that, there are tons of different power ups you can pick up, that will drop randomly from your enemies. While you’re playing you gain Experience and Level up, with every Level up, you get access to a wide Range of skills you can choose from, to optimize your Character in a way you want to play the level/game. Through that, the game offers a wide range of variations to try out and experiment with. The game also offers a variety of boss monsters you encounter randomly throughout your current play trough. Which all have their own strength and weaknesses. You can change the difficulty at any given time. As stronger as you make your enemies, the more experience you will get from them.\n\nThe game is quiet some years old, but is still looking alright in my opinion. I never had any lag issues or stutters in my whole playtime and not a single crash.\nThe music pushes you and matches the action on the Screen.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with the game. Even though you “only” kill tons of zombies in every game mode (Isn’t that the reason why we play this? :)), through the wide range of power ups, skills and weapons, every play through offers are different experience. The game modes are fun, and require their own unique style to master them.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fast paced Zombie shooter, with tons of splatter and action, you came to the right place.\nI can totally recommend the game to everyone.\nSince you can change the difficult on the run, the game is never frustrating. If you die, you will know why and not because the game confronts your with unfair hard enemies. The game offers a challenge to veteran players, and is also a ton of fun for players, which are new to genre. You will steadily improve and feel the difference when you make your enemies stronger.\n\nAlso, if you just want to relax, turn the volume up, make the zombies easier and splatter your way through their lines!\n\n","May 7","true","173.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Why not shoot some zombie scum to pieces? Yeah, I know - sounds pretty psychopathic, but keep in mind: It's fiction. And in this game's fiction you simply shred zombies to pieces. Simple as that.\n\nSo what is "Nation Red"?First of all: It's your quasi "casual zombie massacre game". Quasi casual because it offers the possibility to descend into Zombie County for 10-20 minutes and get back to work, family, whatsoever after. If you're looking for a longer shot you may try the challanges, so it works both for those who are taking a short time out as well as those who want to get some challenging progress.\nSecond: It is a zombie massacre. Nothing more, nothing less. If you're looking for a thought-out plot (or a plot at all), you'll be disappointed *massively*. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced and action-packed top-down shooter with zombies (a whole da*n lot of zombies), you're in for a gory treat.\n\nGraphics:\nThe look is great. It's your typical scrapped, end of days atmosphere combined with your typical zombie settings, including the "usual suspects" as a cemetary and the obligatory gas station.\nThe areas of the levels/maps are pretty limited, which of course intensifies the action.\nKeeping in mind that this game already has some years under its belt, the graphics are still ok (and what's important for me: working on my netbook), but not top-notch. However the atmosphere gets delivered perfectly.\n\nSounds & Music:\nGive 'em hell - metal riffs, shots, explosions, gore & splatter - "Nation Red" delivers an absolutley convincing and genre complimentary sound design.\n\nGameplay:\nThe concept of "Nation Red" is simple, yet addictively entertaining: You'll be confronted with hordes of zombies and you'll gain experience points while shooting, chopping or stabbing through your undead enemies. Power-ups like "Bullet Time" or mines drop sporadically, alternate weapons and grenades offer some tactical variations.\nThe game itself is being played via gamepad or with mouse and keyboard. Shooting, evading, switching weapons, grenades - you really don't need more than these. And, granted, you don't get more options than these. So summing up: Simple concept, simple and extremly easy to master controls.\n\nBottom line:\nIf you're looking for a diverting, entertaining zombie shooter with a "casual" touch ("casual" not meant in the negative way), lots and lots of gory fun, fast-paced action with easy to grasp controls and a grand combination of metal music and booming sound fx, "Nation Red" is your game.","October 24, 2014","true","2.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It may not be for everyone and I'm sure that looking at some gameplay (single or multiplayer) videos will dictate to you whether such is the case for you.\nI think this is a nice and solid action title for an indie collector to have.\nGood number of characters, weapons, and modes all well designed and fun to play\n\nThe game-altering upgrades make it consistantly enjoyable to slaughter your way through zombies that get progressively harder, and therein more satisfying to avoid death at their hands. As you acquire new upgrades, you yourself will start to feel like a walking, zombie-slaying machine while you spit venomous darts and saw blades passively and friendly explosive strikes rain down on the zeds around you.\n\nOne of those titles that makes you want to beat that high score. whether it be a friend's, a stranger's, or just your own.\n\nAs far as negative aspects, I will say it can get repetative. It's probably not a game you'll be playing constantly or for more than a couple hours at a time, but I believe you'll be happy to have it at your disposal when the itch returns to slaughter something to cure a brief bout with boredom.\n\nAnyway. I liked it.\n","December 11, 2014","true","47.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I loved this game and even having completed all missions find that there is still much playability.\n\nMastering the perks is also part of the fun, but don’t think that just because you can add and upgrade your abilities that it will save you from the onslaught of infected that are “coming right for you”!\nRams, grenades, miniguns – these are just a few of the weapons that the zombies will wield against you, in return you do not have to worry about the bullets you waste as all guns are unlimited, that said reloading can be your undoing.\n\nI found that or such a straight forward game a lot of strategy was involved as there are movement penalties for going backwards, using heavier guns and the upgrade decisions will affect your game all the way through.\n\nAbsolutely loved it – so when you get a copy feel free to invite me to a game.\n","January 9, 2015","true","285.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each character has strengths with certain weapons and has certain talents. The solider is an all rounder, loves the LMG but also specializes with the AA-12. The scout carries less health but manouvers a hell of alot quicker than the soldier and really does enjoy using the M107 or pistols. The other classes i have yet to try.\n\nThe perk system itself is brilliant, once you work out exactly what you want from them you can use the Auto perk mode in the main menu to pre-select what perks you want with each level up so it allows the flow of your game to go undisturbed.!\n\nThis game is totally worth it for the minimal cost and its a wonderful stress reliever! Trust me nothing sorts out a bad day quite like Nation Red!\n\n9/10","February 5, 2014","true","32.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The fact is that at me the game feels pointless, just shoot enemies, no story mode, 2 or 3 game modes. That's all. The whole game. I have to say there are a lot of perks, which help the game not being too repetitive overall. Even though, there is no point in keeping shooting zombies, there is a global level, but it is completely useless, you have all unlocked by the first play. From there, the game won't change absolutely nothing. There is no sense in playing the game for me, i bought this expecting it to be at least a bit like "Dead nation", but now i just wish i hadn't bought it.

However, on DN:  You can customize your weapons and such.  If you have a console, get Dead Nation; If you have a PC, get Nation Red.

Nation Red is a very simple game, but its simplicity gives it an incredibly addictive quality. This game can be picked up and played by just about anyone, and veterans or experienced gamers will enjoy challenging themselves to beat their high scores or tackling new levels of difficulty. There's also hours and hours worth of stuff to do, including singleplayer missions, a freeplay mode, and multiplayer.

Nation Red\nIn a Nutshell\nNation Red is a twin-stick, top-down, third-person, hyphen-attracting, zombie-shooter by DiezelPower. In it you shoot zombies (a prerequisite), gather random weapons, level up and choose from an assortment of upgrade / perks, and try either to survive, kill enough zombies to clear the level, or be the last player standing depending on what mode you are playing. The game's aesthetic is gory and dirty and the gear you use tends toward the modern / future side of military armament without stepping more than a toe or two into science fiction's house. Let's get to it.\n\nZombies! Lots of them. Big ones, small ones, slow ones, quick ones, male, female, weaponized and weapon-wielding, ya got em! Each of the types has something other than their appearance to set them apart, and you'll find a fair mix of dangers spread throughout the crowd of undead.\n\nThere's even the random boss intermixed in the horde and those fights can be tough while trying to keep the common dross at bay! Bosses drop better loot but can deal and take a lot more punishment. Bring a sammich and a lawn chair, this fight's gonna take some time.\n\nLevel up your character on each run. When you die, your character resets but the game is built around that, and the leveling is so fast and options are so varied that it plays like an arcade game with a hint of permanence in the form of unlocks.\n\nRandom loots! Yes, this game has em. Weapons, power-ups, exploding barrels, grenades, dynamite and more. Also...\n\nRandom perks. Yes Crimsonland fans, Nation Red took this one whole cloth. Each time you level you get to pick a bonus from a handful of the 78 available in this game. This serves to change your character's abilities and maybe even your play style with each level up. Play to a specific plan (if you can) or tweak your toon all over the place. Go nuts. You'll be dead soon anyway.\n\nPlay solo missions to advance the game variety or hunt in arcade modes like survival and even customize your perk load-out before playing.\n\nPlay with a team in multiplayer; either local co-op or online.\n\nChoose one of 4 classes in multiplayer mode to fit the role you want to play.\n\nGot a favorite gun? Lock it in so that it doesn't get switched out for the next random drop you step on. You can carry two primaries so find the ones you like best and cling to them.\n\nWatch out for those invisible walls. The 'arenas' are much smaller than in a game such as Crimsonland. You might find yourself pedaling backwards, unloading slugs on the encroaching baddies, only to have your backside come up against an invisible wall. Things get crowded fast. Aim for the head. Unload the clip in panic-mode, or...\n\nIf you DO get cornered, you have some tricks to try; grenades, kicks, axes, machetes, crowbars and the like. If those fail, jump/dash past the biters and get yourself some breathing room.\nConclusion\nOn first blush, it looks like a modernized Crimsonland clone, and although there is something different here as well, that analogy doesn't far miss the mark. Like CL, this is a game that circles some well-trod terrain, but does it so smoothly that it feels worthwhile and satisfying. As I alluded to earlier, the arena feels much tighter than Crimsonland's, but that's a good thing. Close-quarters makes it possible to become overwhelmed much more quickly and with fewer monsters biting at your personal pieces.\n\nNation Red is not a game where you level your character, crafting a killing machine to stand against the ages or even to stick around for future gaming sessions for that matter. In NR, you build for the moment, leveling up in the hope to live long enough just to level up again. You know that eventually you are going to fall, but in the meantime take as many of those undead mooks with you as you can. It's bragging rights in the halls of Valhalla. That's the ShMUp-blood flowing through this genre's veins. Go until you can't go any more, and have fun in the fire.\n\nThe game retails for $10 and does go on sale occasionally. That said, 10 bucks is an honest price for this game and there is plenty of gameplay and enjoyment to be found here for the price of half a Jackson. If you like top-down, twin-stick shooters with satisfying, crunchy effects, pick up Nation Red. Those zombies ain't gonna shoot themselves.*\n\nHappy hunting,\nM13\n\n\n*(Well, some might. They aren't the sharpest crayons in the box...)","July 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, the missions act like a sort of tutorial, because they only last several minutes each and they're not that hard. But if you play co-op or survival, it means enemies will endlessly spawn until you die. Every once in a while enemies leave weapons behind; sometimes they're better, sometimes they're worse (depending on the weapon you're carrying at that very moment) and it never takes more than a few minutes before you die. There's a timer that stops when you die and afterwards your time gets posted to a leaderbord and you can give it another try. It's like virtual crack, it's ridiculous.

The game is set up as an arena-based shooter in a square like setting. The goal for most of the objectives in it is strictly survival based (unless you are playing the main campaign missions).\n\nI would put Nation Red in a very grueling category due to the fact that you have no means of escaping the arena until death and it can be filled with massive amounts of blood, guts and carnage. The developers are constantly updating the game every few weeks and bring out new achievements with them to boot. If you like a game where shooting things is pretty much all you need to do AND you love of a wide assortment of weapons, Nation Red pleases on all levels.","July 12, 2012","true","86.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It features many different weapons, each with varying damage, range, reload times, and clips.   You get infinite ammo, mega pickups, and hordes and hordes of zombies to murder brutally.\n\nIn most modes, you get to choose "perks" for every score threshold you reach.  Perks range from simple things like increased Armor or faster Reloading, to some crazier things like setting zombies on fire for being near you and causing the Turbine pickup to nom zombies.\n\nThere are perks that come in perk tiers to upgrade specific pickups - for example, the Fire Team perk upgrades the Ghost pickup so that your Ghost friend carries a shotgun instead of a pistol.  Get both Mirror Image and Fire Team, and you get two shotgun ghosts for the pickup.  Upgrade to Strike Team and Wild Bunch... and you get FOUR Auto-shotgun wielding Ghost friends to fight by you for a short time.\n\nThis game will keep you on your toes the entire time you play.

Zombies are here, you shoot them. There are a handful of game modes, but they're all just small variations on shooting zombies. The UI is not great, but it doesn't get in the way too much, I do wish the camera control could be a bit smoother though.\n\nGameplay; The gameplay feels pretty good. Running around, dodging zombies, and shooting to clear a path in front of you. There is a learning curve in every single match as both the quantity and danger of the zombies increases over time. The game is replayable in the sense that you can try using different weapons and different perks, or a different strategy altogether; but you've pretty much seen all the game has to offer after only a few matches. I do wish the arenas were bigger and more interesting.\n\nVisuals; The graphics are adequate, not great. You won't be looking too closely at the zombie textures while you're playing, but the special effects aren't particularly impressive either.\n\nSounds; The music and sound effects both feel repetitive; While the gameplay itself is repetitive, some variation in sound would have been nice. No voice acting.\n\nIn conclusion, not a bad game. I had fun playing it for a bit. After a few days I got tired of it, and I haven't been back since.","November 29, 2013","true","8.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Its a third person shooter survival zombie game. The game is fun but can be challenging at times to know when to roll and shoot. There is a multiplayer mode with is  fun when you want to play with friends. The single player mode has no story, its just a simple kill zombies that are trying to kill you. There is a variety of weapons to pick from while playing the single player rounds. The game is good but can get repetitive at times. The game makes it fun when you pick your perks for each level you rank up in the game. The perks make things alot easier and more enjoyable to play. There is alot of gore and blood to be seen.  Its a good sit down and shoot em up game. If your into zombies then this is one not to pass up  if you get a chance to get it. Ive enjoyed playing this game and with patients anyone can really understand how to move and Run N' Gun with zombies running after you.","April 16, 2011","true","108.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One of its features that I like the most is that it's an arcade game so there's no feeling down when you die because your score just resets and you can aim for a better one.

You like them or you don't. In my case i don't because of the often wonky controls and often chaotic control of you character. In urban environments or buildings you often get stuck, shoot the wrong way etc.\n\nThis game is just shooting and avoid bumping into zombies. Nation Red is al about killing as much zombies as you can while staying alive in a map that is slightly larger than your monitor. Think about killing hundreds of zombies in a few minutes. Zombies in all sizes, slow or fast, equipped with heavy weaponry or just with their plain hands.\n\nTo defend yourself you have to pick up guns or other weapons that the zombies drop. You equip them by walking over them and you can hold only the last one you picked up. As you rather have a AK47 than a axe you have to avoid the latter from picking up. So avoiding those is also a challenge in the game.\n\nZombies also drop power-ups that increase your health, deploy a sentry gun, add special abilities to yourself or your guns, deploy a flash or trigger a piece of dynamite. These help a lot to get out of a nasty situation. Preferably by blowing up all the zombies around you :-)\n\nYou also get skills during gameplay that permanently enhance your stats or provide other benefits during the game. By chaining these you can unlock really powerful stuff to let you reach the higher levels.\n\nThe game provides you with 70+ achievements and invite you to play 'just one more game' as they typically lasts a few minutes depending how good you are or which mode you play.\n\nAll in all this game is fun to play for a while, just plain simple shooting and blowing zombies done in just the right way.","February 11, 2014","true","14.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On paper this is what the game appears like but a well-rounded and extensive list of gameplay altering perks to choose from allows each player to cater their character to a very specific combat style. With every wave of enemies that passes you gain a little more of a specialty for dealing out damage, but of course the difficulty ramps up as well. A fast frenetic pace means that boredom never sets in as you’re either going to succeed until you find yourself neck-deep in enemies, or you’re going to fail in which case you can instantly try again; getting right back into the meat of the action while trying a completely different build of perks.\n\nPerhaps not the prettiest game but good enough for what it wants to do and very well optimized.  I’ve played it on several PC’s including an old clunker that didn’t even meet the minimum specs and it still ran fine. Needless to say on a modern gaming rig there’s no problems at all, even during the most hectic moments.\n\nA long list of achievements (for those that care) and a decent match-making service provide longevity beyond what the base game offers (which is already quite extensive). Add in its low entry price and a committed fan-base and you have a recipe for one of the best hidden gems I’ve managed to find in recent memory.","December 28, 2013","true","33.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, the concept may seem repetitive at first thought (and it is), but the beauty and fun comes from actually participating in the craziness that takes place. The music is some kind of metal derivative, and I quickly muted it in the settings, as I can not stand it for very long. You will develop favoritism for certain weapons, and also predilection for perks that suit your play style or power factor. There are missions, but they are basically variations of the other game modes that may be played at your leisure without attachment to the game's horror plot. Surely, because of its nature, Nation Red may not be a game you spend consecutive hours playing, and may be best if picked up at short intervals and breaks. There are many statistics that the game keeps track of for you, including a leader board for comparative and competitive reasons. The developer's are very much involved with the gaming community via Steam, and update the game often. I find that playing for longer than one hour at a time, Nation Red gets repetitive too quickly, and as I've mentioned before, it is better enjoyed in shorter periods. The player's character seems to glide and slide around the maps, which is a bit of an imperfection. These movements do not look very well done. Each of the game modes feel and play different from each other, which adds to the already existing amount of replay ability. While there is fun to be had with Nation Red, it simply becomes too repetitive and dull too quickly. The longer you play, the less you will feel like playing, and when you do play, you will be playing it for less time. It is a coffee break style game, and most of your enjoyment will come from fifteen to thirty minutes playing sessions. Anything more than that will rapidly wear out the game, and your interest in it. There is really not much to it. Nation Red is a simple and basic experience.\n\nNation Red is okay.","March 20, 2014","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

More like a warning to steer clear and spend your money elsewhere on more worthy titles.\n\nThe game runs nicely, it's got enough gore to go around, but after about 5minutes of repeating the same steps:\n\n"Spray gun 360degrees, reload" ... then rince and wash ...\n\nYou get quite tired of the game, and will probably end up stressing to find the quit button so that you might end the game as soon as possible before it makes you as mindless as the zombies that you fight in this game.\n\nI like the concept of the game, after all, who can resist murdering mindless zombies that seemingly has no end to it. But i don't really feel that's there's more to do here than just spray spray spray. A decent story driven mode where you could team up with a few friends would make this game decent i think, atleast worth the amount of money that you sank into it to get it.\n\nRating 7 of 100","December 2, 2011","false","0.2"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","4"

There is difficulty, but only because the zombies with guns provide an incredible difficulty spike. Perks feel boring. The endless slaughter gets boring. Boring boring boring boring.

The gameplay is, quite frankly, boring. The graphics are below average, and the multiplayer browser is reminiscent of Mplayer's deepest nightmares. Also, note very carefully that while this game is available in a 4-pack, it only has TWO PLAYER Co-op. You won't see this advertised anywhere. How do I know? Miserable, first-hand experience.

I am always looking for decent co-op games to play with friends and was excited about getting a 4-player game going after buying the 4-pack. After playing this game for 10 minutes I knew I made a terrible mistake. I regret subjecting my friends to this cascade of awful.\n\nThis game is nothing more than constant waves of zombies that are practically effortless to kill. I even cranked up the difficulty to max and had no problems. Powerups are pretty frequently dropped and the waves are fairly small. There's no need to be creative or work together, just keep shooting and you'll be fine. I thought the maps would be large and offer numerous hiding spaces and objectives. Nope. Just you in the middle of the screen and zombies coming at you. You play one map, you've played them all.\n\nI want my money back, honestly. This game shouldn't even be available for purchase. I'd be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I had bought this game at full-price.","December 31, 2013","false","0.8"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

It gets even bigger of a problem in local coop. (You can change the zoom level from zoomed in to extremely zoomed in. ) The edge of the map isn't clearly marked either, so you'll have an invisible wall there. The weapon drops are a bit confusing, as a lot of them look similar, so you have to hover over to see what they are. Fortunately you can lock a weapon to avoid replacing your well loved ones and you can have two weapns at the same time. The campaign mode feels very similar to survival mode, so it's kind of bland. It has an exp and perk system similar to Crimsonland. When a stronger zombie gets hit, they will bleed and tumble, so you won't see instantly whether you killed a zombie or not.\n\nSo it's kind of a meh game, but it's cheap, bug free and doesn't have performance problems even on my 4 year old low-end machine. (AMD HD 3850)\n\nIf you want a good survival top down shooter, get Crimsonland or Shadowgrounds.","April 7, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","2"

Like some other games (Crimsonland) you also level up to build your capabilities over the course of a game.\n\nThe single player stuff is fun. The multiplayer is really what sets this game apart. You're still doing the same or similar stuff, but with a few other people, everything is amplified. It's more frantic, and that really makes this a better game.\n\nThe menus and some game decisions are a bit odd, not very friendly, but not so bad as to ruin the game. But things like showing a button to go back, labelled ESC, that you can only operate with your mouse... what?\n\nSome perks and levelling upgrades aren't very useful, or don't make much sense, but there's enough here that it's worth a few hours. Much more if you get into the multiplayer.","December 3, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does take on that bland dusky dark look like all "oh darn what happened to the world" type games.\nYou have a few characters to choose from and starting weapons which was a nice little patch they added. The user interface has definitely been upgraded, much nicer. The bosses aren't impossible just take a bit of tenderizing. One of the nice parts is coop is pretty cool.

All the weapon drops and perks in the game are random making every game unique in a sense. You can play the missions over again to get brozne/silver/gold stars, there is a barricade mode where you defend a point, survivial and freeplay.  You'l spend ages on freeplay trying to get that better score. The developers have even added a co-op mode.\n\nOne of the more polished and defeinetly one of the most addictive inide games I've played and anyone with a love of zombies and LOTS of shooting and explosions should love this gem.","June 4, 2011","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With numerous perks and a staggering array of weapons, it is possible to have several killer loadouts, depending on how you play.\nThe sound effects are good, and I personally like the heavy metal loop track they have going, which is rare as I usually switch off music in games - this one adds to the frantic atmosphere of the game.\n\nPossibly the only fault I could notice is that in 4 player co-op, it can be hard to keep an eye on your character, especially if there are others of the same class as you. Colour coding might be nice, or probably I just need to pay more attention.\nOther than that, co-oop is a great play, often with you having to stand near your fallen buddy to revive them.\n\nThe game is often on special, and I would recommend this game as a pick up, put down game that still remains entertaining long after you would expect.\nGet the four pack, give to some friends and you'll have an enjoyable weekend right there.","April 26, 2014","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing this game on multiplayer has not gotten old to me since I purchased this.  There are tons of achievements, and the game does a pretty good job at keeping you up to date with the progress you're making on the achievements.  There are multiple game modes to choose from for different objectives.  The campaign will last you a good 3 - 5 hours simply because you have to do each level 6 times to get gold stars, and considering that there is 18 levels, you'll be doing 108 levels before the fulfillment of totally completely a campaign with come to you.\n\nFighting hordes of zombies has never been so much fun. In my opinion, you should pass up Left for Dead, Killing Floor, Dead Rising, and Trapped Dead, and go straight for Nation Red, as it satisfied my zombie killing needs, and hopefully it will satisfy yours as well.","August 19, 2011","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are pretty much in a small arena and run around, killing zombies and picking up power-ups while levelling up and picking new perks. Some of the perks seem pointless but you are free to customise as you want. You control by aiming with the mouse and moving with WASD. There are some really nice features in the mechanics (you slow down down while backpedalling, stamina bar for diving rolls, weapons feel satisfying).\nThere are some annoyances (if you have shared xp on you miss out on level ups until the host pauses the game, the power-up hook effectively gives one player the lions share of the power-ups, ridiculously slow movement with melee weapons, the brawler takes ridiculous amount of damage), but overall a fun little time waster between other games. There is no real persistent progress (which would have been nice) so after one or two games I am ready to move onto something else.\nWith the current low online population, I would only recommend this when it is on sale, however.","January 10, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only issue is that your levels reset as you move through stages, and it can be difficult to remember what you may have purchased in the current stage.\nNation Red seems to be made primarily as a multiplayer shooter, and it does fine as a non-FPS. Single player is still fun for a while at least, and there are multiple modes to choose from, but it's just shooting waves of zombies - that can get a little boring after some time. Definitely worth my $2.50 but online multiplayer is pretty sparse... I guess not many people picked this game up? Play with your friends when you can. There's also a local co-op option if you have a PS3 or 360 controller you can connect to your computer. which is great to have.","July 22, 2012","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When these games turn out as disasters, developers move on or move out of the establishment. When these games turn out to be a success, developers are pressued into producing more of the same in sequels or rip-offs. Either way, released games are often ignored by developers.\n\nNation Red prove to be the exception to the rule. In the year that it was released, the developers actively participate in community forums, listening to wishlist and continuing improving the game. From the super easy game in the early days, Nation Red increased its difficulty, offer new game modes and new arsenal to help you in the zombie surviving experience.

Now yes, it's one of those third-person overhead views shooter games where some may not like or rather prefer an FPS, but this is worth trying out. Play the demo. You're given a number of weapons to match 4 different characters each with special abilities and their own set attributes. A variety of "perks" to select from all to ease the mass carnage of killing hundreds, thousands of zombies. And these zombies ain't none to be messing with. They got melee weapons that deal high damage and perhaps only just 2 Boss zombies that carry a firearm -- minigun and AK47. Quite a time with this game when you've got friends to play with.

The combination of perpetual zombie attacks and online high-scores give it an arcade-style feel; I frequently play simply to see if I can move up a few places in the rankings.  The wide variety of weapons and power-ups and the special abilities you can earn are fun and allow different playstyles you can experiment with.  Online co-op play is strong, so you and three friends can kill zombies together.  If I want to unwind for a few minutes without investing the time or effort into something more substantial, this is my go-to game.","November 9, 2012","true","159.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now yes, it's one of those third-person overhead views shooter games where some may not like or rather prefer an FPS, but this is worth trying out. Play the demo. You're given a number of weapons to match 4 different characters each with special abilities and their own set attributes. A variety of "perks" to select from all to ease the mass carnage of killing hundreds, thousands of zombies. And these zombies ain't none to be messing with. They got melee weapons that deal high damage and perhaps only just 2 Boss zombies that carry a firearm -- minigun and AK47. Quite a time with this game when you've got friends to play with. It's certainly a game you'll keep coming back to.","July 3, 2011","true","176.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
