The gameplay is like a mix between a MegaMan style action platforming with Gradius-like upgrades to make you more powerful. These features work well together, and provide a very nice gameplay experience. It has great music, cute characters, fun gameplay, and has a rewarding level of challenge, especially for the bosses. The HD upgrades for the Steam release are awesome; the game looks great! You can also save ghost data of your playthrough, which is very useful for speedrunning. The developer is very passionate about this game and loves talking with fans and players in order to provide a good experience, although english is not his first language. It has already included patches based on feedback from fans (including Xbox 360 controller support).\n\nI have put a ton of playtime into this game, and it is a great value for its price. I highly recommend checking it out if you are a fan of action platformers!","December 1, 2015","true","10.0"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","46","54","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/420770/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:The Legend of Dark Witch is a challenging platformer made by Japanese studio INSIDE SYSTEM. Originally on Nintendo 3DS, a year later it got ported also on Steam, with keyboard and gamepad support.\n\nThe game offers several levels, each with a boss who gives you a new skill after you beat them. You can select one from three difficulties, which I'd call easy, hard and hardcore. Anyway, if you are not sure how good you are, you can try the hardest difficulty and change it to lower later with tears in your eyes.\n\nVisuals just fits the average pixelart anime style you might've seen in many other games from the genre. You'll find many significant and original enemies through your gameplay, for example (my favourite) is the snow giant with Santa's hat who breathes fire.\n\nPros:- Fine platformer with focus on higher difficulty, though the lowest one should be viable even for casual players and platformer newbies.\n- Anime pixelart style. There's nothing bad on it, especially in a indie game for 5 euros.\n- Hardcore achievements -> Replayability. The easiest one is to actually beat the game (4% of total owners got it), all the others are motivators to replay the game on higher difficulty or under other special circumstances (e.g. without any upgrade).\n- RPG system with permanent upgrades for your character.\n- Gamepad support. Though not full, you'll have to use mouse, at least for the first configuration.\n- You can select jumping sensitivity in the options.\n\nCons:- Difficult blocking. Blocking is made the harder way in the game, as you have to quickly tap left or right button in the right time to block. Personally, I don't like that way of blocking (well, I'm not a good platformer player, that might be the reason).\n- The game may crash if you try to Alt+Tab on fullscreen mode.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 8","true","5.5"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","27","31","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Larxinostic/recommended/420770/","Larxinostic","Larxinostic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Larxinostic/","39 products in account","Recommended: Game: Yes | Port: Yes\nOverall: Game: 6/10 | Port: 8/10\nBreakdown: Gameplay: 6/10 | Story: 5/10 | Sound: 7/10 | Graphics: 7/10\n\nThe Legend of Dark Witch is a cute Japanese indie 2D platformer fusing Mega Man-style game flow and level design with Gradius-style powerups. Originally released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop, Dark Witch has now pleasantly made its way to Steam. Its port did need some tuning at first, particularly in terms of controller input and layout recognition. Now that those issues have been resolved, the game unveils itself to be satisfying and affordable enough that I can safely recommend it as a decent, enjoyable little platformer.\n\nZizou Olympia, the titular Dark Witch, has set out on a trek to locate and retrieve the stolen Syega crystals, which supply magical blessings to the general populace. As a goddess, and a bit of a snarky one at that, Zizou's not going to let anyone obstruct her investigation - and hence, she finds herself progressing through eight stages, each overseen by a potential culprit. The game plays out like an early-era Mega Man series entry across mostly-horizontal stages, rear-guarded by a boss who'll yield her special weapon to Zizou upon defeat. Throughout the stages, however, Zizou collects Tres power from slain foes, building up an enforcement gauge offering various Gradius-style powerups such as increases in running speed and shot power. The game's above-average difficulty encourages the player to put these to good use rather than sit back hoarding Tres, especially since each attack Zizou survives depletes some of her accumulated Tres gauge. Fortunately, merely attacking a boss can also build some meter so that Zizou won't face the prospect of going totally without Tres at a critical moment. All acquired Tres can then be spent at the menu shop between stages to improve Zizou's base parameters and the potential utility of her newfound special attacks. Each of the opening 6 bosses can be tackled in any order, after which the penultimate and final bosses - including the Syega's thief - await. It's up to the player to learn which boss is weak to which special power inherited from defeated bosses.\n\nThe game's colorful stages definitely stand out more in HD than they did on the small 3DS screen. A few nifty stage effects reminiscent of 16-bit-era Sonic and Rocket Knight games add to the flavor of the stages and gameplay. While none of the pixel art demonstrates sheer excellence, it's altogether capable and generally good-looking. Even better, the lineart assets really spring into focus in this HD polishing. Characters look sharp, eye-catching, and pleasingly adorable. Moreover, the game's decently-catchy soundtrack sounds easily clearer and beefier here than it ever could've on 3DS. Again, 16-bit-era gaming comes to mind, both in composition and presentation of the music. Few tunes really stand out as exceptional, yet similarly, few tunes prove to be headache-inducing or flat-out unlikable. There're some good songs here, listenable outside the game (without being knockout classics). On the flip side of the audio, competent Japanese voicework complements the admittedly-plain story snippets. It's not that Dark Witch lacks charming ladies; it's that those charming ladies don't say or do much at all. One might draw parallels here with, for example, a danmaku/bullet-hell shoot-'em-up in the vein of eXceed 3rd: a cast of nicely-drawn gals who don't leave too much of an impression either way. Basically, the story frames the gameplay but doesn't extend beyond it. As with the older Mega Mans - or Mega Men, perchance? - this is fine. Not great, but fine.\n\nAs for PC conversion and compatibility, Dark Witch v1.01 now natively supports 360-mode controllers. The game does play well enough on keyboard since it doesn't need a huge array of buttons to press at once, but it was wise for Inside System to better configure the initial limited controller support so as to ensure compatibility with a decent range of controllers. I'm playing it on a Logitech F310, a controller with which I've no qualms with how Dark Witch recognizes it. This is a positive alteration to aid with navigating the above-average difficulty of the game, at least in regards to the Normal setting. Here's some gratitude extended to Inside System for remedying these pitfalls, as they had dampened the fun of the game for several people.\n\nOverall, The Legend of Dark Witch doesn't really approach the level of a spectacular game. Rather, it's a generally *good* game throughout: good, colorful graphics; good, catchy music; good, solid gameplay. It isn't much for excelling, but it's not really horrid in any way. The story's not much, and Normal mode's no pushover. However, for what it attempts to be - a good, likable video game - it delivers.\n\nReview date: 2nd December, 2015\nRevision date: 3rd December, 2015","December 1, 2015","true","9.2"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","29","38","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/420770/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Old school 2D platform games have certainly been in the forefront in recent years. Games like Shovel Knight, Mighty No. 9, and Azure Striker Gunvolt are some great examples of how this seemingly “old school” type of gaming is more popular than ever. Trying to join in on the excitement is The Legend of Dark Witch. Witchcraft combined with a bit of customization allows this game to have a unique spot in this genre of games for the Nintendo 3DS.\n\nCircle Entertainment is a fairly new developer and publisher located in China that was founded in 2006. The company takes pride in themselves for utilizing the latest technology while keeping pace with the videogame industry. In addition, Circle Entertainment boasts that the average age for the company is only 25. Some of Circle Entertainment’s recent games include Theological July, Bridal June, Knytt Underground, and Demon King Box.\n\nRight off the bat, the storyline is not explicitly told. Players just start playing and eventually get snippets of what is going on in the world they’re playing in. Essentially, Syega Crystals, items that provide the power to all magical creatures in the world have gone missing. Your character, Zizou, a dark witch herself, must retrieve the missing Syega Crystals to bring balance to this mystical world. Unfortunately, the story isn’t anything new and is very cursory. Little to no depth of it is explored, and quite frankly, unentertaining.\n\nHowever, what was entertaining was the presentation of the game. The simple, yet well crafted, graphics of the game makes it at the very least a nice game to look at. Each stage has its own theme (library, fighting arena, etc.), with specific enemies, hazards, and unique music that directly tie into the stage you are currently battling through. The first stage, for example, is the library. Some enemies you face include a librarian, falling books, and a one-eyed book who launches pages at you. The music is pretty casual with nothing fast-paced. I’ve heard that libraries were a place of terror, so I suppose casual music with attacking books sounds about right.\n\nSince this is a ported game from Japan, there are voice actors who, logically, speak in Japanese. This is nothing new since it is very expensive to hire more voice actors. Consequently, the text that translates the banter back-and-forth works just fine.\n\nLike any typical 2D platform game, the objective is to get from one side of the stage all the way to the other. Sounds easy, right? Well if it does, you can adjust the gameplay with three different difficulties - Easy, Normal, and Lunatic. In addition, players can decide how they want to “install” upgrades to their character - auto (game selects which attributes to boost), semi-auto, and manual (complete autonomy). These customizations of gameplay, right in the beginning, can offer unique experiences to each player, in addition to some nice replayability.\n\nPlayers then use the A/X/B/Y buttons to either jump, attack, switch attacks, or utilize a special attack. At first, I was a little annoyed by the pre-designated button assignments, but quickly found out that you can customize it. The top screen offers the actual gameplay of your character, the world, and enemies. The bottom screen shows your health, lives, Tres (the currency you obtain from defeating enemies), and time. The presentation of the bottom screen was perfectly done - it’s a great layout that ensures that the top screen isn’t cluttered with an abundance of information. In addition, there is an electronic manual that you can access throughout the game - a handy thing in case you want some clarification for something on the screen.\n\nSomething that irked me about the gameplay is that you can just hold down the attack button and destroy any enemy without thought. The button-smashing-esque combat can get very old very quickly. If you like that type of gameplay, then this is fine, but for wants a little bit more thought in their fighting can find this terribly boring. There are also no opportunities to replenish your health. Ever. So you either have to die to get full health for the boss, or go through the level without taking damage….an obvious flaw and annoying concept for sure.\n\nUnfortunately, I was disappointed by The Legend of Dark Witch. The 2D platform action genre has some innovative and creative games. I always want to give indie games a chance, but the lack of story, intrigue, and overall appeal with this game simply made it unintriguing. The customization is a nice touch, but ultimately cannot save the game from a poor overall performance. Overall 5/10.","December 20, 2015","true","6.7"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","20","24","4","0"

There's also a 2nd playable character with new abilities and a much harder final boss fight.\nThe music is really catchy and the characters are very cute.\nIf you like games that plays like the classic Megaman games, I highly recommend this to you.\nI've spent nearly 100h on this game on my 3DS and I know I'm gonna spend a fair amount of time on this version too.\n","December 2, 2015","true","23.9"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","15","22","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwenyvier/recommended/420770/","gwenyvier","Gwenyvier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwenyvier/","160 products in account","This is not the best game, but it is not a bad game either. It seems to more or less be a port from the 3DS, which is significantly better than a mobile port that tries to translate taps and swipes into mouse movements. It is similar to Megaman with some RPG elements thrown in for flavor. Kill a boss, steal its weapon, another boss is weak to your new toy, rinse repeat.\n\nThe game starts out... odd. It opens in a tiny window that you can change when you hit the options, I turned full screen on and never had that issue again. It also starts by dropping you into a black screen that tells the controls, stays on that for a few seconds then goes to the title screen, no screens to tell who made the game or anything.\n\nThere are 3 difficulties, Hard is unlocked by beating the game on Normal first. There is an unlockable character, which I don't have yet, although I hear they play differently. And various goodies by beating levels/the game certain ways. The options menu has a few interesting things on it besides the normal stuff. Screen scrolling time (up and down, left and right) and  jumping options (either always the same height or varies by how long you hold the button). Nothing really special to mention, it's an option menu.\n\nThe story is sparse, very sparse. If you are looking for a deep story this is so not the game for you. The mcguffins have disappeared, you are trying to find the mcguffins. Hunt down bosses, ask about mcguffin, fight. That is about it.\n\nThe music is decent, nothing bad but in all honestly I can't remember a single song I've heard. There is some minor voice acting, but it is only before a boss fight, and unless you speak Japanese you're not going to know what was said as there's no subtitles for the lines.\n\nThe game looks nice! All the sprites are nicely designed, although some are used multiple times (I have seen at least 3 variations of the "pitchfork man", palette swap and different attack pattern). The levels all look different and are fitting of the theme of the area. At the beginning of each level it is like you're in a VR world/hologram until you hit a white line then everything switches over to the area's design... which has not been explained. The game also runs at a smooth 60FPS on my system, and I so do not have a good system, so it should run very nicely for most people.\n\nAnd now the most important part! The controls and how it plays! The controls are obviously a port over from the 3DS. If you've ever played a flash game the keyboard controls should be easy enough to pick up. ZXCV are your attack, jump, install(upgrade), and attack menu. AS let you quick swap to the previous/next attack type. Arrows are movement. The spacebar of all bloody things is the pause button, which makes absolutely zero sense to me. In every other game pause is either escape or P, why is it the spacebar here? The controls can NOT be changed. Ok, I take that back, they can... you can change which of the ZXCV keys does what, you can not change the movement keys, pause, or the next/previous weapon keys. The game also has controller support, which I did not try out, but I imagine work just fine seeing as the original game was designed for a system that has a controller. Any prompts given in game are taken straight from the 3DS version, so expect it to say "hit the A/B/X/Y key to do this".\n\nYou can autofire by holding the attack button, and that will clear the way through most of any given level. That is actually a little disappointing. There are hazards to dodge, and some enemies that you can't hit without either a weapon upgrade/change or waiting for their shield to drop, but autofiring will get you through a majority of any given level. I've gotten hurt more on hazards that were hard to dodge than any non-boss enemy. Autofiring will not work on the bosses, they get invincibility frames and their attacks are harder to dodge than the trashmobs in the levels. There is also a blocking mechanic that is poorly explained in game. Pretty much you perfect guard by tapping left or right (doesn't matter which) right as a projectile would hit you. Get it right and you get a small amount of XP and don't get hit, get it wrong and you lose a chunk of XP and lose some HP. You're better off dodging the attacks in my opinion.\n\nThere are also plenty of instant kill pits around, and you get knocked back when hit, so you can see where that goes.\n\nDO NOT Alt+Tab out of the game or it closes the game entirely! Shift+Tab works just fine, but Alt+Tab closes out the window for some reason. Oh, and to exit the game it tells you to Alt+F4... which I find cute.\n\nThe leveling system is interesting. You gain XP (tres) from killing enemies and it fills the bar at the bottom of the screen, and if you want the upgrade that is highlighted in red you hit the install key to use up all the XP to get it. You can't get previous ones if a higher level one is highlighted. The install upgrades are temporary and are gone if you die/finish a level. Also any XP not used you can use outside of levels for permanent upgrades which include more lives, get more XP from enemies, more HP, upgrades to weapons, etc. Your special weapons, the ones you steal from bosses, use XP as their ammo, so fire them wisely if you're trying to get an upgrade. Oh, and since I mentioned HP, there are no health items. If you get hit that HP is gone until you die or finish the level.\n\nOverall I like the game, it's fun and challenging and the bosses are great fun to fight. I find the life system arbitrary, especially since I lose all my temporary upgrades and most of the XP bar upon death. But that aside I'll be finishing this game. And remember, don't Alt+Tab!","December 23, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Gameplay consists of the weakness-finding run and gun platforming of Megaman paired with the powerup system of Gradius. This added a lot more depth to the game than I thought it would, as you can only power up so much and are required to choose those upgrades that will not only get you through the level, but also the boss at the end. It's a pretty tough platformer, requiring you to memorize map layout and enemy locations just like the good old days, and it also sports a series of unlockables and Easter eggs to bolster replay value. If there's any criticism to be levied against this game, it's that the boss powers seemed to be an afterthought and proved unnecessary for the most part. When all's said and done, though, The Legend of Dark Witch is a charming, challenging, and fundamentally sound platformer, and a great value for the asking price of $4.99.","December 6, 2015","true","3.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Like it? Good. Because that's this. You can start drooling now.\n\nPrefixed TL;DR: Buy this game. Seriously. Just go get it.\n\nStory story yada yada Come on we don't play these for the story. We play them, love them, and THEN get into the story.\nThere's six stages to choose from (I recommend going up against Klinsy first), and you get the bosses' attack after you defeat them. It's also a 2D platform shooter. So there's the Megaman bit.\nThe Gradius bit: When you destroy enemies and hit bosses, little butterflies called Tres pop out. Catch them and they fill a meter (though bit by bit instead of a full section at a time). If you're using Liner Shot or Comet (the basic weapons) when the enemy dies, the Tres home in to you; if not, they fly up and away. Fill the meter to the section that you want, press the Install button (3DS A, Xbox B), and that aspect gets powered up. Speed makes you go faster, Wing lets you hover, Liner and Comet switch to that basic weapon (or add simultaneous shots), and Power makes your Liner/Comet attacks stronger.\nIt's a great combination. The text is funny when it can be and serious when it needs to be. The gameplay itself and controls are tighter than anything but an SNES Megaman X.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, there's a very small number of games that compel me to play it again and again even after getting a 100% clear. This game is one of them. So is its (currently 3DS-only, but bet on it coming to Steam) sequel that bumps the stage count up and gives you far more customization options. I'm still actively playing both, with this on both Steam and 3DS! There are two things I'm bummed about. First is the pretty obvious doujin-like failing in screen size and fullscreen. The other which I won't bash is actually a fixed bug that on the 3DS let you use the Dia Missile to gain Install meter (but not actual Tres).\n\nSo, go scroll up now and buy this game.","February 4","true","7.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

When did you get so . . . kawaiiiiiiiiiiii?\n\nIn this game, as in the Megaman/Rockman series, you select the order in which to take on a selection of themed levels; you get a special weapon after defeating the boss of each, and every boss is particularly sensitive to a certain special weapon.\n\nThe action is flawlessly smooth, and I must admit that I'm a sucker for the cutesy art style.  I did feel that the Megaman-style acquisition of boss weapons was a little tacked on, though, since there's almost no use for them outside of boss fights.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/martze/recommended/420770/","martze","Matsu Muhō (無法松)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/martze/","435 products in account","This game is quite good and fun. It's Mega Man with a splash of Gradius. The spritework and music are both quite good. The story is vapid but ignorable. The difficulty ramps way up in the final stages.\n\nThere's a few annoying little problems with it. Don't let this discourage you from buying the game, I'm just very adept at finding flaws.\n\nFirst, the fact that it has camera options reeks of bad game design. Especially when designing a 2D game, you should pick camera settings that work, and design the game around them. And, surprise surprise, none of the camera options quite work perfectly. After some effort, I found the least bad ones.\n\nPut "camera position" on the highest setting, which pushes your character far to the back of the screen. You won't be able to see much of what's behind you, but this won't matter for most of the game, as there's only a handful of places in the game where enemies respawn. You will find the ability to see and shoot enemies far ahead of you to be extremely useful.\n\nPut "camera speed" to its lowest setting, which counterintuitively makes it the fastest possible speed. This setting doesn't actually change how fast the camera scrolls—this is slow as molasses regardless. What it does do is cut out the delay before the camera starts scrolling, which makes the process as fast as possible.\n\nThere are other places where the camera work is sloppy too. Whenever you have to go downwards in a stage, such as down a cliff or staircase, you either have to do the jump blind or stop and hold down to reveal what's below you. This isn't a BIG deal, but a smart game designer would program the camera to scroll downwards to reveal these places automatically.\n\nPlaying as the second character, Riva, is awful. She's simply inferior to Zizou. She requires more effort to learn how to use her, and then when you do, she's STILL worse. Sword Rain and Extra are completely useless. Dash seems cool but it's almost impossible to control properly unless you're a superhuman.\n\nI would like the ability to configure what upgrades the semi-automatic mode installs. I sometimes miss the opportunity to install the upgrade I want during a tense moment, but the default loadout is undesirable.\n\nThe PC port is a little sloppy too. There's unremovable black bars on the left and right because this is a 3DS port and the 3DS screen isn't quite 16:9. You can't configure which monitor it outputs to. The only way to quit the game is to hit Alt-F4... or attempt to Alt-Tab out of it. You can only remap the face buttons, not the directional buttons, or even the quick weapon change buttons. You may have to use JoyToKey to get a reasonable control setup in this game; I simply decided not to bother with the quick weapon change buttons.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game, and I do recommend it. The flaws are dwarfed by the quality of the game. Just don't bother playing as Riva unless you want a challenge and Lunatic Mode as Zizou doesn't scratch it.","January 9","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There's an easy mode that makes the game pretty playable even for non-Mega Man fans, and Hard mode is a solid challenge for those with experience.\n\nThe game's a little low on polish and fancy extras, but replayability is high due to challenges you can do that unlock extra features or power ups for later playthroughs. The crazy low price makes the lack of polish pretty acceptable IMO. Bring a controller.\n\nThe sequel Dark Witch 2 solves most of the problems (odd issues, lack of customization, lack of polish, amount of content) but I still recommend picking up the original.\n\n(Note most of my play time was on a 3DS copy I paid for.

All the same, that's probably the best way to describe The Legend of Dark Witch. Though not quite greater than the sum of its parts, Dark Witch is definitely well-worth the $5 INSIDE SYSTEM is asking for on Steam.\n\nIn this game, players take on the role of Zizou, a witch searching for the Syega Crystals, powerful artifacts that granted magic to the world. After they went missing, the world plunged into darkness. So Zizou searches for any clues to the whereabouts of the missing Syega.\n\nThe base game plays slightly like an early MegaMan game, but to add some distinction, it's given a variant of Gradius's power-up system. By destroying enemies, Zizou collects "Tres", energy pellets that resemble butterflies, which fill her power-up meter. As a new level is achieved, a new power-up can be activated. These include Speed (which increases her walking speed and momentum), Wing (allowing her to hover for a brief period), Line (which can either switch to her default weapon or add a additional angle of attack), Comet (her alternate attack, which can be enhanced like "Line") and Power (which increases the damage her attack does). There are six stages selectable from the beginning (8 in all), each with their own boss. Each boss grants Zizou a new weapon upon defeat, and as with MegaMan, certain bosses are weak to certain weapons. However, these weapons deplete the power-up gauge with each use, not unlike MegaMan's own limited weapon energy.\n\nIn addition to filling the power-up gauge, Tres also acts as a currency which can be used to enhance Zizou's default weapons' base damage, improve on the boss weapons she receives, increase her health, increase the number of Tres she collects at the beginning of each stage and on each enemy she defeats and the number of lives Zizou has on each level.\n\nI've heard that this game had a rocky start on Steam, but when I played (using v.1.08), everything seemed to be smoothed out. The game has XInput controller support, multiple resolution support (though switching to and from full screen requires restarting the game), enhanced graphics, leaderboards, Steam achievements and trading cards. There's also a second playable character that can be unlocked by beating the game.\n\nTL;DR - If you've got an itch for an old-school run-and-gun à la Classic MegaMan and have got $5 to burn, definitely give The Legend of Dark Witch a shot. Here's hoping the sequel makes it to Steam as well!","February 25","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Sounds good, but it is a terrible idea in practice. The game feels like its own mechanics constantly go against fun - remember having a separate energy bar for every new weapon in Mega Man so you could experiment freely without hassle? Well, too bad, because this game actually uses the exact same Gradius-like energy for those weapons. You are basically given a choice of: Do you want to upgrade your basic weapon into a supercannon or just use up that energy to fire weapons that may or may not be effective, and sometimes absolutely useless because of their godawful range?\n\nYou might as well be told to choose between getting a gun and getting shot.\n\nI won't say this is a problem for someone who feels really hardcore defeating bosses with minimal effort, even without essentials like speed boosting (Gradius-style upgrade), but when you die in a boss or any enemy in a stage, you are set back to zero. Even worse, this game has no way for you to get your health back. This is made even further frustrating when you notice that the screen scrolls extremely slow when you turn around. I cannot emphasize the slowness of this enough, you basically have to stand still and wait for the screen to scroll if you happen to zig zag around a maze or just want to explore carefully.\n\nSpeaking of exploration, remember how much fun in Mega Man it was to see a power up and figuring out how to get to it? Well here they went for something completely unfun; The power ups are invisible and hidden in a specific spot on each map, and you have to just blindly jump around looking for them, at which point the slow scrolling gets even more annoying when you get blindsided by enemies that suddenly respawn as you carefully hit every empty air space you can.\n\nThen when you get knocked around a few times in a level or boss, your last resort is to basically grind respawning enemies until you level up your basic attack - and I am genuinely asking right now for someone out there to explain to me what's the point of having to choose between the two attacks, Line and Meteor, when there is no discernible difference that would make one better over the other? It just makes you scream when you switch your attack to the other accidentally, wasting your power meter for something you didn't want.\n\nStill with me? Alright, now, when you finish the game first time around, you're given another character to play as, and she is even more frustrating to play with - that's the theme here. It's frustrating and it's not fun to play as these characters. But the second character is even worse because her basic attack's reach is spitting distance, and its reach is leveled through the Gradius-style system. She can charge her attack like in Mega Man, but its reach remains the same, dependent on the attack's level. You have to be as close as possible to enemies and bosses to hit them, and at this point I just wanted to go play Mega Man and Gradius instead.\n\nAs a big bonus "up yours" the second character's last and most expensive upgrade is something that lets you fire charged up attacks with just a push of a button, but only for a short time. You know what the problem is with this? It's that the bosses have momentary invulnerability between attacks, so this skill is entirely pointless - none of the little enemies are so badass that you would need to shoot multiple charged attacks at them, and just tapping the button is already good enough. You are doing the exact same damage to bosses without this skill if you just charge, shoot, wait for the invulnerability to wear off, and attack with a ready charged shot again.\n\nThe design decisions make no sense, the levels feel lifeless, the music is pretty nice, the bosses are dull and made frustrating with the needless power downgrade that comes with death, and the fusion of Mega Man and Gradius just makes it feel like taking the worst parts of both games.\n\nIf you like a game that demands perfection with your moves, like I know some people do, then you might enjoy this game. If you are looking for something that feels like Mega Man or Gradius and is fun and rewarding to play, then this will just make you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nLet's finish this wordy rant of a review with one more thing: The final boss in the game with the first character is terrible. It's a gauntlet of enemies that you just defeat as they spawn, while the boss itself hovers overhead, spewing slow projectiles. The boss's health slowly drains while you just wait and kill the enemies from memory. There is no tension or a feel of a big battle, you are just standing in place and killing regular enemies. I could've recommended this game based on boss battles alone, but seeing how most of them are just completely immobile cannons, it just clinches this game as a missed opportunity.\n\nI hope that the developers don't give up just yet, though. There is a good chance these folks could make a good Mega Man-like if they dump the Gradius part and make a simple platformer instead. Mega Man and Gradius do not mix.","December 22, 2015","false","6.1"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","2"

Its Mega Man inspired level select remains as good of an idea as it was when, well, Mega Man first did it. Your character and the bosses she confronts have cute designs and nice animations. The fundamentals of action platforming are present.\n\nBut I can say a lot of bad things about it, too. The level selection may have taken inspiration from Mega Man, but the extremely bare-bones level designs clearly have not. The abilities you get from defeating the bosses might have, but from the worst examples in the Mega Man series – they’re almost useless outside of a few niche applications. The system by which you level up abilities over the course of a stage means that you have a huge incentive to defeat a boss on your first try, because additional attempts leave you with far less powerful attacks. Hardly desirable in the kind of game where learning a boss’s patterns is crucial to victory!\n\nWorst of all is the progression system. You can permanently unlock new abilities using in game currency, but it's acquired at such a slow rate that you'd have to play dozens, if not hundreds, of times to obtain everything. I'm not clear on whether the higher difficulty levels are balanced around the expectation you'll have this stuff – much of which is comprised of rather boring statistical improvements – or not, but there's really no answer to that question that makes it sensible to have a progression system at all, much less such a glacially paced one.\n\nI don't regret playing Legend of Dark Witch once, but it would have to be far longer or far better to justify how many times its developers seem to have expected you to play it.","June 3","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A Megaman style game with a different spin? Yes please! Unfortunately, the difficulty in this game seems to come not from enemy strength or numbers, but on anything less than a perfect run. This game emphasizes on collecting currency known as "tres" from defeated enemies, which can then be use to aqcuire temporary upgrades, such as increased movement speed and attack power. This sounds pretty awesome on paper, but the execution is nothing less than painful.\n\nThe main character moves painfully slow, so the first enhancement you'll naturally aim for is speed, which has different tiers of that you'll need to unlock. After you attain your fastest speed, the flow of the game feels much better, so maybe you'll aim for higher attack power, or an extra line of shots, making the dispatch of enemies easier. Great! But what happens if you die? YOU LOSE ALL OF THE ENHANCEMENTS. And if you died past an invisible checkpoint on the stage, you'll start off further down the stage with your default attack power and painfully slow speed, forcing you to build up more "tres" energy in a desperate attempt to get back the enhancements you lost.\n\nNow, you COULD technically respawn enemies by running back and forth, since they respawn once their default position is off screen, but why should anyone have to do that? Would you even WANT to? That doesn't sound fun to me, it sounds tedious and breaks the immersion of the game. And if you die again? Well, you'll wind up running back and forth all over again, killing the same enemies until you get the enhancements back. And if you die against the boss (which you will) you don't get to recollect "tres", so you're stuck fighting a boss at the default, wimpy, painfully slow version of yourself.\n\nI can appreciate the Megaman style with a different spin approach, but this temporary enhancement mechanic really breaks the game. Speed really is the single most important aspect of the game, and when you lose that speed because of a mistake, or just from good old trial and error of figuring out a boss, it really serves as a major handicap and immersion breaking. If you want to play a Megaman style game, I would say just to play a Megaman game.","May 2","false","1.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I really did.  This was Mega Man meets Gradius.  But an artificial difficulty that increases exponentially unless you are playing absolutely perfectly bogs this game down as being unfair.\n\nAs mentioned, this is Mega Man meets Gradius.  As you defeat enemies, you gain points to spend to upgrade your abilities like in Gradius.  The more points you gather, the bigger the upgrade.  Unfortunately, if you get hit, you lose half of the points you currently have.  If you die, you lose all of your points and your hard-earned upgrades.\n\nThis is at its worst during boss fights.  You enter the fight with whatever upgrades you have, but when you die you have begin with nothing.  This can be difficult against many bosses when you at least need to upgade your Speed once to dodge the boss's attacks.  But while you're gaining points for every Chip you knock off the boss's health, you're losing a lot of Upgrade Points because they're hitting you.  If you die once at a boss, it becomes an uphill battle.\n\nThis is made even worse with the Special Weapons.  Like in Mega Man, you can acquire the weapons of the bosses.  The problems is that the Special Weapons get their energy from your Upgrade Points.  So any time you use your Special Weapons, your losing Upgrade Points that you need to upgrade yourself.  It's a bad mechanic that unneccessarily raises the difficulty.\n\nThis mechanic pulls down the entire game.  And a lot of the problems step from that Upgrade Bar.  I like the idea, but its implimentation has turned a fun game into a frustrating game due to an artificial difficulty.  I'm hoping in future installments, the developer will take the criticism on the nose and use it to make a better, less cheap system.\n\nOh, and as an added note, the Level Design was very lacking.  All of the levels may have looked different but they felt the same.  No hazards or obstacles that really distinguished itself from one another.","April 30","false","0.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Its way to short and can be unforgiving. Its not much fun as it does not take long to disect the enemies patterns and the gameplay element forces you to either use upgrades with very limited ammo or go for upgrades which are way more useful. It is a basic Megaman clone with cool retro arcade graphics that takes the one element of Megaman that was the best and throws it out the window (weapons from defeated bosses are useless). Seriously the main weapon you start with is overpowered and the best to stick with.","January 3","false","3.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It stutters the same way as if  you're playing a 50hz game vsynced to 60hz. I'm sure not many will recognize this, but ultra-smooth scrolling in these types of games is essential.\n\nPlayed for 5 minutes before I quit. Will I ever play again? Maybe, if they fix the scrolling and add a full screen option.","December 5, 2015","false","0.1"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","1"
