The combat is satisfying, but can grind a bit after a while - but what you're really coming to a game like this for is the bizarre setting and characters.  You could play it without the first game and not miss much as the story is so bizarre anyway, but it's worth playing both.

I have completed both and there's quite a bit of things to say about both of them.\n\nThe vivid, quirky design of landscape, buildings, characters and items/weapons is present in both games, and it's truly something refreshing that you don't actually see in every game out there.\nThe storyline, too -- is connected. The two are connected, so I suggest you play Zeno Clash before picking up on Zeno Clash 2, as you most likely won't understand the story behind Ghat's 'family' and what happened to it in the events of the original.\n\nNow, onto the mechanics themselves. The game is a first-person brawler, and it's a bit easier than the original. (At least as I remember it, I've played it ages ago. Literally!) The mechanics of the brawling is actually great. Rarely ever will you run into a bug, and the new tools of the trade (Grenades, Chain, as I like to call it the Sun/Moon-strike gauntlet and the Golem Link are all amazing tools that are (later on) at your disposal. The game is very responsive and plays out well, the punches connect when they need to connect, and the special moves that you learn how to use in the tutorial or later on come to play when you fight a bit more advanced enemies.\n\nOnto the world;\nThe world of Zenozoik is truly amazing. It's a 'civilization' between barbarism and chiefdom as described by one of the game characters you will (later on) absolutely love and root for. The locations! They're absolutely amazing, quirky and detailed just how they were in the first Zeno Clash. Now, for a fan -- this is not a bad thing! This is absolutely amazing as it has freshened up my memory on the world itself, especially the 'city' of Halstedom.\n\nNow, if you're familiar with the game you'll notice a lot of old characters appearing, such as Rimat, Father-Mother, Pott and others. And they're spanking new amazing in the second edition. Also, guess who you'll encounter as well? Chneero! That's right! You'll meet Chneero, the one-legged Corwid! And you will love it.\n\nThe game sparkles with detail, and it's absolutely stunning. It has taken my breath a few times when I was watching the horizon over Zenozoik. Why? Well, you'll notice the level design -- which is actually original, and the character/monster designs that you haven't seen anywhere else, really.\n\nZeno Clash 2 blooms with originality and is truly an under-rated and under-appreciated title on Steam.\nWorth the money? Definitely worth even more.\n10/10","March 22, 2014","true","7.0"," 63 of 74 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","63","74","0","4"

The story is often confusing and poorly conveyed through incredibly stilted dialogue delivered by in-game cutscenes. Navigation is a constant source of frustration as the game will decide to leave player’s without an objective marker and no clue as to where to go next. Melee combat takes up the majority of the mechanics and it largely works.The confusing narrative, poor voice acting, and lackluster puzzles make the game hard to love, but if “weird” is your niche, this trip offers some solid entertainment.The game’s utter oddness is enough to grab the attention of the average gamer, but its on-and-off mission structure isn’t going to keep them for long and once again fisticuffs in first-person proves problematic.Hugely imaginative but slightly irritating.

Rather than being a linear adventure in the first game Zeno Clash 2 has large areas to explore interconnected with each other. This gives the world a more cohesive feel.\n\n+ Each area to explore is unique and different from the last making it exciting when you reach new areas.\n\n+ Both Zeno Clash games can not be faulted for being unoriginal. These games are some of the craziest, most unique and original ideas in a game. Everything from the world to the characters to the enemies makes for a very fresh experience.\n\n+ Unique enemy designs\n\n+ Artistically the game is nice with some really nice scenery, technically however I felt that it was average\n\n+ Combat is fun, one of the few games that has done first person melee fighting successfully. In addition to straight combat, you can find weapons/guns or use your secondary items to defeat your enemies.\n\n+ Some slight RPG mechanics. Scattered throughout the world are skill totems, fidning them gives you experience points where you can spend them on 4 attributes: Health, Strength, Stamina and Leadership.\n\nAverage:\n\n-The game is somewhat easy, I had little trouble on normal and I don't think hard would have posed too much trouble either. One of the secondary items makes combat pretty trivial most of the time.\n\n-If you never played the first game then you will not understand what the hell is going on. If you played the first then you will still be confused only slightly less. The story is decent but isn't presented as well as it should be and that is a shame because the story touches upon some interesting themes that should be expored further.\n\n-The attribute leadership is somewhat of a useless stat. Leadership allows you to recruit allies to fight with you in many battles, a new addition to the game. The problem is, combat being easy and your AI companions being stupid doesn't make it a worthwhile stat, making it very meaningless.","January 26, 2015","true","8.4"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","30","34","0","0"

This for me is the main strenght and feature of the game in fact, exploring this world and its fauna and flora is just simply awesome, every minute and every moment.\nAnd that is also why I think the main focus of the game is exploration and storytelling. The brawling aspect in my opinion is just an extra feature, a means to progress the story by defeating your adversaries, but not the game's selling point.\n\n+ Two kinds of collectibles giving the game more depth and content, as by finding them, they each unlock other things for you, both lore based as well as improving your character.\n\n+ The game's lenght is just right. Without looking for all the extra things, doing sidequests and just enjoying the sights, it would still take around 6 or 7 hours which in my opinion is a very fair lenght for such a very unique game.\n\n+ The surrealism.. The design of not only fauna and flora are great, but some of the characters in game, both hostile and neutral will just blow your mind with their looks, as they did mine.\n\nFor the sake of fairness, let's also point out things that I did not mind, but other people might:\n\n= Some locations do not have fast travel points so you have to backtrack on foot a few times. I did not mind this because hey, given how beautiful the places are, it was kind of a bonus for me to see them again.\n\n= The game is not really challenging. On normal, I had no trouble progressing at any time despite the fact I hate melee fighting and thus am pretty bad at it, so for anyone who always likes being challenged by their game, go for hard diff, or a no-upgrade run. ( and yes, I hate melee fighting and yet, I love this game, thats how great its exploration and story parts are )\n\n= As partially mentioned above, the game's combat is kind of an extra thing, I for example used the same moves the whole game and it worked, not caring for any combos ( which are available though ), as well as ignoring the games skull grenades, which I find redundant as they seem pretty ineffective and overall, just, unnecesary.\nThe combat system is however in no way boring or even frustrating, and that is because luckily, the combat lenght is usually around 2-4 minutes, of the mandatory fights in the game.\n\n= Partially connected to the above point, enemies respawn in locations. But, you do not have to fight them at all.\nYou can easily just run past them and they will never catch up to you, so it once again does not really get annoying, you just go about your business and they will eventually give up or you will just reach your goal and leave.\n\nTo sum up, this is a unique gaming experience!\n\nIf you love games that are surreal, beautiful and unique in design, have great stories, and are really fun to explore and spend time in, this game is definitely for you.","September 24, 2015","true","10.9"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

Like the first opus all the fighting is mainly about fisticuff and peculiar blunt weapons which makes for some intriguing at first but generally very satisfying gaming experience. As you might expect the story unfolds and takes on where the first opus left it back in the days. Some questions remained unanswered in the past and Gatt will need to put his own personal straight up hammer-diplomacy to use once again to bring justice to his fellow Zenozoid brethren and save them from the evil designs of the makers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/215690/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Released 4 years after its predecessor, Zeno Clash 2 takes place where the first game left off. FatherMother is now imprisoned and Ghat - teamed up with Rimat this time - is planning to set him free. All this is because of Golem, the mysterious creature our heroes were helped by who - to have the favour returned - decided to rule our heroes' village and establish some not exactly just laws.\n\nThe core elements remain the same: Zeno Clash is still a brawling game. But now with more fluid combat which also means it is easier this time. We feel more in control of our body and the rage meter that gradually fills helps us deliver bigger punches. Alternatively, we can initiate a fury status which allows Ghat to unleash stronger punches faster. Melee weapons and guns return and here we have some new additions.\n\nWe now have a chain which allows us to have a greater reach. Also, we have some creative weapons such as the gauntlet that is for opening gates - either the moon or the sun light can help us here. The other gauntlet allows us to link two enemies - by hitting one of them the other suffers the same damage. This is a good idea in case we have run out of skull grenades and we are facing a horde of enemies.\n\nOverall, the more fluid fighting technique with the new combos gives us a better - and more enjoyable - brawler experience. Facing big guys is not as tedious this time as it used to be. We have more tactics up in our sleeves and the extra weapons such as the somewhat overpowered chain really allow us to have a good time.\n\nGraphics-wise the game looks better than ever. I especially liked the golem creatures' animation and some of the vistas are gorgeous. Some of the cutscenes deliberately employ the light of the setting sun and walking along the coastline and looking at the constantly changing tides can be invigorating. The music is great and accompanies the transpiring events the same way it did 4 years ago.\n\nThe story? Still barely makes any sense. But now we can venture into the world of golem creatures and can get a few glimpses at their unique technology. More steampunk weirdness if you missed it. Did I also tell you we now have a creature with teeth in their beak? Zeno Clash 2 throws all the weird citizens of Zenozoik at us.\n\nThe campaign, interestingly, is not as linear as it used to be. We have waypoints that can take us to the desired place we need to be. Markers indicate in which direction we should go and as we now have side missions to complete we can just prioritise in the way we desire. We can also look for some collectibles - totems are especially important as they can level us up. This is a minor RPG element in the game I found unnecessary but ultimately interesting.\n\nThe challenge mode returns where round after round we can just beat up all our favourite Zenozoik friends and every penny we receive after every round counts: Do you purchase a weapon or unlock the chain? Or simply buy 4 allies who can help you survive the next round. By the way, allies: by talking to some of the citizens we are able to recruit some Zenos ourselves in the campaign - this is best if we cannot find a buddy for cooperative gameplay.\n\nZeno Clash 2 is great! Its large-scale fist-fights are greater and they surely involve even weirder participants. Grab it while on sale and go get into some fist-fights right away!","August 31, 2015","true","8.1"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

I do not understand the design choices here, almost everything got worse.\n\nZC1 gradually introduced you to fighting moves, ZC2 presents you an overwhelming tutorial and then gives you zero hints during the real game. The fighting system in ZC1 was perfectly fluent, it seems very clunky in ZC2. Most of the interesting moves deplete your aggresivity bar, and once it is empty (very soon), you're stuck with just basic punches and the fight gets slow and tiresome. The moves in ZC2 are no longer intuitive, but are artificially created. There is needless complexity in having not just a fast and a strong punch, but you can use both for both the left and the right hand, and you need to alternate between them to achieve combos. Combos are the strongest artificial example here, you need to remember how to alternate between left and right attacks in order to achieve them. There's nothing logical in that. Also, it's very difficult to kick someone on the ground now. Simply put, it no longer feels like a real, brutal, raw, intense fight.\n\nIntroduction is also lacking in other areas, not just fighting moves. When you start the game, you find clams containing items, but you can't pick them up, and you have no idea why and what they are for. ZC1 told you that by eating fruit you regain health. In ZC2, there is no such hint, and all of those items are brownish or greyish something (I haven't recognized what they should represent), so you're left wondering. At least some tips would be nice.\n\nThe story in ZC1 was at a reasonable pace, and interesting, mostly using hints than revealing things. In ZC2 everything seems to be happening really fast and doesn't make much sense. It's like several book pages were missing between each of the cutscene. Moreover, it seems to go directly against the story in ZC1, the main character completely switched sides. Very confusing.\n\nThe open world - why?? ZC1 was very linear, but it made perfect sense, it was a freaking brawler. ZC2 seems to feature "open world" which sports large open areas interconnected by portals and loading screens. First it breaks immersion, second it leaves you running around not knowing what to do (the map is so useless!) and the annoying critters respawn every time you enter the area again. The checkpoint system is the last straw - not knowing when the game was saved last and having no ability to save manually is a disaster in an open world game with large open areas.\n\nTechnically the graphics is OK, but for some reason I liked ZC1 graphics better. Surround sound support is broken, characters voices are nearly inaudible, you have to switch to stereo in the operating system.\n\nIt's a pity, I was looking forward so much to this game.","September 7, 2015","false","2.0"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","26","38","0","0"

The story, characters, monsters, weapons, and scenery are just as wacky as the first.

And let me tell you; I had a blast playing the first one and I had even more fun playing the second one, even if it had a slightly higher learning curve in the beginning. Let me sum it up:\n\nFirst; the graphics have been improved. It now runs on UE3 and it shows. It's sharp, runs at 60fps and looks gorgeous. The environments and characters are simply amazing. What a great world ! ACE Team sure knows how to build an intriguing, weird world.\n\nSecond; the world is now bigger (unfortunately still a bit too linear) and has sidequests.\nThird; Ghat (main character) has more moves, including the awesome looking and easily executed piledriver.\n\nFourth; you can now bring allies into some of  the bigger battles. It also introduces co-op, so you can run around and fight bad guys with a buddy.\nTell me that that doesn't sound cool, right ? Hell yes !\n\nAt the same time it also has some flaws, thanks to these new additions. Let me sum those up:\nThe world is bigger, yes, but it's still divided into hubs. So instead of using one big world, it's split up which throws you a bit out of the experience every time you have to travel. These portals also look a bit out of place.\n\nSince battles contain multiple enemies it's hard to use some of your newer moves. And while your allies are somewhat helpful, they can also get in the way when you're fighting (inconvenient when friendly fire is on). The game also locks onto enemies automatically, so you'll have to switch around a lot. My advice is to disable this in the options menu so you can move around freely and lock when you feel you like it.\n\nAnd like always, whenever a game is awesome, we don't want the experience to end too soon. Zeno Clash 2 isn't short, it's about 8-9 hours long (including all sidequests), but still on the short side for an 'open world' game.\n\nI had a great time playing it, and I truly hope ACE Team will earn enough money to give us a third game of this wonderfully realized world.

The switch to an "open world" structure has nothing to it than being just a level playing field for enemies to roam. it isn't even worth using your fists to fight at all when you get the chain weapon at the very freaking beginning of the game, which tilts the balance of difficulty tremendously in your favor. You don't even have to throw a single punch once you have it. Just spam the chain weapon all the day long and no enemy can get close to you.\nPlus the presence of stupid "puzzles" that are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to solve, especially with no walkthroughs or anything to help makes it all the more worse.\nThe game is so bland, collecting the moths scattered throughout the maps actually feels more fun than any of the actual playing","February 6, 2014","false","7.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

I didn't know whether to buy one or two. If this is your case and you don't own both games and you do end up buying one copy... buy the first if you can. If you liked the first, you'll definitely like and buy the second. The story line gets exponentially better and relates to the previous story.\n\nThe second Zeno Clash takes place with a continued story line from the last. Ghat is now able to roam freely unlike the first which guided the player and jumped place to place. If you've played the first, those places that you went to, you are able to visit freely again. New enemies are created that suit their terrain wherever you go along the world. I like how the first literally did not need any free-roaming, it was nice to have something different in the second one (as you were able to continuously run).\n\nThe game-play has changed I would say about 50% from normal. You can now call up allies when you fight, which sort of takes away being smothered by opponents. The first one really felt like you hit your opponent, that same effect is still there but not to that satisfaction of that from the first (that pttchhhhh sound when hitting someone good and that dynamic camera movement). What I did like though (probably the best upgrade), is when you were being attacked from behind, you were warned and were able to press both mouse buttons to counter the opponent hitting your back. This is huge as Zeno Clash you'll find yourself sometimes surrounded by many enemies. I would definitely like to see more of this type of feature (hopefully with one button control or kick control) if a new Zeno Clash comes out.\n\nThe fighting scheme is somewhat the same and both hands now are able to power punch. Weapons are as far out as they were before and 3 new weapons are added to your "special" arsenal. One is a chain which comes very handy and is fun to use, the other two are two special Golem weapons which I won't spoil. The fighting is a bit more decorated in the second, and I feel more freedom was given. The grab function has also slightly switched.\n\nI would recommend this game if you are a real Zeno Clash fan or just really liked the first. Unless your the guy who likes newer games instead of older version of games then grab number 2.\n\n\n\nRating : 7.8/8\n\n\n\nwould give it an 8 if the game was slightly more different than the first. I would also like to ask kindly that the creators the Zeno world make sure a Zeno Clash 3 comes out :)!\n\n\nFor future Zeno Clash games I would recommend multiplayer, and maybe even dare to try to incorporate local co-op. To add to the fighting, perhaps add kicks or even allow for players to hold down the mouse button, then use the mouse to swing to determine the type of swing. Don't make it to the point where people start snapping their mouse cord, but something decently close enough.\n\n\nScreenShots :\nDumbo has certainly changed over the years\n\nThe way they chose to portray the game is simply excellent\n\nI don't think I've ever played a game with so much diversity\n\nFew perks included in challenge mode","August 26, 2014","true","8.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Zeno Clash 2 is a slightly more open beat'em-up set in first person against creatures that look like a junkie's nightmares. Yes, the same hodge-podge group of ecclectic animal parts have spent a good deal of time figuring out new ways to re-esemble things that look vaguely human but not quite enough to off-set that uneasy feeling. Of course, the fact that you get to cave-in nearly every punch-able face you see helps.\n\nThe combat is the biggest part of the game. Happily, it not only works fantastically by itself, it actually fits into and around the story. It doesn't bog down the story ACE Team is trying to present, and the story fits in with the fighting so that you don't feel held back by cutscenes or dialogue keeping your from punching more dudes. The punches and weapons have impact as well, sending oponents reeling, dropping their weapons, or even sending them flying. Unfortunately, that goes the same for you: when the enemy hits you, you feel it.\n\nI love this game. I've never been a big fan of beat'em-ups but somehow this game really gets me excited. The characters are vivid in more than just their off-putting looks and the story is fascinating. The environments have made a huge change for the better, becoming more open and vibrant. However, don't let the openness fool you. This game is still very linear; not quite as linear as the first one, but it is very far from open world. However, you are free to explore the various locales as many times as you want.\n\nThe story is one of this game's strong points. ACE Team's writers crafted a world that really feels alive and sets itself apart from similar RPG titles. It works hard to connect every thread from the first game into this one and expands beyond its predecessor in the way a sequel should. The story is far from perfect, of course. A few points could easily have been skipped and nothing would have been lost. However, those points are interesting in their own way and add to the life of this world even if they add nothing to the main plot.\n\nZeno Clash 2 is worth every penny. It provides a great story both as a standalone and as a continuation of the Zeno Clash world, and the combat is superb, fitting in perfectly with the story and shining as a testament to first person beat'em-ups. It isn't terribly hard, but it won't be a walk in the park either.","January 6","true","10.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I'm not sure I did, but I had a lot of fun.\n\nZeno Clash is niche. It is also obtuse and unfriendly to newcomers. There are no tutorials (apart from a couple of screen prompts in your first fight); there's no journal, no quest log, no helpful NPCs offering guidance on what to do or where to go. There are entire sub-plots you could miss by not going into the right house in the opening city (which gives no indication it is a hub area). This really is a game in which you are dumped in a world, given the lightest of prods in the direction of a story - and then get left on your own. Persevere and you might end up loving it.\n\nI loved it. The game is pretty short (6 hours or so), the controls are clunky (there's one fight which requires a special ability that will have you gnashing your teeth), but the combat is satisfying, the game is beautiful and it is unlike anything I've ever played (though I might now have to check out Zeno Clash 1).\n\nIf you are fed up of being spoon fed AAA baby food, this comes highly recommended.","October 20, 2014","true","9.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The guns--while powerful, were clunky and unwieldy, just like the hand to hand combat initially. But just like the combat, the plot, art, and enviroment deepen immensely with time. Half way through the game, no spoilers, I found out exactly how deep it was.\n\nThe story isn't extremely well written...However it is worth weeding through, thorns and all. It's almost deeper than itself, the protogonist, Ghat is justified in his anger but doesn't handle correctly and gives us a cliff to jump right into the plot.\n\nThis time however, the attemps to streamline the gameplay serve to it's detriment. The combat got quite the downgrade and turned me off to the core gameplay. The story didn't grab me either, being a "Path to redemption" as I saw it. The Gameplay and the story together make for a rather unappealing engagement, and it lost me just after the first chapter. I cannot say I can reccomend this game.\n\nNow let's talk about the invidual points. Combat's up first. In the original game, you could easily see your reach, your blows felt like they had weight to them and each punch was satisfying. Countering was worth the practice, managing groups of enemies isn't even worth it a quarter of the time. You can just kyte them out, swing one punch to stall one of them. That's not the worst part. Your character has no reach. You literally have to stand chest-to-chest to engage your foes, the effect of your punches feels light, combat isn't worth it.\n\nPlot wise, it's a false call of retribution. For what little I was able to stick through, it was just another half-way written attempt to undo what the first game did in some way. I lost interest the moment I got the synopsis of what I was going to be doing in these first thirty minutes.\n\nThe combat along with the plot are what got me to charge on in the first one, but this game's was far worse than the original.\n\nEdit:// Since people don't respect the opinions of others, comments have been erased and shall be erased again.

I consider the last one to be the most important although the other two things are not insignificant upgrades. I still kind of like the really bad voice acting from the first game but I'd be lying if I said I was disappointed that everyone in Zenozoik seems to have taken English classes.\n\nThe combat mechanics haven't changed too much although you now have two or three attack combos you can use rather than just straight punches, kicking, and grabbing. In addition, there are a few new pieces of equipment added along with the return of the skull bombs. It all makes for a more polished experience.\n\nThe art direction is still weird and still amazing. As far as story goes, without spoiling anything I'll just say the revelations in this chapter make me hope for a Zeno Clash 3 to make it a full trilogy, There is definitely enough material left to flesh out a full third installment.\n\nMinus point: There's a single multiplayer achievement.

And while first person melee combat is a thing nowadays, most of them see players in sword fights or other similar melee weapons combat. Zeno Clash 2, however, focuses more on martial prowess, with emphasis on punches and kicks strung together into stylish combos, all seen from a first-person perspective. Playing Zeno Clash 2 is like watching one of those kung-fu action movies where the viewers get some interactive scenes to determine the plot advancement.\n\nIn some ways that is a great concept and a fresh introduction in the gaming industry, but it could be a bad thing. Despite the available number of moves and combos the players get in the game, unless you actually memorize each and every one of them you'll find that you'd end up repetitively spamming the same attacks anyway.\n\nOverall it is a good game, maybe not the best game in the market, but good enough if you need to kill time.

I played this with a friend through co-op a day after it was released. There were a few bugs but nothing that ruined our experience. The important thing is we had ALOT of fun playing this.\n\nHowever this games ambition seems to have swallowed all the potential content. It tries to be a big open world adventure but it still has the small studio budget logic and unfortunately it shows especially in the big open areas, there are just vast areas of quite frankly, nothing and  It's dissapointing that this studio can't get a bigger budget because these guys are really the only ones brave enough to go that extra mile with the weird and wonderful. Something that very few game studios do nowadays.\n\nThe combat was in my opinion better in the first game, if they put as much effort into putting originality into their characters and strange locations as they did their combat mechanics they would be on to a winner.\n\nFor a unique and different experience I'd recommend this game but I highly recommend you bring a friend along, Zeno clash 2's odditties are unique and special but it's sure lonely in the world of Zeno.

Also, there's Co-Op which is fun.\n\nYou could probably consider this as a First Person Brawler with Metroid/RPG like additions.  You level up your character, increase your stats, find upgrades & solve various puzzles in the environment.  It's also open world now, unlike its predecessor which is an overall improvement.  You can interact with people in towns & pick random fights if you wish.  Enemies also spawn outside of towns so you can always find something to thrash.  There are side quests as well which add to the more open world RPG like experience.  The main campaign is roughly around 5 or 6 hours so I won't spoil the story for you but it does have a better story than the previous game.  The problem though is that the game sets up something in the story & then never follows up with it.  Possibly because they are going to put it in the third installment if they plan on making one.\n\nOverall the game is fun & is an overall improvement over it's predecessor.  The character designs range from hilarious to down right creepy.

The ending, although satisfying, has left me hoping that the series becomes a trilogy.","November 16, 2014","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It was wacky to a fault and the gameplay was monotonous. But the creativity behind it maybe left enough of an impression that I splurged on a sale for the sequel.\n\nRegardless of the money, I don't feel playing through this game was time well spent. The world is bigger. It's less linear. There's more exploration and more characters. But those weren't problems that needed to be addressed or improved from the first game. It's like the developers focused on all the wrong things instead of working on any of the actual issues. The gameplay is still boring and limited and frustrating. The characters and the writing don't have any emotion in them, to say nothing of the flat, dull voice acting.\n\nWhat did make me happy was the lore and history of the universe getting fleshed out. That was the best part by far. Inevitably, it was drowned out by the other elements, and we're left with a story not worth telling. The events of these games don't actually seem to affect any real change for either the characters or the world they reside in.\n\nI have to give some props to the art direction. There are some beautiful moments of pure imagination. I'd probably buy some of these landscapes and levels as artwork. The problem is they're more fun to look at than to play through.","March 14","false","13.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Visually it's indeed a splendour, wierd and wonderful with all kinds of cool details to the world and it's inhabitants. Despite it being such an odd place you get really immersed in it thanks to the physiciality of the combat and your interactions. Even the games guns are clunky constructions made of bone and wood. In all, everything has weight. There are also a host of welcome improvements over the first installment. We get to spend less time with the Corwids of the original but in exchange we visit so much more of the land, get more challenges and tools at our disposal. Keeping this fighting game interesting, mechanically for it's dozen hours is quite the feat. Side quests often reward you with valuable items and weapons. Totems too encourage you to explore, to level up and make the game a bit easier given how tough the combat can be.\n\nIt's a little clunky though and overall the game lacks the polish of AAA titles. Voice acting ranges from good or solid to the outright bland but it never got distracting. It also strains at the seams to hold the games scale in place. But for the breadth and depth of it's ideas, as well as the colourful execution, it's absolutely a must play for those seeking something different.","August 29, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It easily matches the quality of a lot of AAA first person brawlers, even though it was made by a relatively small team of devs. It's pseudo-open world, consisting of a collection of medium sized areas seperated by brief loading screens.\n\nThe brawling mechanics are impeccably designed and make for a smooth fighting experience that remains challenging up until the endgame. It's action packed, and you'll be frequently accosted by bizzarre looking bandits and other enemies who want to beat you up. The story is weird and unique, and the universe is original and nicely realized.

Will it gives you a better rendition of the game's world, your adventure is still pretty linear, requiring you to simply go to place A to place B, then off to place C. Furthermore, the side quests are somehow scarce: the recruitment missions last for a short time, and so do the only two collectable tasks\nHowever, if you loved Zeno Clash art style and somehow charming story and characters, you won't disappointed in the sequels\nOn a bonus note, I always welcome the introduction of proper boss battles, which are another great change from the first Zeno Clash\n","August 6, 2013","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Btw, the story itself surprised me quite a bit, as it appeared my interpretations of what's going on there had been entirely wrong when I'd played ZC1 back in 2010.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the second ZC has become a free-roam experience with rpg elements, which is a good thing imo. Also, visuals were improved and everything feels a lot less clunky. On the other hand, battles now seem way to easy, so if you want them to be as challenging as they used to be in ZC1, I recommend playing on highest difficulty and not rely on weapons too much (some of which are blatantly unbalanced).\n\nCheers and thanks to the developers.

Doucet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mdoucet/","278 products in account","I was put off at first by this game simply not being Zeno Clash 1, which used a different game engine, more linear environments, and what felt like an entirely separate combat system. I don't personally like the Unreal engine, and feel that there are arguably few games that it works well for. The entire time I played it I could feel the anguish of the designers when something couldn't be realized exactly as they had imagined it, but what they truly gained from the switch was too great to ignore and I imagine was quite a point of conflict for the ACE team because really, for the game they were trying to make, they needed Unreal.\n\nIt took me a long time before I could appreciate the sheer brilliance of the game as a whole. Gating through upgrade acquisition, skill-ups through exploration, and an insane amount of little details throughout to help the world feel alive. Not necessarily anything new on its face, but the deeper you get into night the clearer things become. The more I played, the more I appreciated the lessons the team took to heart from their first game. Literally every part of the game bleeds thoughtfulness when scrutinized.\n\nThis game felt like it was made for me and I am notoriously difficult to please. I'm not dumbly impressed by beautiful vistas or flashy combat, but by the subtleties of fine details and overall execution. I'm not running from one exit to another, I'm standing in a field and observing how each individual part makes up the whole. I'm watching that bird, tethered to the exit, and thinking about how in this world that's how the inhabitants mark their boundaries.\n\nFrom the other side of the game, I can see that Zeno Clash 1 is a cave painting compared to the masterstroke of its sequel. One is not necessarily better than the other, so much as they each merely exist in entirely different contexts. Zeno Clash 2's story both surprises and delights, which was admittedly an unexpected and welcomed extra when all I really set out to do was live in that uniquely backward-but-forward world for awhile. 8/10.","February 10, 2014","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The characters were all unique in a way that made sense with the world.\n\nZeno Clash II really just ruins about all the elements the first had going for it. My only guess is it was the plague of 'Let's make an open world game for no reason!" Seriously, this new take on the game adds NOTHING except tedium and boredom. A couple of the power-ups you get early on are cool, but some of the puzzles are vague other than linking enemies and a few hidden orbs together to open gates. If the game wanted me to use it in a new puzzle, it would have to teach me or otherwise make something a little less obscure. Somehow, I also think the game looks worse considering the original ran on the Source engine and was a pretty tight experience; compared to Unreal engine, where the models are ugly and hit detection can be poor.\n\nOverall, I played this game - dropped it due to motion sickness and then recently re-insatlled with Flawless Widescreen and FOV maxed, mouse speed slowed, and auto-target off. I got much farther, but this game is just too boring compared to the original to keep caring.

I don’t know how that happened. the dialogue in the first game was fantastic and thoughtfully placed. words weren’t wasted, even the made up ones. things occurred logically, at the same time, a dash of the unpredictable, but the dialogue always sat in accordance to the situation and usually inflecting a caveman’s poetic sensibility. there is none of this in zeno clash II. only the golem is permitted to be well-written, everyone else, in taking background roles, sound like background characters. ghat is strung pathetically by rimat for no good reason at all. he contributes nothing more than wanting to beat people up when problems face his way. although that’s how he acted before, he was considerably more pensive about it. rimat has no clear ambition, besides wanting to help father-mother, except most of the things she does do not seem to accomplish anything. I guess, in the sense of their aimlessness, rimat and ghat string eachother along, but that doesn’t mean anything good. it’s all fueled by the nonsense desire to have sidequests. these give you more things to do and places to go, but they’re not well written or thought out, so level progression seems random, and how the characters justify it doesn’t sit very well. I’m quite certain rimat never had a good line throughout the entire game. at least ghat wanting to punch people is entertaining.\n\nhowever, though the dialogue is incredibly simple, even lacking, the story is still competent, and near the end, great. does that make sense? somehow, I lean towards: not really. zeno clash II has a habit of presenting things that don’t make sense. it deals with personal satisfaction, it deals with unshakable ideals, it deals with duty over honor, it deals with intellectual rebellion, it deals with living in a rut. most of  this stuff is in the shadows, told over half-meant quips of long lost history. the distance and at the same time casual immediacy of the story surprises. though it cannot be forgiven how bland the dialogue is or how sudden the plot developments come, it still manages to be convincing by the end of the game.\n\nyet, clear as day, plot and dialogue take a backseat in zeno clash II. the game is entirely about exploration. although accepting your first sidequest within city walls gives the game an air of a strange, barren western rpg, it isn’t the case at all. zeno clash II’s open world ends up more like zelda than anything else. there isn’t really anything open about it, the sidequests themselves being entirely linear and missable. it’s only an interconnected overworld. there are, oddly out of place, treasures to find. personal stat upgrades are hidden as totems and offer lukewarm progression. the amount they improve ghat is negligible and it starts to take far too many to see any improvement, yet the effort to giving things to collect is fine. that sentiment rears its ugly head with two other kinds of collectables, butterflies and cubes, that feel forced and relatively pointless. while the elegance of the world is a far shoot from, say, metroid prime, if you enjoy taking in the strangeness of the world, zeno clash II is incredible. you and impossibilities get to journey together. that’s the most important part about playing zeno clash II. experiencing another world that’s an otherworld, while punching people in the face.\n\nif you have no greater goal in life than punching faces, this is a sublime work. there quite frankly is nothing in the beat ‘em up genre that provides such a well-rounded experience. however, entirely, it is just a well-rounded experience. unless you have a particular love for the very strange or, once again, for punching in the face, you might even feel a little bit let-down with zeno clash II. the gameplay is fantastic despite its simplicity. I very much loved the game, so I want to defend it, but I lack the words to do so. it’s a collection of somewhat good things, which might make a great thing, but only to a very weird person.","March 4, 2014","true","12.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/215690/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","I was worried from the first impressions that people on youtube had about this game. Having really enjoyed the first one, I was really excited with a sequel's potential, and yet, the general opinion was that this was a far less enjoyable game than the first Zeno Clash. Regardless, since I had the game, I decided to try to right after finishing the first.\n\nSo, let's say it has a pretty confusing and "not as exciting as I hoped for" beginning. Even having played the first one, this game throws you into the wolves right from the start in regards to its story, and that sort of continued through the rest of the game... That's my biggest complain.\nThere's a string of events between the first Zeno Clash and this one that they simply don't tell you. In the first one, Golem helps you through the journey and everything seems fine in the end. When this game starts, Ghat's feelings towards the Golem have changed entirely, which puts you in a weird position of not knowing why exactly that has happened.\n\nBut I'll go into that later.\n\nThe main focus of the last game, was the world they've built, which was weird as hell, but also beautiful in its own way, despite not having the opportunity to explore its full potential. I'm satisfied to say that the said issue has *mostly* been resolved with Zeno Clash II. You'll meet many more characters that give you more pieces towards understanding the world, and have many more different areas to roam around.\nThis time, however (and much to my sadness), the Corwids weren't given as much atention has in the last game, although there's some contact with them as well (read my impressions of the first Zeno Clash if you don't know what they are).\nThe scale of their world and story is far more grandiose in this game. Instead of worrying about your little world, doorways are opened into a larger world than zenozoik. You'll be able to understand the origins of this "tribe", and that was a great drive for me, the whole way through.\nFrom the first game, you learned the world. This time, you learned how that world came to be, and that's pretty awesome.\n\nMy advice for playing the game: look for every Cube, and then go into the Secret Tunnels in the desert (do it towards the end). Also, find it by yourself, it's not too hard, and it's a great part about the world discovery! In that tomb you'll find more information that complement what you learn through the story nicely.\n\nSo, the world is still great, if not greater. What else? Characters!\nThis time, you'll meet other beings similar to Golem, you'll know their purpose, their origins, and to a point, their deep characters.\nMy main problem, as I said, was the main character, Ghat. At least for me, a Player vs. Player-Character conflict arose for me. (read more about it here http://thestorymechanics.com/2013/09/03/player-vs-player-character/)\nMy own beliefs through playing the game were in a constant conflict with the actions that the game had me do. Those beliefs came to be from what I played in the first game... I came to play a certain Ghat that is incoherent with the actual Ghat, and that was a bit awkward, and something the designers should be more careful with next time around.\nThis may very well be a personal problem, but it contributed to my initial confusion, and detriment of the experience in the first hour or so.\nApart from that, the characters were as great, this time with a focus on Golems instead of Corwids, both unique and great to the world of ZenoClash.\n\nSo, the world and the characters have once again carried the game for me, and I loved it the whole way through. If you've enjoyed the first game, you definitely have to try this out, since the same aspects that made the first a great game, make this an even better game, since it has improved its flaws with a richer and more open world.\n\nThe combat system was fairly the same, with more combos, and a bit of Cooperative play, but not too much to make a big difference. It does not hinder the game, and it's a nice change of pace from most FPSs out there.\nYou still have primitive weapons which look great, although they're not really a necessity to go through the game.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nThe art direction was still awesome, creating a really rich world (both visually and conceptually), with its own backstory and look to it. The music didn't really standout for me, but it's not a major issue in any way.\nIf you haven't played the first Zeno Clash, go play it, and then play this. They're both very much worth your time if you enjoy having a completely different world to explore and great characters to talk to.","December 29, 2013","true","10.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The explorable world might feel a bit constrictive compared to, say, Skyrim, but this IS an indie team we're talking about here:\n\nThe Visuals are always staggering in style and occasionally in techncial finese, although one might find the occasional bug or two.

What makes it funnier is that people actually expect this sort of punk behavior of the protagonist Ghat. Nobody ever calls you out for getting into random fights, shooting people in the streets, or chain-whipping wild animals into submission.\n\nFun/cruelty factor aside, the combat is pretty interesting on its own; if somewhat easy. You have a good number of different punches, combos, and special attacks you can use, while still not overwhelming the player in any area. There is a very bare-bones rpg stat system which, while not really necessary for the game in the first place, doesn't get in the way of anything.\n\nThe levels are very unique and entrancing, ranging from busy alien cities, flower-covered deserts, high-tech ruins, and something I could only describe as a river of soap. Every other character in this strange world has a different way of speaking and some little quirk or design that defines them and makes them stand out. The levels and characters combined make for an even stranger story that only gets weirder and weirder as it goes along; and take that for what you will.\n\nIn summary, it's fun; especially if you are the easily amused sort or just really stressed and want to play as a guy who likes to punch things in the face. The setting and story are very unusual and alien, and while it might not leave you glued to your keyboard eager to see what happens next, it is certainly worth going through it just to see all the exotic locales and see how the whole thing plays out. It's jus an overall amusing and odd experience.\n\nBad:\nPoor balance, bugginess, and lackluster voice acting if you aren't reading any more of this.\n\nDepending on how you play, this game can be stupidly easy. Sometimes it feels like Ghat practically cheats. Between the absurd melee skills, being able to chain-whip six guys at once, special attacks that can send about anyone into a ragdoll, and being able to call down laser beams from the sky, it felt like the slow and bumbling enemies I faced never stood any chance. Weapons get an extra mention: While the various hammers, scepters, and guns are very pretty and fun to use, they practically allow you to cheese your way through even the most difficult fights. To counter this, the game makes weapons finite. Once you break your hammer or use your gun's ammo, that weapon is gone for the rest of the game forever. Once you use all the weapons in the campaign you don't get any more, and that felt a bit cheap since they were still a lot of fun and I wished there were ways to acquire weapons to use just for fun.\n\nBut on the note of balance, allies actually can be useful outside of cannon fodder distractions, and it can actually be worth it to put points in the leadership skill for that reason.\n\nThe game is just a little bit too buggy and slow at times. There was a time where I found a way to kill a boss without him being able to hurt me on pure accident. Some of the sidequests, which I looked up online and know for sure I did not have the items to complete, let me complete them anyways. Enemies in some areas got stuck on terrain. Weapons I had not picked up (to save them for later) would vanish when I left an area (adding to my dismay that fun weapons are cheaply limited). I also got a few visual glitches related to the lighting. One in particular caused me to have background images burned onto my screen like a picture. So there are some very frustrating and jarring bugs that one could encounter on a regular basis.\n\nFinally, the voice acting. I'm not an expert, but I sometimes felt like it wasn't possible for Ghat or Rimat to show any emotion outside neutral or slight frustration. Every other character in the game is fine and has some unique verbal tic or speech mannerism that makes them interesting to listen too, except the two protagonists. Maybe the Golem isn't any better, but at least he sounds like what he is supposed to be. Sounds in general just feel a little muted sometimes, but this is the only thing really bad enough to stand out to me as far as the overall goes.\n\nSo the voice acting is a little bland at times, bugs and balance decisions can be frustrating, and the game can be a little too easy at times. I won't nag too much on the difficulty because I wasn't on hard, but the main thing for me is that it felt easy for the wrong reasons. There are just a lot of little bad designs and difficulty flaws that mar the surface of an otherwise fun game.\n\nOverall:\nOn the freeroam rpg scale, it's certainly not Skyrim, and if you come into this with any sort of high expectation it will disappoint. The game requires you to overlook some flaws\n\nBut while it has some moments when it will make you sigh in disappointment, but you can always shake that off by punching some giant crabs. The weirdness and silliness is the main charm here, and the focus on the brutal fist fights combined with the unusual setting full of furry, scaly, and just plain freaky alien creatures just makes the whole thing fun; despite how simple and unbalanced it is.\n\nAs a person who is easily entertained by first person fighters such as this, there is nothing not to like. At the very least, it's cheap and a good way to kill some time punching random things in the face. I recommend it.","January 17, 2014","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The explorable world might feel a bit constrictive compared to, say, Skyrim, but this IS an indie team we're talking about here:\n\nThe Visuals are always staggering in style and occasionally in techncial finese, although one might find the occasional bug or two.

The voice-acting is....\n\nWell, moving on, I'd say this is a heartfelt recommendation to all those who wish to play something weird, something new and something that shows that little development companies can work so hard that they start being judged on the same level as triple-A titles (If you didn't know, that was the main reason for the mediocre reviews official sources usually gave the poor thing).\n\nThen again, I love the game universe, so I might be a tad biased. :P","July 1, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What makes it funnier is that people actually expect this sort of punk behavior of the protagonist Ghat. Nobody ever calls you out for getting into random fights, shooting people in the streets, or chain-whipping wild animals into submission.\n\nFun/cruelty factor aside, the combat is pretty interesting on its own; if somewhat easy. You have a good number of different punches, combos, and special attacks you can use, while still not overwhelming the player in any area. There is a very bare-bones rpg stat system which, while not really necessary for the game in the first place, doesn't get in the way of anything.\n\nThe levels are very unique and entrancing, ranging from busy alien cities, flower-covered deserts, high-tech ruins, and something I could only describe as a river of soap. Every other character in this strange world has a different way of speaking and some little quirk or design that defines them and makes them stand out. The levels and characters combined make for an even stranger story that only gets weirder and weirder as it goes along; and take that for what you will.\n\nIn summary, it's fun; especially if you are the easily amused sort or just really stressed and want to play as a guy who likes to punch things in the face. The setting and story are very unusual and alien, and while it might not leave you glued to your keyboard eager to see what happens next, it is certainly worth going through it just to see all the exotic locales and see how the whole thing plays out. It's jus an overall amusing and odd experience.\n\nBad:\nPoor balance, bugginess, and lackluster voice acting if you aren't reading any more of this.\n\nDepending on how you play, this game can be stupidly easy. Sometimes it feels like Ghat practically cheats. Between the absurd melee skills, being able to chain-whip six guys at once, special attacks that can send about anyone into a ragdoll, and being able to call down laser beams from the sky, it felt like the slow and bumbling enemies I faced never stood any chance. Weapons get an extra mention: While the various hammers, scepters, and guns are very pretty and fun to use, they practically allow you to cheese your way through even the most difficult fights. To counter this, the game makes weapons finite. Once you break your hammer or use your gun's ammo, that weapon is gone for the rest of the game forever. Once you use all the weapons in the campaign you don't get any more, and that felt a bit cheap since they were still a lot of fun and I wished there were ways to acquire weapons to use just for fun.\n\nBut on the note of balance, allies actually can be useful outside of cannon fodder distractions, and it can actually be worth it to put points in the leadership skill for that reason.\n\nThe game is just a little bit too buggy and slow at times. There was a time where I found a way to kill a boss without him being able to hurt me on pure accident. Some of the sidequests, which I looked up online and know for sure I did not have the items to complete, let me complete them anyways. Enemies in some areas got stuck on terrain. Weapons I had not picked up (to save them for later) would vanish when I left an area (adding to my dismay that fun weapons are cheaply limited). I also got a few visual glitches related to the lighting. One in particular caused me to have background images burned onto my screen like a picture. So there are some very frustrating and jarring bugs that one could encounter on a regular basis.\n\nFinally, the voice acting. I'm not an expert, but I sometimes felt like it wasn't possible for Ghat or Rimat to show any emotion outside neutral or slight frustration. Every other character in the game is fine and has some unique verbal tic or speech mannerism that makes them interesting to listen too, except the two protagonists. Maybe the Golem isn't any better, but at least he sounds like what he is supposed to be. Sounds in general just feel a little muted sometimes, but this is the only thing really bad enough to stand out to me as far as the overall goes.\n\nSo the voice acting is a little bland at times, bugs and balance decisions can be frustrating, and the game can be a little too easy at times. I won't nag too much on the difficulty because I wasn't on hard, but the main thing for me is that it felt easy for the wrong reasons. There are just a lot of little bad designs and difficulty flaws that mar the surface of an otherwise fun game.\n\nOverall:\nOn the freeroam rpg scale, it's certainly not Skyrim, and if you come into this with any sort of high expectation it will disappoint. The game requires you to overlook some flaws\n\nBut while it has some moments when it will make you sigh in disappointment, but you can always shake that off by punching some giant crabs. The weirdness and silliness is the main charm here, and the focus on the brutal fist fights combined with the unusual setting full of furry, scaly, and just plain freaky alien creatures just makes the whole thing fun; despite how simple and unbalanced it is.\n\nAs a person who is easily entertained by first person fighters such as this, there is nothing not to like. At the very least, it's cheap and a good way to kill some time punching random things in the face. I recommend it.","January 17, 2014","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The core hand-to-hand combat that was one of the main draws of the first game returns here with some improved depth, but the overwhelming enemy counts make battles more of a chore than anything and renders the lock-on system mostly useless in larger fights. The AI (both friendly and enemy) seems to be surprisingly incompetent and a noticeable step down from the original.\n\nThe game's environments are impressive and fun to admire, but they're also shallow and lack substance. Whereas the first game was purely linear (which in turn led to a more focused, interesting story), the sequel decides to go the open-world route with side-quests scattered about that makes everything feel like a mess. The game places skill totems throughout as some sort of incentive to explore, but it comes across as a poor attempt to mask the overall emptiness of the world.\n\nZeno Clash 2 is a game that tries to be more ambitious than its predecessor and ultimately fails as a result. Gorgeous to look and a combat system that is quite strong, but compared to the original, there are far too many changes for the worse.","February 8, 2014","false","2.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I was going to write a rave review about it, but I foolishly decided to play Zeno Clash 2 first. The problems start with the tutorial/prelude. I might not have played the tutorial if it hadn't also been labelled prelude. As it was, punching Metamoq in the face with some voiceover recap of the plot of the previous Zeno Clash in the background sounded like just the thing, which should indicate how good the first Zeno Clash was. The first thing I noticed was the lack of filters. The first Zeno Clash had a hazy effect, which made distant objects blur and added to the atmosphere, and which I assumed was an attribute of Zenozoik. Not so, apparently, since that effect is gone in this game. Instead there is music added to the voiceover. Music was used sparingly in the first Zeno Clash, so the overall effect was that of excessive melodrama. Oh well, if a bit overdone, the plot is still awesome, and punching Metamoq in the face till it's over should be simple, right? After all, I defeated the last game, and know how this goes.\n...\nNot so much. It turns out that there's combos and stuff now. The 'lock on' key has been switched, which is a minor annoyance, but more annoying is that it's a bit difficult to connect with some of the attacks. I find out that the tutorial is glitched when I manage to check a box without fulfilling the requirements, and just stand there for a while, since the game won't move forward until I satisfy the /actual/ requirements. It's here that I start to worry that the game might be overcome by feature creep.\nA worry which is not abated when I find that, despite beating the previous game, I am unable to do the '5-part launch combo' required in the tutorial, even more ironic since it comes after Metamoq's quote: "If you are satisfied and do what you feel you must do, no matter what that is, then you have reached perfection." Apprehensive, I finally quit from the endless nightmare of facing a downcast Metamoq and start the real game, hopeful that the tutorial was an ill-conceived quick add-on.\nBut of course, the problems continue into the real game. The combat system is now so complex that I have no idea what I'm doing in the first fight, and the AI manages to trip over itself without any clever guidance from me. In the first game, if you plan it right, you can have heavy enemies smash through lighter ones to get to you, or have lighter ones glare at you, unable to attack through the enemy interposed between you. You can even attack enemies from behind if they're distracted by picking up weapons, something which I had to exploit to defeat one scene.\nBut the AI in the first game is actually pretty good. It hides from your shooting range when it thinks it can, and does stuff like sneak up behind you. I didn't see any of that here.\nWhat I did see wasn't much better. Somehow, combat looks jittery, and the lighting isn't the same. I saw a new creature design, with even more nudity, and knocked it out before stumbling across a most egregious example of feature creep. Remember how the 'lock on' key was remapped? It's now the key for 'exit area'.\nTo understand how terrible this is, you have to understand how the first Zeno Clash worked. You would sometimes walk places without fighting, and sometimes you would fight. Another example of Metamoq's wisdom.\nOh well, I exit, and the story goes on... and on. One of the great strengths of the first Zeno Clash was how much it did with very little dialogue. This is not the case here, where it takes three sentences for your sister to tell you that you're helping her break Father-Mother out of jail.\nAnd then... nothing. Oh wait, a tower that says 'Level Up!'. Feature creep indeed! Let's go there, then get stuck before realizing that we have no skill points yet, pull out a map, which utterly butchers the charming minimalism of the one in the first Zeno Clash, then forget how to put it away, leaving us stuck, until we remember it was 'M', and run around aimlessly, and... we can talk to a person? Wait a sec, did we just get a quest?\nWhen did this become an RPG, anyway?\nNot the first Zeno Clash, not a good RPG.

And if you disliked the first, this one is vastly improved!\n\n+The combat has been improved, with a many different combos added into the game. A new fighting style where each mouse click controls each hand rather than light attack and heavy attack independent to each mouse click. A fighting style mixed with an RPG, how quaint!\n+A skill system! You can level up strength to hit harder, stamina to fight longer, health to be tankier, and leadership to command stronger allies!\n+Allies! You can collect allies throughout the game that will assist you in fights. Definitely helpful if you plan on playing singleplayer rather than coop.\n+The game provides an easy to access tutorial that will give you a refresher on any newly added combos should you need it.\n+The story expands very much upon the previous game, answering many questions left from the first game while also creating a very entertaining original story for this game.\n+The graphics are vastly improved as the game moved from the source engine to the Unreal engine for this game.\n+The world remains one of the most imaginative worlds i have ever seen, and with the lore expanded upon in this game I cannot help but drool at the idea of another sequel. MORE ZENO CLASH MORE!\n+The iconic great voice actors return from the first game, with new ones that are just as great at fitting their roles!\n+The characters you love and hate return and more are added, each of them with their own background and interactions to be discovered. Deadra's still my favorite!\n+CO-OP! YESSSSS! Now i can enjoy Zenozoik with a friend! He plays as Rimat though, and the first Zeno clash taught me to hate Rimat. But seriously, the co-op rules. Makes those 1v8 fights so much more bearable.\n+This game was much longer than its predecessor. It took me 6.6 hours in coop wheras its predecessor took me 3 hours. And whereas the previous game held one challenge mode where you ascended a tower or descended a pit, fighting all enemies you see, this game provides three challenge modes.\n#1. The Colosseum. A Singleplayer/Coop mode where you challenge your opponents.\n#2. Rock of the Ages. A silly mode where you play as a rock that runs everyone over while also recruiting an army of allies from the game. All the characters! This mode is so fun I could play it endlessly, it was even expanded on and turned into it's own game!\n#3. The framerate challenge. You fight binary opponents in an attempt to keep your framerate above 25fps at all times. It's quite strange, but provides quite the interesting challenge.\n\nThis game was ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic, and I really hope a 3rd one is in the works. I give this a 10/10. This is one of the most memorable games I've ever played and one I will revisit ten years from now simply to relive this classic. It's a rare day I give a game 10/10, but this one earned it. Good job Ace Team! Hope to see more games of this style from you, hint hint, ZC3? ;)\n\nDefinitely pick this game up. The prequel too! You won't regret it!","May 26, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I r8 0/8 m8. 0/10 -ign"\n90% are the classic whiny, originalist fanboy who doesn't like the fact that they changed their precious, repetitive, simplistic, linear game to free roam, added companions/allies, added a few small side quests, spruced up the combat with combos and heavy attacks, and added a skill tree system.  These people are all little b!tches\n\nI'm going to make this quick:\n\n+Beautiful Environment - Return to the world of Zenozoic and its warped landscape.  Revisit good old areas from the first game and see fantastic new areas such as the grassy plains of Rath Bird Fields and the epic abstract vista of the Pink Tower.  All is eye candy in Zeno Clash 2\n\n+Open World - Lets you explore the surreal world of Zenozoic and revisit areas for side-quests without being confined to linear railroading.\n\n+Improved Combat - Combos and Heavy attacks help liven up the combat system and breathe new life into it.\n\n+Companion System - Interesting twist that allows you to call companions to help you in big battles.\n\n+Weapon System - Given certain weapons and items that help you in combat and through puzzles.\n\n+Puzzles - They have added puzzles! For those that don't like puzzles, don't panic! They are usually simple and fun.\n\n+Story - A good story and a hidden backstory that shows you how Zenozoic came to be.\n\n+Co-op - Co-op is always good.\n\n+/-Skill Tree - System is a bit rough, but adds an interesting aspect to the game.\n\n+/-Story kicks off closely after the first one's ending... which means you will have to play the first one to understand anything at all that is going on.\n\nMany people have claimed bugs, but I had never experienced any during my time playing.  This game is fantastic. They took the good of the old and gave it an upgrade.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theraintransformed/recommended/215690/","Theraintransformed","In-Game DOGG™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theraintransformed/","412 products in account","Zeno Clash 2 is probably one of the most unique games I've ever played. It was a very strange and almost "magical" experience from beginning to end, and the game progressively got both stranger and better. To summarize Zeno Clash 2, the game is basically a first-person brawler that takes place in a tribal acid trip.\nThe game is entirely in first person (except for cutscenes, of course) including the combat, which is based upon stringing together combos and avoiding damage from enemies. There are also a few first-person shooting and puzzle-solving elements to the game that come into play at some parts. The controls felt tight, but the combo system was obtuse and the combat felt too simple, even with the additions to it that the player periodically acquires. While I will admit that the gameplay itself is kind of weak, it has some legitimately interesting mechanics, as well as a handful of gimmicks that, while gimmicks, were still interesting and fun to play around with. One thing that really bothered me about ZC2 is that you can't jump or crouch. I feel like the lack of a simple mechanic like a jump button reduces the depth the world (and therefore exploration) has, and was a lazy cop-out by the devs so that they wouldn't have to put invisible walls/barriers in places they didn't want players to get to.\nThe highlights of Zeno Clash 2 are definitely the setting and art style. The setting is something very special in ZC2 as it is completely unlike anything I have ever encountered in a video game before. To best describe it, I would say that it was influenced by Morrowind and the Oddworld games, both of those being games with very unique and distinctive settings that ZC2 draws from in order to create something very unusual and interesting. There are great plains and mountains with strange creatures walking among them (my favourite being the "ballsack shrimp", a species of walking dog-sized shrimp with its eyes hanging like testicles from its body), huge forests with mushrooms and trees the sizes of buildings, and ancient tombs with dark secrets, as well as the occasional pocket of civilization (more or less) here and there. It also reminded me of Star Wars/Dune at some parts, especially with the desert city at the beginning of the game. The atmosphere of the game is very bizarre and outlandish, but also quite strong. Every area feels different, and all of them have something that completely sets them apart from the others. This makes the world feel big - really big. It helps even that at one point, you get to see pretty much the entire continent (which you've been travelling across the whole game) before your own eyes. There's even a neat day-night cycle, and the time of day will change as you transition between places, making it feel as if you really did travel a long distance when you change zones.\nThe writing and story of ZC2 are also better than I expected. The game has a decently detailed backstory, and it's subtly expanded on throughout the game via legends and characters that the player encounters. There's quite a few characters in the game, but none of them are given too much focus, except for Fathermother in the beginning and the Golems towards the end of the game. Indeed, the story in general isn't given much focus, although a few events did happen during the campaign that were interesting or unexpected from a writing perspective. Instead, the game is centred on exploration and backstory, which is something that develops more and more as the player covers more content. This increases the emphasis on sidequests and exploration, but allows the player to go through the game at their own speed.\nOverall, Zeno Clash 2 is quite an experience. While it's not exactly the paradigm of innovation or perfection in gameplay, I believe that the gameplay provides a decent canvas for the player to delve into the other, more unique aspects of the game. It's also fairly short, so I recommend this game for anyone who's looking for a game that's original without being pretentious or half-♥♥♥♥♥.\nSomeday, I will play this game while high.","August 6, 2013","true","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","5"

This weirdest looking guy with lion's head and puny wings is smack talking to me and I tell him to ♥♥♥♥ off - that I've already caused him one black eye. Now it seems like I'm allowed to punch him in the face again and that I do. Eventually it turns into a brawl and I have to beat every customer in bar, one by one, and I think to myself "Ok, that's a rough landing in game. Looks like there's a lot of punching happening".\n\nOnce the bar is clear, I have no idea what to do and can't really talk with any of the static NPCs hanging in the bar either. I look for a door out and get a cut scene with some girl talking about saving FatherMother. I have l i t e r a l l y no idea what she's talking about. "Wait, does this game have some sort of plot? Huh, why does my character have tattooed moustaches?!"\n\nCut scene ends. I am out of the bar and see more weird looking creatures. One guy looks like a mix of owl and human. I punch the closest, small, weasel looking guy, knockout. I hit some female creature with tendrils on her face and four boobs hanging out, knockout. Dog, punch. Pig, punch. Ok, I don't think this will get me anywhere. I notice I now have a waypoint in my map, I think.\n\nI follow the waypoint, punch some llamas' in face, pick up some skulls (no idea what they do) and other items I can't fully see since they are under the terrain texture. At waypoint I meet a guy who tells me he's not going to save FatherMother with me.\n\nI close the game and say to myself "f*ck it, I'm not going to save him either."","August 8, 2014","false","6.7"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","1"

The previous game had colourful scenary and interesting models (which they mostly just copy pasted over in the sequal) and it looked great on the Source engine, but since they switched over to the Unreal engine, everything in the game now looks like it's had a bunch of boring and dull smeared over it.\n\nThe only reason i got this game was because it was bundled with the first.\n\n","January 18, 2014","false","0.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

Further building upon all aspects of it's predecessor.\n\nNow most importantly, the gameplay is intuitive and fun to play. The game is a first person, melee focused fighter. All the controls make sense, are easy to learn and master. During boss fights and such, the game doesn't take you by the hand and tell you how to defeat them, which is great. You need to figure everything out for yourself, and you really are put into the main character's shoes. The game has co-op, although not particularly benefiting from it, it's a welcome feature to a game that is equally fun to explore on your own or with a friend.\n\nThe story might really take you by surprise. It might seem simple at first, but has a lot of well thought out layers and complexities to make it incredibly interesting and keep you at the edge of your seat.\nAlthough the tutorial will fill you in on the story, I would advise playing through the first one beforehand to really feel immersed in the world.\n\nI can't recommend this game more, it oozes polish and brilliance.

I really don’t know whose bright idea was it to use an engine that's notoriously bad at rendering flesh and hair for a game that’s primarily hitting fleshy hairy things in the face.\n\nThe voice acting is atrocious. The female lead sounds almost exactly like the one the female lead in the first game had that everyone hated; I’m not sure how even non-english speakers could’ve missed that. The world APPEARS to be open world but is actually restrictive and closed in maps, and the continued absence of a jump button highlights this. The music is simplistic and lifeless compared to the first, with quite a few bad remixes of tracks from the first game. And to top everything off the game is designed around Co-op when the first game was single player, and done is a way that makes it feel like they were just jumping on the Co-op fad (which is already started to die off). I shudder to think of how much of the development probably went into this.\n\nI really enjoyed the first game. It didn’t matter if it was short or limited or somewhat ugly, it was an exciting new type of game with a setting that’s more exotic then what you generally find in video games. I can tell they were trying to expand things with the sequel, but I also felt like they were trying to do something that they simply didn’t have the budget, manpower, and experience to do. In the end I was disappointed by a clunky and ugly game with a big empty lifeless world and questionable design across the board. It’s not BAD persay, but it’s a mediocre experience that definitely wasn’t what I expected or wanted from Zeno Clash 2 .\n\nWorth it on a steam sale? I guess. Personally I’m hoping one day that it’ll get a Witcher-esc revamp and rerelease. Though with the death of the publisher who even knows if that’s possible.","March 9, 2014","false","7.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

It is a first person fighting game, and by fighting I mean pretty much only basic punching and kicking and some combos of the two. Supposedly there is the ability to grapple but outside of the tutorial it very rarely worked for me. There were what felt like a thousand different combat combo's to learn in the tutorial and combat is just incredibly convoluted with way too many combat actions to remember. Combat is not very well done anyway. It is not fluid at all, just awkward, because you have to mouse click with perfect precise timing to make sure that your combo keeps going or you won't do ♥♥♥♥. You have to be way too precise when trying to remember a combo like "press LMB+RMB for double punch, hold LMB for uppercut, press RMB to kick, then press Forward (W)+LMB+RMB for a double forward thrust punch". Jesus Christ man, who wants to do all that crap to ♥♥♥♥ing fight? Not many people I would assume.\n\nI could tell this was not that great just by watching youtube gameplay which is why I would of course never buy something like it even on a big sale. It came in a bundlestars.com deal that I bought for $2 for a couple of other games.\nSome indie games can be really good, but this is a sub-par indie game through and through.

You can feel so much more connected to Zenozoik with the ability to freely travel around and explore. The battle system has been overhauled to make it much more interesting. The story is expanded massively, showing that Zeno Clash was just the tip of an iceberg. The new weapons are very unconventional, which makes them extremely interesting. I am so sick of assault rifles, but I digress. The characters feel unique and interesting. Characters from ZC1 come back in higher definition, with tons of new friends. Even the non-speaking denizens of Halstedom are still in place, keeping the feel of the first game. The music is incredible. It does an outstanding job of conveying the surrealism of the world you're exploring as an uncivilized, misplaced protagonist who is learning more about the world than any of his equals could begin to fathom. Massively recommended.\n\nShame that Rimat's lines were recorded in a bathroom though. Also I miss Deadra's old voice, and it was a little jarring to be without her for so much of the story, considering she was a central plot-mover in ZC1. It kinda felt like taking Alyx away from me if I was playing HL2.","July 10, 2014","true","41.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After spending the last 8 hours with Zeno Clash 2 I'm still really not sure what to make of it. On the one hand I enjoyed the fact that this is a first person two fisted brawler so I like that it's different. The cool, trippy world is carried over and the levels are made bigger. What I didn't like that was that I'm still not sure what the heck I just saw story wise. I ended up skipping the cut scenes because I just wasn't very interested. Combos were somewhat difficult to pull off because the chains require you to sort of "pre-input" what you want to do. It sounds weird but when you unleash combos you have to keep pressing the buttons even when your guy isn't responding but you have to keep going. I probably screwed up the explanation but do the tutorial and you'll see what I mean. I also didn't care for the minor puzzle solving you have to do at times because it just slowed the momentum to a crawl. The bug where you're carrying a weapon and you can't swing or anything until you're hit was incredibly annoying. All that said, for some reason I really wanted to see Zeno Clash 2 through to the end.

I think I may well be having nightmares about FatherMother for a long time to come.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, I found the controls tricky (getting the right sequence of mouse clicks to pass the tutorial took me far more time than I'd like). Though it turned out that didn't matter anyway, as pressing both mouse buttons down at once to perform a double punch, followed by kicking my enemy once they were on the floor, did the trick most of the time.\n\nThe gun design is very intriguing, reminiscent of the weaponry in the film Videodrome. But firing the guns was mildly disappointing, to say the least: they have the same kind of effect as a child's popgun, both in terms of haptic feedback, sound and damage done to enemies. And they break after firing them about 4 times. I decided to stick to fists and feet.\n\nI didn't play for long, but during the time I did, I didn't have a clue what was going on. Working out where to go next seemed next to impossible, and I got around mainly by chance. I wasn't really sure who anyone was, who I was, where I was, or where I was supposed to be going. The dialogue didn't help: it is extraordinarily difficult to follow, obtuse, bizarre, and poorly translated, with the quality of subtitles from a Chinese martial arts film translated by someone who speaks English as a second language. But charming nonetheless. I didn't play the first Zeno Clash, but I get the feeling that if I had, I would still not have a clue what was going on.\n\nDespite all these flaws, I found it entertaining for an hour or so. The experience of playing it is kind of like being inside one of those avant garde Czech animations you sometimes see on TV at 3am, but with fighting.","August 21, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not everybody can get into the "first person fighter" idea - and it will certainly cause some people simulation sickness if you  haven't built up the immunity to it that I have.\n\nBut why I like this game?  Well, because it's very unique.  I find the strange and screwy world and characters oddly charming for some reason.\n\nGood to pick up when you are in the mood for something odd or different.

Well, because it's very unique.  I find the strange and screwy world and characters oddly charming for some reason.\n\nGood to pick up when you are in the mood for something odd or different.

The brawls mechanics are polished, the problem from the first game disappeared and new options are added to the system. The weapons are improved as well. The history is indeed, deep and fortunately, almost completed (as probably there will be a third part some holes remain). The duration of the game is still a little short, 8- 12 hours for the campaign.  There are now certain RPG elements as you can improve some stats, still are not mandatory and you character has good chance to finish the game without them. You can max one or two of the attributes per game (or maybe more if you truly explore each region of the world).

Zeno Clash was as punk as Vidiot and other classics of the genre. It espoused primitivism and unbridled desire in ways so surrealist and cruel that it often revealed the charace of civilization. Zeno Clash 2 begins by taking the familar characters and then unfortunately throwing them into a hollywood style plot. It doesn't work, and damages the atmosphere of the game, but about an hour or two in it descends back into the same libidanl logics that made the first game so great, only to end on a slightly less Stellar not. The weapons are awesome and really assist in combat, and I have yet to get the last one, but over all if you're a fan of the first one and can forigve the opening's premise you're in for fun primitivism and a great game.

It also added stats that can be improved throughout the game.\n\nVisualy it is a significant improvement to Zeno Clash in every way and still delivers a great surreal experience.\n\nMechanically it still focuses on first person brawling like Zeno Clash, but has changed the buttons so you can do more but it takes more time to remember the combos and special moves. Also I found that timeing is key evenjust to land consecutive shots or the game doesn't register it. Weapons are even more powerful but still balanced and the addition of more secondary weopns allows for variety in combat and can be used outside of combat.\n\nThe story is great and takes off directly from the developments of the last one. It's much larger than the last one involving more of the world of zenoziok that answers some questions and brings up some others.\n\nThe only possible Draw back is the fact that while you'll get a kick out of the beautifully rended characters and environments, the familiarity and the answers and clarity offered in the game dispells some of the mystery and oddness. Still it has more than enough of that strange and surreal feeling.","December 17, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These improvements complicate however, making intuitive systems less natural but more robust. It's a double-edged sword, and some of the original's charm is lost along the way, but that dichotomy mirrors the central conflict of the game. Just as the instinctive freedom of Zenozoik is supplanted by the growing complexity of its society, so too is the charm of an organic experience supplanted by the deepening of its systems. As unavoidable and regrettable as that may be, it doesn't hold the game back at all. The sequel continues the story of this bizarre world to a deeper and more satisfying conclusion than the previous game. If you found yourself somewhat let down by the ending of Zeno Clash, don't let that hold you back from playing the sequel. You might find yourself judging the original differently after they're both finished, as I did.","May 12, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zeno Clash was as punk as Vidiot and other classics of the genre. It espoused primitivism and unbridled desire in ways so surrealist and cruel that it often revealed the charace of civilization. Zeno Clash 2 begins by taking the familar characters and then unfortunately throwing them into a hollywood style plot. It doesn't work, and damages the atmosphere of the game, but about an hour or two in it descends back into the same libidanl logics that made the first game so great, only to end on a slightly less Stellar not. The weapons are awesome and really assist in combat, and I have yet to get the last one, but over all if you're a fan of the first one and can forigve the opening's premise you're in for fun primitivism and a great game.

Plagued by bugs, and graphical issues. Very linear game play, and boring repetitive, punch punch punch. The story is decent, but poor voice acting made most of the cut scences a must skip. Ultimately I retired this game. Wouldn't recommend.","December 10, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hit mapping seems to be a little off and the odd glitch will force you to restart a chapter. I was unable to continue due to an error not allowing other opponents to spawn in, which has knocked my motivation to restart back to that chapter. I find it sad I have to give this a negative review, because I love the world they've created, but bugs so prominent can't be ignored if they halt the gameplay so often.","May 28","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said said I never finished ZC1 due to its flaws.\n\nI picked up Zeno Clash 2 as part of a bundle so cost me a few cents and it was a wasted purchase. I like the environment art style but it feels like they have tried to turn this into an RPG with quests, levels and the like.\n\nI hardly scratched the surface and buggy glitchy graphics meant I had to restart the game twice.\n\nQuickly got bored at the zero focus it has and dull combat. The first mission appeared to be find someone, hit him once/ Job done. Just don't waste your cash, 30 mins in and uninstalling, it is that bad\n\nCombat is boring","June 5","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
