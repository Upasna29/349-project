But that doesn't stop it from being hillariously crazy and in your face. The gameplay is bland and gets boring. However, this is made up for by how stupidly action-packed the cut-scenes/QTEs are. Annoyed by QTEs? That's fine, you can set the QTE difficulty separately to 'fool-proof' so you don't even have to do them. And you can customize your ninjas colours super thoroughly. Play as a plain grey boring guy for one level and then you can be a rainbow or a sweet neon pink messenger of badassery. I just finished this game today on live stream and can honestly say it's one Hell of a roller coaster ride.","June 27, 2014","true","12.0"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","38","44","3","1"

Ninja blade feels a bit like prince of persia with all the parkour/ninja like moves but not as fun as the latter.\nthis game is also chock full of QTEs, its literally everywhere in almost every scene and in every bossfight which kinda makes the game feel shallow. i think they were trying to get the god of war feeling but its just not there since if you fail the qte it just rewinds you a few seconds back so you can never ♥♥♥♥ it up. it will only affect your end game rating and score.some levels also have a turret section which is pretty weird for a game called ninja blade. its not that fun and is pretty much an on-rail arcade shooter just made to prolong the game.\n\nsoundtrack is forgettable but okay.\n\ngraphics are decent for its time although still not that pretty and choppy kind of like a ps2 game.\n\nthe ending is pretty bad and not really worth noting.\n\ni wouldnt say its a crappy game, its an okay hack and slash game with a few problems here and there, just not at full price. maybe get it at 50-75% discount if you are really interested.","October 7, 2014","true","11.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

From Software knew the answer and gave us Ninja Blade. The mundane gameplay isn't exactly top-tier quality and in a way all of Ninja Blade reminds me a lot about Froms earlier works that were always kinda meh but had some distinct styles going for them (I am thinking King's Field, Murakumo, Otogi or Frame Gride right now). The actual storyline and monster designs are pretty cool, reminiscent of late 80ies and early 90ies anime and I would be lying if I wasn't into it - especially since the game takes itself serious, which is always a plus in my book. What starts as Resident Evil with swords (with the enemy parasite reminding me of "The Many" from System Shock 2) turns into something that has some resemblance to Fist of the Northstar and martial arts flicks.\n\nUnfortunately, it's all downhill from here - for starters the game suffers from an overabundance of QTEs, turret sequences and AWFUL wallrunning/walljumping segments. Combat is imprecise and floaty, movement kinda jerky - reminding me about some Dreamcast-era hack'n'slay titles. I do not know wether or not it is the 60fps (that the console versions did not have) that turned Ninja Blade into the glitchfest that it is, but this game is seriously bugging out at times. In 7 hours playtime I haven't seen the animation for swinging and jumping from poles align once with the pole I am swinging and jumping from - the hero is always miles away from the pole. Then there are some dramatic changes of scenery - you go through a door and BAM! you are teleported to a different area, complete with different lighting and new camera position. And the wallrun-sequences are straight outta glitch city with the character repositioning himself constantly because the game has some serious hitdetection issues when wallrunning - all of it feels really poorly made, like the whole game barely holds together (in fact, it always locks up when I went to quit game). It's not Early Access / Steam Greenlight levels of ♥♥♥♥ - but a poor port/effort none the less. And honestly, it's just not that fun (should mention that at least 2 out of the 9 stages are filler and recycle bosses and even parts of levels) - not when you have alternatives like Devil May Cry 4 or Metal Gear Rising right here on Steam. Might as well just watch this one instead and don't bother with playing it.","February 14","false","7.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","3"

The game is wonderful to watch, and somewhat fun to play. The cutscenes are filled with plot, then when actually playing all that plot goes away and you just kill stuff because it's there to be killed.\n\nAbout half the combat is quick time events, and the other half is hack 'n slash. There are only 3 weapons and a few ninja powers, all of which are upgradable. There is minor platforming involving wall-running, but it's super linear and only there to get from area filled with mutants to area filled with mutants, though there are some areas where it will let you go elsewhere and get secret items.\n\nThe game looks awesome not because of the graphics quality, but rather because awesome things keep happening, very much like a good action movie. As far as plot goes, there is a lot of it between the levels.\nAlso, apparently an aggressive mutant outbreak ocurred 7/7/11. I should really watch the news more.","July 11, 2011","true","3.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

At least\nwith the current version on steam. Also the game is sometimes\ncomplaining that the right memory slot is not selected and\nsome texts are directly from the console version.\n\nWhat kind of memory slots and cards shall I use on the PC?\nThis is rediculos. Also, the game says that your save game\nis successfuly complted. When you try to load it, you spawn\ndirectly after the INTRO sequence from the beginning of\nthe game at lavel 1.\n\nIt is not so bad. You can pick the game for casual play and\nplay it through. It is not hard. Executing basic commands\nwill not invoke QTE. But any kind of combo attempt will\nfire the QTE imediately.\n\nThe enemies are very stupid and can easily be killed.\nBut - not everything is so easy. The enemies use\ncheap tricks, when surrounded by 3, they wait for\nyou to attack one and then another one will jump\ninto you and damage you for sure.\n\nBoss fights are nice but get repeditive. You just have\nto repeat one and the same thing over and over\nagain. Killing a boss is epic. The feeling is nice.\n\nThe game mechanics are somewhat funny. Some\nmoves like wall run use an additional key for no\nreason. In ninja gaiden if you run against wall\nand jump on it, it becomes a wall run. Here you\nhave to hold the RT for the wall run.\n\nYou can play the game with the mouse. I find this\nvery nice. A lot of movie sequences use the game\nengine with a far too strong blur filter.\n\nDon't bother with the story. It has some flips but\neverything feels so cheap.\n\nIf you could at least save and restore properly,\nit would be a nice alternative weekend game.\n\nFor sure in 2016, this is not worth the $10.","May 4","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even on sale, just don't.\n\nThe basic gameplay is decent enough: you hack at zombies of some kind with three different sword - a basic katana, a huge, slow, powerful monstrosity that breaks shiedls and a pair of small, fast daggers that help clear swarms of small enemies. There's actually not much of this basic combat, a lot of time you're hunting huge bosses and fight them with hack-and-slash combat and QTEs. Never before have I seen so many QTEs in one place. In addition, you have some wall-running acrobacy stunts and collectibles hunting.\nThe problem is, neither part is actually really fun or rewarding. And there's a lot that's just wrong - half of the story animation / dialogs looks blurry or out of focus. This doesn't make sense, since it's all done in the game's engine and gameplay runs fine. For the most part. When I quit the game for the first time and played again the next day, all explosions were replaced by a black rectangle. And no amount of screwing around with graphic settings helped. Then there's the fact that you can't save in the middle of a mission. You've got to go to work or take part in some aspect of your real life? Sorry bro, the last hour of gameplay is wasted, you'll have to restart the mission.\nNo, thanks.

It quickly becomes tiring and tedious.  They don't difference in the outcome of any cut-scenes They are used in absolutely every possible opportunity, and if you mess up you are forced to replay it over and over until you get it right.  It was just too much.\n\nThe weapons and combat mechanics are unimpressive.  They work, but the attacks don't feel like they carry much impact and timing to pull off some moves feels very loose.  Enemies don't convey their patterns or behavior very well either, so anticipating them is difficult.   None of the combat flows and it just feels lackluster.","December 5, 2013","false","11.7"," 14 of 36 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","14","36","0","0"

Segments that should be cutscene turn out to be a boat load of QTE (quick time event) sequences which if you progress through the game quickly will happen sometimes every 5 minutes or less. Or if you want to you can QTE every single enemy with no sucsse. If you are using a controller the Quick Time Event prompt fades in giving you less time to react where the keyboard prompt is an immediate thing. All around it feels like quick time events were something that was just tacked on at the last moment and it doesn't really fit. But don't despair, the QTE's have a difficulty setting; if you don't want to put up with them you can set it to the lowest setting and watch it as the cutscene it should be although the prompt will still pop up like you are still gonna give it a go.\nAs for the story you will be completely lost as to what's going on unless you watch the prologue in the extras or on the store page. Gameplay wise it feels like its trying to be 3 different games in 1 and fails horribly.\n1. The setting feels like its trying to be the Shinobi reboot for PS2 with the whole modern urban Tokyo ninja thing.\n2. Your character looks like Ryu from Ninja Gaiden and tries to be just as cool and fails at it.\n3. The combat system feels like it was based around not your first weapon but your second that feels a lot more natural for some reason and happens to be dual wield sword but it makes you use this super slow broad sword through MOST of the game. The upgrade system mimics that of God of War as well as some of the attacks that you unlock via upgrading. The Quick Time Events mimic God of War in the way of being activated in the same ways. Aside from the games it tries to be there are also poorly incorporated turret segments that completely break the flow of the game. There are moments that also happen quite often where you will have to go through your weapons just to continue through the game. And again this wouldn't be and issues if i was done less often but its over used. The gameplay looks and feels very broken as if the cosmetic things where more important the having a solid foundation for the cosmetic items to be built upon. Most of the main issues with this game could have easily been patched out after its release to PC.\nGraphically this game looks sub-par for its era at max settings and you will have to keep going back into the settings in order to have a descent frame rate due to the game insisting that your frame rate does not exceed 30 fps. Mind you this is a port to PC after debuting on Xbox 360 five months before. There is obvious clipping and at times the audio will just cut out, so if your not using subtitles you have no idea what's being said. The game could use more than it's fair share of optimization, because I get better framerate in crytek games with loads of particle effects with better framerates.\nOverall this game does not feel like it was made to be on PC at all and it needed another few months of development in order to work out its serious bugs or at least a patch to correct them after release. Only worth the cash it you want to see how not to make a game.","November 26, 2013","false","30.5"," 12 of 32 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","12","32","0","1"

This seems to be maybe the fatal flaw of any game that is a platformer, going way way back, they may look good but their impossible to play due to broken controls.  Must be what made Super Mario brothers one of the most iconic games ever made, because the controls work.  Seems like 99% of games that require any precision from this game to AC games just are terrible with controls.\n\nWhat is worse is the game has strange features, under settings for visual quality it says low, medium, average.  Ummm ok so is medium or average better?  There is no actual data point given to us to know what "average" means.  This seems made for consoles not a bad thing, but when all the dialogs say please dont turn off your console, thats kinda weird on a computer.  The game defaults to locking at 30fps, thats a console thing, this is PC.  Im not sure if its even possible to disable if I disable it, not to mention the odd choice of not having 1920x1080 is kinda weird for a game.\n\nThe gameplay is real bad, if you miss a QTE you need to do it over, not a bad thing, but it makes you press retry everytime.  Meaning it would be alot more fun and fast paced if It just started over since the only option is to retry anyways, or give up crawl in a hole and die there.  The game just doesnt work though, the character will warp around where he will suddenly appear on top of walls or other places.  The controls dont seem to work, as in there are prompts on the screen telling you what to do, but the game seems to randomly decide when it wants to work and when it doesnt.   This game relies on QTE events which are done pretty well, other times its confusing because there is so much information on the screen like in BIG text it will say HIT RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON with a little x button underneath if your on a controller, it will also say dodge, how much information is needed to hit a button?  Is it really an einstein project to just put an x on the screen?  Did they really think gamers would not know to hit that button without providing tons of on screen text to correspond with it making it hard to even see what button to press?\n\nA great concept with awesome visuals, lack of working controls make the game unplayable.\nRating:  0/10  Value:  $0.10","February 5, 2014","false","0.3"," 15 of 39 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","15","39","0","1"

There is a return of Raikoh, from Otogi, if you so choose to use the costume.\n\nI miss the destruction and somewhat more grounded nature of Otogi.\n\nNinja Blade appears to be a parody of all the stereotypes of Japanese games and entertainment, but sadly, I think it is a heartfelt homage and is taking itself seriously.\n\nGet it if you want something that is just... stupidly over the top.

These rabid creatures were easily provoked and resistant to conventional attack. Eight specimens were encountered in the region now referred to as "Ground:ALPHA"... Only four were successfully contained for study. Victims of the attack were quarantined at a research facility nearby. These victims displayed signs of internal liquefaction and accelerated necrosis, similar to symptoms of other flesh-eating viruses native to that region.\n\nBut it wasn't a viral outbreak. It was a parasitic infestation. A previously unidentified species of hook worm was found beneath the skin of the Ground: ALPHA specimens. These parasites, we call them "Alpha-worms", laid dozens of eggs inside their hosts, which in turn produced numerous larvae. These larvae penetrated the bloodstream and triggered a variety of genetic failures. However, unlike most genetic failures, these symptoms were not fatal. Instead, infested victims were larger, stronger… and driven by hunger. Using the research gained from the Ground: ALPHA specimens, a team of some special individuals were assembled. Minor outbreaks occurred over the next few years, but elite squad quickly put them down.

The game is chock full of Action Commands and Quick Time Events.  They are everywhere.  90% of the cutscenes will be Quick Time Events.  Every boss fight will have at least 5, if not more.  If you despise QTE's with every fiber of your being, this game is not for you.  But there is good news!  This game doesn't go all Resident Evil and make you watch 10 minutes of cutscenes beforehand or throw a game over at you if you screw up.  Rather, the game just pulls a Prince of Persia: Sands of Time bit and simply rewinds the QTE back a few seconds.  The prompts rarely change, so if you miss something, you can do it again very quickly instead of waiting forever to get it right.\n\nIn a nutshell, the gameplay is action/platformer.  You will be wall running, jumping, and swinging through levels while slicing up zombies and other monstrosities through Japan as it's taken over by some kind of virus.  Ken (The protaganist) is basically Ryu from Ninja Gaiden, slicing everything into 1/8ths.  You get three weapons, a standard sword, a heavy sword for armored enemies, and daggers on strings (think sword-chucks) to clear swarms of easy enemies.\n\nThe story isn't anything special, but it thrives on being absurd.  At one point you will land a broken airplace on a highway, and then pull it to a stop.  By yourself.  You will also smash a giant spider with a wrecking ball.  It's all in good fun.\n\nAs was stated, QTE's make up a huge chunk of the game, so it tries to keep them non-punishing.  Nothing bad happens when you fail, it just rewinds a bit.  There's a score system in place which includes how many times you failed QTE's in a chapter, but you have a fail a lot (like 100's of times) for it to make a dent in the rating system.\n\nIf you like watching a super ninja slice, dice, smash, and destroy everything that Resident Evil came up with first, all the while running down skyscrapers, then this game is perfect for you.","September 12, 2015","true","32.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
