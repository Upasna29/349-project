"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/393150/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4510 products in account","A good Hidden Object game.\n\nThe story is a detective tale set in the 1930s with a female protagonist, who has to solve a supernatural disappearance. Puzzles range from standard hidden object finding to basic object combining puzzles, and nowhere do you have to backtrack more than one screen to find all items. None of the hidden objects are mislabelled either -- which is a common problem in HOGs -- so you don't feel cheated if you can't find it, it's always just because you overlooked it at first.\n\nThe downsides of this game are the speaking animations, or rather, the lack thereof, and the weirdly stilted voice acting. The male parts sound natural but the female voices are incredibly odd, as if they're run through voice synthesis.\n\nThe game is at most two hours long and doesn't contain scary or horror elements, so it's a good playthrough for anyone.","September 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","2"

The previous installment was "The Dreamatorium of Dr. Magnus.\n\n*HOPA - Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure.\n\nGame Visuals\nI want to mentioned that the visuals for this game is nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.\n\nGame Audio\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even its simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.\n\nGame Voice Overs\nNormally, I don't have any comments to say about voice overs in games. Since that they're generally decent. But it's a different story with this game. The voice overs in this game isn't so great. The voice actors/actress aren't interested in what they're suppose to be doing.\n\nGameplay\nThere are only four difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular, Advanced, Expert and Custom.\n\nDiary Notebook it has two sections. Game Objectives and Notes.\n\nThere is an option for locking the inventory in place to keep it stationary.\n\nThere are interactive items in the game. These items are marked with a symbol but sometime they require extra items before they can be interact with.\n\nThe interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations. It isn't given automatically at the start of the game.\n\nMagical Amulet it reveals certain events that had taken place before. It's like a memory residual.\n\nMulti Tool device that three different tools that can be for certain tasks. Tools: Knife, Screw Driver and Scissor.\n\nMost of the game's hidden object scenes consists of placing items back, fragments, shadow items with some or no interaction.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nThere are collectible in the game. It is "Eye of Horus" they're scattered throughout the entire game to find. Twenty-two in total.\n\nThere are fifteen different achievements. But each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere extra contents (concept art and wallpapers) for the game in the extra section.\n\nThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.","March 14","true","6.2"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/393150/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account","As Hidden Object games go, this one probably isn't worth the time.\n\nFor those not familiar with the genre, HO games tend to have a semi-decent story, and generally involve finding objects to unlock further progress into the story - either by applying items directly to what you see in the on-screen scene, or by combining with other objects to make it work properly, or create something.\n\nThis game, while it has some beautiful scenes and art, doesn't deliver quite as much as you might hope for from a Hidden Object game.\n\nFor starters, there aren't that many scenes that require some thorough searching. Part of the fun of a good HO game is having lots of big messy scenes for you to hunt for a list of random objects from. The few that do exist in the game are spread pretty thin.\n\nThe point-and-click aspect is on the tame side as well. For example, there's a statue that needs reassembling at the front of a tall building. The arms were lying on the ground outside, and were among the first items picked up in this segment of the game. Later you find the last piece, a hat of sorts, is inside the building. Upon putting the hat on the statue, the hand reveals a key... a key that could have been acquired without assembling the statue? Yeah, I don't get it either.\n\nI found the main character's voice acting to be sub-par too. It distracted me from the game, mostly in the form of my giggling and stifling laughter. She sounded like a total stoner, all slurred and dragging out her words... yet she was meant to be a private detective. Maybe she's both. It's plausible. Maybe.\n\nSo while you could get this game, I'd advise against it, until it's heavily discounted. Compared to others in the genre there just isn't enough content. What content there is I found too similar to elements from other HO games. Possibly ok if you're looking for an easy introduction to the genre though.","November 29, 2015","false","3.6"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","3"

You can see in the past. And finding clues is just a part solving it.  You have to puzzle your way through the game. The story is well thought off. With a disappearance and some (ghost?), ah well you will find out by yourself. They did it quite well, but it is missing some depht when it is about the characters. You will mostly read about what happened. But you will not encounter many. So you do not know there role. Untill you have read it, so don't skip the articles.\n\n2 hours, watching all clips, is all that is needed to complete the game (all achievements). It's short, but well, who bothers if you enjoy it.\n\nThere is one thing that really bothers me. The voices of the female characters. They do not sound natural. More computermade. So that's a thumb down. But the males are good to listen too. Too bad you're a female.\n\nA second small thing is how easy the game is. I've never had finished the puzzles and hiddenobjectgames to fast. Maybe I play them too much, but i find, in comparison with some of artifex mundi games, they are easy. If you just starting, this one is ideal.\n\nIf this does not bother you, you can enjoy the game. Otherwise, there are more difficult ones on the market.\n\nFor the music fans: I like it, and it didn't bother me in the game. It is well chosen, but i'm not you, so you might differ.","September 11, 2015","true","3.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","4"

You meet Dr. Magnus, her (boy)friend, that was working on a secret project called Dreamatorium. So what's the evil spirit that is behind the kidnapping wants with that invention?\n\nI suppose that this is a sequel from a first game but you don't really need the previous plot to understand this one. It's a nice story, with a spirit that seemed to urge you without even putting you in danger of anything.\n\nThe gameplay is the classic one for a HO game: puzzles, Hidden Objects scenes, collectibles to find, etc.. Yeah, true, sometimes, I had an hard time to find objects because I could mistake the answer with another. But else, even the puzzles weren't too hard. The presence of the amulet is a nice feature as it's strongly tied to the story.\n\nThe graphics are nice, even if it's only labs, mansions or streets - only the King Research Center was the odd building in that. The soundtrack was also fitting. The voice acting was also a success, though I would have preferred that the main character didn't sound like she was bored.\n\nTrue, it's kinda short: only 2 hours for people used to play that kind of games, and knowing how to use a map. But I've enjoyed that game a lot despite my previous fear that it may not be a good one - I'm strongly influenced by Artifex Mundi's style and universe and HOG I've played in the past: Mystery P.I., Women Murder Club, Samantha Swift, Mystery Cases Files and Big City Adventures for example.\n\nSo in the end, The Dreamatorium of Dr. Magnus 2 is an excellent HO/adventure game, so, don't hesitate if you're a fan of these or if you want to try one!","November 11, 2015","true","1.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Graphics are not spectacular but again not terrible.  Nothing to write home about, as the saying goes.\n\nThe voice acting is egregiously bad.  This bothered the bejeezus out of me, but I'm also picky about voiceovers.  It probably won't bother the majority of players as there aren't that many sections of dialogue.\n\nMy biggest complaint was the playtime; I finished in two hours with every achievement completed in one playthrough.  The game was overall very simple.  Since the game includes trading cards, you may end up going and playing more to get all of your cards if you're one that collects (which I will be doing).\n\nOverall, not terrible and worth a play, but due to the short playtime I would suggest picking it up on sale.  These games generally don't run more than about 3 hours for a playthrough, but two hours and lack of extra features makes this game not worth a full $7.99 to me.","January 23","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Mini-games difficulty is high enough to spend some time but not annoyingly difficult which I don't like in some games. I mean HOG games are for fun in my opinion so puzzles must be slightly difficult so I can relax instead of googling a walkthrough. Maybe they are a little too easy here but still fun. Drawing is just perfect, can't ask for more in a HOG game.\n\nThe only bad thing is voiceacting. I can't even imagine what devs were thinking using this actor for the main character. She sounds like she is under a hypnose or under effects of strong sedative lol. Main villain (and almost all other characters) is also not sounding too good but it's ok compared to protagonist. But to think of it.. you know that type of bad which is also almost good and funny? So here it is ) It's not ruining the game totally but adds "WTF? Really?" feeling when you hear it for the first time because everything else is nice in this game. In fact only Dr. Magnus sounds like a pro.\n\nCustom difficulty is another big plus of the game. It's veeery helpful if you skipped some hidden symbol and just want to rush through the game, skipping mini-games after 5 seconds. Somehow I skipped one symbol even on my second run lol so i loved this option.\n\nSo overall: it's short and easy which can be a bad thing for someone. But anyway the game is entertaining, good looking and very well made and if not for the voiceacting (which again is even fun sometimes) it would be a perfect HOG.","September 22, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","3"
