This game was made with GameMaker, but don't be fooled, it's a good experience.\n\nPlay as Chelshia, a chimera who was created to accomplish household chores, but was modified at the last minute to stop some evil-doers with her "Rock Arm".  Wait.....this sounds familiar........   You'll be facing off against monster girl pirates who have stolen from the town of good monster girls and....wait, this IS familiar!!\n\nThat's right, this game is essentially a fusion of Rockman (Megaman) and Shantae...only with a focus on monster girls!  Face off against a naga, a harpy, a mermaid, a mimic (chest), a pizza slime (like...a slimegirl made of pizza) and a dridder (spider girl)!!!\n\nPROS:\n+ Retro gameplay\n+ Free\n+ Achievements\n+ Great humor\n+ Challenging start\n+ Occassional lesbian humor and tsundere humor\n+ Small download (51 MB)\n\nCONS:\n- Starts a bit hard, but rewards you a bit too much for collecting everything (Berserk's pros outweigh the cons)\n- Feels a bit generic in the beginning (but the game grows on you)\n- Dash attack can be spammed to win easilly.\n\n\nIf you want a free Rockman (Megaman) or Shantae, this is right up your alley.  A free game you'll be surprised at for not having a price tag.\n\n\n8.5/10  A worthy addition to Steam.  :)","May 20","true","13.8"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"

Best of all is the price tag at the low, low price of free.  The game is fleshed out with quite a few levels, each with their own themes and each containing various secrets, such as fairies to find.  Upon completing levels you're given a ranking based on your performance.\n\nKhimera's difficulty level probably falls more in line with your own skill and ability.  If you're impatient like I am, you'll find the game to be a bit more difficult because you'll hurry along.  This leads to missing things like jumps, some of which are very precise, or running headlong into enemies.  I will say I found the game a bit easier once I started using a controller.\n\nOverall this game is a lot of fun to play if you enjoy platformers and with the free price, what do you have to lose?  It's not even a large download!\n\nI did record a few stages - completely intact with my deaths - so people could get an idea of exactly how it plays:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6i5pkJjDxw","May 15","true","2.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You cannot use the pizza attack using a controller.\n\nI have beaten super meat boy, super mario lost levels, IWBTG, all the megamans, shovel knight etc.  This game should be my jam, but the controls hold it back.

It hearkens back to an era when most games were colorful and cheerful rather than gritty and grim, when games had punishing difficulty curves and when mastering a particular portion felt rewarding, when games were loaded with secrets and fed a sense of wonderment and discovery. These were the games of my childhood, and this is the niche that Khimera fits into.\n\nFar more than a mere nod to the past, Khimera feels like a lost classic of early gaming. Its artwork, music, humor, and gameplay all work together to deliver one of the most satisfying (and for free, no less!) games I\'ve encountered in some time.\n\nIn short, if you like fun, happiness, and childlike innocence, you should download this game. Because that\'s what this game is-- distilled happiness and a  chance to recapture, at least for a couple of hours, what it felt like to be 8 years old.

Then, pirates attack for the money. Meanwhile, a scientist had just finished building a chimera [Cheshia], when he's asked to help save the island. He gives the chimera a golem arm to beat pirates up with. Then you go beat up a lamia [she has arms, she can't be a naga].\n\nGameplay?\nYou have a number of actions you can use to battle the pirates.\n- Normal punch\n- Strong punch\n- Dash punch\n- Air punch\n- Ground punch\n\nWhile each should fill their own role, the dash punch is highly spammable, meaning it's superior to the rest in the boss fights [or at least one boss fight].\n\nLevel Design?\nSome levels are just painful to try playing [Oil Rig, Airship Fortress]. Some are easier, but only slightly. If you can beat Mega Man, you may only have slight difficulties with this game. If you haven't, you're straight boned.\n\nDistractions?\nYou can play a weird Mario Bros./Wrecking Crew imitation called Cake Boy. There's a chef in a place with cakes, signs, sweets, doors and snakes. The goal is to score points by collecting sweets, getting the cake to the white door or blowing up enemies with bombs. Each door leads to the other door of the same color, and cracked doors break after use.\n\nSo, overall?\nThis is a game. It exists. If it costed money, you can bet the top of your legs it'd be worth a fiver. But it doesn't.\nWhich lets me rate it:\n9/10 [Almost perfect]","May 18","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls seem to be really tight, the only thing that i would change is how you lose momentum if you attack midair (the sauce shot loses a lot of potential because you became helpless midair imo.)\nAlso if i had to change a combat element, it would be the dash attack. I don't think it has to be removed altogether, but maybe make it unable to hit back projectiles and put it on a cooldown. Lots of games like League/WoW have mechanics where an ability has 2 or more charges, each charge has X seconds before its back up, so the ability can be used in rapid succession but then they have to wait twice the amount of time for both charges to be back. I think that type of system would really benefit if the charge attack is kept, because right now it makes it too easy to cheese bosses.\nother than that its damn good, there seems to be a checkpoint in enough spots where you don't get too much repetition sickness, fun/challenging platforming, and also has easter eggs/interesting interactions if you poke around.\nWith the dash attack busted atm id give it 7/10 because combat/difficulty level means a lot to me and it makes it too easy in some aspects, but really worth a play.","May 12","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a few references to other indie games, anime and memes but they never become annoying, the humour is gentle and at its core the game is a simple old-school platformer with lots of replayability and attention to detail.

So I was happy to find out this game exists, and happier to find out it's both free and fun. The game is clearly and proudly based off the megaman platform games. Like the megaman games, you make your way through themed stages, each with thier own set of enemies and hazrds that get harder the further you get into the stage before you face a boss and defeat them for a new power like having a double jump, or a charge shot. The game itself is also much more forgiving then  most old school platformers. The stages themselves can be tricky, the pirate ship ones having lots of traps that need good timing to avoid. But the bosses are all easy. They leave themselves open for long periods which means rushing in and smashing them in the face is the way to go. The only boss to put up a challenge is the last stage of the final boss, and that's more due to the moving platfroms and the spikes you have to deal with.  The game is short, but that's to be expected when it's free.  There is stuff to do after you beat all the stages. you can find fairies and books hidden in the stages, and retry for A ranks and Deathless and Beserk runs.","June 2","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you get hit by an enemy while it's advancing and try to hit it afterwards, doesn't work. Jump back and THEN punch. I wanted to go fast, but the game forced me to go slowly and precisely.\n\nSome mini boss attacks are impossible to read unless you've played before, for example, the mini boss in... Pumpkin something? Can't remember. Anyway, that mini boss has an attack that goes in a straight line across the screen in an instant and you have no way of knowing if it will do that attack until it has attacked.\n\nYou WILL get hit and you WILL get salty.

I know it's probably tacky to complain about a game that was free, yet I still can't help but feel a little ripped off because this could have been a fun game if not for the controls.","May 11","false","0.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/recommended/467380/","mokushiroku","Moku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/","694 products in account","Product received for free\n\nRevised for v.1.2: 22/05/16\nKhimera is a free game, so any complaints should not deter you from trying it. Its style and personality counts for a lot, but the difficulty may not suit some players.\n\nPros:  Really nice art style with a wide range of great character designs.\nAmusing dialogue and an interesting plot.\nReally nails that 'retro' feeling throughout.\nA sort of mixture of Mario 3, Mega Man and Castlevania.\nSome good platforming (see below) and plenty of hidden collectables.\nIt's free, so you risk nothing by trying it.\nNeutrals:  Treasure pickups are your rank, and dying removes a chunk of cash. A single death will pretty much guarentee no A-rank, and almost all of my ranks are C. It promotes perfectionism and punishes the smallest mistakes (though there is no 'punishment' beyond the rank itself).\nCons:  Insta-death platforming, where one mistimed jump will ruin your no-death run of the level and send you way back. Enemy hits stun you mid-air, too.\nSparse checkpoints and health pickups are extremely rare, so be prepared to replay 5-10 minutes over and over until you get it right. On instakill, two-block-wide platforming sections with wind, this becomes incredibly frustrating.\nEnemies enter the space you occupy and damage you with contact. While your defence against this had improved since 1.2, it is still a major source of damage from enemies that attack you, remaining out of hit-range and stunning you from turning. This is compounded by flying, tracking enemies that are incredibly hard to hit --even pixels above your head-- if they're slightly off-center. Not only that, but it makes the dash-attack extremely risky, as it will usually result in you taking damage too. These might be fixed with enemeis being knocked back when they damage you, slightly wider range on vertical attacks, and some invunerability frames on the dash.\nIn summation, it's really cute and worth trying. The platforming is fun when it isn't a series of insta-death drops; the fighting is mashy and basic enemies can overcome you if you're not paying attention; and the difficulty is punishing, but levels are actually completeable now, so I can happily recommend this to everyone (but don't expect to fly through it).","May 16","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

I had a great time playing it. However it can be a bit challenging, especially the speedrun cheevo. Pixel graphics but still looks good and even cute imo. A few levels, different monsters to defeat, stuff to collect, the music was good too I think. I played it few days ago and my memory is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes so I am not really sure, lol. Can be 100%-ed but takes 10-15 hours or maybe more, depending how good you are.
