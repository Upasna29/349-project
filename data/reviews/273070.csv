It manages to be complex without being overly complicated.  Are there screens of charts, graphs, and tables?  Sure, but you slowly acclimate yourself to them at your own pace.  You can be successful at the game without digging into them too deeply.  To me, one of the turn-offs I have to these sorts of games is learning to play feels like a grind, or a chore.  With The Last Federation, the act of learning to play the game is itself fun.  The strategy portion even has a separate difficulty from the simulation, so if you're having trouble with one, you can dial it back without making the other too easy.  The interface is quite intuitive and the artwork is mostly very attractive.  Pablo Vega's soundtrack is easily his best yet, and would be worth a purchase on its own, but luckily there is a fantastic game to go along with it.  If these sort of games are you thing, then you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not playing it.  Even if they are not, give it a shot.  It might surprise you.","April 11, 2014","true","27.4"," 282 of 329 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","282","329","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XartaX/recommended/273070/","XartaX","XartaX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XartaX/","379 products in account","I'm really disappointed by the launch of this game. There is lots of depth in a way, but most of it is irrelevant. Most of the gameplay just boils down to slowly getting opinion modifiers to grow. The most efficient way to play the game seems to be to just ignore most of the game mechanics. For example, in my current game I have two epidemics on two different planets. It's plunged the health meter to -40K and it's sinking by 100 every month. Vaccines show up as available tech in the tech list, but I can't actually start a research project with the affected race to unlock it. Despite this massive plunge in health, the races effectiveness doesn't seem to be hampered much at all, and the only real problem for them is that they have close to no ground power, but their space power is completely unaffected.\n\nThe computer advisor also mentioned planetary bombardment at some point, but I've yet to find a way to actually do it. The other races seem to just kill themselves by throwing their troops at the Burlust homeworld meatgrinder. Solving anything in a military faction without having the Burlust at your side and space superiority seems very hard, and certainly not worth the effort. No, the far easier (and more boring) road is to just play the opinion slider game. After starting a federation it only took me about 5 minutes to get almost all the planets to join it by spamming influence tasks and giving away technologies. It's kinda weird that the game has so many mechanics and charts and such, and 99% of it is completely irrelevant and unimportant.\n\nIn addition it almost seems nigh impossible to actually lose the game in a legitimate fashion. The only things that have killed me so far has been ♥♥♥♥ing up a battle, rather than performing any overall strategical mistakes. As someone who has put more than 500 hours into Europa Universalis 4, I find calling this a grand strategy a huge insult to the genre. There is no strategic difficulty to be found here. The biggest (only) decision seems to be what order you want to do things in (which races to found your federation with).\n\nThe game also seems to have its fair share of bugs. In addition to the epidemic thing I mentioned earlier, I was also trying to get rid of insurgents on a planet and it put me up against 90 ships. The race I had selected to help me didn't send anything. I tried again with different members of my federation, but every time I didn't have a single ally in sight when the actual battle started.\n\nAnd then there's how a boatload of the game mechanics make no sense at all. Take technologies for example: You can easily convince a race to give away a tech (any tech) free of charge (for the other race, you have to cough up a few credits) to another race without any difficulty at all, but there is no way whatsoever to make them give or sell it to you personally. It's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that someone who is literally worshipping the ground you walk on wont help you outfit your ship (forcing you to attack them for their technology if there is noone who can, or is willing to, research it together with you), but they will give away their national secrets to a competing country for just a few credits.\n\nBottom line, in it's current form this game just seems to be broken on so many levels. It's not fun, most of the mechanics aren't important, although they seem interesting, and they seem to be implemented extremely poorly (I'm looking at you, epidemics and unbeatable Burlust ground power). The only thing that is keeping me playing for now is the potential for what the game could have been. But that's not what it is. There is the possibility of the game being hugely improved down the line through patches and DLC, but as it is right now I can't really recommend it.\n\nEdit: If you feel this review isn't helpful, feel free to comment on it in the comment section (click the "Not Recommended" text on the top of the review - it's a hyperlink). If there is something about the game you'd like explained which I haven't adressed, I will try to explain it if you ask (and if it's relevant for the full review, I'll put it here). If you think I have some factual errors feel free to point it out and we can see if we can clear it up. If you just disagree with my opinions it'd be nice if you didn't rate it as unhelpful, as a review is just a collection of such opinions. If you feel that something I think is negative wouldn't affect your enjoyment of the game (or the other way around), the review would still be helpful to you since it gives you information about it : )\n\n---------------\n\nUpdates since initial review:\n\nWhat's been patched to my knowledge:\nTesting during patch v1.002:\n- You can now research techs with other races even if they already know the tech, giving you access to them without raiding. This seems to be a patchwork fix, though, as it thematically makes no sense that you help a race research something they are already supposed to know.\n- Races with incredibly strong ground presence are now actually beatable. I'm not 100% sure exactly what caused this change, but I'm assuming it's the other races actually using planetary bombardment now (because the races I saw attack the Burlust in my game should not have been able to beat them in a ground battle).\nExample graph: http://snag.gy/WMgtB.jpg\nThe dip in the red/purple graphs is post-patch. Before that you can see the Acutians repeatedly dipping due to just being slaughtered over and over although the federation has complete space dominance: http://snag.gy/l84SR.jpg\nFederation members are Acutians, Andor, Evuck, Skylaxians and Peltians.\n\nTesting during patch v1.003/v1.005\n- While ground combat seems to be fixed now, space combat seems to have taken a trip to nonsense land. Here is a screencap from my current campaign: http://snag.gy/IGiJg.jpg\nYou can see the Acutians constantly sending ships to the Bovarine home planet, and in fact they have around twice as much total power on their planet right now (25026 vs 13332). Even so, the Bovarine completely annihilate the Acutian fleets over and over without any problem whatsoever. In fact, before that screenshot I completely wiped out all their ships with a direct assault and the Acutians started their ground assault while in orbit, but it took them literally seconds to kick them off their planet through their production alone from scratch. As the Acutians control 3 planets and have way better quality ones as well, this doesn't exactly make sense (not to mention their technological advantage). Illustrated in a power graph: http://snag.gy/Adp7z.jpg\n\n- The devs have now implemented "Federation points" which more or less represent a races desire to join a federation. If anything, this implementation shows how this is clearly a beta product right now, as this is a completely new feature coming out of nowhere.\n\nAdditional complaints:\n- Attacking anti federation insurgents is a horribly bugged mess. I once managed to get an ally to actually join me in the fight instead of sending nothing, and their ships turned up... hostile to me and allied to the insurgents. That said, combat is ridiculously easy on the normal difficulty, and I can kill a fleet having 10-15 flagships (you have one) and outnumbering me maybe 100 to 1 (counting medium/small ships) without diverting ANY power to shields. I'd play Ironman if the combat was skipable, but I'd hate to replay an entire campaign because of a single mistake in a combat (although it's easy, you can die fast if you mis-play with no power to shields, but play correctly and you should be able to kill a fleet of almost any size).\n\nAnyways, this is apparantly around the max size of a review, so I can't really document further testing. If you have any specific questions about the state of the game, feel free to ask in the comment section. If I ever feel like the game is in a state where I can recommend it, I will change my review accordingly.","April 20, 2014","false","13.7"," 1,053 of 1,353 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","053","1","0","115"

My first game I saved everyone but the burlusts who were so hated by everyone that they were at continous war with everyone.  So i use the skylaxians to spread military technology around to everyone else in the federation which was everyone.  This includes the Acutians who hate me with all their robotic hearts, but they are in the fed and the burlusts need to die before i can win.  It's 70 years later and the burlust homeworld is about to fall.  When all of a sudden the acutians pull out of the federation, and take the burlusts planet while they are weak.  Well, I thought to myself, everyone else in the solar system against two planets owned by the acutians, this will be a cakewalk.   As it turns out the only people in the Fed who hated the acutians enough to go to war with them were the Pelatians.  So i have to spend some 50 years dragging the acutians reputation through mud before everyone finally agrees to go to war with them.  Problem is at this point the acutians have finished the tech tree in its entirety largely thanks to the boost I had the skylaxians give them.  So begins a long drawn out war of attrition between the alliance and the acutians.  After 30 years of war with no visible progress, I decide that I need to finish out my tech tree, so I can actually fight all these assasins the acutians keep sending after me.  So I finish out the tech tree taking about a century to do so.   Now at this point i had essntially gotten infinite money.  So i thought to myself how will i kill the acutians when they keep breeding like rabbits.  Then it hit me.  I'll just pay the evucks a crap-ton of money to poison the environment and ruin the medical capablities of the Acutians with their probes.  So a few million later and the acutians planets are cesspools of disease.  At which point a virus springs up.  I then hire a small army of 60 bioterrorists to infect every last acutian with this virus.  5 years later the acutians are dead, and I win the game.   Great game with nearly an infinite number of options.  No two games will ever be the same.","October 3, 2014","true","37.2"," 116 of 121 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","116","121","8","0"

Arcen's newest game manages to do this exceedingly well. I got into the open alpha fairly early, and so had a chance to watch this game evolve into the gem that it is now, and to be clear, this review is aimed at the final alpha build.\n\nIn a normal game of TLF, you're an independant agent with the self-appointed task of unifying the system through any means possible. And there are quite a number of means to achieve this goal. Head of state being stubborn? Bump him off, the next will surely be more pliable... maybe. Entire race running amok? Pay another to crash a moon into their homeworld.\n\nThe combat side of the game has changed quite a bit since its original inception, now resembling something like a turn-based shmup. Combat is, in general, quick and messy. Often, you're not really expected to defeat all comers, though don't let that stop you. An average combat mission involves you warping in, determining what needs to be done, then moving to accomplish your objective. If all you need to do is destroy a space station, why bother with taking out every individual ship and risking health loss or failure?\n\nWith eight races, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, dispositions, and deals to make, things can get complicated rather quickly. A few will band together naturally, while most of the time each faction is pretty much out for itself. Of course, you have the power to influence this as well, and it's often necessary to get two races to work together to take on a much stronger foe. The amount of deals you're able to make is pretty staggering, ranging from simply killing pirates to smuggling freedom fighters onto a planet and starting a revolution.\n\nAs a fan of simulations, I love watching the races squabble and toil in their sandbox solar system with Observer Mode, in which the player is now just a bystander watching everything unfold instead of actually doing anything.\n\nAll said, I would recommend this game to any fan of strategy or simulation gaming. It does have faults, of course. Combat can be pretty tedious after a time, and despite the sandbox-y nature of the simulation, it does tend to unfold fairly similarly. Certain races, assuming they aren't gimped by a bad roll in planet generation, which is often the only factor that determines how successfull a race will be, will always become a major problem and have to be dealt with, invariably by wiping them out. I have yet to finish a game in which all eight races survive to the end.\n\nArcen has proven again that they are a truly unique development team, making the game THEY want, rather than the game they think WE want.\n\ntl;dr   Buy this. It's good, and so is the company.","April 15, 2014","true","19.3"," 180 of 214 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","180","214","0","0"

It is (4-1)X because exploration does not exist. Also, player does not control a race but manipulates other races by using politics and by helping battles.\n\nIn this game, player is the last survivor of a murdered race (Hydrals) that was the dictators of the solar system. But one of them betrayed the race. His (Its?) goal was to make the space technology available to other races and then creating a federation to unify the solar system. After Hydrals' homeworld got destroyed, the last hydral (i.e. the player) crashed into one of the rivals' planet. When that rival race built their first capital ship, he managed to steal it and escaped. That's all the story the game has. It is not deep but enough to make things clear, at least to a point.\n\nThe game does not have a separate tutorial. Instead, when player starts his/her first game, most of the game elements are locked and these elements are unlocked and explained as the game progress. Its execution is very good. Although there are lots of things to learn, player is never overwhelmed by them. Most of the information and choices have very informative tooltips. They are especially useful when some option is not eligible. This way, only thing the player needs to do is reading the tooltip which explains the reason. That said, some of the advanced information, such as which conditions are required to capture a planet, are never explained.\n\nEvery race has a different political structure and has a different opinion of life. Some values military strength and are more aggressive, another is all about peace and quiet. This makes the player approach them in different ways to gain influence and convince them to join the federation. It is also possible to agitate a race against another, resulting in starting a war. Of course, these actions do not happen directly. There are lots of friendly and hostile actions player can take. When player visits a planet, possible "missions" are listed under their own menu. These missions are the main tools to manipulate races. By using these "tools", player achieves his/her goal for a certain race. I won’t go into details because this is not a guide.\n\nCombat is different than classic turn-based combat. Units don't move/attack like in a chess game. It is actually more like Dragon Age's pause-order-continue style but pausing happens in periodic intervals called "turns". In each turn player issues a move order, then an attack order, and fight continues until next turn. There are also abilities that consumes one full turn. Player can select 6 abilities to use in battle and if an ability's ammo is depleted it is replaced with another ability of the same type during battle (Abilities have three types, i.e. "offensive ability", "operations" and special ability”). Starting abilities are random, but how many abilities of a certain ability type a player can use, depends on which race's first ship was stolen by the player at the beginning of the game.\n\nThere are some points that make the game less “believable”. For example you can make a planet’s environment go bad, but race itself does not take any counter-actions to fix it. It will stay as it is, even if it cost billions of inhabitants.\n\nThe main soundtrack is similar to 90s arcade games’ low bitrate sounds. Other soundtracks are smoother and easy on the ears. Sound effects are decent. Also when a very important event occurs, a female –I am guessing AI- makes funny comments.\n\nPros:+ Good Simulation: Every planet advances depending on the status of planet and race. Strategic elements and properties of the races affect outcome.\n+ Humorous: Game has some humor in comments, descriptions etc. It is always a good thing.\n+ Chaotic Battles: This is both good and bad. Bad side is below. Good side is that it makes battles more challenging.\n+ Replayability: Every time a new game starts, planets and their inhabitants change. Due to compatibility factor between a race and planet type, a different race becomes more effective. This effectively changes how that game progress.\n\nCons:- Overcomplicated: Finding which information is important and which is just for "decoration", takes too much time.\n- Static UI: This means, UI size is static and the higher the resolution is, the smaller the UI becomes. Therefore, when the resolution is set to full HD, UI elements become too small and very crammed.\n- Chaotic Battles: Bad side of this is what the name suggests. When every small dot-sized ship fires another dot, screen gets covered with dots.\n\nVerdict:Game has a different approach to space strategy games and the formula worked well, enough to keep me in the game until I unified the solar system without taking a break. So I recommend it.\n\nP.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nEdit: Fixed some typos and formatting","August 8, 2015","true","10.7"," 71 of 75 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","71","75","0","1"

Unlike most hybrids, however, this game could stand on its own for either genre.\n\nThe Grand Stratetgy is deep, but for a new player the heavy details  are not necessary...but they are there if you are curious! Each of the 8 races you interact with are distinct and serve their owns uses both as allies and as enemies.\n\nThe concept as a concertrated force influencing a dynamic galaxy is not common and very satsifying. You can swell up a (potential) ally race into an even mighter one, save a weaker race so as to distupt your enemies, completely shut down an enemy by yourself , or a variety of other things. It is very dynamic. You change the galaxy somewhat, but you also have to react to the galaxy's own logic. The strengths and weaknesses of each race is constant each game, but their combatablilty with their starting planet and when they become space faring means each game will have a different balance of power to start with. The result is each game is different.\n\nWhen you take part in battles you enter the tactical turn based game. The mode can either be slow and methodical or fast and quickly depending on how difficult your parcticular situation is. It is enjoyable to devastate enemy forces if you manage to get a tech edge. If you fall behind...just use tactics.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone with a mild interest in grand strategy games or turn based games. This game has the depth to be enjoyable for dozens of hours as is. The devlopers already say that they have a framework for years of expansions, (and even better, free content as well!)\n\nAn excellent title, one I would highly recommend.","April 17, 2014","true","55.2"," 124 of 162 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","124","162","0","5"

Despite the looks, I love this game almost as much as Civ 2: Test of Time, my all-time favorite.\n\nThe feeling you'll get when you beat the game for the first time is even better than killing a hard Dark Souls 1 boss. The bliss I am now feeling is... beyond words right now.\n\nIn the game's current state, it is now actually decently easy to play in comparison to past versions, if before wasn't a good time to get it, now's good.\n\nThe game itself is a clever blend of strategy and shooter, seeming ot be able to go from Real-Time strategy game with a "galaxy" map and a pause button, then go into battle and it's more like Demonstar, only a turn-based, tactical, strategic shooter version in combat.\n\nCombat is simple, but complicated at the same time, with just enough to not be too much to new players.\n\nThe game has you trying to unite a system composed to 8 civilizations, all crowded together, in an alliance. Each race has their own ideals and even their own way of doing things and personalities, no two races are the same, and that's where the challenge comes from.\n\nA couple will always pick a fight, two or three will always be technologically ahead, there is a rather weak race who is easy to get in good terms with ofcourse, but everybody is different.\n\nThere's so much to do in this game, all that one really needs to do is find what they need to do and do it.\n\nThe soundtrack and art design is simply wonderful, I personally love it, now that races will be on randomized planets, it makes it even better.\n\nThe tutorial is Very well done with new players directly in mind as it explains EVERYTHING at an even pace, and does so in-depth aswell, unlike many other games on Steam today.\nThere is no tutorial level thankfully, the tutorial itself is integrated into hte game itself, and entries can be called upon later in the menu, later in the game if you've missed how to change power levels on your ship, or start making the federation.\n\nBeating this game for the first time on the lowest of difficulties gave me a feeling that not even beating Dark Souls 2's bosses gave me.\n\nUltimately, this game gets a 7/10 in my books; I can't describe it, it's just this game is so nicely done in every way, it oozes creativity, quality and it is clear the Developer has put their heart into making this game.\n\nI simply love this game.","November 1, 2014","true","42.4"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","60","70","0","0"

Nor are turn-based space shooters, but putting them together isn't something you see everyday.  So naturally when I heard stories from TotalBiscuit on the Co-optional podcast about how he eventually got everyone to stop killing eachother by comitting genocide I was both amused and intrigued.\n\nI then ignored it for about half a year.  I needed something new to stream and since I don't have a particularly good internet connection I'm really limited in my choices. I decided to try a few different things out and Last Federation simply blew the competition out of the water.\n\nIn the Last Federation, you are the last Hydral in a solar system of races that hate your guts since your race was a bunch of asshats that decided to stop everyone else from getting into space.  Karmic retribution in the form of rockets attached to your homeworld's moon turned out to be the last thing anyone did to interact with your people in a very permanent fashion.  The only reason you're not dead is because you smuggled space faring technology to another race.  That race plops you in prison and everyone goes about their business.  A long time later they make it to space with a strong flagship. You break out of prison and take the flagship.\n\nSo thus this is your starting scenario.  One race hates your guts and the  rest are pretty neutral to you.  Time to create a federation and stop everyone from killing eachother off.  Kind of, but we'll get to that later.\n\nThis is a 4X game where you don't have a race.   You are just a powerful diplomat running around the map.  If it was just this, then it would have been an interesting, if ultimately shallow, experience.  But Last Federation takes it further with an interesting turn based space combat game that takes the place of automated combat in other 4X games.\n\nYou can do everything here from attacking or aiding defense armadas in wars, to killing pirates, stealing techonology, space stations, assassinating leaders, or giving space faring tech to races not yet in space.   During this mode you get the ability to move, damage with your weapons, or use special abilities that clear shots from around you and affect the battlefield. I specifically mention the shot clearing because enemies spam the battlefield with shots in practically every direction.  It reminds me greatly of bullet hell games in this respect.  Usually your best defense is to dodge out of the way.  But sometimes you don't get that option and you get shot down or have to run.\n\nWith a few exceptions, the penalty for this is time. If you get shot down you're out of the action for a year and the races get left to their own for a while.  Which will likely wreck any plans you have in some way.  But doesn't end the game.  It can be quite fun to just roll with the punches when you make mistakes and see what happens.\n\nDespite all this praise, the game does have some drawbacks.  Graphically the battles are very pretty, but the 4X mode leaves alot to be desired. It is essentially a flat picture with icons above the different planets that races own.  There is no real ability to zoom in on these or get any more details about the worlds you are looking at save the occasional drawn art.  While this is serviceable, it could definitely be better.\n\nNext the game employs a staggered tutorial system that introduces concepts as you get further into the  game. These tutorials are fine, but they are very information heavy and sometimes introduce concepts that you can't really utilize for a while.  For example, the tutorial about research explained that you can research your own stuff at space stations you control! The ability to control a space station didn't pop up for me until much, much later. As a result I kind of forgot to make use of this until another playthrough.  The tutorials get you where you need to be, but they could be cleaned up a bit.\n\nFinally the game's win condition is maybe a bit too simple given the story.  Basically you need to create a federation and then either kill off everyone not in the federation or absorb them into it.  The only real failure conditions are the death of all Federation races or your own (This can happen in only a couple of situations.  But yes there are a couple fights that can end you permanently.)  The implication at the beginning is that you are trying to prevent genocide from occuring again with the Federation, only to turn around and do it yourself.  Actually uniting all of the races without one of them dying is very, very difficult. There are different types of achievements for accomplishing this with limited sets of races.  And this I'm fine with, but it seems like the game was designed for the solar system peace situation and less so for the others. It's not a big deal, but it does feel weird.\n\nBeyond this the game has a great deal of statistics available to you which help decision making should you desire it.  It can also come across as a bit intimidating, but I found it very worthwhile to get a handle on it all and use it to help my chances of success.  Ultimately, I was really happy I learned it all and really ended up loving this game.  If you enjoy Civ, Galatic Civ, the Endless series, or really any other games in this genre then give this a try. You'll probably really like it!\n\n(Note: The DLC does introduce some backstory variations to help some of this make more sense.  It also adds the ability to join and control a race so you get The Last Federation and a more traditional 4X experience at the same time.  I have not tried them yet.  But given the base game I probably will look into it and update this at some point.)","November 27, 2015","true","13.5"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","31","33","3","1"

I always try to start custom maps in games, so I tried to do that in my first try, and I got a popup suggesting I try QuickPlay instead. I took the advice. Then came the picture of the hydra and the story of what happened to you, what are you doing and why are you doing it. I have a weakness for mythological monsters so the idea of playing a space hydra was just too cool to miss.\n\nUnfortunately, the game's use the word "race" and the typical "-ian" ending for their names (Acurian, Peltarian, etc)) gave me the impression the game's lore would be very cheesy (just like in games like Galactic Civilizations and Master of Orion, which were enjoyable but definitely cheesy story-wise). All according to my prediction, the game presented good-old mostly anthropomorphic aliens (even the completely robotic race had an unnecesarily human body), with a very juvenile view of politics, "economy" and intrigue; the lore was more or less a repetition of old soft sci-fi tropes, nothing special.\n\nWhat could have been Mount and Blade in space, turned out to be mostly a game of Spreadsheet Commander; even though the game does have unique mechanics for each "race", for influence and credit gain, it is still just 2 abstract and lifeless concepts that you are trading back and forth: credit, and influence. And even beneath this apparent layer of complexity the game _feels_ just like the same in every planet. The purported "Grand Strategy" element of the game didn't get to play out. But man was the music catchy.\n\nI didn't get to enjoy trade or cooperation or diplomacy, it really, really felt like Spreadsheet Commander for the short time I got myself to endure it.\n\nAnd then comes the combat... I will skip it, I don't even want to explain it, but it's really mediocre. It's fun the first few times but, I just can't get myself to see anything interesting about playing turn-based combat with a single ship; and maybe in the future you get to do more interesting things with other ships, but I will quote the very game's Logbook here "in battle, you just have You and whatever allies you managed to get, against your enemies", and when I fought enemies with allies by my side, I still could only pilot my own ship. So I'm going to assume the game will always only let you pilot or give orders to your own ship; this is hardly a "Grand Strategy" combat style. I consider the combat system so mediocre, that the game would've been better without it; it could be replaced with an abstracted combat method, in the Spreadsheet Commander spirit that the rest of the game took.\n\nDo I think the game has no merit at all?, No, I think it has some, but I'm very picky with games, and this game just couldn't get me hooked. But the music is really good, and so is the art. So... I will just pretend I paid for a music album and a nice hydra picture and leave it at that.\n\nAlso, so you can get an idea of what games I enjoy (and you can tell whether to trust my taste or not):\nMount and Blade: > 500 hours\nCrusader Kings II: > 100  (this game is quite the map-painting simulator, but it had <something> that made it feel a little more than that, and so it did get me hooked).\nCivilization V: > 400 hours\nStarbound: > 100 hours\nDota 2: > 100 hours\n\nThat's an example of some of the games in my library.\n\nHappy gaming.","November 15, 2014","false","4.6"," 277 of 437 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","277","437","7","9"

It's a nonstandard 4X game with heavy emphasis on diplomacy, and is extremely niche in an already niche genre. If you don't think manipulating everything from behind the scenes is fun, then walk away from this game and never look back. However, if you do enjoy that, then this game might be for you.\n\nThe Last Federation is a well-designed strategy game with a surprising amount of depth. You play as a lone mercenary, and watch as the AI builds its empires. Your goal is to nudge the AI in a way that will ultimately create a Federation that spans the solar system. Your actions rarely have an immediate payoff, but over time you can decide which planets become wastelands and which ones become paradise. It's a thing of beauty, to subtly change a few numbers early on, and watch the butterfly effect go.\n\nThe combat system is a turn-based bullet hell, where you can manage power distribution, plot out movement, and use weapons/abilities. The tutorial places a lot of emphasis on combat, but managing RCI and influence is far more important. While you can hold off an overwhelming invasion force for a while or smash apart a stalemate, combat is only one tool out of many in your arsenal. It's up to the player to figure out when to get their hands dirty, and when to sit back and help build up armadas.\n\nThe game has an excellent soundtrack, shiny art, and a very coherent design. The story is solid, if a bit cliche. The game has a rather light-hearted tone, with blurbs of snark and sarcasm coming from your AI assistant as the solar system evolves. The screen does get cluttered later in the game, but the option to clean it up does exist. Critical information is very well presented and accessible, but may get overwhelming to new players despite the tutorial. The developers have given an incredible amount of attention to detail, to the point where I can still discover new interactions after 40 hours of playing the game. There are many mechanics and interactions that go unexplained, although there is a bit of appeal in discovering them for yourself.\n\nIt's impossible to do much on your own in The Last Federation. You just can't hope to make or break interplanetary empires with your single ship.  You will have to rely on the various AI races to do the dirty work for you. The DLCs add in new game modes, but the gameplay patterns stays the same: AI does the heavy lifting, and you guide it and stack the deck in your favor. With a randomly generated solar system, there's a healthy amount of replayability. The game does stagnate after you figure out the optimal strategy, but there's a lot of fun to be had as you learn it.\n\nThe Last Federation is a solid, niche strategy game. If you're looking for a standard 4X game, you will be disappointed. If you're interested in this game solely for its combat mechanics then I would advise against getting it, because it's only a small portion of the game itself. But if you're looking for a strategy game with heavy emphasis on diplomacy and manipulation, then I would strongly recommend it.","April 12","true","67.3"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","2"

And while the writing is very funny and the soundtrack is lovely, some design decisions turn the game part of this into a bit of a farce.\n\nYou have way too much power over the entire simulated world. Pretty much every variable is directly and easily changed by a metaphorical snap of your fingers and a selection on a menu. You can make anyone like or dislike anyone else. You can quickly ravage anyone's homeworld by messing with their 4 economic indicators and there's nothing they can do about that. Alternatively, you can quickly turn them into an obscene super power, and they cannot do that on their own. Owing to the fact you're completely and instantly healed at the end of every battle, which you can escape from anytime you like, you can destroy virtually infinite numbers of ships, if you but have the patience. You can be delayed, but never stopped. Nothing in the game will ever challenge you; nothing *can* challenge you when you are given this much control over everything. Higher difficulty settings only cause things to take longer; they don't make you any less likely to succeed. The irony here is that beneath the dozens of daunting menus and hardcore aesthetic, what you have is an ultra casual game. And that's what ultimately makes The Last Federation pointless to play.","July 19, 2015","false","26.0"," 63 of 87 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","63","87","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/recommended/273070/","cannonesshannah","Katie's Hannah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/","979 products in account","Recommended: Definitely a different spin to 4X strategy, this game will be a hit or miss based on whether you find that spin interesting or not, but it's worth trying to find out.  It's a game where a lot of care has been taken with it's development and mechanics, and it shows.\n\nThe Last Federation is a hybrid 4X strategy game developed and published by Arcen Games, most notably known for their AI War series.  It also serves as something of a counterpart to AI wars in concept: whereas AI wars was about carefully dismantling a much superior foe, The Last Federation is centered around you playing as the lone survivor of a race that subjugated the entire sector before one of the subjugated races uses a superweapon to wipe you out.  The central concept of The Last Federation is that while you otherwise have all the typical elements of a 4X strategy game, you don't directly control the civilisations involved - instead you must use diplomacy, manipulation, intimidation, your superior technology, or your superior firepower to manipulate the course of events.\n\nIn essence, you go to different worlds in your super-starship, deciding which races to uplift with spacefaring technology, how you want to help the ones you want to ally with, how to undermine your enemies, and so forth.  This takes the place of going to different worlds and stations and having several options of what you can do presented to you.  You can do all the standard 4X stuff, but instead of it being for you, rather, when you're helping research a technology, build an improvement, or do one of the many other tasks at the planet, you're doing that for the other race.  The benefit is furthering along a race you want as an ally, giving them better tools to succeed, with the ultimate goal of uniting the galaxy, by hook or by crook.\n\nIt's a different spin on that 4X genre, and to Arcen Games' credit, they've obviously put a lot of thought into how these mechanics will work in that context.  Tutorials are provided and go into just enough depth without the amount of babying hand-holding most AAA games do.  Most everything feels intuitive and easy once you get into the game.  If there's anything that's a little rough around the edges as regards that, its that sometimes the data pertinent to the given task at hand isn't presented in the clearest fashion.  There is a metric tonne of different things being simulated for each armada (unit), each planet, and each race at any given time, so it's a very dense amount of information to digest.  For the most part the game does an admirable job of giving you the directly pertinent information but sometimes there's related data that doesn't get displayed.  To give one example at time of writing, one of the tasks you can perform at a world is cleaning up space junk from battles, which clearly outlines what you get for doing so quite well, but what it doesn't tell you is how much space junk is up there - for that you have to go into the extended information of the planet and through dozens of detail fields to find the one that tells you how much junk is in orbit.  It's not a game-breaker by any means, but it makes more work for a player that wants to play optimally than is strictly necessary.\n\nThe tactical combat when you get into direct combat is reminiscent of a sort of turn-based SPAZ.  It works pretty well, although I would recommend if you want a challenge you kick up the difficulty.  I played on the normal setting and once you got into the tech progression it pretty much became a cakewalk.  One presumes, however, its more challenging on the harder difficulty levels.  Especially so since you can enable a "permadeath" mode whereby if that ship of yours gets blown up its game over.  (As opposed to otherwise, the game forcing you to flee if you get critically damaged.)\n\nProduction values of the game are good to high; as said prior there's a lot of thought that's been put into the game and that extends to the design as well.  Sound design is good, the soundtrack is very melodic and is something I'd even listen to outside the game as something ambient, and the graphics while 2D are pretty neat, especially the world background graphics which has hand-painted scenes.\n\nA lot of heart went into this game and it shows.  Whether you like it or not will depend on whether that spin on the typical 4X formula agrees with you, but its worth the look and the purchase.  Speaking on a personal level, I think this game will be a contender for game of the year for me this year.  It's a really brilliantly-heartful and excellently-executed game.  Whether you love it or you don't, I doubt you'll find anything else quite like it.","April 24, 2014","true","27.6"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","0"

Bullet Hell meets Civilizations in Space?\n\nYou have 8 races, all with very identifiably anatomies ranging from small furry barn-owls to Metroid style Chozo-esque utopian robots to a planet of robots who act like Bender from Futurama to a warlike crab? people (what the hell is a Burlust). The main game mode has you trying to make a unified Federation to stop genocides like the one that happened to your awesome 4 headed dragon race. You can research technology on you rown or with other races to improve your relations with them, help build structures on planets that can either strengthen defenses, help production/livelihood, or just make a bunch of TV channels that help different races learn that they're not supposed to hate everyone.\n\nAll this is done through an interface that shows some incredible artwork of each planet and an entire solar system, and text-based explanations that are written as the actual dialogue of your snarky, spunky female ship AI, whom I may add is a fully fleshed-out character who will actively react to the events that occur in-game (she does NOT like when computer virus diseases pop up. Also she can be legitimately surprised if you can pull off things like getting the Peltians to successfully conquer a planet).\n\nAnd in-combat you have a pretty well rounded bullet-hell style 2D shoot'emup complete with special abilities that can help kill enemies, keep you alive, and help circumvent the power management. Oh, did I forget to mention your ship acts like the old Star Wars TIE Fighter game where you divert finite power between weapons, shields, and engines?\n\nThe achievments in this game are a sort of guide to playing. Sure, you *could* just win by completely destroying all races except the ones who are easy to get into a Federation, but some require some finesse (and multiple saves to be honest) like trying to get a Federation of only the Acutians, Burlust, and Thoraxians for the "Look Upon Your Creation And Despair" achievement when the fastest way is to....make a Federation of Acutians-Burlust-Boarines, then find a way to get the Thoraxians IN and the Boarines OUT.\n\nAnd yes, you will end up loving some races and hating others. The hiveminded bug people are going to grate at your nerves as you fly to their planet every few minutes to let them know the hard way they're not allowed to have a military just so you can be absolutely sure they don't end up ruining your attempts at a clean, genocide-free Federation where nobody has to play planet hop-scotch and move their entire remaining race.\n\nTo top things off the DLC adds new scenarios, one in which you actually have your own faction and one where the Federation exists and you need to keep it from being taken over by a 9th race of Touhou-style bullet-hell ship-piloting bacteria. You have to stop everyone from fighting each other to have a chance against these things and as the Burlust, Acutians, Thoraxians, and Boarines will have taught you well enough, fighting is something a lot of people like doing, no matter how much you hate it.\n\nThe game never seems to drag on too long like the inevitable Civ comparison in the long-running marathon games and never seems too short like Civ games that barely hit the iron age before victory (of course the game can be cut short by you dying but that can be said about a lot of games). You can use the standard galaxy or give everyone dice rolls and just hope the people you hate end up starting out on a planet that's ill-suited to them so they don't explode in population.\n\nThe soundtrack fits the game *perfectly*, with each track set to each scenario (trade ship raids, resistance fighter smuggling, invading, defending, etc.) all culminating in an ending song that makes it well worth the trouble those Thoraxians give you DID I MENTION I HATE THE THORAXIANS?\n\nLast, I leave you with an excerpt from one of my games: I was attempting to get the achievement for having the three peaceful races in the Federation and nobody else. I focused ENTIRELY on building up their research, technology, defenses, etc. until their planets were fully equipped with everything they could ever want or need. I just ignored the other 5 races and let them go kill each other for a while. Until....until I saw a small little skull icon with a red outline across the other planets in the system. Turns out when you let one race conquer 4 planets they form a nigh-unkillable Fear Empire. This Thoraxian-created Fear Empire literally could NOT be defeated unless I conquered EVERY planet they owned and on their last planet I had to exterminate over a hundred BILLION bug-people. I had three races completely blot out the sun with their fully upgraded warships, I bombed every single building they ever made into dust, I poisoned their environment so much literally nothing could live on their planet, I undermined their economy so they could never even think of building a single spaceship, I poisoned the population until disease was so rampant babies were born on their deathbed and that only took out about *half* of their population. After just hitting the Orbital Bomb dispatch and setting the game to extreme-speed for about 20 minutes I FINALLY killed every single one of these 100+ billion bugs amd wiped them from the galaxy, which allowed me to finally establish my peaceful Federation of pacifists.","October 8, 2015","true","113.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","20","21","9","0"

You can also start wars or end them. The biggest negative aspect of this simulation mode include some of the options not being as usefull as others and their is quite a bit of grinding late game. The positives are that each of the races are very unique, there are some very good stories that come out of this simulation aspect, and there are some very interesting thematical events that happen. *SPOILER ALERT, DONT READ THIS NEXT PART IF YOU DONT LIKE SPOILERS* An example of a good story that came out of the simulation aspect was when I created an alliance out of the Boarines (isolasionist ice boars), the Burlusts (hyper aggresive chicken people) and the Acutians (Capitalist Cruel Robots), I then backstabbed the Boarines by convincing the Skylaxians (honour bound stereotypical grey aliens) to wage a war of extermination on them so that there were only 2 races left in my grand federation. Wanting to fill the gap I recruited the Thoraxians (bug-like hive killing machines) into my federation. After years of fighting (the grinding I was talking about) it came down to my federation (about 5 planets) and the Skylaxian Empire (about 3 planets), and after all these years of fighting, my federation then betrays me and became an axis of evil, causing me great troubles.\n\nThe combat aspect is very schump like and turnbased (more turnbased than schump like). The combat is very hard to explain so I wont really try, but all I can really say is that it starts becoming repetitive after about 50 hours to the average person but otherwise is quite enjoyable.\n\nFinally, just want to mention some things I did not mention before, the music is really great and the expansions add SO much to the game but sometimes the game is really hard to lose so you will get into positions where it would take about 5 hours of grinding to win and 5 hours of waiting to lose. Also the learning curve is super steep.\n\nTL:DR\n+Developers are awesome\n+Races are unique\n+Great stories come out of this game\n+Game is very open about ways to complete your objective\n+Great Expansion (soon to be Expansions)\n\n+/- Combat is great but can get repetitive\n\n-The late game is grindy\n-The simulation aspect could be balanced better\n-The learning curve is pretty insane","November 28, 2014","true","33.9"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","22","28","3","0"

It's clear that the devs put a LOT of time into this game. The objective of the game is that you are the last survivor of your race, who were exterminated by the other races dure to their oppression by you (your race). As the last survivor of your race, you don't want to see the other races to fall to the same circumstances you did, so you set about creating a galactic federation (or just choose your favorite, and kill everyone with them, while still calling it a "federation"). The game in itself is extrordinarily detailed, as you are very powerful, still having (most) of your races tech, and as a result, you use these powers/tech to try and manipulate the galaxy to your will (you can't directly change much, but you can manipulate other races to do your bidding, or subvertantly destroy the economy/medical system/police force of an entire race. In the end, it's a very detailed and very fun game. Oh, I forgot about spaceship combat, it's probably the funnest part. Usually you vs around 10 enemies initally, then as the game progresses, it's you against 20k ships (although it takes a very long time to get to that point). It's hard for me to describe it in any more detail, but if you are a RTS fan, i'd highly reccomend this game.","October 23, 2014","true","39.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Arcen's games are never easy to master, but this one at least is very easy to learn, and you won't find yourself frustrated by an unintelligible wall of statistics like many similar titles.

This game will have you playing it nonstop for hours upon hours.\n\nThe goal of this game is to unite a federation with 8 races, each with their own personality and way of getting them into the federation. To add to the backstory, you are basically the extinct race in the space galaxy, since they were total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. As you did a last-minute mission to betray your race, your race's planet is blown up due to spy probes poisioning the environment and a huge space-bomb known as a Planetcracker.\n\nIn the actual game itself, you can interact with the different races through many ways: interact with the Skylaxians through democracy and trade, or interact with the Burlust warlords by threatening them, dueling them, and bribing them. There's even space stations and a blackmarket to buy bribe items, or to hire workers to protect/build your space station, and to even research faster. Like I mentioned before, all races are very diverse in their own way. For example, the Acutians are a hostile capitalist robot government who have whatever industry leading their government be their current concerns, or the Andors, which are basically peaceful robots whose main focus is to help other races. To top it off, each race can get their own research tree, with technology limited to only them.\n\nOh, and I also forgot to mention: the battling part. Basically, the main story of how you get your ship is that after you leave your planet before its destroyed, you crash land on another planet. You can select this planet, or it can be random. But after some time being stuck on the planet, you finally help them reach space, and steal their prototype flagship. However, this makes them very angry at you right from the start. Already, this adds choices. Do you want to start with one of the more powerful race's ships and risk getting attacked by Assassins? Or do you take a weaker race, but have a weaker ship? This further adds on with the next question: Do you risk giving that race more technology to hate you less, although they will be more powerful? Or do you take out their ships and make alliances with other races? The possibilities and problems you face will be endless, each with their unique approach. And there's even special abilities and different weapons to help take down different enemies and to exploit their weaknesses.\n\nOh, there's also planet stats, such as their medical, economic, enviromental, and public order state. If they get too low, they can cause too much havoc in the planet, exposing themselves to outside attack, or if they get too high, they can cause a big boom for the planet and their efficency will skyrocket. You can even affect how the planet states are: for example, you can help with the economy or persuade the leaders to start a positive trend in a certain state. Even further, you can build buildings such as a Solar Shield to help with the environmental state, or science buildings to boost research time. You can also sabotage their buildings and even cause hostile acts to disrupt their planet and give them a hard time.\n\nOverall, this game has a huge option of things you can do, and there's even an observer mode to see how the solar system develops without your help. With such a wide variety of game options and situations, and- Oh, wait, I forgot! Quests exist in the game. These quests can have varying impacts on a race or two, such as secretly giving them spacefaring tech, improving their environmental state, doing joint-bombing runs with races against other races, or even saving freighters from pirates. There's still more to go over, but I'll stop it here, and end this review with a 10/10. This game is also constantly patched, so even if you dont play it for a month, the game may be much better by the time you play it again. Overall, its a very nice masterpiece.","June 8, 2014","true","48.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

To do this he has to gain credit and influence with each race by doing tasks for them. There is a lot of alien politics involved, and each race is quite different to the others, meaning the same approach doesn't work for all the races.\n\nThe game can be a bit hard to get into at first, as there's a lot of stuff suddenly being introduced at once. It can easily turn away some players, but I'd really recommend to keep playing, because eventually you get familiar with it all. The normal difficulty is pretty laid back and you have plenty of time to learn the ways and can afford to make mistakes.\n\nThe combat sections have you partake in a sort of bullet hell spaceship battle. They might seem pretty difficult at first, but again, they're actually a lot easier to grasp than they look. The battle is broken down into turns. You select where to go and which enemy to shoot at. The game then plays it out and you get to pick your next move. In addition to that, you can even change how much energy goes to your weapons, shields, and propulsion, as different situations require you to adjust it. For example, if you get swarmed and start to suffer damage - divert more energy to shields. If you need to take something out fast - divert it to the weapons. And so on.\n\nPerhaps what I liked the most was how well-developed the lore and background on each alien race was. Each of them has their own political agenda and attitude to you and the other races. Some are diplomats and peacekeepers, whilst others are very warlike and territorial. I've had a lot of fun learning about each race and their likes and dislikes.\n\nMusic in the game is also fantastic. Each race has its own unique theme music, which was a nice touch. The visuals are pretty simple though and a lot of the gameplay, particularly the political side of things, is text-based, whilst the combat looks like a regular space shooter. So that aspect might not appeal to some people. But don't let that put you off if you enjoy a good strategy and political intrigue.\n\nJust for those who are a bit unsure of how to start off and get going, here is some advice on methods that worked for me:\n\n1) Start off by giving space-faring tech to 2-3 races you find most trustworthy. Normally Andor, Skyllaxians, and Peltians are pretty reliable, though it is up to you! This will get you plenty of starting Credit and Influence early on.\n\n2) Start doing friendly tasks for those races and increase influence with them further. Cooperative Research is pretty good, as you can then gift this research to the other races and get free influence with them!\n\n3) Expanding Unused Area and Colonizing/Mining Moons is great for getting some quick Credit.\n\n4) Make sure to open up some Trade routes between the races you've allied with, so that they start to like each other as well (this is found in the Political page for each race, not in the Friendly Actions page).","January 30","true","14.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","9"

This game makes almost no sense to me.  Strategy seems a vague and ambitious term for this.  You do your own thing and influence other civilizations in the vaguest possible sense in order to accomplish the feat of you, the civilization that was destroyed, starting a federation of the remaining others to win the game.  You do this by being omniprescent through their development and literally nudging them in the direction you want.\n\nThe concept is interesting but the gameplay is slow and impotent in that decisions have very little impact on the civilization you are "manipulating" which gives very little differentiation in games.\n\nNow, that out of the way.  The battle.  You spend 80% of your time manipulating and 20% enjoying the hell out of excellent turn based strategy.\n\nThe interface is surprisingly intuitive and the perks/abilities actually make a difference in combat.  The strategy component is great, and aside from some short periods where you feel like you are grinding it really feels like the piece of this game that works.\n\nThat's the problem.  You have here a 1/2 great game here.  Bipolar in the worst of ways for a 4x, the strategy seems useless and the battles are great.  This is like the exact opposite of Endless Space, and there is going to be some people who love it, and others who don't.\n\nBottom line: buy it on sale if you want a varient rogue type 4x.

The game in it's current state isn't complete and you can feel  those kind of echos as you advance through various play-throughs. This feeling usually goes up as "how does helping X get me closer to Y or how can this impact relations with race A." Some of the newer patches make the game feel more complete and I really feel like the devs will keep making updates for this game.\n\nThe price is worth it in my opinion, you might be turned off at first by the fact that this is a 4X game where you control only a single person. This is why the game works, you feel like you ARE the last of an advanced race and that you ARE going to give fire to the other races. I really felt like It was my job to watch over these other races (most of the time) and the game seems balanced between being this merc and the actual race. You can't just nuke everyone off the galaxy (by yourself, any way.)\n\nAlliances work pretty well in this game. A certain race can give aid to other planets, another can dump toxic waste and disrupt  the economy, another can create deadly viruses and crash moons, and planets can even be destroyed. You can kill a Queen of a race, the senate of another, undermine a CEO's company, and kill the leading warlord in an honourable duel in order to get a better pull of that race decision making or to ruin their strength.\n\nCombat is a bit simplistic but works very well and I found myself enjoying the combat system. It does get easier as you get stronger and more experince, so you can turn up the combat difficuility without making the strategy harder. Or you can turn up the strategy part and turn down the combat to make for a more decision-making gameplay. This is a very cool feature and I wish more 4x games would have this.\n\nThe solar system is a bit small in my opinion, but gets VERY VERY packed later in the game. After very long games, I loose the ability to speed through time because my computer ran the game very slowly due to the mass population of the system. This is likely more of a reflection of my system and less of a reflection of the game itself; besides the HUGE amounts of populations later in game, the game is pretty smooth.\n\nRaces are diverse and unique, but seemingly are in small numbers. I would love to see more races that can appear in different games (or not appear.) Planets seem to be quasi-random and I notice that race locations vary among games. Events are random and I've never had a game play the same twice (some times a "bad guy" race and befriend a "good guy" race and literally form a fear empire, or "good guy" coalation can form a union of planets.) These alliances are your competition and can overpower the federation you are trying to create and kill you.\n\nI really enjoyed this game and I praise the devs for the presentation and deliverence of the product. I look forward to updates and more games by these creators.","May 10, 2014","true","24.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It takes hours just to kill one guy. And god help you if you want to challenge the burlusts (a race in this game that is all about war). Your fingers will die before the god damned enemy does. You could decrease the difficulty, but even on normal, it takes so damned long, and nothing damages you. Why even have a combat sequence at that point?\nOther than that, the simulation aspect is pretty in depth, though it definitely seems species other than the warlike ones need constant babysitting. if you have it accelerated to x2 fast forward, a race is going to get wiped out before you even see the ships.\nThe aspect of play, though, is unique. You play as something of an agent behind the scenes...except for whenever someone's getting attacked, because no one can defend themselves. You run around, and do diplomatic stuff. But, not too much, or else those you've united will form an alliance that's opposed to your federation...even though you were the one making them not kill eachother...yeah. I don't get it either.\nTalking about diplomacy: Each race has a drastically different diplomacy screens. So different you'd think they were from different games. And this would be fine if some of them weren't really clunky as hell. As mentioned above, if you want to talk with the burlusts, you have to commit to a 9 hour duel (as such, I almost always get everyone to gang up on them. they are such  pain in the ♥♥♥). And the Peltions and their damned vote system. So few things give votes, and that's the only thing that powers their diplomacy. You need 300 votes to get them into your federation....you get .5 after taking out an entire pirate camp. And as mentioned, combat is this game's weakpoint.\nSure it gives the races "flavor", or "personality" or whatever people call it now, but it sacrifices functionality.","November 27, 2014","true","22.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

As such your job is to first create the federation, and then persuade the eight races of the galaxy to join it.\nActually, it would be more prudent to say that your first job is to make the rest of the galaxy not hate you enough to actually listen to what you say :). You see, your character is an Hydral, a space-hydra that the game tells you subjugated the whole galaxy and basically made everyone cross with them on a level that made them exterminate the entire race, save yourself. And since the other races is as aware of this as you are (however repentant you may be) their general opinion of you will be colored by this the entire game.\n\nThe game switches between being a strategy game to being a turn based shooter in the same vein as critical mass, with focus on dodging enemy fire and proper weapon and ability management. For those who don't fancy this, an auto resolve function was recently added in, but aside from fights being somewhat repetetive the combat is a nice touch of thinky action that ends up feeling significant while taking up no more space than it has to.\n\nManagement of the different races opinion of you is key during the game. It starts out negative but can be altered to the positive through friendly actions, such as giving a race back the power of space flight, and altered to the negative again by doing things the race doesn't like, such as giving the power of space flight to a race they don't think should have it.\nThats the key challenge of the game, to keep building up influence by helping the races while trying not to burn bridges as you go.\n\nThe relations between you and the races however is only the one part of the puzzle. As you might expect, if helping different races can put you on the wrong foot with someone, then naturally that someone will probably not like that race autonomously of what you do. All the eight races will either with or witout your help eventually reach the stars, and when they arrive, they will start to develop relations to each other. Some races, like the peace loving Andor will often (but not always since every game can play out very differently) ally themselves with others enjoying peace, while more warlike beings like the Boarines will more likely attempt to conquer other races.\nThis is where you as the player comes in as someone who can make sure that the different demeanors a race is having will work for them and the final goal of a unified federation. For a federation to form the races must like each other enough to actually want to unify. They wont do it just because you ask them and as such the relations between races are just as important as the ones between them and the player.\n\nSo, how exactly do you make the races do what you want them to? Through the friendly and unfriendly actions mentioned before. The game provides you with a plethora of different ways to affect a race ranging from helping them research technology to improve living standards or military prowess to providing more hands on medical help if a planet is in plight. Doing actions like that will provide you with positive relationship points as well as power up the race in some way. But these are only examples of the positive actions. On the negative spectrum there are things you can do ranging between attacking the race head on to weaken them, to instigating coup or undermine the relations between different races -a needed tool as other foci of power can crop up to challenge your federation.\nThe actions will affect the different stats of the races and allow for you to guide a race to a higher power level than the others, make them ripe for conquest or just as a tool to make you more popular with them. And the popularity is needed for the last thing il talk about that allows you to suggest things to a race. Namely:\n\nThe actual governments of the race. Through them the player can suggest bigger changes than just the general assistance or misdeeds otherwise open as options and ask a race head on to do something for the player. A race can for example be asked to stop makin war on another race, or to focus their attention on getting their economy straight. It is also for the most part here that the player can ask a race to join or found the federation. This is where most of all the different quirks of a race is visible as the government they utilize differ greatly from one another. This demands the player to change the way they approach the races initially as some cannot be bribed and others require another set of in-game resources to allow you to suggest things for them to do. It also means that both before and during the time the race is part of the federation the skills they bring to the table allows for different ways to work around your enemies.\nThey can be acessed when you are popular enough for them to actually care for what you say but some actions require more popularity than others and these levels differ greatly from race to race.\n\nI dont know, this kinda went on, but the point is that if any of this sounded appealing to you, then the game is worth checking out. For what you get, 20 money is cheap and during any kind of sale it is a steal. The devs have been working full time on patching and adding to the game since launch and have so im told a reputation of doing so on all their games.\nIt is deap but easy to get into, hard to master and different every time. Combat and AI both feel like they are nailed down pretty good and the players choises are always at the center of the experience while they at the same time never take the cake from the eight races that act as both the pieces, the board and sometimes opponents in this game.\nI like it very much and recomend it heartily.\n","May 1, 2014","true","31.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

You take the role of lone spaceship, adrift in a system with 7 or so other races. One of them, selected at the start of the game has access to spacefaring tech and hates your guts and will stop at nothing to murder you. Your goal is to build relationships between races up to the point that they like eachother enough to ally with eachother. The complexity comes in the form of the fact that all the races work differently in political dealings. One of them responds to violence and little else. One is a race of absolute pacifists. Another is a collective of capitalist robots. All of these races have different political systems. Of course when said first race eventually takes up arms against you it's time to defend yourself. Your ship, at the start of the game atleast, is powerful enough to cripple large fleets, but if you don't spend time researching techs you'll swiftly find yourself dogpiled under vastly superior enemy ships.\n\nOverall a strong recommendation.\nProtip: Never anger the Thoraxians.","June 21, 2014","true","33.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The combat runs like Star Control's melee mode, only a bit more strategic. This was really entertaining at first, but then became a serious bore later on.\n+1 star for concept.

A lot of the dialogue and events really get a laugh. They did a good job there.\n\nMinuses\n-1 star for gameplay. It was interesting at first, but in the long run, I was bored. I think I spent an hour on maximum speed trying to get the last race to join the federation. Just got tedious trying to achieve the goals.\n-1 star for balance. even with the entire galaxy blockading/bombarding the murderous bug people from basically day 1, they still didn't die and would continue to send out fleets to attack the others' home planets.\n-1 star for size. The galaxy is really small. So small in fact that its really quite boring. it might have been more fun if the races could colonize other star systems and attempt to conquer the galaxy or something.

An interactive simulation in which your actions can have unimaginably large consequences and the options presented to you for dealing with the situation how you please are equally large.  Now, the vast majority of grand strategy games I have played achieve this level of complexity easily, but where their huge error lies is how alien and hard to grasp the concepts are to people with little experience in the genre.  This has actively prevented me from reaching that pinnacle of puppeteering the genre promises, but my hope for an accessible game with the same level of depth remained.\n\nThe Last Federation delivers on both fronts with remarkable ease, and in only 2 games I had become a manipulative master of the solar system, pushing races to my own ends and then watching as all of my hard work resulted in a lasting peace for all races still alive.  Your ability to influence the world is simply staggering, and yet, everything is presented in such a concise and understandable manner, you never feel overwhelmed as you poke and prod corners of the solar system.  The small skirmished your single ship partakes in are quick, brutal, and ultimately are done not for the militaristic advantages they provide, but the political ones, giving every single action you make significant meaning and ramifications.\n\nNothing in the game is trivialized and everything presented to you matters.  The moment to moment manipulation is exhilerating as powers rise and fall around you, both from your influence and simply the different views of the species clashing in a beautiful explosion of math.\n\nWatch people play the game.

You start as the lone survivor of a tyrannic race of hydrals (large hydras) in a solar system that has eight surviving races. They are all weary of you, some of them having led a destruction of your fellow hydrals. You retain a technology superiority throughtout the game, but because you play as a single ship, you must direct the course of the solar system by proxy, through a spectrum of diplomatic, political, and economic options (though admittedly, they are little more than number modifiers). The combat's effects are limited to earning credits, new ship equipment, and changing the races' opinions.\n\nI found the tactical combat fun for the first couple of hours, but not entertaining enough afterwards. Luckily, there's an effective auto-combat feature that lets you skip the combat.\n\nThe strategic gameplay is well-balanced and varied. In the last game that I finished, I unified the solar system by doing the following:\n\n1. Asked one planet to start trading economically with another, building goodwill.\n\n2. Asked another planet to start "lauding" another planet, building goodwill.\n\n3. Transferred technology to a third planet to buy influence and gain proxy votes in their planetary assembly. The three planets I worked on until now qualified to form the federation at this point.\n\n4. Built credits and influence, waiting for the fourth planet to develop its economy and technology enough that it changed from an isolationist society into an outward looking civilization amenable to joining the federation. The fourth planet joined.\n\n5. Kept dueling the leader of the warrior society planet until I built enough respect to browbeat them into joining the federation.\n\n6. Bought my way into having the sixth planet join, with a ton of credits.\n\n7. Asked half of the federation member planets to attack the seventh planet, the one that the game spawned as having destroyed the Hydrals. Their hatred of my player character had deteriorated too much for a diplomatic solution. The seventh planet was taken over by one of the federation planets.\n\n8. Destroyed the medical and environmental infrastructure of the eight planet, while having the federation planets wage war on the planet. They lasted a while before finally succumbing to the federation.\n\n9. The game ended, and I enjoyed a really nice song to accompany the ending screen.\n\nI can't remember ever playing a game like this with such a varied approach for all the races. The fact that the scope of the game was limited to a single solar system where all the races resided helped, as opposed to a traditional 4x space strategy game where the numbers often got bloated. It's not a game I would play repeatedly, but I enjoyed the two days I spent with it.","August 4, 2014","true","15.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Interesting races and interactions. The combat is fun to play and strategic enough to keep you interested. Personally I didn't like the humor that much, at some points it was a dull but mostly the game is serious enough.\n\nThere are some issues with the game not really "putting" you in strategic situations which easily results in very simplified stat grinding instead of actually doing the whole strategy game thing. If you are willing to spend some time thinking and planning on more sadistic things, this game offers A LOT of depth.\n\nAlso in the beginning I didn't quite understand the concept of time in it. I felt like I had to hurry (because of how quickly some races ascend to space), but in actuality you have a lot of time to perform your actions. Putting 12-24 months in to tech research for example is only a fraction of time you will, eventually, spend in converting races. I would have preferred non-realtime related numbers for things. E.g. Relative time of 10 minutes for someone's ascension feels like you seriously have to hurry things up when infact it's a very long long time in game.\n\nAll in all, I do highly recommend this!\n\nAt least after 5 hours this feels like Master of Orion on a smaller scale and as an agent and not an empire which is really cool experience.","April 23, 2014","true","6.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You see, for a game where you supposedly work from the shadows to shape the world order you want, your most effective actions by far are the most direct ones. Unless you play as a pacifist, it's incredibly easy to just buff the races you want with technology and massive fleets, and eliminate the troublesome races. You can tell a race to produce fleets twice as fast, and then sit at their planet while adding literally a 20x modifier on top of that. Then when they go to invade the race you tell them to, you singlehandedly wreck the opposing armadas and then commit genocide by nuking the planet from orbit. It's beyond ridiculously overpowered, it's broken. Maybe the Invasion mode from the first DLC works better due to being combat-focused, but most ways to play the standard Federation mode are rendered incredibly easy if you use the direct methods. Serious rebalancing is needed to make it into the shadowy cabal-simulator it's made out to be, but in lieu of that, just removing the armada construction option and the orbital bombardment would go a long way towards making the game more challenging.","May 23","true","74.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Solid enough to eat up my entire Sunday. That's right - the 7.9 hours it's talking about up there was one glorious day. Why? Because this is Shadow Broker: The Video Game.\n\nI'm in the end stages of my first playthrough, and it was on Easy because I wanted to sandbox it a bit. Just play with the systems, and see what happens when I kick them in the head. It's important to note: Combat Difficulty has a HUGE effect on the Strategic game - it is basically a measure of how much you yourself can influence. At the easier levels, you can make certain races completely bow before you, which is game-breaking. Bear in mind - most Arcen Games consider "Normal" their Easy difficulty.\n\nThe game boils down to making numbers on a spreadsheet work the way you want them to, but the flavor of what they put on top is wonderful. All 7 races have their own feel to them, and have to be negotiated with in different ways. On harder difficulties, I can see the game doing a wonderful job of making you feel small in the combat, but I am willing to bet that a savvy player can still feel very large indeed on the galactic scale.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that the interface still has some... personality to it. I'm never quite sure I've done my targetting orders correctly in combat, and I feel like there are still some things that are hidden in the back end that I can't find. The strategic map still seems to have some problems when there are a lot of armadas late game, causing the frame rate to slip.

Very poorly executed.\n\nReally enjoyed the start of the game, and the combat, but nothing is well explained, and the tutorials are frankly pretty confusing. My main issue is that I'd spend a bunch of time building up relations between two empires, only to have them form an "anti-federation alliance" before I get a chance to form any kind of federation, despite the tutorial saying they'd only do that AFTER you formed a federation. Sounds like a glitch, but maybe I just missed something?\n\nOn a more meta level, the game doesn't seem to know if it wants to be a spreadsheet simulator, or a bullethell space game. The devs took the middle road of just using the worst features from both genres and making a sub-par game in both genres.\n\nBullet Hell:\nThe bullethell ship-battles are much too busy and convoluted, and none of the abilities seem to have much impact, even on ultra-easy mode. Having to switch between anti-shield and anti-ship is cool, but it's impossible to tell what are fighters and what are missiles, or what team any ship is on. Dodging attacks isn't really even an option with all the chaos going on in a large battle, so you just have to hope your shields are up to the task.\n\nThe 4x style management sim is even more bland and confusing. Every task you attempt takes months to have any meaningful impact, locking you in one place while you fast-forward through tons of war and politics and have to just cross your fingers that the galaxy hasn't imploded while you were collecting space debris. On top of this, every single empire seems to have a different method of interacting with the player, none of which are explained at all. Mechanics like the diplomat seem to serve no purpose at all except to make you click a spot in the menu every time you meet an empire, since there doesn't seem to be any downside to having them and they're essentially free to purchase. There are quests, but I was never able to figure out how to actually go do them, since visiting the relevant planet never made them turn up in menus.\n\nI'd recommend not wasting your money on this lemon.","February 16","false","4.6"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

The Last Federation is a game with a lot to offer, but feels as though it needs more patches to become what it really should. At present it swings between ridiculously easy (use the Acutians to dump toxic waste on some planets, murdering all but a million people there and bam, no more enemies) and absurdly hard/grindy (fight AFA insurgents on the highest difficulty, spend thirty-odd minutes fighting a tiresome, repetitive battle.).\n\nThe core concept is excellent, and the gameplay starts out good, but it's simply not well balanced. AI War's brilliance was in that the more you did the harder the enemies became to defeat. Conversely, TLF doesn't have some form of inherent balancing beyond the formation of non-Federation empires, which are easily defeated by using the native abilities of your Federation allies even if you decide to simply never engage in combat.\n\nWhere the game is enjoyable and clever, it's easy. Where it's hard, it's boring. Combat is so tiresome I've gone from playing on the highest difficulty to the second-highest to the lowest, simply because spending all my time carefully observing projectiles and maneuvering around them while staying just in range of an enemy ship, kiting it down and eventually blowing it up and repeating the process thirty or forty times is unenjoyable. While just clicking through combat until I win isn't stimulating, it's not any more boring than regular combat.\n\nDespite all this, The Last Federation is a game with a tremendous amount of potential. The numbers need to be better balanced - it's too hard to impact some stats, and too easy to impact others, and some options are simply useless compared to others, but after a few patches, I believe it'll be a game well worth playing.","April 22, 2014","true","36.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Since it was on sale though, I decided to give it a shot, and was immediately surprised by how inuitive a lot of the aspects of the game were, but also how impressive the tutorial was(Perhaps a little too hand holdy for my taste, but definitely did a good job of teaching what was going on).\n\nFor a strategy game, the difficulty was probably just about right for my tastes, with a learning curve that was not too punishing, but still required you to master most of the game to get a perfect win on normal.  What I was not expecting however was the storytelling that the game managed to do, and while much of the story is determined by your own actions(and very much read between the lines subtle in a few spots), the setup and the closure was extremely good.\n\nReplay value is a /little/ questionable, but that is more of a personal taste thing.  I felt the only weak points were in that department, and largely a consequence of the player's effect on the game being pretty Illuminati-ish.  Instead of the player taking immediate actions that had dramatic immediate effects, the most effective impacts are from long drawn out planning that typically leads to the same roads (dealing with the warmongering races typically boils down to crippling them by destroying their world's ability to make effective war, or by setting them against each other, and tipping the scale occasionally to be sure neither side ever comes out on top for instance).\n\nI'd still give the game an arbitary 9/10, especially if you can pick it up on a sale, and enjoy turn based(this is "real time" in a lot of ways, but very much meant to be played with a lot of pausing) strategy, sci fi, abstract gameplay, or a combination of all three.","December 4, 2014","true","32.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are different kinds of weaponry, and each race gets it's own unique ship with different abilities and weapons.

I'll give you choice of checking out my Let's Play, or, further down, my written review.  Something, for everybody!  :)\n\nPlease be aware that I started this LP BLIND:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-pJ_N8ws5o\n\nA quick word about Arcen Games in general.\n\nI saw this game was being made while I was working on my Bionic Dues Let's Play.  I was already a fan of the work Arcen Games does by this point and I followed the development.  When I finally got my hands on The Last Federation I was super eager to jump in and just take over the galaxy.  Something you'll learn over time, with Arcen, you never jump in and just take over anything.  Arcen has a way of adding a million things to games that you have to absorb, learn, and take care of.  I won't lie, it's a pretty daunting task.  If you don't hunker down and commit to playing their games in full, you'll miss out on some fantastic games.  My final word about Arcen is that they don't just make games and move on, they continue to work on them, add to them, and improve them.  It may sound like I am drinking the Arcen Koolaid, but I feel GOOD developers don't get enough credit.  My proof would be A.I. War: Fleet Command was made in 2009, even in 2014 they released yet another DLC/Update.  :)\n\nNow onto the actual review for the game!\n\nI'm a sucker for Turn-based Strategy games, it's no secret.  Having seen The Last Federation in development I was eager and excited to check it out.  You are the last of your kind, the dominant species in the galaxy, the Hydral.  Your race was a cruel one, the dictators of the galaxy.  Unfortunately for them, they sort of got obliterated.  You allowed yourself to be captured and bided your time.  Finally, you decide it's time to break out and save the galaxy from itself.  You steal a highly advanced prototype ship and, after your escape, you start to shape and mold the galaxy.  The game isn't all about fighting, it's about strategizing, diplomacy, and alliances.  There are 8 races of aliens in total, each with unique strengths, weakness, characteristics, and governments.  Your ultimate goal is to create a federation, or alliance with all the races.  Unfortunately, not everyone likes everyone else.  To add fuel to the fire, the race you stole your ship and escaped from, don't like you very much.  Make your Federation and all who refuse to join you must be eliminated.  You have to convince your allies to take them down!\n\nThe turn-based combat is very well done.  It's turn-based combat, but more like simultaneous turn-based combat.  You choose where you wish to move, which weapon or "Special Attack/Operation" you want to use, and who you want to target.  Many enemies have shields, or heavy armor, and you have to use the correct weapon for the job, changing as shields go down, or a swarm of small fighters are deployed.  You have multiple targetting solutions as well.  You can fire at anything in range, focus fire, fire at a direct point, or not shoot at all.  Choosing the right weapon, in the right situation, while manuevering in the right place is the key to success.  In addition you can choose to divert power more to your engines, guns, or shields to maximize their effect.  Special Attacks or Operations play another big role in combat.  Operations allow you deploy extra ships to fight for you.  They range from tiny fighters, to lance weilding heavy ships.  Your special attacks can be as simple as jettisoning garbage to blow up incoming projectiles, to hitting your afterburner to give you a few turns of extra movement and speed, to cloaking.\n\nWhile you can't directly eliminate anyone, you still have all the power.  The game's diplomacy system and how many different ways you can and NEED to influence is second to none.  You can build up your relationship with a race by helping eliminate pirates, researching technology, assist in building a space station, building up their economy and tons of other ways.  Additionally, you can cripple your enemies by more or less doing the reverse of those very things.  Claiming a space station from an enemy and giving it to an ally to boost their production is one of my favorites.  You can go beyond that, gaining voting proxies with their government, dueling a warlord to unseat him from rule, damaging the reputation with another race,  even planting false evidence.\n\nThe Last Federation has a ton to do and it's quite challenging.  Often times your best laid plans get waylaid and you must  adapt and change how you wish to arrive at your ultimate goal.  From beginning to end the game pulls you in, gives you more and more stuff to keep track of and will leave you scratching your head on more than one occasion.  How do I get Aliens A to not want to murder Aliens B, but go to war with Aliens C?  When you finally succeed you'll feel like you accomplished the impossible and you very well may have.  There are plenty of different difficulty settings, including ironman mode and permadeath.  If all of that hasn't convinced you, the comical writing and voice acting brings it all together.\n\nThe only thing I would have considered a con is a personal preference.  One that, amazingly enough, was addressed in one of the DLCs of this game.  I wanted to be able to be my own faction and take over the galaxy myself.  Forget the federation of happy aliens living in harmony.  I wanted to be in the Federation of ME!  :D  As I said, the DLC Betrayed Hope did exactly that and more!\n\nSpeaking of DLC, there are two out right now.  Betrayed Hope and The Lost Technologies.  Each DLC brings it's own share of updates, upgrades and unique things to the game.  Not to mention their own game modes.\n\nSo, in summation:  I highly recommend The Last Federation.  It has fantastic writing, fun combat, amazing depth in how you can effect the galaxy, an outstanding, deep, and rich diplomacy system, and tons of choices on how you want to play.  In addition, it is an Arcen Games product, so you know they are going to keep working on it, supporting it, and improving on it.  YES!  BUY!  NOW!","January 6","true","21.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","7","12","2","0"

In a way it is a bit like Drox Operative, the AI gets to play a 4x game, but you play something different, an agent that only influences their game.\n\nIf you've played Crusader Kings and disliked the fact that you couldn't just force your ruler to kill whatever heir he wanted to or declare war on whatever country you wanted to, this game isn't for you.  If you like the idea of working from the shadows and nudging others behavior to do exactly what you want, this is great fun.\n\nI'll share my favorite experience of what I've played so far:  I was still trying to get my feet under me and I decided to try to steal some tech from the robootic capitalists.  Now in doing so I ended up obliterating their fleet.  I was pleased with myself at first until I saw one of the other races jump at the undefended opportunity and assault them with their fleet.  Now this attacking race was not one I wanted to have a terrotorial lead, so I intervened and destroyed their fleet, severely damaging my reputation with them.  Then another "bad guy" race attacked the planet, forcing me to intervene again.  Then the hive-mind race attacked.... Eventually I had effectively pushed a huge "reset button" and reduced most other races fleets into rubble.  The people I had stolen the tech from were safe.  Of course now half of the system hated my guts for playing galaxy police.  At first I was a bit frustrated with the game because of this, then I really appreciated the story that had just unfolded as I basically repeated the mistakes of my in-game species all over again.\n\nWasn't the reason I was building the Federation to stop these kind of things from occuring?\n\nCongratulations Arcen Games, your game worked!","September 27, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The launch videos for it made me lose interest, but watching TB's "WTF Is..." of this game made me want to buy it. I was not disappointed. The game has replayability in that you can try and 'win' it in several different ways, so there's still reason to play it after beating it. It may not be the best replayability. I suspect few people will rack up 100+ hours of game time, but few games can claim that they can.\n\nOverall, the game is a fairly unique concept (I've not even heard of a game like this before, but I'm not exactly winning trivia pursuit matches either), and executes it fairly well.

Beyond that, the gameplay and AI diplomacy on the system map is as finely crafted as anything else I can think of.\n\nTurn-based combat is much more fluid in practice than it sounds like, and it can often be a spectacular visual riot of shots blasting in assorted patterns, and being able to wisely choose a path and speed of each segment of movement makes a big difference in how much damage you take.","July 6, 2015","true","117.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't think of anything else quite like it.  Drox Operative is possibly the closest, but that's only in concept.  In gameplay they're very different.  If you're getting down far enough to be reading my review you should already have an idea what this game is about.  Last member of an advanced race trying to have your way with the galaxy.\n\nThe mix of turn based and real time gameplay is well done.  I would have liked more customizing options for your own ship.  Hardpoints for weapons, maybe.  Some way to have more than a lone weapon able to shoot each "turn."  Better options for making a carrier like ship as well.  Fighters and the like fire out of your ship in a large group like spokes on a bike and are handled more like a ability or "spell" than launching strike craft for strategic missions.

Space Rangers and Drox Opertive both have the same "rouge operative in a 4x universe" gameplay - and they both execute on the idea in superior ways. Also note that this is not a sandbox or open-ended game – it has a very specific goal and nothing really to do but work for that goal.\n\n2) The "strategy” part: There is only 1 solar system and 8 planets. That is it. No exploration, no undeveloped planets, nothing to find.  Make sure you understand that. One single very small, crowded solar system is all there is to play in.  The gameplay revolves around running the same missions over and over to gain favor. The upgrades are very few and not impressive. You can’t get allies to give you tech, so if you want it you have to find someone without it and research it with them or, often, steal it from you allies. (edit: I understand this and other things are being patched in, but this is not an early access game and I’m going to judge the game I’m playing as it was sold and not what it might be in 6 months.) All in all, there is little or no grand “strategy” to be had.\n\n3) Turn-based bullet-hell. The trick to a good SHMUP is control and the ship controls like a giant brick with a ton of inertia. More realistic maybe – but not conducive to dodging millions of bullets. Your abilities, heath, shield and ammo all automatically regenerate at the end of combat so there is not much depth to the “tactical” part. Actually calling this “tactical” seems disingenuous. Making something turn based does not make it tactical. It makes me really miss the turn-based fighting in Space Rangers.\n\n4) Simulation: Charts galore. Stats that influence nothing! It’s an amazing collection of information that is ultimately pointless as several other reviews have pointed out.  Super-deep political and economic simulations are great, but since gameplay basically boils down to influence and bribery the effect of those simulations are negligible at best.  The races are very different, but you use the same tactics on each one of them (i.e. running the same missions over and over for influence) so it doesn’t matter if you are doing it for space chickens or capitalist robots.  Also, I have run the simulation in observer mode and it just seems to end up in stalemate after stalemate. Not sure the A.I. is up to actually winning, but it’s great at providing endless conflict. I’ve seen planets be under “attack” for decades with nothing, literally nothing else happening in the universe. Also note that you will never just be “attacked” unless I missed something the only fights you will ever get in are the “missions” you choose to go on.\n\nI know I have not played for 1,000 hours – and I would never review a true 4x game with this little time under my belt. But let me assure you that the few hours I’ve had are enough to show me how shallow this dish is. The scope of the game is so narrow and confined that everything just feels arbitrary and repetitive. Maybe with a great deal of work this could be fun – there is a foundation to build something great here; but this is not that great game. One of the few games I wish I did not purchase.","April 22, 2014","false","6.0"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","2"

It's like a terrible movie that you just want to end already.  The combat mode is derived from the 80's arcade Asteroid, only in the 1980's arcade you are in complete control of you vessel. In this stupid game you plot a corse, select a target, a weapon and that's it. That is as interactive and exciting as this game gets. 17 hours of play is shown because I was litteraly bored to sleep by this game. The rest of the game is trying to create a federation out of 5 different factions. This might be cool if the federation factions did anything by themselves but they don't. Getting a faction to join your federation doesn't help you at all, it just makes it so they won't hurt you anymore. Regardless of how lopsided you make the power base, they will not destroy their enemies un-aided. In a normal dificulty game I united the entire solar system except one faction who had one already weak world. Although hundreds if not thousands of times more powerful, my federation could not defeat the only enemy left in combat by themselves. This is because while they are your enemies they are tought, when they are allies they do absolutely nothing in combat. No joke, they do nothing. They never shoot, they never move. The only thing they do is catch a stray round every now and again. Half of the abilities and skills in combat mode do nothing, you click the button, the screen shows that you have used the skill, but takes no effect. This utter waste of time and money gets a 0 out of ten points from me as it has 0 redeaming qualities.

That said, it is a great stratagy game where creative problem solving is the order of the day, and if you like games that develop stories... I mean... (removed for spoilers, suffice to say crazy stuff happens and it's fun! Think your way through problems and explore all the menus to find interesting but difficult solutions to problems! The less you know, the better.)\n\nAs a sidenote, discard others opinions of strategy, everyone is going to play it differently and that'll effect how the game plays immencely. For example, I've been told that technology is useless, but I godmode myself by hoarding technology all the time until I can single handedly apply peace through superior firepower, it really does seem like any and all playstyles can be viable if you think it through well enough... and hoping something embarrassing doesn't happen to ruin your day. Always have a backup plan! Eggs and baskets and all that.\n\n[edit] Oh, and the game boasts about it's spectator mode and how it's even fun to watch? It's not, thoraxians win every time unless disease stops them, and nothing ever happens, empires don't do any diplomacy or trade or special attacks or anything with eachother, ever, unless you tell them to. I think it's telling that they remove the double speed option and replace it with super and ultra fast forward only, and that you have to click and hold instead of it being a toggle like in other modes.","March 20, 2015","true","26.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Your job is to kill just the right butterflies so that the universe walks into your goal scenario.\n\nAlong the way you get to play a number of turn based bullet dodging missions in order to accomplish your objectives.\n\nThis is not any sort of combat simulation, some ships just spray bullets into space in beautiful patterns.\nYour guns aren't really upgradable, even though you have choices - a rock, paper, scissors style damage system.\n\nThis game is not a 4x.\nThere is no unknown area to Explore.\nYour control cannot expand.\nYou do not own any resources to exploit.\nAnd while you have a ship, the closest you can get to exterminate is taking special actions to reduce the population of a planet.\n\nWhat you do have is influence, spent in marvelously different ways for each 'race'.\nThis game is basically the diplomacy screen from a normal 4x fleshed out into a full game.\n\nIt's brilliant, but it's not for everybody.

It has a lot of interesting features but the overall result is that those features could have been handled in a better way.\n\nThe first and most horrible turn off for me in this game is the amount of information this game gives : Whoa ! I never saw  so much information in a game. From the planet info to the history log, this is too much for me to enjoy playing. It's like I spend most of my time reading instead of actually playing the game...\nWhat's more, a lot of those information are not really needed and as many others already said, the game just requires you to make friends with who you want and do missions for them.\n\nWhich makes me come to my second point : Too repetitive. When I saw the battles were in real time, I thought it was a really interesting game but after going throught dozens of battles, well it got quite boring. Just move and choose the weapon and let the game do the rest. Yeah, it includes some strategy but battles are such a mess that most of the time, it'll be more like a rock-paper-scissor battle, just find the good weapon and avoid missiles. I thought there would be more customization for the weapon like the ability to purchase and evolve your ship parts, but what we have just make it the same whatever weapon you use. And being interrupted each second to give orders is rather annoying.\n\nAnother small point that annoys me is the UI. I don't know why but I feel like the UI is not clean, the typo is not easy to read and the information display ticks me off, like it's not at the level it should be for a game worth 20$. But maybe it's just me.\n\nAll those points together makes it a no for me. If you enjoy space strategy games, I'd rather recommend other games (such as Endless Space which is a must have for me).","May 16, 2014","false","2.3"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

There might as well be no graphics, because they don't really do anything.  If you turn the music off, most of the time you get dead silence.  You constantly stare at a Universe Scale map.  There is no colinization, or anything else associated with real stratagy.  And you have special god like powers.  You can completely alter the four key, "game elements", by just saying please change this.  It really boils down to running from one of 7 planets and affecting those 4 key elements.  The tech tree seems irrelevent, and like I said it's all really just numbers, there is no real graphics to this game.  One exception.  There is a completely unfleshed out 2D space combat game mixed in.  But that just turns into a much cooler version of a 1980's arcade game called astroids.  With special gimicks you get to throw out a limited number of times.  Again, maybe I don't get this game, but to me, I'd rather play monopoly or sorry with my little kids, than this game.

While patch 1.002 fixes a few, there are still many issues that need to be fixed. The Last Federation scores points for trying to put a different spin on the 4x / strategy genre but the execution has been pretty craptastic. This game was rushed out the door with serious issues such as: AI not initiating ground combat, Numerous typos like "Peacekeeers", Missing diplomacy options (Boarines have no option to join the Federation even with a Solar Unity regent), Broken special weapons, but I'll just leave it at that. A lot of this game just dosen't work, or has been band-aided to kinda work.\n\nStill considering buying it? I suggest waiting until they release about a years worth of patches before jumping in or wait until it's on sale for $5.99. Otherwise welcome to paid beta.\n\nThis game takes "Indie Game Sloppy" to the next level.

What makes it different from the other 4X games is the fact that you don't have any direct control over the 8 races of the game, and can instead only prod them in the direction you want them to go.  Also, the goal of the game is peace, not war, which significantly changes the strategy, and puts an emphasis on diplomacy and influence. The turn based combat is the weak point of the game, since it gets very bland and repetitive quickly. Luckily they implemented an auto-resolve feature to get out of it.

With turn based gameplay, no less!\n\nTo clarify, the ship to ship combat is turn-based, while the strategic map can pause to show the state of the entire galaxy in one fraction of a second, or can skip many months in a minute, dependant upon the players wishes.\n\nThe main basis of the gameplay is that you play an unaligned mercenary piloting a stolen ship, aiming to herd 8 warring intergalactic factions into a galactic Federation (one of whom is somewhat perturbed, as you nick your ship off them in the first place). The races seem perfectly content to squabble among themselves for all eternity, and take a very apparent glee in making your job all the more difficult.\n\nIn terms of accessibility to levels of player dedication (and patience), it is varied in difficulty. The easiest difficulty still provides just enough challenge that your tactics will adapt beyond your comfort zone, allowing new 4X empire builders a campaign-length sandbox to test their strategies in, whilst the toughest difficulty is, I would presume, challenging enough for even a master of turn-based space combat.\n\nI would not be able to say too much more about Hardest difficulty, as I can barely get past the tutorial level on it.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like the idea of a text-heavy 4X political strategy game with a refreshing turn-based top-down spacecraft shooter with dakka levels set to optimum, then look no further than this game.\n\nIf, however, you are attached to your retinas, then better luck elsewhere (those myriad bullets, shells and lasers dotting the screen can give some wicked migraines if you look too closely to the screen).","December 18, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seemed simplistic at first and fairly basic. The combat seemed laughable, being you play as a super ship in a galaxy of space faring noobs. Yet just as I was about to give up on the game, it got interesting. It also revealed the game is harder than it first looks. Get past the first hour and suddenly you're trying to juggle a half dozen alien races. Helping one annoys the rest, which is a problem since your goal is to unite the galaxy in a federation, which doesn't work as long as you have enemies.\n\nSurprisingly hard to put down once I've started playing. It's not really like anything else I've played, which is a good thing.","September 22, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead, you are trying to convince every other civilization to form together into one Federation.

A little sabotage, some planted false evidence, and a couple of false flag operations can drive a wedge between enemies, leaving them open to manipulation by you.\nFinally, for those utter recalcitrant races, you can just arrange to have them killed off.\n\nThe game is simple in concept (make everyone friendly with each other) but deep in possibility, as you have many options to accomplish your goals.  The learning curve is somewhat steep, but there is a lively and friendly community able to help.\nOverall, an unusual game with an enjoyable premise and interesting mechanics.

Prepare to get tutorials thrown at you scattered along the first 2 hours.\n\nBut after that, it really starts to shine. The game gives you tons of options, and you are going to need them. Basically, you have the incredibly hard task of uniting a universe that would otherwise destroy itself. The alien races all act differently, which often  leads to them fighting (mostly over minor stuff. E.g. "They eat food we don't like. Thus we don't like them." Just like real life).\nHowever, apart from the well executed strategy part which is a realtime/turnbased hybrid thing (every action you perform costs a certain amount of time) there is the combat system, which takes a little time to get used to but is great fun after that. It's like a bullethell game, but with frequent pauses to give the next comand.\n\nSo if you like strategy games of any kind and have a lot of time mastering the games mechanics I'd say it's defenetly whorth the pricetag.\n\n(Note: The game is entirely in English...)","August 10, 2014","true","29.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seemed like some approaches were not actually feasible, which was made even more egregious by the fact that there were achievements for them. Like "win a game with only one race in the federation" for each race.\n\nChanges have made that kind of thing more viable.\n\nI kind of knew going in that it had problems, but I felt it was a concept worth endorsing. A kind of strategy game where you don't control armies, but make suggestions and take specific actions. I'd like to say "and you don't have much impact", but when you can convince one race to strap rockets to a moon and send it crashing into another race's homeworld, destroying the planet utterly? That is making a pretty significant impact. In a literal and figurative manner.\n\nHow you interact with each race is a little different. Sometimes you deal with a democractic society. In those situations you might bribe individuals or make speeches for or against parties. Some civilizations have an insect queen, so you bribe them with tasty food in order to have them mood swing to something that suits your purposes better. Sometimes you'll kill their leaders. One race will respect you more if you do that. One race consists entirely of corporations. So you can help the corporations that do the things you like get into power by helping them construct buildings.\n\nThe setting is creative, and the writting is pretty good too. There is little voice acting, most of which takes the form of your ships computer, whom I kind of love. Lots of personality. If I was the last member of a tyranical alien race I think I'd want an onboard self aware computer a lot like that too.\n\nWhat makes this game interesting is the way you approach diplomacy. You have a goal, in forming an interplantary federation. Several alien races working together. But how you manage that is pretty open ended. You don't have to be a nice guy about it. I for one am having a bit too much fun getting those "win a game with only one race left" achievements. See, you can't actually form a federation unless at least two races like each other. Which means one of them has to die. And the best way to ensure that happens is to influence another race to betray them. And then help the remaining race in your federation commit genocide on planatary scales.\n\nYou can also try and do things in a less transparently malevolent fashion. And I feel that's kind of the way you're supposed to do it. But at the same time there's something kind of awesome about forming an alliance out of literal capitalist robots, a race that is so death metal that they like you MORE when you defeat their leaders in personal duels and sell the pilots you "rescue" into slavery, and insects that eat everything ruled by hive queens that undergo constant mood swings.\n\nThat one is actually pretty tricky because they can decide they're better off without you, and kick you out of your own federation you formed. But figuring out some kind of strategy is why it's fun.","May 23, 2014","true","100.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a very unique concept which puts diplomacy front and center, unlike being just a build up to war or a way to temporarily postpone war  like it is in most other games. The way this is achieved is to make the player themselves very weak. Even though you almost literally play a god in this game, ironically, I've almost never felt so powerless as I did here. Which makes sense because you are trying to manipulate intelligent beings so they shouldn't be just putty in your hands.\n\nThe space combat section is fun and almost could be a whole seperate game in itself. It   gives you the often welcome illusion that you are actually able to accomplish something very meaningful. quickly  But ultimately even blowing up a few ships yourself  won't do much  to alter the balance of power so be very careful who you ♥♥♥♥ off.

The staggered tutorial does an excellent job of making it easy to understand the mechanics and how the different races act and interact, and there's still a lot of depth to play in. Fairly short compared to a lot of other strategy games (eight planets, with no breakdown of area beneath "planet"), but there's a high replayability factor from trying different approaches and having different races be "first landing". As others have noted, you're a lone diplomat in this one - all your efforts are through diplomacy, but that will sometimes be gunboat-flavoured.\n\nThe Betrayal gamemode DLC doesn't have a lot of replay to it (you're out to paint the map) but *is* rather cathartic after having to deal with bickering races doing stupid things and adds some fun planet-management mechanics. Certainly the closest to classic strategy games.\n\nInvasion (the other DLC gamemode) is interesting, as whilst it's relatively easy to get the various races to agree to attack The Deadly Invaders™ the difficulty really lies in having them be strong enough to win, and agree to help protect each other. The resulting Federation, though, feels probably the most natural all-races one of them all.\n\nHighly recommend playing, especially if you can pick it up on sale.","February 14","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of playing as one of the competing alien races, you play as the king maker. Your goal is to influence all races into joining a peaceful coalition (and to elimate those who won't cooperate). You have to influence, cajole, or black mail each race to get your way. The starting planet for each race is randomized, so every game is different.\n\nAlso, the continued support of Arcen games is astounding. The game was good at launch, but they keep adding more and more features with every patch. If only every developer was dedicated to their games this much after launch.","September 24, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's approachable and has very unique gameplay, with political/large-scale decisions playing out in an FTL-style time system and combat being turn-based bullet hell. The soundtrack is catchy and amplifies the situations you find yourself in, with an appealing user interface that gives you a good amount of immediate feedback. My only gripe is that the Betrayed Hope and Lost Technologies DLCs are basically required to give the game good depth and replayability.\n\nIt's a very niche, love-it-or-hate-it type of game, but it's worth a try...if they ever get around to releasing a demo.","December 27, 2015","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went through it and modernized it on our website and wanted to post it here for everyone to enjoy. This is will be a brief overview of the review and you can read the full, in-depth version here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/the-last-federation-overview-and-review/\n\nThe Last Federation is a feature packed and sometimes daunting strategy game. It's combat system utilizes a unique turn based system where you must plot your ships course while avoiding enemy fire, this is easier said than done when your battles often look like bullet hell games.\n\nThere's tons of technologies to acquire, multiple difficulty levels, quite a few game modes to choose from and lots of ships to pilot. It's a very solid strategy game that's sure to please strategy fans. We gave the game a 9/10 when we first covered it.","December 9, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're required to juggle & consider 8 different races on your goal of unifying the solar system. There are large scale tactical options to make, & a real depth to the interactions that diplomacy in most other strategy games fall short on. Recommended to anyone looking for something unique in the genre.","February 14","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/euanreid/recommended/273070/","euanreid","Euan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/euanreid/","312 products in account","Very fun little game. The staggered tutorial does an excellent job of making it easy to understand the mechanics and how the different races act and interact, and there's still a lot of depth to play in. Fairly short compared to a lot of other strategy games (eight planets, with no breakdown of area beneath "planet"), but there's a high replayability factor from trying different approaches and having different races be "first landing". As others have noted, you're a lone diplomat in this one - all your efforts are through diplomacy, but that will sometimes be gunboat-flavoured.\n\nThe Betrayal gamemode DLC doesn't have a lot of replay to it (you're out to paint the map) but *is* rather cathartic after having to deal with bickering races doing stupid things and adds some fun planet-management mechanics. Certainly the closest to classic strategy games.\n\nInvasion (the other DLC gamemode) is interesting, as whilst it's relatively easy to get the various races to agree to attack The Deadly Invaders™ the difficulty really lies in having them be strong enough to win, and agree to help protect each other. The resulting Federation, though, feels probably the most natural all-races one of them all.\n\nHighly recommend playing, especially if you can pick it up on sale.","February 14","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtgibson/recommended/273070/","jtgibson","jtgibson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtgibson/","820 products in account","About halfway through the game, you will most likely already know whether you've won or not.  This means that the late game can result in a lot of tedium where it feels as though you are simply mopping up.  However, getting to that point is one hell of a lot of fun, and there are enough surprises along the way to keep even the late game interesting.\n\nArcen do claim that you should use the fast forward often and as much as possible, but for me I've found that this is usually suicidal.  The problem with the interface is that it tends to be moderate-to-long periods of tedium interspersed with sudden and astounding events that suddenly change the game world to such an extent that it isn't possible to avoid; more work should have gone into a system that allows interruptions of "dispatches" when various events occur.  Pair that with the fact that some things you do will have absolutely no consequence (e.g., after I wiped out a five-armada Burlust invasion of the Evuck homeworld, somehow the Burlusts still instantly conquered the planet) and the game can be an exercise in frustration.\n\nBut what an exercise!  If you look past its small faults, you'll find a lot to love.","July 3, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Never use quick start\nReason: The tutorial in my opinion is terrible. It hinders the player a lot. It locks the key element of the game away: the Federation progress button. The information with in this button should be available at the start of the tutorial and then lead from there. Also the space battle tutorial is needs to be all at once not spoon feed to the player. There is not much to it. The ship has 3 main guns, 6 abilities, and power distribution to weapons, shields, and thrusters. Later you can swap out guns and abilities later in the game. That is very simple and that is the compressed version.\n\nMy opinion on the game: (Note: I’ve only played on normal difficulty and 15 hours)\n\nThere is a lot of waiting in this game and can snowball out of control if you don’t watch the relation races have with each other. Winning is really simple start the federation with one of the more war faring races and make them super strong and make them angry with the other races. Winning with all the races is the challenge and the problem. I’ll put it simply there is no reward nor reason for the player to do this other than bragging rights. There is nothing that makes me, the player, want to bring these races together other than the opening cut scene and I kind of wish there was more. So that lead me to say 5/10. Yes I skipped over the graphs and spreadsheet parts. Why? Because they can be mostly ignored really unless you are a mid-max person or playing on a higher difficulty (though I can’t confirm that). It's a game that's not for everyone.\n\n\n\nBetter story Idea (this is for the developers)\n\nThe Hydrals the first space faring and longest space faring race in their sector discover a large armada approaching their system. Unfortunately other races in the sector are on the verge of becoming space faring. The Hydral’s not wanting to deal with the other none space faring races in this time of crisis choose to block the races from becoming space faring and prepare for the coming armada force. The player, a Hydral, decides that it would be better to unite the races rather than let his race fight the oncoming force alone. The hydral goes off and delivers plans to two other race in secret and is shot down and captured by the last race, the Acutians. Later he learns of the destruction of the hydral home world do to his/her efforts years later. Which leads to the current story of creating the federation but gives a reason for recruiting as many races as possible as they need to work together to survive the coming armada.\n","May 30","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
