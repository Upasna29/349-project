Saw it was now avalible on PC, so I decided to give a go, despite the negative review's, at 4.99 I figured it wouldn't be a big loss if it was atrocious. The PC version is...A little different and takes some getting used to. The control physics seem to be a little improved over the Mobile version of this game. The truck's don't roll over as easily as they do in the mobile version.\n\nThis game can be frusturatingly challanging at times, due in part to the A.I. which flucuate's from being professional badass's who set record time's around the track (Almost unfairly it seems at times) to being complete ♥♥♥♥♥'s who couldn't navigate their way out of a wet paper bag.\n\nOne of my favorite feature's of this game is the fact that they offer a few vintage trucks...Bigfoot #1 and the Original USA-1 trucks is pretty cool to see, since these beasts of the 1980's are the one's I grew up watching.\n\nThe game has a few more features than it's mobile counterpart which is a plus.\n\nThe rest of the game is fairly underwhelming, but what do you expect for a five dollar mobile port? The Graphics are sub-par by todays standards, the sound quality is monotonous, the soundtrack is simple...Offering very limited tracks, but in fairness they stay true to the nature of ''Monster Trucks''.\n\nSo, to summerize, the controls are somewhat clunky, the sound is avarage, the graphic's are Playstation 2 Era quality. But if you love Monster Trucks, especially the 1980's Alumni, and you are willing to see past this games short comings and just enjoy it for what it is, you can't go wrong.\n\nOverall Score 6/10\n\nGraphics = 5\nSound = 5\nControls = 5\nReplayability = 7\n","August 21, 2015","true","42.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

Good performance. Steady 60 FPS and no noticable drops.\n\nCons:\n1. It's an obvious mobile port. Mobile ports are mostly not good. This is a good example.\n2. The game is heavily farmable. You gain next to no money.\n3. There are no control settings (Apart from sensitivity... wait, what?) nor any tutorial.\n\nVerdict:\nGame has good performance with it's 60 FPS, but that's about the only positive thing. The game lacks a lot of basic features a PC port needs.

I have no control over what I am doing as in choosing different types of gameplay myself. The only keys that work in each section for me are:\n\nMain Menu: Esc. , Enter/Space\n\nIn Game: Arrowkeys/WASD (Going backwards does not work)\n\nWhen I try to select any options with my mouse, nothing happens. I mouse over what I want to do in the game and absolutely nothing happens. The only way to exit the game (in fullscreen) is to CTRL+ALT+DEL out of it. I just exit the program in windowed mode. I have nothing bad to say about the actual driving part besides it is a little too difficulty when you are force to buy one of the weaker trucks first, maybe if you guys tune the trucks that the computer runs down a little bit, it would be a lot more enjoyable for a younger audience that would get frustrated to quickly.\n\nI do really think this game has alot of potential. All it needed was a little more time put in to it before its release date. From what I have seen on the trailers of the game it looks great, and that's really what I wanted this game to be. I'm sorry to say it but I can not reccomend this game yet, but like I said before, a little tweaking to this game and it could shoot all the way to the top.\n\nP.S. I would also like to say that I have the mobile game for an Apple device, which I have nothing bad to say about. Not to criticize you about another one of your guys's programs, but I see alot of updates are being released for Android phones/tablets and it would be nice if you could release them for Apple devices.

At the time that I'm writing this, I've done about 12 races, all on the Eastern Championship and I only ran into one time where I had to restart the race because the lights glitched out and I couldn't move.

The game can run smoothly on most computers, which is great. Its the exact same thing as the tablet version, but with better graphics, smoother gameplay, and MUCH BETTER controls. It even has the multiplayer, which unfortunately. doesnt seem to work well (I am unable to start a game with someone, but I do connect to other players, but it takes a too long time to make the game start), but I'm sure its a thing that is getting improved as I am typing. Even though this isnt a free game, unlike the Android version, i'd say buy this PC port. You dont get ads, and you get better graphics, controls and smooth gameplay for a very cheap price. I still do think the game could be improved. A truck maker or a track maker could make the game much more interesting (I'm not saying it isnt interesting right now), although its not something we desperately need, but just an idea.\n\n\nIn a nutshell, its a great game, and I would rather stay on the PC version than on the tablet version.","October 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"

Then again this is coming form a guy that hasn't played the android version so it's your call to take it. This game, from it's truck selection seems almost like some sort of annaversary to all the trucks that has entered, then again, it's missing quite a lot like gravedigger, madusa, and such. It feels good on controls (since it's just the arrow keys(or wasd) And when you find out where the checkpoints are, you can easily cut corners once you're frustrated enough.\nYeah, it can get frustrating. Pretty much your truck, every truck, is a rubber toy where any bump turns into a ping pong mess. Trying to race and control your truck can become a draining task yet I personally want more. If they lightened the physics a tad bit then this would be fun hands down.\nNow the potential in this is great. if they turned this into an actual console/PC game I could see it mixed with Monster Jam: Path of Destruction (my fav so far)  To create your truck and add team races and accessable to 4 players. It has good potential, and I can see why poeple love it so much.\nI'll continue play this, but it's of asking yourself how much frustration can you stand. That or toss out you compeditive side and just goof off and hope you make progress.\nIt's a shame they force us to vote on the game, because I don't think I can recommend, nor dislike the game from people, it's just, I want more to it.","September 15, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You also can buy upgrades for your trucks.  Now there is controller support and I've had no glitches so far.  This is a mobile port I believe so dont expect too much from the graphics.  As stated already the ai sometimes can be flawless and hard to beat but other times you are sitting at the finish line waiting on them to finish.\n\nOverall my two year old and I has enjoyed playing Monster Truck Destruction.  If you are wanting a Monster Truck game there may be better ones out there (I dont know) but if you can get this for a cheap price I say give it a shot!","January 23","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are really easy to master\n2. The graphics are GREAT\n3. It's crazy cheap when on sale\n\nCons:\n1. AI needs to be dumbed down a bit because they are way too fast in racing and win all the time in freestyle\n\n\nI recommend   11/10","February 7","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
