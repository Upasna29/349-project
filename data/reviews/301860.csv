"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/301860/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Standing on the top of a long abandoned crane, rusty beams creaking out a song of defiance against the forces of gravity struggling to pull them apart, I was filled with a crushing sense of melancholy for what could have been. The sun had already set, and from my position I could just make out the outlines of the tallest buildings in the silent moonlight, the last remaining testament of a sunken city through which I was now scavenging for anything useful that may have been left behind. It was at this moment more than ever that I wanted desperately to be taken in by Submerged and its dilapidated beauty, to be swept up in the wondrous world it had conjured and the ambitions which seemed to drip out of the moss covered walls as they struggled to find a place for themselves.\n\nIt is a cruel irony then that Submerged’s ruin is its own overbearing grip on the player. Developer Uppercut Games has gone to such enormous lengths to direct the player and ensure they’re never at a loss as to where to go or what to do, that I felt alienated by my own needless presence. My attempts at exploration became less and less adventurous as I quickly discovered how limited my ability to explore actually was. Immediately I was trapped in my tiny motorboat, able to drift through the gaps of the structures still towering above the murky ocean but unable to so much as reach out and touch them and prove they were more than props in a dystopian tour.\n\nOccasionally I’d be presented with a red vine signaling my chance to make port and clamber up the side of a building to see what was on top, but by then it was already clear that the world of Submerged was not one to be discovered but consumed. Every landmark, collectible, and handhold had been designed with the sole purpose of giving me something to do and observe. Aggressive camera angles directed me toward every significant structure I passed, forced my view toward a collectible I might have missed or a path I needed to take, all the while removing me of the ability to do anything but tell my character what direction to go as they did the rest.\n\nSubmerged traps itself under an omnipresent need to control and focus the player’s attention, and in doing so brings the entirety of its artificial existence to the surface. There was nothing more it could do to make me care about its characters or the history of the underwater city I was only glimpsing the top of; I was stuck behind the layers of antagonistic design allowing me no room to breathe as I performed Submerged’s song and dance wishing all the while that it would soon be over.\n\nOnce you strip Submerged of its fabricated openness and shell of a narrative there’s very nearly nothing left. What remains are your character’s clumsy movements as you guide them through monotonous platforming routines. It’s not the clumsiness you’d expect from a child attempting to scale a skyscraper with her bare hands, but a robotic awkwardness that creates an agonizing amount of disorder between what you do and how the game responds. I cringed every time I had to make my way up a long wall or choose between continuing the main path or grabbing a collectible, as I knew it meant a long struggle with a climbing system that all but plays itself but still needs you to tell it where to go.\n\nI would be lying if I said that there were not times I found Submerged staggeringly beautiful and affecting. Rocketing my watercraft over waves as dolphins swam beside me or watching the sunset from the top of a building overlooking what remained of a bridge, I felt what Submerged had been trying so hard to create. Quiet, beautiful moments followed me throughout Submerged, springing up at random moments as I saw something astonishing out of the corner of my eye, but it was always during a time when I had managed to momentarily remove myself from the pressing control of a game that believed it could force me to feel and appreciate something. And then just like that they would disappear and I would be left alone again with the cold mechanical systems urging me forward.\n\nBy the end of Submerged I had stopped trying. I’d given up finding something that was being intentionally withheld from me, allowing the game to point me where to go and sooner allow me to leave. This was not a voyage but an entrapment; a siren’s call to a dead end and a meandering crawl back out. The game Submerged could have, and by all accounts wanted to be is still hidden here somewhere, but that hardly matters when it so fervently refuses to let you see it.\n\nFull disclosure: Submerged was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

You play as Miku, a young girl who has arrived in the flooded city with her wounded brother, Taku, in search of supplies to help nurse him back to full health. You must explore the city, by day and night, in order to find eight supply boxes, the contents of which have the potential to save Taku’s life.\n\nThe story of the game took me 3.4 hours to complete, the rest of my game time comes from just exploring the city.\n\nSubmerged’s gameplay consists of exploring the flooded city using the boat you arrived in and then using your telescope to find items of interest within the world. Once you’ve located items of interest you can travel to the buildings they are on and climb up them in order to collect the items whether they’re the supplies for the story or the other collectibles found in the game.\n\n+It’s a good looking game, the textures and overall appearance of the game may not be cutting edge but not only do the graphics get the job done, they look nice and suit the game while doing it\n+The backstory of Miku and Taku is delivered to the player through amazing drawings which are unlocked four at a time whenever you find a new supply box\n+The story of the game itself is good though it’s very basic due to there being no dialogue in the game, the ending is also good and, in my opinion, somewhat unexpected\n+Submerged has a full day and night cycle which not only brings some life to the game, it also allows for some great screenshots to be taken, particularly around sunset\n+Submerged also has dynamic weather events such as thunder storms\n+The game has 86 collectibles (not including the story items) so there’s plenty to do even after you’ve finished the story, 60 of these collectibles are pieces of the city’s story so unlocking them all will help you understand how the city has come to be the way it is\n+The flooded city is home to a few different types of wildlife, such as dolphins and whales, which again helps to bring life to the game\n+The game’s soundtrack is fantastic, the music is relaxing but at the same time it gives a real feeling of isolation to the game\n+The controls, particularly for climbing, are very simple making the game easy to play (I used a 360 Gamepad to play)\n\n+/-The game has a ‘Make a Postcard’ mode which is basically a way to set up screenshots, I like the idea of it a lot as someone who loves screenshots but using it forces the game’s logo on to your screenshot which I’m not a fan of, I imagine most people won’t care hence it’s in the +/- section\n\n-Submerged is blantantly overpriced, for a game which can be completeted in around 2 hours a regular price of £14.99 is too much\n-Some of the game’s animations, in particular how Miku walks, look clunky and unrealistic\n-There isn’t enough music! Like I said early the soundtrack is fantastic but it just isn’t played regularly enough in the game\n-The game looks awful if the graphics settings are lower than medium and when I tried the game out on low I really didn’t enjoy it as much so if you don’t think you can run it on medium or higher then you may wish to think twice about buying the game\n\nVerdict:\nWorth Purchasing on Sale (6.5/10)\n\nSubmerged is an excellent exploration game that is relaxing to play, has good graphics and is set in a very interesting world. I wanted to give Submerged a much higher score than I did but with its current price I simply can't recommend it, wait for this one to go on sale.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","August 4, 2015","true","5.5"," 159 of 226 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","159","226","7","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/recommended/301860/","LordWeh","Lord Weh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/","344 products in account","Submerged certainly has good taste in influences; you can see more than a dash of many critically acclaimed games in its DNA, games like Journey, Ico, Windwaker, Shadow of the Colossus, Dear Esther, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.\nWhilst these games clearly have been very influential, it’s a shame that Submerged feels like it simply borrows elements from them relatively ineffectively, and never carves a strong identity of its own.\n\nThe game is exploration-focused, with no combat. This gives the title an eerie calm, a gentle post-apocalypse. You sail a small motorboat looking for supplies for your brother, spotting landmarks and finding story pages along the way. Whilst the plot and gameplay are minimal there is definitely a certain joy and beauty to be found in sailing about and watching some of the wildlife, even if just for a few minutes. The soundtrack is also very effective, at times moving, stirring up similarities to Jessica Curry’s ‘Dear Esther’ soundtrack at points. I felt the soundtrack did a lot of the heavy lifting in creating the atmosphere in the game.\n\nThe plot of finding supplies for your brother is initially quite motivating, however it quickly loses any sense of urgency. You must collect ten supplies (bandages, medicine, water, food… all located atop ruined buildings), although eventually the story gives up the pretence of narratively engaging supplies and simply has you searching for ‘more medicines’ towards the end. These supplies exist in a kind of meta-state, whichever large building you find that is climbable will have the correct supply at the top, satisfying the next stage of your ‘quest’. This isn’t much of a problem, meta-thinking aside, as it allows you to tackle the buildings in any order, but it certainly drains from the narrative focus and tension. Your brother lies in wait, unmoving, and the collection of each supply has an almost identical animation of returning to the tower, administering the supply, sleeping, and waking before you set out for the next supply.\n\nAs you complete the main quest and gather collectables the game unlocks story images; simple pictographic slides that collectively tell a story. This element is clearly inspired by the images used in Journey to wordlessly provide context to the world, but here it falls flat. Journey’s story worked because the aesthetic and the theme were designed to be beautifully minimalistic and almost ‘culture-neutral’, with the pictographs carefully timed to provide deeper context for the world you travel through… But here the design feels lazy. There’s little extra context provided, and the cave-painting aesthetic of the pictographs didn’t feel genuine against the setting of the New York-esque city (even considering the post-apocalypse setting). It simply felt like a hollow execution of a fairly lazy idea, wrapped in a collect-a-thon sidequest just to provide something else to do.\n\nThe lack of combat or challenge weren’t a problem for me, in fact many of the games I list as clear inspirations don’t have much challenge or any combat. However, those other games succeed where Submerged falls short due to strong narrative themes or visual aesthetics providing potent artistic experiences. Submerged lacks severely in this area, sadly, and also lacks polish, leaving it feeling like a hollow game that is less than the sum of its parts. All too often it simply feels like a rushed and unfinished game. Buildings are blocky and ‘gamey’, wreckage feels lazy and repeated, and the majority of the textures are flat and lifeless. Whilst certain moments can be particularly beautiful visually, these are more often surrounded by ugly textures, poorly placed foliage, clumsy repeating objects, uninteresting story, and clumsy animations that pull the artistry back down.\n\nI admire what Submerged wanted to be, but it lacks a strong aesthetic and any meaningful central theme, along with virtually no plot development or polish, instead feeling like a rushed and unfinished homage to a half dozen greater games.\n\nIf you’re happy to play a slow-paced, short but relatively relaxing game with a lot of rough edges, give it a try and you might get some fun out of this. But if you’re looking for story or a meaningful, artistic experience, Submerged sadly falls below the line.","August 6, 2015","false","2.9"," 83 of 110 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","83","110","2","2"

Action-adventures in which you care about someone else, and there's some form of drama.\nExploration and drama. That's what this game is all about. To some extent, it is inspired by the interactive hopelessness in the face of your impending doom, a theme explored by games like Shadow of the Colossus and Journey. But Submerged does something new with it. It is an emotional experience and goes in a direction that most games would never take.\n\nIt's quite shocking that the game is almost completely devoid of challenge. There's no violence even though there are scary things in the world. There are no puzzles, and you can't die. I usually hate games that don't offer challenge... but this game successfully challenged my obsession with challenge.\nBecause of the inability to die and make real mistakes, some people tagged this "a walking simulator", but the gameplay does way more than that. Just exploring the city, recovering its story, climbing buildings with the cute teen protagonist, searching for secrets, and being paranoid about things that may cause potential infection, and also, who's friend and who's foe, provided me with enough choice and thrill to keep playing.\n\nAlso, it's the first game I've played that does environmental storytelling so well - the first game that made me really enjoy piecing together the story of the city, of the world, of its inhabitants, of my own origin, all of that without any words being used, or explanations handed to me. You can even decipher the glyphs in the game in a very intuitive way.\nThe lack of violence allows for a unique way to relate to the other... lifeforms that you meet - your doubts, your fears, your hopes when you meet them wouldn't have been the same if you had a weapon you could wield whenever you felt insecure.  Also, if you assume that they may be a giant consciousness controlled by the green plants it doesn't make sense for them to be outright hostile to you - you're going to become one of them anyway, they might as well help you. There is a sick temptation in accepting your fate and joining these creatures which is a nuanced, complicated feeling and you can't have nuance if you use simple videogame violence.\nFinally, the way you're moving towards your inevitable doom just to help someone you love is done better than any other game I've played. Come to think of it, all 3 things mentioned in this paragraph (uncovering the story through the environment, dubious creatures that are maybe friends, maybe foes, and doom and self-sacrifice) are present in some form in Shadow of the Collosus, but I'd dare to say that this here is done better and affected me more (if it weren't for the ruined ending). It reminded me why playing and making games is worth it, something that all the noise around me makes me forget.\n\nP.S. Unfortunately, the ending sucks. In a "Minority Report", deus ex machina, happy way. This game cannot afford to end on a happy, light note, but it did. Still, I usually care more about a game's idea than about its execution. I can't recommend this game enough.","December 30, 2015","true","19.3"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","34","37","2","0"

Every film that wasn't 'Water World' was sealed in a vault, every book that wasn't the novelization of the script from the hit motion picture 'Water World' was burned, and every classroom on every continent played the masterpiece on loop. Not since the Pax Romana had people known such peace.\n\nAfter the weirdly uncontested canonization of still-very-much-alive Kevin Costner, world leaders began unceremoniously running their taps because “climate change was taking way too long.” In a matter of months Earth resembled Costner's magnum opus. Not since the period immediately following the Pax Romana (Crisis of the Third Century) had the world known such instability and amazing shrimp deals.\n\nEnter Submerged.\n\nSubmerged is a pretty little indie title brought to you by Bioshock alums, and it shows (aesthetically anyway). Plants are appropriately sway-y, the city-scape you navigate is an eery, decaying extension of the ocean, and the wildlife all have, like, barnacle herpes or something. And it's pretty to boot (not the herpes, the environment). Sunrises and sunsets are breathtaking, and the sea is illuminated by bioluminescent organic nonsense at night. It suffers from that videogame phenomenon of “DON'T LOOK TOO CLOSELY AT THE BAD TEXTURES” and “THOSE BACKGROUND BIRDS JUST KEEP VANISHING INTO NOTHING” but all that's pretty forgivable.\n\nBut you're not here to find out about the graphics – you can see them for yourself. You want to know about the story, the lore! Alright!\n\nYou're a girl on a boat with your injured kid brother, Taco (the game says Taku or something Oceanic but I like calling him Taco for reasons). After finding a safe spot you set off to provide Taco aid and find out more about the world around you... its story, its inhabitants, its landmarks, and your past. And that's how you're fed most of the narrative. For watching an animal or getting close to a landmark you're rewarded with a pretty Polynesian-style illustration. For getting supplies for Taco you're rewarded with a pretty Polynesian-style illustration of your personal story. And for finding little narrative caches sprinkled throughout the flooded city you get – you get the idea. It's interesting and unique but it feels like so much padding – especially finding picture 23 out of 60 depicting the story of the city. It's also the primary source of gameplay, scaling ruined skyscrapers, office buildings, and hotel; very simplistic in nature.\n\nSo is Submerged worth it? It's times like these that I wish Steam had an EHHHH option. It's pretty, it's haunting, and it has, for my money, an excellent overarching message. However, at times Submerged feels like a tech demo. It's shallow, the “grab 70-80 odd images” sidequest gets tiresome (doesn't take too many context clues to figure out what happened to this city guys! I certainly don't need a dozen images of just a building or a dude), and it is short. It's a testament to the idea that it isn't about the destination; no, it's about the journey. But is the journey worth it? Ultimately Submerged's cons outweigh its pros, and that's a damn shame.\n\n'Water World' is a ♥♥♥♥ing terrible movie.","August 4, 2015","false","3.2"," 89 of 135 people (66%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","66","89","135","25","12"

If I was 20 years younger it may have been cool, but I think this game is just way too simplistic for an adult to find engaging.  You boat around a sunken city, find places to dock, climb the outside of buildings, and find items, and that's it.  Again,\n\nYou boat around a sunken city:  Boat Mode controls are limited to steering, go backward, go forward, and go forward faster.\n\nFind places to dock:  You can only get out of Boat Mode at specific locations.  These locations are all marked with red-flowered ivy.  You can't go take a swim, you can't get off your boat just to look around someplace because it looks cool.\n\nClimb the outside of buildings:  This is the Assassin's creed bit, but that really makes it sound way sweeter than it is.  There are six interactable surfaces.  The ivy that I mentioned can be climbed up, down, and sometimes sideways/diagonal.  There are drainage pipes that can be climbed up and down.  There are ladders that can be climbed up and down.  There are zip lines (few) that can be zipped down/across.  There are ledges that can be climbed up and down and shimmied along either on top of or hanging from below.  There are broken ledges that can be climbed down (only) and shimmied along while hanging from below.  That's everything in the environment that you can interact with.  There is no jump button.  There is no possible way to fall.  You can't touch any surface that you aren't specifically intended to access for the sole purpose of obtaining an item.\n\nFind items:  There are three types of items.  They all have icons on the map that are revealed whenever you get close to them.  In Boat Mode, you can collect Boat Upgrades.  These make your Go Forward Faster button Go Forward Faster longer.  In Climbing Mode, you can collect Lore Items and Progression Items.  Lore Items each fill one  crude drawing entry in your journal and eventually give you a complete back story on the city and the protagonist.  Progression Items teleport you back to a particular spot on the map and advance the present story.\n\nAnd that's the game.  That's everything in the game.  I wish I could say that Submerged is more than the sum of its parts, but unfortunately it just is not.\n\nThe scenery looks cool.  I mean, post-apocalyptic waterworldy city ruins!  That's a great setting for an exploration game - If you're actually allowed to explore.  All those big buildings, the great skyscrapers that you're climbing?  You're never going to get inside of one.  You're never going to jump off of one (what a missed opportunity there).  That REALLY big one?  Yeah, you're not going to climb that one.  Sorry 'bout it.\n\nStill, you'll have fun climbing the big crane.  You'll get a little tingle the first time a whale pops up near you.  You'll cheer when you finally find red flowers at the base of a building you actually want to climb.  But...  The experience sours fast, way faster than $15-$20.  Go watch a gameplay video instead.\n\nJust one more thing:  I'm 30-something, and it's not a great game for me.  However, this would really be a stellar game for a 10-year-old.  Very kid-friendly, very easy to control, very pretty for a game this simple.","August 4, 2015","false","2.4"," 54 of 79 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","54","79","2","1"

Personally I enjoy this game, but this is purely what I like. All things I consider good in this game is probably a turn off for hardcore gamers. The short answer would be to say if you like "The Path", you will like this game. Anybody else should stay well clear of this title.\nWhat doesn't help is the marketing which makes a big point about the non-violance in the game. Probably done to lure the parents who want to give their kids a game that doesn't involve weapons.\nIt's more story driven than game mechanic driven. That's a weakness as the story is a simple plot although personally I like the execution of the storytelling.\nThe game mechanics are very simple and involves walking, driving a boat and wall climbing. Personally I like the wall climbing aspect of the game, but I liked that aspect in the first Tombraider games as well, even with the usual wonky camera problems each 3D platformer seems to suffer from.\nNice graphics but certainly not on the level of the "Disappearance of Ethan Carter". The biggest problem you might have is that each building you climb ("the game level") is more or less the same in appearance.\nNice music.\nNo enemies.

Even though I had missed a secret (due to my blindness), I didn't mind trying to find it.\n\nThe graphics are extremely beautiful, and the effects are amazing. The water looks and moves realisticly, and it is neat to ride the wake from a nearby whale that has jumped from the water. The trees swaying in the wind, the flowers moving back and forth, the butterflies flitting from place to place. All highly realistic, and a joy to look at.\n\nThere are also really good weather effects, such as rain, thunder/lightning, and fog. The sunlight and moonlight glisten off the water almost magically, as if they had a secret to tell, but couldn't.\n\nDiscovering the various landmarks and other unique buildings and signs added to the mystique. This takes place on Earth, but is it  our  Earth in the future or an Earth from an alternate universe. There is enough to make it familiar, yet alien at the same time.\n\nI have grown quite fond of Miku, and would love to have more adventures with both her and her brother, Taku.\n\nI did not suffer one crash or any graphical glitches, and it ran smooth as silk even with all the settings at max. You can use mouse/keyboard, but I used a controller and I am glad that I did. It makes use of the rumble feature (you can turn this on or off in Options), and controlling the boat was quite easy to do.\n\nThis game has absolutely NO combat in it whatsover, nor are you racing against a timer to prevent failure. You can explore at your leisure, and you don't have to worry about doing things out of order. You can explore any of the climbable locations in any order, no matter how close or far. I like having that freedom, and not being boxed in to "go here first".\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. An absolute joy, and I would purchase a sequel (if they ever make one) in a heartbeat.","January 12","true","13.6"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","7"

Sometimes it's outright stunning with beautiful sunsets on the ruins of a lost civilization and at other times it reminds me of the last gen consoles , or even worse.\n\nMusic 7 of 10\nI liked the music, still I have a feeling it could have been better. There is almost no voice-acting, but sometimes the two kids talk in their strange language, which has no real explanation. But it's rather self explaining.\n\nGameplay 7.5 of 10\nYou play the little girl and you have to climb and explore the various ruins of old skyscrapers. Which is basically the whole gameplay.If you like to explore a little you'll also able to find fragments of the old world and little hints what happened to the family and the civilization.  No you won't find a rocket launcher here or hordes of zombies. In fact there is zero fighting in this game. So if you're into that stuff, this game is not for you.\n\nStory 7.5 of 10\nYou play the little unnamed girl and your goal is to find medicine, bandages and food for your injured brother. The story is very basic and not very complex , but it's sweet nonetheless.\n\nFinal verdict\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes a beautiful atmosphere and doesn't mind the shortness and the lack of combat.\n","October 6, 2015","true","2.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

The game puts you in the middle of a dilapidated, mysterious, city with the goal of saving your brother. Everything in the game has a story, the city, the main characters, even the the creatures. How you go about solving the riddle of the story is left up to you and your pace. The gameplay is rather simplistic as Submerged features no combat. This game wants you to take your time and smell the roses, Searching  to unravel clues and nuggets of information to find out whats going on. The game is gorgeous and designed very well, however because everything is so green, some of the buildings begin to blend together.  The puzzle solving involves an Assassins Creed-esque style platform hopping. This is fine but it becomes repetitive as there is no fear of death or anything that shakes up the gameplay and keeps things new/fresh. The view from the top is gorgeous though, as weather shifts and night comes, you truly feel like your in a ghost city.  There is plenty of things Submerged does very well, from the music, ambiance, and story telling. The only problem is that the game is very simplistic, what you see is what you get. If you like what you see, buy it. It's an enjoyable, calm, experience and great for kids. On the other hand it is tad bit pricey for the amount of gametime/content. I think the game is worth it but some people want more bang for their buck. There is nothing wrong with that. I say buy this when its on sale or do your research!\n\nEDIT: So I beat the game beware of SPOILERS ahead.

I find this a great game to relax with after a busy day; steering your boat through the sunken ruins, following whales, climbing along the trees, at times you can almost feel the bright sun, the breeze and the rain. There are no difficult puzzles, and no conflict or violence at all; this  will certainly not be a game for everyone. But I find it far from boring and enjoy the slow pace, and the way the simple but moving story gradually reveals itself. The graphics are beautiful, if not the best out there, but especially the transitions of day and night and the changes in the weather make for a wonderful sense of atmosphere.

The worst consequence you could expect for miscalculating was having to double track a longer route. Having that in mind, and with game’s easy-going atmosphere I was able to immerse myself completely in Submerged’s remnant world.\n\nDespite the lack of combat and „bad guys“ you are not alone in this crumbled world, as many sea-dwelling animals accompany you along the way, as you progress with your trusty motor-boat in search of medicine, and other optional collectibles. And it really is a joy to ride in your boat, and explore the seemingly bland world around you learning its secrets and backstory along the way. Almost everything you collect is depicted in unique and easy to understand pictograms, as there is virtually no voice or text in Submerged.\n\nThe sense of mystery is ever present, you can really feel it as days go by, weather changes and some strange looking, almost rotten-looking, folks start to show up. The world looks good, actually amazing sometimes like in sunny dawn for example. Water textures especially. One thing I really did not enjoy when it comes to world design is that sometimes streets feel familiar even though you never been there before, and you feel that very early in the game. But, I guess it is just a try to make the game as immersive as possible, and I appreciate that.\n\nStory-wise Submerged offers a lot of emotion and you feel conected to Miku and her sick brother really early in the game. Heart-warming and mystic is a rare storytelling combination in modern video games and maybe thats the reason why you’ll never lose your interest in it. Gameplay boils down to a lot of climbing and even more boat-riding, actually that’s all there is to gameplay, in absence of combat.\n\nClimbing itself is a linear and straightforward affair, sometimes with few surprises along the way. Some puzzles or alternative routes would be great to have, and that the other important thing Submerged is lacking. It would surely get some extra hours of gametime if puzzles were included, if nothing else, cause game is a short adventure altogether.\n\nDisclaimer: Key was provided by developer for testing the game and for review purposes only","August 31, 2015","true","5.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

This game is SUPER pretty. The screenshots that they included really don't give it justice as this is one of the most beautiful and relaxing games that I've played. However the lag during the cutscenes is pretty ridiculous, my computer has the specs to easily handle at least 'High' graphics settings and during gameplay everything is smooth. But as soon as you open a supply chest and the cutscene begins (These are the only cutscenes/loading screens) it starts jitter and the audio begins to jump. Not sure how apparent this will be during the retail release however at the moment it really takes from the smooth and calming gameplay.\nThe gameplay itself is enough to keep you interested, the climbing is nicely animated and interesting although it can get a little repetitive. The story itself is short (At around 1 1/2 - 2 hours) so if you aren't too interested in getting all of the diary entries or landmarks etc then the climbing isn't too much. This style of play won't allow you to fully experience the afore mentioned BEAUTIFUL world the surrounds you, you will pretty much be looking through your telescope to find supply crates or climbing a hotel (Which aren't hard to spot so you'll spend no time at all just cruising around looking for them). When you do look for the diary entries and engulf yourself in the post-apocalyptic world around you, it can get very repetitive. You stop admiring the atmosphere and world and start to get annoyed with seeing the same landmarks and buildings as you drive around in circles looking for those last few entries, with very little reward for actually getting them all - the sub-story is very self explanatory and only requires a few of the cryptic clues to actually figure out if you haven't already from the main story.\nThe main story itself isn't amazing. It's not bad, but it's not exactly Life is Strange. Without spoiling anything, the only part that actually had me interested and slightly excited was the ending, the rest of it is told through childish images that are quite predicatable instead of being the heart-breaking story that the developers were going for.\nThe price for this game is just unreasonable for 2-5 hours of repetitive content, so I would definietly wait for a deal to bring it under the £10 mark before you pick it up.","August 4, 2015","false","4.8"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

You can travel around the city in a boat, and climb buildings for either clues as to what happened to the city, or to collect medical supplies for your brother. On your travels you can also record wildlife that you encounter, as well as finding upgrades for your boat to enable you to travel faster for longer. You have binoculars that can be used to identify collectibles as you travel around, and these get marked on the world map as you find them.\n\nThis is not a climbing/traversal game in which you can die at an incorrect button press (Assassin's Creed, I'm looking at you!). The places that you can climb are clearly marked, and you are unable just to 'let go' or 'fall off' a platform even if you wanted to.\n\nThis game is purely driven by the visuals it presents with an interesting story-line depicted throughout. The story is not told in words, but pictures, and the language that is used sparingly throughout the game is not a real one. Because of this game-play is very heavily based around your want and desire to collect, not just the medical supplies to progress the main story-line for your brother, but also the clues to find out what actually happened to the city.\n\nSubmerged is a beautiful game with a great soundtrack and a powerful and harrowing story to tell, not just for the main character of the game but also the world in which it is set. If you're a fan of collecting things in a sandbox-style environment, then this may be a game for you to try. Overall the game-play mechanics (particularly the climbing) may get a little repetitive, but there's just something really enticing about the world, how it looks, wanting to find out what happened, looking at everything there is to see. I found this game very endearing, and though it is a little lacking in parts, it really made an impact and I'd definitely recommend it.

You take on the role of Miku, a young girl who has brought her wounded brother to the city in their small fishing boat. It was developed by Uppercut Games, an Australian indie game studio founded by Ed Orman, Andrew James & Ryan Lancaster. All 3 worked on games in the Bioshock series.\n\nThe drowned city the game is set in is overflowing with wonderful detail. Swaying trees, plants and vines cover every building. Not one bit of the area you explore is in pristine condition, instead everything is in a state of disarray and decay. What struck me the most though, was how the abandoned world felt alive. As the waves peacefully move up and down, you dont have to look far to find some kind of sea life. Whales swim past your boat, fish and dolphins glide in and out of the water. Even the sky is far from empty, with birds and butterflies keeping you company as you climb from ledge to ledge. Rain can move in and out at a whim and theres even a day and night cycle coloring the city in all kinds of beautiful ways. And speaking of beautiful, Submerged as a whole doesnt disappoint. Its built with Unreal Engine 4 and has all kinds of pretty graphical features like god rays, defined textures and ambient occlusion.\n\nThe music is very peaceful and soothing, making you feel like its okay to play at your own pace. No need to rush or worry about enemies or dying. Even falling as you climb is not a concern (you just lead Miku to the ledges and vines and she automatically jumps. You do however control the direction she climbs). This is the one thing im still uncertain about though. On one hand, it allows you to really take your time and enjoy the amazing scenery. On the other, this game would be perfect as a platformer. I missed being able to jump for myself and having to use skill to make it to the tops of the buildings. That being said, it was still a thrill to scale the walls to reach my objective and even more of a thrill to look around (and down!) once i got there. The goal of the game itself is pretty simple. Find supplies to help your brother. And as you go about doing that, finding pictures that help tell the story of what happened to the city. Theres also the boat you use to navigate the ocean around you, which is a really fun part of the game. Using it to explore the submerged world was quite unique and rewarding. One final neat thing the developers added in on top of everything else is a “postcard mode”. It essentially lets you pause time and move the camera around a bit to take a screenshot. While its not a totally free camera (boo!) and it adds a vignette/damaged picture overlay as well as a Submerged logo to the shot, its still a really nice and welcomed addition. I hope more developers decide to do this in the future.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the 3 or so hours i spent with Submerged and look forward to jumping back in to discover anything i missed (you can continue to play after you complete the main storyline). If a calm, relaxing exploration game sounds good to you, i think youll enjoy it too.\n\n~Fun fact: The sky textures were provided by NASA.","August 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","21","36","0","0"

Here are some thoughts:\n\nMany of the reviews refer to this game as a platformer. This is absolutely not a platformer. You don't do any traditional jumping in this game. You simply direct the main character from ledge to ledge with no timing or danger involved.\n\nThe game appears more beautiful in screenshots and trailers than it actually is. In reality, you will spend the majority of game time hugging a wall that is simply a repeated texture of windows and concrete.\n\nI beat the game in 2 hours. There were more collectibles available for me to find, but I didn't feel compelled in the slightest to find them. Simply finding the main items of the game tells the minimal story. I applaud the developers for making a game that doesn't force itself to continue going for the sake of padding game time. The two hours I had was fun, but if it dragged much longer I would have ended up hating the experience.\n\nI would not pay $20 for this game.

There were many times where what I was feeling was wonder or whimsy or a triumphant eagerness to explore, but the music would hammer the sad jams until I wanted to give up and jump off of a building.  I'm generalizing, but I don't think most dudes want to feel sad while they're overcoming or adventuring.\n\nBesides that, the game is what everyone else has said.  It's about exploration and atmosphere above all else.  There's no real danger to the gameplay except perhaps being afraid that you missed a secret on a large building and will have to climb for 10 minutes again to reach it.    The graphics in motion are a bit dated (textures & geometry remind me of Xbox 360 quality) but they are super evocative anyways and easy to get lost in.\n\nOverall, recommended but disable the music.","May 13","true","0.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

You take on the role of Miku, a young girl who has brought her wounded brother to the city in their small fishing boat."\n\nIn the first few minutes of the game, you are presented with Miku and her younger brother climbing out of a boat. Her younger brother is hurt very badly, and it is up to you to explore the world to find supplies to help take care of him. Already the story feels heartwarming and heart wrenching and it is up to you to interpret. The game does not contain any written storyline, and tells the story through pictures you unlock as the game progresses.You will learn not only about Miku and her brother, but about how the world came to be Submerged.\n\nA vast city awaits your exploration, but it's one that is a maze of skyscrapers and ruined technology. Nature has reclaimed practically everything, and you'll learn more about that as you discover the secrets hidden throughout. Initially the world might seem dead, but that is not the case. Various creatures roam the world, and some will even interact with you. Many times throughout the course of game play you'll have a pack of dolphins following your boat, or even a whale trying to get by on his hunt for food. You never feel alone playing Submerged, but that doesn't make the eerie feeling of desolation and destruction go away.\n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful and atmospheric and really helps absorb you in the story and your quest.You cannot lose the game, there is no combat, and there are no time limits.Everything is so visceral and relaxing. Each building is small challenge to navigate and the stunning visuals always provide you with a unique and exemplary view on the world with each wall you climb.\n\nOverall Verdict\nThe beautiful visuals of this game, the immersive and ethereal soundtrack and the way the game leaves you to figure out and interpret the story yourself makes this game certainly one that you will never forget.\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!","August 31, 2015","true","5.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

That's basically my whole review. The climbing mechanics are incredibly simple. The puzzles were super, super linear most of the time and fail-states were nonexistant. BUT, it was a fun "turn off your brain" activity to do on a quiet night. I enjoyed climbing the buildings!\n\nThat boat, though. THAT BOAT, THOUGH. I did not like driving in the boat. Near the end of my run, boating around became a chore as I desperately tried to find the next building to climb so that I didn't have to be on that freakin' boat anymore.\n\nThe story, in my opinion, is also pretty dumb. Like, the main story, I mean. The one about you and your brother. You can find out more about the city by boating around and finding "hidden" books but that requires exploring around in the boat and I didn't want to do that. So I don't know much about the city's story and have no comments to make on it!\n\nA good game to play with a drink after a long day.

It's a story of struggle, loss, and survival. Like a searchable painting. Not every nook and cranny has something to find, but hidden through-out are little details that individually may not be significant, but as a whole paint this beautiful tapestry. It's a non combat adventure game with a great aesthetic and a story sprinkled a with little puzzle solving and mystery.\n\nThe gameplay is very straight forward, as Miku you traverse this under water city in a small boat. As you explore you will find various upgrades for your boat. Kinda optional in my opinion but it's another thing to go hunting for and will ease your search for answers. The main story objective is to find 10 ration crates. As you find these the story will progress with a cutscene and progress the story along. There is also 60 hidden things to find, several creatures to spot, and other things to find.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/I3YtK4r1WYM\n\nThe puzzle solving is a series of climbing ledges, climbing vines, and... well it's a lot of climbing. Climbing and boating. That's the gameplay. You climb things, find things, putt-putt around on your boat and try to save your brother. The gameplay on it's face is fairly simplistic. However, as a game without combat you are taking in the world around you.\n\nSome have reviewed Submerged negatively stating it's too short or repetitive. Sure, if you mainlined the story you could get done pretty quickly but why are you rushing to complete a game? If you take your time, search around, and try to take it what the developers put into the game I think you can find enjoyment here, even if it only took you a few hours to complete.\n\nSome minor graphical bugs aside (some textures are weak and there's a little tearing at times) I think Submerged has a lot to offer as an indie exploration title.

Some people would argue that without a failure state, it isn’t a game. I however would argue that it is, it has more depth mechanically than more basic exploration games that have been in the debate like Dear Ester. To be honest I dislike people trying to determine what a game is, instead of fostering new virtual experiences.\n\nWhether or not Submerged is a game is in fact not the issue. The main issue submerged has is its repetitive gameplay, climbing sections are not difficult and are the same assets repeated over and over. While the environment looks great, the same ledges are used again and again and there’s very little diversity in the gameplay. The fact that the climbing sections are mostly linear with a few diverting paths to find story cards is also a disappointment again causing almost boorish sections.\n\nThe lack of a failure state is a mistake in my opinion, having the danger of falling from a building into the water would have been a good one. The developers were quoted in saying that the threat of death detracted from the serene environment, however I have to disagree, you can have both a beautiful and deadly environment.\n\nThe games graphics are wonderful, creating a vivid environment. The concreate and glass buildings overgrown with plant life mixed with a blue and green sea is great too explore and look at. Character models also look impressive although the animations are a little off on occasion. There is very little to complain about visually from submerged, the visuals create an immersive environment that begs to be expanded.\n\nOverall Submerged is a beautiful looking game that lacks depth when it comes down to its mechanics. The game is a short lived one with the main campaign only taking around two hours to complete. Submerged certainly has its merits in its world design, visuals, sound and story to some degree. It is however severely let down by its design choices in both lack of a failure state and the level disng of the climbing sections. I personally enjoyed it, I thought it was a fun little game that had charm and as someone who hates tedious climbing sections, I found the simpliticity of the game fun for me however if you are someone who likes more diversity and depth to climbing puzzles and to games overall, its highly probably that you may wish to try submerged in a sale, if indeed at all.\n","August 4, 2015","true","2.8"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitsunefreak/recommended/301860/","kitsunefreak","Kitsunabi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitsunefreak/","43 products in account","Submerged is a beautiful game with a great soundtrack and environment. It feels a little like a cross between A Tale of Two Brothers & Lili: Child of Geos in terms of the worldly feel & gameplay. The game is essentially exploration and you start off boating your injured brother Taku to a submerged city. From there you boat place to place, trying to find "crates" that contain survival stufffs. The story is pieced together literally via little pictures that you either find throughout your travels or receive after finding each crate (there are sections for animals, the city, the protagonists, landmarks...). You also have the option to search for capsized boats for upgrades, which is essentially a nice speed boost (very useful later on from getting between points A and B). The platform like levels are clever and quaint. The environment does change from day to night depending on how long you explore and admittedly, while beautiful, it does get unsettling at night in abandoned submerged buildings.\n\nThis is certainly not an "exciting" or "fast-paced" game, it's about the slow and beautiful exploration of the world and its environment, so if you're looking for that kind of excitement, this may not be the game suitable for you.\n\nMy computer is about 3 years old so the game runs decently enough though the loading screen is unusually long for me, so it's just a heads up for people with older graphics cards and things. If you save & quit in the middle of nowhere at night, for example, when you load up, you will start at homebase in the day but all your exploration progress is kept. Also, definitely use your Telescope since it locks on to points of interests and records it in the map for later use. For people who'd like to save time instead of boating to the same place since they missed something: crates prompt an immediate return to home, therefore I'd recommend searching the area and interacting with the crate last since it would be a bit annoying to have to come back if you accidentally grabbed the crate first instead of the collectible book.\n\nThere does appear, however, to be a bug of some sort at a landmark site called "The Net Tower" which essentially looks like a tall communication tower with a squarish base. Unfortunately, getting close to it prompts the mini aesthetic cutscene and crashes the game. I would recommend steering clear of that area for the time being. There is the occasionally problem of the girl jumping from ledges (typically, if possible, she would drop down the ledge to climb) but this is remedied by the game loading up your progress from a few paces back. For the ledges I'd recommend walking up the edges and then climbing down, since it's wonky.\n\nTLDR; it's a beautiful game and I definitely recommend it!","August 7, 2015","true","8.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's vast yet empty world creates a haunted landscape filled with secrets and collectibles for you to acquire.  The graphics in this game are stunning, and more then that, the world itself is imaginatively  put together.  The sunken city seems to combine elements from a variety of cultures leaving you wondering both where and what was this city.  What happened here?  What happened to the world?  And the answers can be found through a few hours of thorough combing through the cities buildings and many landmarks.  As day turns to night and night to day you will constantly find yourself stopping to take a moment to appreciate how the light is hitting the water, how the animals seem to move keeping the world alive, yet still barren.  The music creates a perfect ambiance to back this journey of exploration.\n\nThe only area where this game really seems to lag is in the gameplay.  The actual gameplay elements are all perfectly functional, but far too simplistic.  I found myself growing tired of the climbing within the first few buildings because there was just no challenge.  There's two parts to gamplay, riding in your boat and climbing.  The climbing is just pointing the direction you want to go and nothing else.  And the gameplay never evolves.  The only thing that changes throughout the 2 hours it will take you to complete the basic storyline is the boost on your boat increases as you collect other fallen boats.  I would have loved a more challenging climbing system, or possibly some obstacles to overcome/puzzles to solve, something to add a bit difficulty.  Without is the game can seem to start dragging at times.\n\nOverall through I would say in all elements except for gameplay this game was a 10/10 for me.  Gameplay is a 6/10 -perfectly functional but lacks engagement or escalation.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who might be looking for a game a bit more cathartic, or relaxing, or who just really wants to see what a strong imaginative team of developers can come up with when they really try to create something beautiful.","August 7, 2015","true","2.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The visuals are just to die for.\nThe game play can be a bit tedious, but if you take time to boat around every inch of the map and gain all the collectables and complete the story, you really will get enjoyment out of it.\nIf your intention is to move through a game as quickly as possible, then this game is not for you - and will only take an hour or so. However, if you dedicate yourself to completing the game 100%, you will be lost in this sunken city for hours.\n\nGameplay is limited to floating in a boat, with backwards, forwards, left and right controls, docking at buildings and ruins with red flowering ivy and climbing the outside of buildings - walking on ledges, hanging off ledges, climing up and down pipes, more ivy and a couple of awesome ziplines.\n\nThe beauty of it? The satisfaction of knowing you're helping "your brother" get better. BUT the dynamic weather and being able to stand at a signal tower and look up to see it in all its beauty or standing on the edge of the building and looking out at the city covered in moss and half ruined takes the cake.

This is how exploration games should be. You are tasked with exploring this submerged city to help save your dying brother. Gameplay consists of driving in a boat, climbing buildings, and looking through a telescope. It's a simple game that won't take long to explore the world, but it is very relaxing and beautiful.\n\nWell, I wasn't relaxed 24/7 while playing this game. Even though I knew I couldn't die and nothing could hurt me, I still had a feeling of fear while exploring this empty city. First of all, the drowned city is creepy. Huge buildings, a huge creepy statue, huge creepy bridges, a huge radio tower thing, etc. Maybe I'm just afraid of huge creepy things (I am), but I was reluctant to travel to new areas at night for fear of approaching something new, huge, and creepy. Also, the animals! Some of the whales are so big, and don't get me started about those weird plant humans.\n\nNighttime and daytime are gorgeous in this game. The graphics aren't stunning, but that didn't mean I didn't love the way the water reflected the sky, sunrises/sunsets, and the rain for example.\n\nThere are no proper voiceovers in the game.

I'll go with up, but just barely. This isn't something I'll be going back to. I doubt it'll ever even enter my mind again.\n\nYou're an explorer in an open flooded city. The art and atmosphere are pretty good, particularly the animals you encounter. But soon you'll realize that half the story (that of the city) is told through random collectibles that are a bit of a chore to get. This was my first disappointment with the game. If that's your thing, well, great. But narrative and superfluous collection don't go well together. The good thing is it doesn't take /that/ long to get them, you'll just have to backtrack occasionally.\n\nMy second disappointment was that barely any of the buildings are explorable. You've got the 10 buildings in which you fetch medical supplies, the 1 building you occupy, and a bunch of generic, copy and paste, smaller, hollow structures littered around the city that all have one collectible story piece in them. They're like those frustrating islands and beaches in Black Flag you land at to find one chest, or one song sheet. The 10 main buildings have a little variation between them, but not much. Earlier in my playthrough I found myself circling a lot of the non-enterable buildings checking for a docking station.\n\nWhy am I recommending this game if I only have bad things to say about it? Well, the good thing is that the game is short, so the repetition doesn't last long until the game is over, so you can focus on the beautiful music and the stunning views while playing, and trying to save your brother is enough to motivate you through the few hours.\n\n\nIn summary, this is a short, fairly shallow but pretty game that I would recommend just for a quick distraction.","September 10, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/301860/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","This game is a postcard-perfect exploration game, with the challenge being to a) work out what happened to this beautifully bleak environment, b) solve a bunch of 3d climbing puzzles, and c) collect stuff.\n\nTo progress, you treat your wounded brother by searching what remains of the city for supply drops. These drops are found at the top of larger buildings, which you climb via ledges and pipes etc in what amounts to simple mazes. To get between the buildings, you sail around on a nippy boat, often flanked by creepy mutant dolphins.\n\nTo give you more to do (and to extend the climbing puzzles), the city is littered with bonus crates to find, each containing a pictogram fragment of the backstory. If you like lore gathering and interpreting pictures of men poking fish with spears, you'll have a (mutant) whale of a time.\n\nGameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFYOJ2lnN-c\n\nSubmerged has a neat mechanism to help find your next goal without hand-holding - you climb to any high point you fancy, take out your portable telescope and scan your surroundings. If you spot something important, it's marked on your map (and compass) for you to investigate.\n\nThere's plenty of 'wow!/oh no!' moments in Submerged - it can be as obvious as turning a corner into the most stunning sunset in games, or from something more ominous and creepy as the plot unfolds. But if you don't let yourself be absorbed by the simple pleasures of the game, you'll feel you've seen everything quite fast. This game doesn't do a lot of things, but it does what it does well.\n\nThe lack of combat in this game isn't a problem, and it's only the conditioning of videogame history that insists otherwise. It wouldn't feel right in this quiet world, anyway. What's more of a problem is the lack of freedom. There's no jumping, no falling, no real improvisation; the climbing puzzles end up feeling linear and repetitive in consequence. At times Submerged feels like a very cunning 2D game in 3D clothing.\n\nSubmerged is a very short game if you charge through it from A to B. And, unless you love sunsets, it's not something you'll come back to once you've run through the plot and poked around for a decent whack of the collectibles.\n\nBut never mind. Just savour it while it lasts, enjoy the superb soundtrack and take a bit of time to actually *look* at a game for once.","August 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

The above average visuals and soundtrack, combined with the relatively low challenge, do make Submerged one of the more relaxing experiences I’ve played in recent memory.

It reminds me of Grow Home (objective-wise) crossed with a disappointing Assassin's Creed (movement-wise).\n- Some minor immersion-breaking things - randomly floating grass and tree entities (palm trees also do not just grow out of straight concrete!), and the ominous swamp tumor monsters that slowly walk around corners to spook you out... with the right angle you can usually see most of them disappear.

One of my favorite things in this game are the strange creatures and the freedome you feel when you drive the boat or scale a building also the sunset is on point.

You find yourselves in an unknown city, surrounded by water. While he tries not to die, you have to climb the buildings and find emergency rations to make him not die a little longer.\n\nThe game play is basically like Assassin’s Creed, if Assassin’s Creed was only about the parts where you climb buildings (oh wait, it is!). You sail around on your boat, exploring the area. As you do, you can find upgrades to make your boat faster, tiles that depict the story of this sunken city, landmarks that serve no purpose but to look cool, and creatures that seem to think you are the best thing since the city flooded.\n\nThe plot has no dialogue, save for a couple of lines of self-narration while the girl says what she has just found. But the story is still very deep, and may tug at the heartstrings a little by the end. It would have tugged at mine, IF I HAD ANY!\n\nThe graphics are stunning, as with everything I have seen released with the Unreal 4 engine. The world is absolutely beautiful, and the creatures are lifelike. My only complaint is the low resolution. With a 4K monitor, the game would still only play up to some low resolution like 1600X1200. I am sure I could have found a workaround, but the game looked good enough that I did not really mind.\n\nThe music is captivating, as well, and really lends to the ambiance of the entire game. This is more of an exploration game, with a very slow pace. You can take your time and look for every little tile to see the full story of the city, and every boat part (which I recommend doing first) to go even faster, or you can breeze right through it. If you blow through the game, though, you really miss out.\n\nAll in all, an excellent artistic work that I did not mind sinking a few hours into. I highly recommend this to anyone who does not need to be killing something to enjoy a video game.","May 23","true","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The setting is similar to Enslaved, but more depressing - the world is flooded, only parts of the highest buildings are visible above water, all covered in plants and seaweed. Your brother is seriously wounded and you need to gather some medicine and rations for him from the roofs of the buildings. To get there you use your boat and telescope (to locate interesting objects and mark them on your map). Then you climb up and search for hidden stuff.\n\nSubmerged combines TPP exploration and some light platforming elements, though no skills or good coordination are needed, as it is impossible to fail here. You don't jump, you just move across ledges, pipes and branches and try to get all the secrets on your way to the top. What is more - there is no combat or violence in this game, but it contains some minor scares and sad moments - think of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons or Journey. The story is told without any words - the only text you see is your objectives.\n\nThere are no technical issues with the game and it's optimized well, but you can feel the low budget. The world and character models look fine, but animations are unrealistic and jerky and platforming elements seem too easy and repetitive (thus boring for hardcore players). Soundtrack is lovely, though, as well as the atmosphere.\n\nIf you like exploration games and simple, but touching stories - try it, you should not be disappinted.","August 3, 2015","true","2.4"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","25","49","0","0"

I needed a lot more time before it came out.\n\n1. The exploration when on foot is mostly just scaling buildings and walking through narrow passages. It's too enclosed to feel like I'm exploring, it feels like I'm just climbing up a ladder for 10 minutes.\n\n2. When not on foot, exploration is awul because the boat controls HORRIBLY. It seriously controls worse than the bike in No More Heroes, because at least with the bike, when I turned around, I ACTUALLY CHANGED DIRECTIONS. When your main mode of transportation for going around the map controls horribly, it ruins the immersion and makes exploring feel more like a chore.\n\n3. Graphics are okay at best. I'm normally not a "graphics make the game" kind of person, but when the main appeal of a game is exploration, visuals are insanely important. You need the looks to back it up, and this game doesn't have that.\n\nIt's not a bad game, but it needs more polish and time on the dev table.

Building an entire game around this concept, however, is an exercise in insanity, more so when the controls and camera are so painfully stiff that it's muscle-fatiguing within the first hour. It's a shame; the sources of inspiration Submerged draws upon are clear as they are magnificent (Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, Far Cry 3, Tomb Raider, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker), but never does it manage to build anything remotely compelling in comparison, not when the most fundamental aspects are so broken at their core.","December 3, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The graphics are medium to top notch.  The way this game plays leaves room for all ages, although it does expose human suffering regularly through interactions with the injured boy.  I found the controls to be simple and straitforward.  Plays perfectly on my Xbox 360 controller as well as my mouse and keyboard.  If you are looking for a slightly saddened, but colorful exploration game this could be perfect for you.  Atmosphere reminds me of the movie waterworld from back in the 90's but with a bit more color.  Colorful patterns swirl on the water surface like oil and I can see nothing under the water.  Strangely familiar creatures leap from the water surface as they are drawn to my engine noise.  Two blocks away I can hear something very large splashing between the buildings, and off in the distance an abandoned bridge stands guard over what used to be a mighty river, but is now an underwater trench.  This game pulls of atmosphere perfectly.\n\nCons:\nNo underwater exploration.  Not really a con, but people should know.  No depth of field adjustment:  Makes game unplayable on my Nvidia 3d Surround setup.  If anyone knows of a functional mod, or file adjustment I can perform to enable this I would love to know.  Game isn't about combat, and is set in a region of abandoned city so repetition is par for the course here.  Buildings start looking the same and climbing all feels the same.  This is what makes the game relaxing and ambient, but can also make it very boring.\n\nConclusion.\n10/10 If it had a FOV slider.\n5/10 Because it doesnt.  I have way too many exploration games that look beautiful spread accross my 6018x1080 Nvidia 3d Surround display.  Forcing me to fill my view with the shoulders of my character breaks this game for me, and killing two of my monitors to play on 1/3 of my display size is foolish at best when I have other options for entertainment.","August 18, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a relaxing boat ride through a world that's empty but alive.\nIt's relatively short (~6 hours after all the secrets are found), but what it does, it does pretty well.\n\nThe story is enough to hold your interest (mainly, what happened to the world you are exploring) but it amounts to pretty much a bunch of fetch quests, so the real interest here isn't the main story, it's discovering secrets, upgrading the boat you ride around in and discovering the story of what happened.\n\nI personally liked the game very much - the art was pretty solid, the music was appropriate to make you feel alone. The area you are in is manageable and to be honest it doesn't feel too big (except near the end when you are trying to track down those last few pesky secrets.\n\nThe cons are that its short, the building textures aren't amazing up close, the models are smooth but the graphics are nothing to write home about.  My biggest complaint, though, is the climbing.  It's very tedious especially after the first few buildings.  It just feels unecessarily slow.\n\nOverall a good game to get lost on if you have time to kill or want to relax with a story/ exploration game.","April 24","true","8.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auldwolf/recommended/301860/","auldwolf","AuldWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auldwolf/","423 products in account","I think the problems people have with this game come down to flawed ideals.\n\n1.) It Isn't Quantity Over Quality\n\nWhy do they love quantity over quality so? The best games I've ever played have been fairly short. I don't understand this desire to add in repetition, grind, and padding just so it's worth the money. Portal only lasted three hours yet it's been hailed as one of the greatest games of our time, and thus it should obvious why the importance lies in how much you enjoy something, not how much time you spend with it. Dragon Age: Origins claimed 60 hours of content, but 35 of those were spent in the labyrinthe dwarf tunnels being lost and repeating the same combat over and over until the person playing it was sick of it, and another 20 were just soulless grinding and repeated content.\n\nThis is the kind of game addicted mindset that lead to MMOs and skinner box models. The best 'game' in the Quantity Over Quality category then is World of Warcraft, it has endless content. It doesn't matter that it's not fun to play; Nor does it matter that it doesn't have an interesting plot, narrative, or story; And it's fine that it's lore is just a pile of spaghetti and mostly sheer nonsense. It's got bang for buck, yo! That, apparently, makes it the best.\n\nFrom Mega Man to Portal, the quality over quantity category is stacked chock-a-block full of enjoyable titles which prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that this is what anyone should want. Portal, Ico, Doom, Quake, Shadow of the Colossus, flOwer, Braid, Shatter, Psychonauts, To the Moon, Streets of Rage (series), The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker, the original Metal Gear Solid, Day of the Tentacle, Ultima VII, Full Throttle, Life is Strange, Saints Row IV, Never Alone, Ori & the Blind Forest, Stacking, The Stanley Parable, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, recent Telltale series... I could go on as there are so, so many more. I think my point is made, though.\n\nThere's no reason to choose quantity over quality unless you're a game addict, but if you are, you shouldn't be considered a metric of what is or is not a good game.\n\n2.) No Combat\n\nThere's no combat. It's an exploration game, but one with a strong story. This isn't Proteus. It actually does have goals to follow and things to find. To me, that's refreshing. A lot of people though have trouble getting stimulated unless there's violence on the screen, and I don't understand those people. There are far too many of them playing games, which means that whereas film goers can appreciate a film that doesn't incorporate violence in any shape or form, gamers are just gagging for it. I think that's sad.\n\nIt also leads them to rage at titles like this where there's none of their shooty-shooty-bang-bang, or stabby-stabby. This leads me into my next point, but I'll get to that below. The fact is is that there's nothing wrong with a game that doesn't have violence, if there was then we'd pan everything from Tetris to To the Moon. It's a really simple-minded perspective to believe that everything needs murder, but some people need viscera to be stimulated. I can only imagine those who do to have very simplistic, extroverted minds that require non-stop stimulation. That doesn't reflect badly upon this game, but on them.\n\n3.) Not a Male Power Fantasy\n\nGuys are used to this, and they rage whenever they don't get it as though the primary demographic of gaming is somehow being discriminated against. Oh boo hoo, cry me a river when most games are about male power fantasies, which involve characters guys want to be, being swooned over and praised by characters guys want to look at. See: Skyrim. I'm a guy but my fantasies tend to not involve sticking my mansword into things in order to have the masses faint with awe. I'm more secure with my identity than that, and more self aware. I prefer healing, or helping, or exploring.\n\nWhenever a game pops up that obviously isn't a male power fantasy though, you'll have people rage about it.\n\nThee three factors explain all of the negative reviews for Submerged. Essentially: The negative reviewers aren't a particularly bright bunch. They like skinnerbox games filled with violence and male power fantasies because of course they do. It's all they can enjoy. But that doesn't mean you should take their reviews with anything more than a grain of salt. This is a particularly great game that practices quality over quantity.\n\nUltimately, you'll have to decide for yourself. But read the negative reviews and tell me you don't see what I mean.","August 6, 2015","true","6.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","2"

Don't let that drive you away from this game though, just sit back and let me spin you a review.\n\nSubmerged was developed and published by Uppercut Games and it revolves around a young girl Miku and her near death Brother Taku in a world that seems to have been drastically changed by the effects of global warming. We play as Miku throughout our adventure and we have to explore a large flooded city desperately looking for suppiess to help our Brother. Our goal is to find these supplies by climbing our way up tall skyscrapers in an assassins creed style way of parkour and getting to them by using our squrrelly as ♥♥♥♥ boat.\nHeres a question, where did she get these crazy climbing skills? She lives in a flooded world with basically no way of climbing anything and she's a pro at this stuff, I still have trouble rock climbing with a pully system and yes, I lift.\nAnyway, in order to find these supply crates we have to use our telescope to keep a look out for flags on certain buildings, and after every crate we get treated to a four slides revealing a bit more of our characters story.\nBut Justin? What else is there to duu?\nThat's the main story, Ten crates, 40 slides (I can maff) and about an hour and a half of in game time. There are a few side quests you can do such as finding a bunch of journal entries that give us the story of what happened to the city, finding all of landmarks across the ocean or finding the 8 different types of animals hanging about. Just 8, the rest are dead, Just like my dreams. I'm sure if you did everything there is to do in this game you'd top out at maybe 4 hours for a slow run or 2 and a half to 3 for a more focused run.\n\nOver all this game is beautiful, the ambient sounds are great and the controls are responsive and easy, easy enough to let my four year old take a crack at the game, and while the story is neat it's not worth what the publisher is asking, I really did enjoy the game, but there isn't enough content here for a $19.99 price tag. Rocket league is $19.99...\nTake the $20 you were going to spend on this and grab something with a bit more depth, but pick this game up when its 90% off on the next steam sale because it's a good way for us to actually finish a game for once and make us think we're making progress on our steam libraries.\n","August 8, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The female protagonist  is searching a flooded map for things to help her injured broher such as drinking water (even though the world is surrounded by water, medicine, first aid, etc...\nAs you progress through the game there are some odd looking creatures that appear in different areas that seem to neither hurt nor help. They are just there...most of the game observing. The gameplay is decent, the music is tranquil, and our heroine is joined regularly by a variety of sea creatures that seen to enjoy swimming playfully alongside her boat as she searches for things to aid her brother. I won't go any further, don't want to spoil the game.\nIt's not bad for what it is. But I got it on sale, so I don't know what the regular price is. But once you finish it. There really is no reason to play it again. So don't pay too much.","February 29","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You take on the role of Miku, a young girl who has brought her wounded brother to the city in their small fishing boat."\n\nThe StoryYou are presented with the problem within the first few minutes of the game as you step off of the boat holding a young boy; your brother. Already the story feels heartwarming and heartwrenching. I can't go into details, as this is largely a story-driven game, but I can say a few words regarding the story. It's mature, it's macabre, but there are many interpretations and thoughts you can have regarding the story. Nothing is ever explicitly told, just shown. There's a story to Miku and her brother, but there's also a story about the city and the world.\n\nStory Verdict: Deep and yet open to interpretation, but definitely not lacking in emotion or sincerity.\nStory Score: 8.5/10\n\nThe WorldTying in directly with the story is the world; the environment. A vast city awaits your exploration, but it's one that is a maze of skyscrapers and ruined technology. Not only that, but the world is flooded to an unknown depth. The nature has reclaimed practically everything, and you'll learn more about that as you discover 'secrets', or hidden drawings that fit a timeline of events.\n\nInitially the world might seem dead, but that is not at all the case. Various creatures roam the world, and some even interact with you. Many times throughout the course of gameplay you'll have a pack of dolphins following your boat, or even a whale trying to get by on his hunt for food. You never feel alone playing Submerged, but that doesn't make the eerie feeling of desolation and destruction go away. There are multiple mysteries to uncover, and exploration will solve them all. Trust me, I want to say more but it would spoil too much!\n\nWorld Verdict: Open, beautiful, and full of life. Maybe a little too empty, but I'd rather have that than get bored with too much to do. Honestly I'd say it's perfectly filled.\nWorld Score: 9/10\n\nThe SoundtrackThe only reason this deserves a category is because the soundtrack is so beautiful and I hope that it becomes available for download. Seriously, it's so atmospheric and incredible! Uppercut Games, make this happen!\n\nSoundtrack Verdict: The perfect companion for a desolate and ruined world, and it needs to be available!\nSoundtrack Score: 9.5/10\n\nThe GameplayThe gameplay is largely what you make of it, much like Journey. You cannot lose, there is no combat, and there are no time limits. Those who expect an action game should look elsewhere, though that's not at all a negative comment about the game. Everything is so visceral and relaxing with playing Submerged. Each building is small challenge to navigate and the stunning visuals always provide you with a unique and exemplary view on the world with each wall you climb. Gameplay is simple, the controls are are obvious, and controlling Miku is simple considering you can't fall off or die.\n\nGameplay Verdict:You take Submerged at your own pace, and that's the beauty of having a limited amount of mechanics.\nGameplay Score: 8.5/10\n\nThe ExperienceA game like Submerged is an experience, but in a different way a typical FPS or casual game is. A game that gives you the tools for a good experience is a dangerous type of game, but usually attracts those who like story-driven, thought provoking games. As a whole Submerged is just stunning and beautiful. Unreal Engine 4 is such a fantastic and versatile engine, and Submerged creates a wonderful, living world to spend a few hours or more.\n\nExperience Verdict: Much like games of similar genres, the experience created by Submerged is the heart of this game.\nExperience Score: 9.5/10\n\nOverall VerdictThere are only a few categories I can score Submerged by, but I believe that the few categories I can score it by make this game more than worth the time and price. The beautiful visuals, splendid soundtrack, and deeply ambiguous story of Submerged entice you into a surreal experience that you will NOT forget!\n\nOverall Score: 9/10","August 3, 2015","true","2.8"," 19 of 40 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","19","40","0","0"

Even though there is no combat in the game, there's a sense of eerieness that pervades the whole game. They handle mystery well given that the tasks you have to complete are a bit repetitive in nature. The beautiful landscapes and docile, but at times playful creatures who inhabit the world make the game a very peaceful way to spend an evening. The story comes together in a very expected way, but is creative in that it's mostly told all through visuals. 8/10 would play again!","September 15, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world has a real Beyond Good & Evil quality, but if that world was devoid of life. The devs were definitely aiming for a Shadow of the Colossus-esque game, but missed the mark by making this extremely tedious. All the character movements feel like you're trudging through molasses. If you're not patient & thorough. You'll either leave things behind or dread having to trek back to items you missed. As far as I'm concerned, It's a "no" vote.","January 24","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The city is overgrown with vegitation from what can be assumed as years without maintance. The story and scenery though was the only real driving points to play this game. The climbing mechaninc got fairly old quickly when the building climbing began to feel linear, even if they threw in twist or little puzzles to find clues to the story. I'd prefer to have a bit more done to the story to give it more depth as it got confusing towards the end and it never answered a lot of my questions. If there were a bit more variety in climbing like more bizzare buildings or multiple paths rather than one leads to a secret the other leads to the supplies it'd be a lot more enjoyable. Overall if you want a game to pass the time that isn't really challenging and is calm pathfinding then this is the game for you.","May 29","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
