When you interact with objects (sometimes just by clicking, other times you have to throw them), they "unlock" and turn into color.  Changing objects or entire rooms from grayscale to color is the basis of this game - when they're unlocked, they are counted as decisions and influence your life later on.\n\nSo far, the puzzles seem easy enough, even for a puzzle-challenged person like myself.  When you're near some objects, there's even a clue on what to do with it.  For example, while standing near an empty binder, a caption says that I need to find some paperwork.  And when you are holding the missing piece nearby, it automatically moves to fill in, leaving the guesswork out of it.\n\nI'm enjoying this game so far.  I have a hard time with throwing things though (so far I've encountered darts, a horseshoe pit, a basketball court and a football).  Most of these things won't "unlock" and colorize with just one throw, but honestly if you have better hand-eye coordination than me, you'll have no trouble.  It's not a deal breaker, it's just a small difficulty I have to overcome.  Not the game's fault.\n\nThe grayscale is a soothing color scheme, and it's fun to explore the setting (your childhood home).  However, when you unlock the colors, it gets a little bright and loud.  Yellows, oranges, greens...quite the opposite of black, white and gray.  It makes a dramatic difference to the game.  The effect of colorizing is cool as well.  Things don't just suddenly turn yellow - pixels move across the object and gradually fill it with color.  It makes it a bit more subtle, which seems to fit in with the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a relaxing, easy-puzzle game with a calm color scheme (until the color sets in, then it's crazy!), then look no further.\n\nHere is my gameplay of the first level:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCmIrZaY38E","June 26, 2015","true","7.3"," 43 of 55 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","43","55","0","0"

Apparently I died as an old man with regrets about my life choices...?\n\nThere appears to be VERY little content right now.  It looks like there could be a couple branching "paths", but with ONLY 1-2 months(!) of Early Access planned there's NO way it's possible to come up with enough content to make this interesting.  Sorry, I wanted to like the game.  It doesn't come close to delivering on its promises.\n\nThe first level is visually polished enough, the second office level not so much - with all the coworkers, male and female, sharing the same character model.  And then suddenly it was "lunch" and they were all standing with a ball behind their back...?  By this point its feeling more and more like this was someone's school project made from Unity assets.\n\nThe dialogue scrolls past way too quickly without waiting for you to press a button to confirm you've read it.  Not that you're missing much, the dialog is very generic and uninteresting.  Between levels it does wait for you to confirm the dialogue, however with the current amount of content, the transitions are extremely jarring and just awful.\n\nFor this to be successful it needs a story, like it promises.  There is currently really no story.  All that "Storyteller engine" stuff is a load of BS at this point.\n\n*SPOILERS*\nThe only possible "choices" I made:\n* click everything to make it turn colors (drawers, lamps)\n* Try agonizingly to get a basketball through a hoop one time\n* Play horseshoes\n* Play darts\n* Listen (stand next to) girlfriend while ~3 lines of trivial dialogue rolls by, rather than walk away\n* Answer the phone\n* Put records on a record player and listen to the music (will children/teens even know what this is?)\n* Put 3 items in a binder\n* Put the stuff in the box\n* Move papers from one place to another\n\nThese are NOT choices!\n\nFun stuff:\n* Throw a football in girlfriends face\n* Throw darts in girlfriends face\n* Put a box on girlfriends head","July 8, 2015","false","1.5"," 44 of 70 people (63%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","63","44","70","12","3"

If you like exploration-driven adventure games, this one has potential. At the moment it feels like it's a bit low on content, but at the current rate it will likely be quite an interesting game when it's finally released.\n\nYou start off as a teenager packing their things and saying goodbye to their family house, about to leave for college. Depending on what you do and what you pack determines where your life takes you (you end up on one of several different "maps" for the second round of exploration). Where you explore and what you interact with determines how the rest of your character's life pans out.\n\nIt's less than an hour long per playthrough, but it's fun going back and trying different things to take your character through a different path in life.\n\nIn the game's current Early Access state (15 July 2015), it seems like all of the different life paths are implemented but it's still lacking enough detail to make some of the exploration parts interesting. I enjoyed my first two playthroughs of it, but there were some boring bits that I hope will be fixed.","July 10, 2015","true","1.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","0"

None of the options stick properly, not even mouse sensitivity or FOV. If you crouch/run/zoom/throw/climb or view any cutscene, FOV reverts to the extremely low minimum. You're extremely limited in what you can do without going back to the options menu every 3 seconds. The slider should modify the base value, and the different cameras should adjust that and revert to the base when finished, but instead it seems they revert to a set value. 2. The performance is abysmal for the visuals on display, though it's mainly very specific settings and the way the game streams textures. Some settings can completely change the visuals in a really non-intuitive way to little performance impact. Depth of field looks nice in some scenarios, but it seems to just be a near and far blur that doesn't change, rather than focusing on the cursor. If you push up against a wall, it's pure blur. There are dozens of bugs regarding the settings to what I'd say is a pretty unimpressive result fidelity-wise. Tons of pop-in, both seemingly intentional and unintentional. More on that below. Finally, it desperately needs a dedicated full-screen option as it can lose focus behind the taskbar somehow, and lose mouse bounding while using the menus.\n\nGameplay\nI enjoy exploring 3D environments, especially when there are fun physics things to play with. This game is just hinting at that. The grabbing mechanics feel satisfying and are largely fine outside of the FOV reverting issue and that come objects shoot straight into the character and snap back and fourth when grabbed. There are tons of drawers and containers to open, but rarely anything of interest. The basketball outside was a lot of fun to play with, and I'd say the game could benefit massively from more things like it. There are tons of medium/small objects that are static in the environment, and it's a shame not being allowed to mess with them. Also higher texture quality on objects with text, and the ability to rotate objects while zooming (right click) and say holding shift, would be fantastic.\n\nOnce you leave the first level with the home, the amount of things to interact and play with jumps straight off a cliff. The house already felt a little bare, but in later levels there's almost nothing at all except a few pebbles by the lake shores. There needs to be puzzles, things to interact with, really anything of interest!\n\nMouse acceleration is a touch too strong, and while movement in general okay, it could be improved significantly. I feel sprinting speed should be increased, and the player should be allowed to jump and fall off small ledges like the second story in the cabin at the start of the forest area. Snapping to the ladder awkwardly to go up or down, on top of the FOV resetting, was beyond clumsy. Finally, you should be able to sprint while carrying objects, and be able to strafe while sprinting as well. Being locked into only forward movement while running endlessly through the forest level felt really restricting.\n\nPresentation\nAssuming various fidelity issues are addressed, the game actually can look pretty nice. However, it's key problem is also it's main gimmick. Filling in color as you progress through the environment. It works okay in the first house environment, where it's triggered by fully exploring the contents of the room. The black and white interiors are unappealing, and while the colored versions are an improvement, they aren't great either. Outside however, in the forest area of the game (the second "level"), the filled in colored versions are bright and vibrant. Certain scenes are screenshot-worthy. That said, that's AFTER you fill in the area with color, which entails walking around intentionally off of paths to fill in as much as you can with an invisible circle surrounding your character. You want to fill in the environments fully to see them finished, but not only is that a waste of time and a distraction from anything else the game might be trying to say, tons of obstructions stop that from being possible. On top of all that, the constant coloring in seems to be done via texture replacement, and oh boy does it stutter endlessly because of it. I get it, you saw other games pull off this painting gimmick well, and you want to emulate it... But at this point it is very clear that attempt has failed. I say drop the gimmick entirely, and let the player focus on more interesting mechanical and story elements. It seems early enough that implementing such changes would be a relatively minimal amount of effort, with the only challenging being finding a basic way to explain goals to the player.\n\nSound wise, the game is currently like walking through a void, with some footstep sound effects. The sound effects that are there are okay at best (though I did find the basketball's to be satisfying), and some are too loud/abrasive. The best moment was when I put a record on in the livingroom and walked around searching for more hidden things. The game desperately needs more sound environments the ensure a sense of place, and if you can pull off basic reverb and 3D sound sources, even better.\n\nFinally, a mixture of sound and visuals. The dialog is pointless in it's current state. The game absolutely NEEDS voice acting to tell a story or cement this as a believable world. I thought it was cute when I dialed 911 and they got angry with me, but it lacked a ton that even lackluster voice-acting could have provided. To add to this problem, the subtitles of all speech including some from the player character (side note, if you spam certain objects like the kitchen faucet, the dialog text will show up again for every time it was pressed as you walk away), use a gross red text on a gradient transparent box covering most of the bottom of the screen. Small white text with a black stroke, and nothing else, is more than enough for subtitles. Similarly, the white text that pops up saying what objects do is pointless in 95% of the cases it's used, so it could be omitted along with a toning down of the border around intractable objects on hover. I feel no border, and a dynamic crosshair would serve that purpose far better.\n\nTLDR - Summary\n~IN PROGRESS~ The game needs a lot of reworking, bug fixes, and well, actual content. If it never changes from it's current state I could never recommend it, but that doesn't mean it can't eventually be a nice little game, and I hope this feedback helps work towards that. I'd hate to see all this effort so far go to waste.","September 7, 2015","false","1.1"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","23","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/privatehudson/recommended/352360/","privatehudson","PvtHudson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/privatehudson/","1409 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPretentious tripe.\n\nThis isn't a real game.\n\nSay what you will about "walking simulators" like Dear Esther or the numerous Crysis 1 mods that I helped beta test (Triptych, Worry of Newport)  but those were polished pieces of immersive fiction with fantastic graphics, audio/visual design, voice acting, and good stories.\n\nThis "game" has a good concept where your day to day actions will have consequences in your future. However, the "actions" presented in this game are pure nonsense.\n\nHere are some of the things that you can do in this game that will apparently have consequences in your future:\n1. Throw a football\n2. Play darts\n3. Answer the phone\n4. Play the horseshoe game\n5. Put 3 pieces of paper in a binder\n\nAnd the list goes on and on. These aren't real choices. This is rubbish. This is like claiming that if I have a chicken taco instead of a pizza, and if I have a cup of coffee instead of a bottle of Coke, that I'm going to become a nuclear scientist instead of a professor.\n\nEssentially this "game" is nothing more than picking up an object from one place and putting it in another. That is all it is. And depending on which of these actions you choose to do or not do, they will branch out in different "story" arcs which are once again nothing more than collect an object from one location and place it in another.\n\nI got the office job as the 2nd story arc and all it consisted of was 20 minutes of delivering files, making copies, and delivering mail.\n\nThe game looks like utter rubbish, looks nothing like the screenshots or the trailer. It also has an FOV of below 60, some sort of mouse lag/acceleration, and a head bob that makes it feel you are drunk. This is one of the most nauseating things I've experienced.\n\nI know this is in early access, but even if the above paragraph gets fixed, this game will still be nothing more than collecting objects from one location and placing them in another. And there is no way that they will finish this game in 1-2 months. The game is barebones with no music (unless you put a record on), barely any sound effects aside from your footsteps, and no voice acting.\n\nIf you like picking up objects from one place and putting them in another in total silence, then this game is for you.\n\nLike I said, the idea is good but the execution is nonexistent. If you want to make a game where your choices have consequences in your future, you need to put some ACTUAL choices in, not shooting a basketball or opening up drawers until the room lights up.\n\nThis is the way the game should be. Story arc 1 is you at home, your house got sold, and you're preparing things to leave to go live in your college dorm.  Your future life should be depended on things like the way you talk to your friends, your family, your girlfriend (and have actual conversations with dialogue), the way you spend your last day in the neighborhood you grew up in, what major you decide to pick for college, etc. And make all of this timed so that you can't do it all.\n\nInstead the game decides your future by throwing rocks in the river or putting an LP on. How does that even make any sense?\n\nStory arc 2 should be you in college instead of automatically placing you in a job.\n\nI can go on and on but I feel that is enough. I have no hope for this game. If it ever does get finished, I guarantee it'll be nothing more than it is right now. Picking up stuff from one location and putting them in another. And depending on what stuff you pick up, it'll branch the story off into another section where you get to do the same exact thing.\n\nI also made a video about it in case anyone is interested:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atRxrVGDM5c","July 12, 2015","false","1.1"," 31 of 53 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","31","53","4","0"

Continue does nothing. The game looks good.  I wish the person you first talk to had some more life to her. You talk to your girlfriend or boyfriend. Depends on what you pick when you start. I choose the girl. She looks good but doesnt have a lot of life to her. She stands in one place and moves her arms a little bit. She does talk but no lip sych and no voice.\n\nBasically you move around and fix things inside the house by grabbing things. The colors really pop thanks to the black and white effect that goes away once you complete some thing.  In the game you can play horse shoes, dart and basketball. No scoring is kept however so its more to show off the engine then anything else. Interesting gameplay features so far.Once you tired of the house click on the car to move on to your office job.  Ok so far I have completed the main game. If this is so then is woeful super super super short. One hour of gameplay more or less. Once you get to your office you supposed to deliever packages to folks inside the office. Once you get tired of this mini game then you can leave your office and the game is over. It has some kind of scoring systems and thats the game. The graphics inside the office do not look very good at all. The people are all the same and sitting in chairs. However they are floating besides their chair and not sitting in the chair at all. I had one package I had to deliever with the description of Large written on it. Thats when I gave up and left the office and got the game over.

In this story telling adventure game, every time you interact with a person or object, it colorizes itself.\n\nThis is a genius life metaphor where Action and reaction become a visual effect that shows you how every interaction affects your destiny. Choices lead to different paths, and by the end you see how many life options you’ve unlocked.\n\nThat being said, there aren’t a lot of objects to interact with. But that’s life.\n\n6 colors out of 10.","August 20, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Ever wonder about your actual life? Like after college, were those initial decisions the rights ones? Did it matter at all? It brought up issues with the balance between working for success and not wanting to die feeling you waisted those precious moments. What actual decisions might have a cause and effect on it? I feel the book "Tuesdays with Morrie" had a similiar message. They are on to something here. Can't wait to see where this experiment goes.\n\nThe graphics are a joy to look at. The open sandbox, explore, and interact gameplay expand on the unique story. If I had to choose a personal favorite feature, it would be the colors that come to life, progressing the storyline like something out of the cult classic movie "Pleasantville".\n\nGive this a try, let yourself wander and wonder how this game relates to your own personal story.","August 24, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

The puzzle although easy at time's made for a intresting expirence. Byfar however is the record player system that had me running down to the record player giddy to see what the next song was (Purple Record is by far the best). Overall a very intresting concept and look forward to the updates that will expand the world that is presented. The dialog could use a bit of work as it is very one sided. Overall the game looks like it will expand to something awesome.\n\nNote: Painting the walls was a bit difficult and resorted to throwing the paint brushes like darts.","June 26, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Got it, as soon as I saw it on steam thinking this would be something fun.

There are a few bugs and issues but It's in Early Access so that can be expected. The music and atmosphere are awesome and can completely relax you and let you enjoy the game with a better mind set than you may have had going into it for any reason (bad day at work, stressed, or haven't had your morning tacos yet).\n\nInitially I thought the $10 price tag is a bit high because of the Early Access issues but after reading the most recent post from the writer/designer, I believe that what I wouldn't have wanted to pay for the game, would go directly to wanting to support the people working on it.\n\nI got this game in a bundle and have more than gotten my monies worth. I am actually going to buy a copy or two for people because of how much I've enjoyed the game and how much I think others will like it too.","January 24","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would recommend this game as a wishlist item as it is an amazing concept and looks wonderful but would not recommend buying it yet as I own the game and have yet to be able to play it because even though I meet all criteria to play the game it will not open and on the rare occaision it doesnt crash right away it crashes as soon as i pick my background.  I hope this is fixed and am excited for if/when it is.","December 25, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
