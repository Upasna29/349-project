"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nyashechka/recommended/294580/","nyashechka","unknown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nyashechka/","952 products in account",""Freedom Is Not Free" - Walter Hitchcock, U.S. Air Force Colonel.\n\nThis game tells us about adventures of a small green fish called Luther who was sucked into the cave by whirlpool. The cave is populated by various kinds of fish. Water in cave is oxygenated - a lot of bubbles come from bottom all the time. Because of that all inhabitants are suffering inside those bubbles (remember, fish cannot live outside the water). Luther makes a tough decision to free them by shooting bubbles with his trusty slingshot, but in order to survive he has to take the food (worms) away from them. Does Luther truly realise the output of his actions? Can the unarmed liberated fish make its way outside the cave along with Luther or will they die without food inside bubbles? You will find the answer to these questions after 100 tough levels.\n\nThe game is cool, but don't play more than 10 levels at once - it becomes kinda boring so don't forget to make a break. You can press Control to change the direction Luther facing.","December 14, 2014","true","3.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","13","15","4","0"

It is more like a DLC, however. I recommend turning down your headphones before launching the game, as the audio is loud. The opening cinamatic sets up an interesting plot, when Luther falls into a cave as him and Freddi are out on a picnic. The graphics are really great, I'd say they are even as good, or better, than Battlefield 4's graphics. One of the complaints I have is that the backgrounds rarely changed, I finally got a new background 20 levels into the game!. Another complaint would be the option to cheat easily. At any point in the game you can just hover your mouse near the bottom of your screen to have a cheat menu to appear. Turning these on might be a good idea to get a general feel for the game, but I highly recommend turning them off once you get use to the controls since the cheats greatly take away from the games difficulty and enjoyment. I also feel like this game is just a cash-grab from the devs. I say this because you seldom, if at all, get to see the main character we all know and love; Freddi the fish. Hopefully with the upcoming "Dragon's Teeth" DLC we will be able to have more weapons, vehicles, enemies and more realistic, detailed NPCs.","May 19, 2014","true","1.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","11","13","5","0"

It's not very engaging and I have no memory of playing this one when I was younger. At least with Maze Madness there were designed levels, this is just very arcadey and bland.","July 31, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","0"

With that said the sheer amount of time it takes to get through levels means you'll still get a few hours out of this even as an adult. I'm just past level 50, no idea when this ends, and I'm already at nearly two hours of game play, (with only about 20 min afk). Overall great for kids, gets boring and repitative after a while for adults.","November 29, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
