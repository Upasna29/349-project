"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlequillybunny/recommended/400580/","littlequillybunny","♫Quilly Shiba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlequillybunny/","4312 products in account","One of my personal Games of the Year! Black Closet is developed by Hanako Games, which you may know from another game of theirs, Long Live the Queen. Black Closet packs intense and tactical gameplay with great storytelling, and I have yet to see a balance like this in other games. A heads up though, you may enjoy this game differently if the game play, as described below, isn't really your thing. The game also isn't easy (but there are options for that!) so there is definitely a learning curve.\n\nThoughts, game play wise:In Black Closet, you play as the student council president of a prestigious girls' boarding school. If solving mysteries and power is your thing, this probably already sounds interesting. Naturally, you have a lot of obligations and work to do though. The game play aspect of the game focuses on solving mysteries - if you succeed, you maintain your position, but if you fail, there are consequences, often long lasting. The game is a lovely combination of stats raising, resource management, and you must use a good combination of your skills versus your "enemies".\n\nEach case is randomly generated - if you play the game long enough you can kind of figure out some approaches to solve the cases, but they will not be the exact same. I loved how this game kept me on my toes the entire time, and it was the greatest feeling whenever I was able to solve a case on my own (felt lucky, oftentimes). Like real life, sometimes you will have a large amount of work dumped on you, but often there's actual scandal or dark intrigue involved (hopefully unlike your real life job).\n\nOverall you will need to keep track of your "minions'", which in this game means other student council members under you, and their stats as well as their loyalty. You then send them on different missions, which often don't take just one turn to solve, as you will have to gradually unravel mysteries, and battle using stats and dice rolls. So you'll really need to think tactically as there are all sorts of constraints against you, making the game really exhilarating to play. By the way, you could die as student council prez. You could die a lot.\n\nThoughts, story wise:Yes, there is very rich story in this game. Everything is a mystery that you have to unravel - the cases you solve are mini stories in themselves, but there is also lots of main story line, which is about the school, your minions, your past and present, and other secrets. There are character routes for each of your minions, with multiple endings for each. I've played two whole routes and some partial ones, and each one had me emotionally invested as well as hooked. Each girl has their own past, sometimes intertwined with yours/ Elsa's, and the writing is amazing. I was playing Vonne's route, and felt emotions that I rarely feel in real life... It's very rare that I see a game that has such good story but also mind blowing game play, so this combination definitely earned Black Closet a games of the year spot for me.\n\nOther things to know:The replayability is very high for this game - apart from trying to get each character route which takes many playthoughs, you can also start custom and random modes. You can amp up the difficulty, and choose to focus on just solving mysteries if you so wish. You can even upload custom character pictures! If you can think of something to do in this game, Hanako Games really got our backs for this title. The game ran flawlessly for me, and I didn't experience any performance issues at all.\n\nEnding remarks:I highly recommend this game, for the game play as well as the story. I personally found nothing bad to say about it, which is quite rare. There's very high replayability, deep, tactical gameplay, and lots of customization.\n\n~If you enjoyed this review, please check out the Completing the Backlog curator page, for other nice reviews by me and others!~","November 2, 2015","true","17.9"," 71 of 72 people (99%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","99","71","72","0","5"

But not just one or two mysteries; Dozens of tiny mysteries in each playthrough. Every week new cases hit your desk, and using your wits and skills of your faithful council members you must put together the clues and solve the cases before something terrible happens... or maybe it's all a red herring. Only by solving it will you be able to tell. Along the way you can make friends with your classmates, find romance, and uncover the darkest mysteries of the school.\n\nQuick Look:\n+Wide variety of case variants mean it's possible to play an entire game without repeating a case outcome\n+Solid writing and diverse and interesting characters\n+Easy to understand pass/fail check mechanics\n+-Art is usually great, but some assets are a bit rough\n\nEach case is a tiny story within itself with it's own cast of randomly generated charaters. While there are a set number of case types there are a large number of variations in the solutions to each case, so that you canplay an entire game without seeing a case variant repeat. Even once you've managed to learn all the different case variants there is no way to tell which variant youre dealing with until you begin investigating, making each case a race against the clock to solve it.\n\nThe cast is diverse and interesting and each route is different from the last. Each of the characters come with their own motivations and desires and the plots never fall into the predictable or cliche. There's hours of gameplay to be found in exploring all the different story paths. Once you've done that, there's also an unlockable freeplay mode where you can create a custom council of your very own and solve cases without the distractions of the plot.\n\nOverall, Hanako has delivered a solid and enjoyable game yet again and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys  tabletop inspired mechanics with a good story and enjoyable writing.","September 16, 2015","true","20.1"," 79 of 84 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","79","84","2","0"

I'm lazy enough to not write much so go figure, friends that read my reviews know I'll just write whatever comes to my head which can be either a lot or not much.\n\nThis game comes from Hanako Games, the makers of Long Live The Queen. I have a lot more than 8.5 hrs in the game, it should be at least a few days worth- I owned the game before it was on Steam, so that's just my steam play-time.\n\nBlack Closet is an interesting, logical investigation game. The mechanics are good and the game is fun. There's an achievement checklist and a decent amount of replay value. Investigations have different branches so they're not always the same, one of the core mechanics: who the Traitor is, changes each game, and there are at least six different storyline branches based on who you choose as Harvest Queen after the first major part of the story.\n\nThe game has different difficulty settings, and is challenging the first time around on default settings. Oh and this one is just a personal preference: I like the background musics on this one, they're relaxing to listen to and suit the theme well too.\n\nCheck out the screenshots and the video, if it seems like your kind of thing, I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.\n\nCheck Hanako Games if they like these too- they have more games that didn't come to Steam:\nhttp://www.hanakogames.com/\n\n\nUpdate: I forget there's a custom campaign mode too, which was added after I beat the game the first few times. Quoting the dev:\n\n"Normal campaign mode ends at the end of the school year, if you've made it that far. There are several ways it can end early.\n\nThere's also a custom campaign mode where you set how many weeks you want to play for and how many cases you want to handle every week. In that mode, you also get to use your own characters instead of the default ones, and can set yourself extra challenges like starting with a smaller team."","September 19, 2015","true","11.1"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

The characters are  well-written.  Your minions may seem like game tools at first (you use their special skills to question, harass, stalk, inspect witnesses, suspects and locations), but each one really has a background story with depth.  You can romance them to flesh out their full story line or just stay friends.\n\nThere's also a secret society and your college applications to worry about along with your love life.\n\nLike "Long Live the Queen", it did take me several play throughs before I successfully graduated and found out the saboteur.  There can be a lot of things to juggle at one time which can be overwhelming at first.

Actually achieving that goal requires a successful term as president of your school's student council, and achieving that goal requires putting the lid on several potential scandals without damaging your own credibility too badly. Let me tell you, there are a lot of potential scandals, and other forces at work may end up making your life more difficult. But first you need to identify and neutralize the traitor within your ranks...\n\nBlack Closet is about solving the mysteries in your school. A few times a week, one or two new cases will be brought before you, and it's up to you to get the bottom of them before they erupt into a scandal that could damage the school's reputation (maybe). Each of your minions has their own stats (which can be raised with point from successfully solved cases), and picking the right minion for the right job is critical to your success. Your targets have their own stats, and your minion can only get the right results if their stats are higher than their target's. Complicating this is chance itself - a twenty-sided die that adds a random number of points to each participant in a confrontation. Failed encounters during harsher actions like harassment or detention will make you look bad, as will targeting an innocent person. You have two bars measuring your success - School Reputation and Council Karma (measuring the student body's opinion of the council itself). Letting either fall to zero is a game over, as the higher-ups of your school will be all too happy to sacrifice you to save their own skins.\n\nThere's definitely replay value in Black Closet. The most obvious is the romance paths with each of your five minions (two of which have an a path and a b path), and it's only through these that you can completely unravel your minion's characters. Cases are randomly generated except for the big storyline ones (which can still have variations between them), and many cases start out similarly but have very different solutions. The traitor is also randomly chosen (though players who have beaten the game have the option of selecting the traitor herself), so targeting the same person in every playthrough will rarely work. And of course, if you just want to solve mysteries free of plot-involvement, there's a custom campaign mode that allows you to create your own minions and work on cases alone for a set number of weeks (though careful! That mode has its own special challenges).\n\nMusic and graphics set the mood (and please don't ignore art style 1 when it comes to CGs).The writing is solid, as it needs to be for a game like this and as it typically is for a Hanako Games product. Characters may seem like simple at first, but each have their own personalities and motivations which become clear in their own routes (and makes how any of your minions could be the traitor feel natural). And of course not everything's serious - sometimes humor is found where one least expects it.\n\nHighly recommended.","October 28, 2015","true","99.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It's your job to protect the school from scandals by rooting out the illicit activities of your fellow students. But as the president you don't have to get your hands dirty, that's what your minions are for. They do your bidding, and may try to undermine you, and it's up to you to train them up and make the best use of their skills.\n\nBut the weekly issues are only the background for the larger mysteries surrounding your school and you've got to solve them if you want to make it to graduation in one piece.\n\nI've completed the game twice so far and found that it takes roughly 3-5 hours for a single playthrough. Depending on how much reading you do. For those of you worried about replayability, don't. The cases you're assigned each week are randomized. You'll never get the same cases in the same order and each case is always slightly different.

I feel I am understating.\n\nThis game is full of mystery, darkness, wonderfulness, and intrigue.\n\nIt plays out as a board game. Resource management, sending out your minions to solve cases within the school. It's also got a lot of VN segments, where you get to talk to your minions, possibly date them, and also work out which of them is a traitor. Then there is some further mystery which I am not going to talk about at all because spoilers.\n\nBut let me tell you; the girls are a mystery too. Over your playthroughs you will get to unravel their personailities. And more! It is delicious.\n\nIs there replayability? Yes. Every time you play, the traitor is different, and the cases within the board game are different. Plus, there are so many choices you can make in the VN side of the game, and find out more what's going on, what you can do about it, and about the girls and romancing them... and you can walk yourself into a lot of different outcomes. There are a lot of layers to work out, and it's a ton of fun to do so.\n\nI just worked out how to resolve things in a certain way last night, and I felt like "this is epic!

The randomly-generated cases work well with a surprising amount of variety in the possible outcomes, and the resource/time management aspects of creating tension and leading to interesting dilemmas regarding who should be sent where.\n\nThe story and dialogue gets a bit melodramatic at times, but it feels appropriate for a game about conflicts between high school girls at an all-female academy. I enjoyed the character development that I saw (I didn't complete everyone's story arcs), even though most of them start off as pretty standard archetypes. To me, at least, the constant stream of cases does a good job of alleviating a major issue with visual novels: every playthrough is unique! The standard "pick these options to go down this path" setup still exists, but the player isn't just fast-forwarding through the rest of the game during subsequent playthroughs.\n\nTo be honest, Black Closet is a tough sell at full price; it's a fascinating concept that's executed reasonably well, but it doesn't feel meaty or polished enough for $20. Once it's on sale, though? If you're at all intrigued by this game, get it!","October 9, 2015","true","20.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Game of the year!\n\nBut in all seriousness, this game is very well written, complex, and immersive. Ive never played a game with a romance sim undertone, where you were a dominate female. Usually in a F/F romance setting your almost always submissive and loyal, almost to a fault... not this game. It puts you in the roll strong female lead that commands respect both on the job, and with her romance choices XD. It handles the somewhat taboo themes with extrodinaire taste, that is a real joy to watch unfold. Your not so domineering that your crushing your romance options spirit or mind, your simply being the master and commander, they swoon at the knees for.\n\nOh... and then there's the actual investigation/gameplay. Its pretty fun and engaging, it doesnt really get old like you might think it would, the random elements and the variety of options on how to solve the case, keeps it fresh\n\nOne little complaint is the difficulty. It can be unforgiving at times, even if you know what your doing, which the first time you play, you wont. The random hand of fate can turn into a fist and swing the entire game into a doomed scenerio, so save often... not that you CAN. You can only save at the end of each week, which is a real pain, when you have to go through scenes and even dates over and over again if your trying to tip toe over failing a crucial investigation.\n\nSpeaking of early on difficulty, there's a traitor in your team, and the way you deal with it requires you to A. Befriend them by going on outtings with them so they feel to guilty to betray the team. Or B. Figure out whose the one failing on purpose through trial and error (you'll have to do that anyways to find out who they are.) and then EXPEL them from the school, and thus expelling them from the game!  SO you'd have to finish the game with only 4 henchmen, not 5, each one bringing vital skill combinations to the table. This wouldnt be such an issue, if it wasnt for the fact you dont have enough outtings to fully befriend more then 2 people, so I recomend saving after the first week and if its impossible for you in other saves AFTER figuring out who the traitor is, going back and making sure you fully befriend them as well as your romance interest of choice. This is actually alot of work, so this game isnt just a tip toe through the toolips, it requires throught and planning.\n\nBUT those are just minor annoyances, that Im not sure if I would even want to change, but their there.

In this newest release, you take on the role of Elsa, the newly elected class president of St. Claudine's (a private girls' school), and it is your job to solve various cases presented by students and faculty.  Otherwise, scandals could break out and ruin the school's reputation and/or the students' trust in you.  Along the way, you learn that there is a traitor among your minions (one of five students who will help you to solve cases) whom you have to discover and either you can befriend them or expose them.\n\nOf course, there is more than simply solving cases and such.  As there are five minions who will work for you, there are five paths that you can pursue.  Three of these are romanceable while two are more friendship paths (although it's interesting to see what unfolds if you try to pursue romance with those paths).  Although I enjoyed trying out all the paths, I preferred the friendship paths but this may be more of a personal preference than anything else.\n\nIn regards to the gameplay, I enjoyed it very much.  I loved solving the various cases given and even when you may be given the same type of case, it may not be solved in the same way as a previous playthrough.  Thinking through the cases and finding out the best and most efficient way to solve them is key to earning the best case grades and accompanying skill points with which you can use to train your minions to be better at certain skills, such as observation and stealth.\n\nThere are a total of 16 achievements that you can earn so there's definitely a lot of playability to be had in Black Closet.  Also, there are two art sets (for both CGs and character sprites) so if there's one that you prefer over the other, you can choose to your heart's content.  Even after you earn all the achievements and finish all the character paths, there is still replayability to be had.  There is a customized mode where you can add in and/or design your own minions and determine their skill values and set the number of weeks within which you wish to solve cases.\n\nBlack Closet is such a wonderful game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Hanako Games or even if you're a fan of VNs and life sims.  There are VN aspects in this game as well as the element of solving cases.  It's a great game to have and I have to say that now I'm having difficulty determining if I like Black Closet or Long Live the Queen, as the latter was my favorite game before Black Closet's release.  ^^","September 21, 2015","true","35.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

It's much less "visual novel" -- there's still that component to it, but the gameplay is a bit tighter. The interface is awful; it's hard to see what you have selected and awkward to navigate -it should be simple to click on 3 things but this game makes it annoying and easy to mess up. The mini-mysteries you solve are kind of repetitive -- you'll see the same ones come up multiple times though theyc an have different solutions. Still, they're fun to figure out and try to optimize.\n\nThe romance aspect is interesting -- in LLTQ you barely got to know the princes you could choose to marry, but in this the romantic partners all have seperate (mostly stereotypical anime girls, but with a twist) identities and since you have a lot of chances to interact with them, you develop a strong connection.\n\nAside from interface woes, this game is a lot of fun.

As with most Hanako games, the game is broken up into weeks. Instead of studying magic and dating demons, you solve cases and dominate other women in your off time.\n\nThe cases themselves are fun and rewarding to solve, but at times can become overwhelming when your specialist minions are otherwise occupied. Typical case solving falls into searching, questioning, staking-out, and punishing. All of the cases have more than one solution and plot, with most having 3-4. Overall, the cases are interesting enough to grab the player's attention, while still giving the story and character interactions room to breathe.\n\nDuring the weekends and sometimes during the week you get to meet with your fellow councilors and do lewd things have pleasant conversations about tea. Ultimately, as seen in the other Hanako games, plot and characters take a backseat and let the gameplay speak towards the quality. While written well enough to make you want to get all the Yuri scenes complete the game, you can tell that it's certainly not the primary focus of the game's design. Certainly not a visual novel, but the story and characters are nice enough.","October 2, 2015","true","12.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

You are given a team of student countil members to help you maintain order and reputation at the school.\n\nThe first third of the game features your interaction with your board members and your attempt to discover the traitor amongst your team. Finding the traitor isn't necessarily difficult -- the traitor will tend to perform less adequately than your other team members. Otherwise, however, you get to interact with the team, and through this interaction you learn more about who they are. The characters themselves are relatively deep and well constructed; I think the art is a bonus in this regard, as it serves as another means of discerning how they act and what their personalities are.\n\nThroughout the game, you will be attempting to solve "cases", which are events that occur at the school. They represent typical happenings at a boarding school: vandalism, missing persons, etc. The overall breadth of possible random events is not very big -- you will face multiple repeats of past events. Luckily, the outcomes of the events change. For example, in my playthrough, I encountered the "cheating" event multiple times. One of the times, it turned out to be a cheating ring led by multiple girls; however, another time, it was merely a coincidence. Thus, you cannot assume the outcome of the events, even if you have played the event before. Nonetheless, you do fall into some patterns with the events -- for example, with a certain event, it eventually becomes obvious that it is more important to search for clues at key locations rather than interrogate the suspects. Nonetheless, it manages to stay entertaining throughout the play experience.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very interesting, with opprotunities to ponder statistics and strategies of handling the events. Rarely do you have only one event occuring at a time; thus, time management is a crucial aspect because each of your team members can only investigate one location or person at a time. Thus, there are some times when you may need to perform a cost benefit analysis to determine whether one event is more important to investigate than another, or if one event is a decoy that does not threaten the reputation of the school. Additionally, each of the student government councilors are better at certain actions over others, requiring specific thought as to who is best to assign for missions.\n\nThere are romance subplots in the game, and they are decently well executed. One complaint about the romance sub plots is that those dialogues will completely eclipse most other interraction with your team members, meaning that you lose the opportunity to learn more about your other council members. I assume this is to add to the replayability.\n\nSpeaking of replayability, I think there is significant room for replaying the game, as the events themselves are constantly changing. The traitor is also random, so you do not know who is sabotaging your investigations. Each playthrough will take a minimum of three or four hours, so it isn't a terribly long game, but the replayability is a factor working in its favor. The game itself is reasonably difficult as well, providing enough of a challenge to remain interesting.\n\nAs mentioned, the artwork is certainly aesthetically pleasing, as well as the music and sound effects.\n\nThe real quandary concerning this game is whether it is worth the price listed. I procured my copy for approximately $12. While that feels just a tad too high of a price for this game, I certainly do not regret the purchase, and I believe that developers who put forth the effort to create a quality product should be rewarded. If the price drops to $10 or less, this is absolutely a game I would recommend without question.\n\nIn closing, I do recommend this game in most aspects. The lack of a large pool of possible events is a little unfortunate, but otherwise I find it to be an engrossing game that features unexpected needs for strategic thought and statistical inference. A good game and a great playing experience.","December 31, 2015","true","11.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You play as student council president Elsa Jackson, who is tasked with quashing scandals and keeping up appearances in a sophisticated all-girls' high school. Also on the Council to assist you are your minions: popular flirt Althea, her stubborn and opinionated sister Thaïs, naive newcomer Mallory, unusually competent Vice President Vonne, and antisocial Rowan.\n\nEach week, you receive a couple of cases and have to assign your minions to various tasks, such as questioning witnesses or searching crime scenes. The girls have different stats that will determine their success or failure when executing their assignments. In the background, you also have some overarcing plot cases to solve; one of your minions is a traitor, and you have a limited amount of time to figure out which girl it is and deal with her in one way or another. And then there are the outside enemies that your advisor, Miss Talmage, alludes to, such as a mysterious group called the Red Mask that seem to know lots of things they shouldn't, such as where you sleep.\n\nIt's a rather difficult game, difficult enough at times that you can tell it's made by the same developer as Long Live the Queen, but there are tricks to learn that make it easier, and the game also includes an easy mode (which was not included when I initially played waaaaay back in the pre-Steam days, but am happy to play with now). The mysteries are interesting, and your fellow council members are all well-developed. Elsa is somewhat unique in that you get to choose everything she says (from a visual novel list of options, of course), and what you pick will affect her characterization and what your minions think of you, especially if you're on a romance path.\n\nAnd the art and soundtrack are both beautiful. You actually get two art sets to choose from, the original art set and a new one that was added in later versions of the beta. Truthfully, I prefer the first one and am not sure why the second one gets all the focus in screenshots, but both have their merits. (And you have to earn CGs in both art sets, so you'll be seeing a lot of them either way.)\n\nUpon completing the game you unlock custom minion mode, which lets you create your own council and is rather fun to play around with. You also get the ability to choose who the aforementioned traitor is at the beginning of a normal game, which makes things easy for completionists.\n\nAll in all, another excellent Hanako Games title and well worth your money to pick up.","September 16, 2015","true","2.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Because it's set in England.\n\nBlack Closet is a game where you order your minions to stalk and harass schoolgirls, join cults and manipulate everyone around you. Think I'm exaggerating? I'm not.\n\nConduct investigations into various cases around an all-girls boarding school. Forged test results, secret societies and lesbian love affairs are just some of the cases that you may be assigned. Each case is randomly generated and can have a different outcome, making each playthrough a unique experience. There are aslo special cases that can result in a game over if you fail, so make sure your minions are properly trained.\n\nThe other side of this game is a basic dating sim. It doesn't have to be a romantic relationship, but you will get a choice of following one of your five minion's storylines early in the game. This part of the game remains the same, but characters will have different responses to your different dialog options. The only major things that these affect are mostly whether you end up in relationship with your chosen character. Otherwise, this whole segment doesn't have a huge impact on the game other than sometimes affecting the loyalty of your minions, which really only comes into play at the final part of the game.\n\nYou have the choice of five lovely ladies as your love interest.\n\nAlthea - The school floozy.\nThais - The prissy posh one. Well, posh-er. It's a private school, so you know.\nVonne - The token childhood friend character that is so devoted to you that it borders on creepy.\nMallory - The cute, bubbly one. I think she's American or something.\nRowan - The shut-in. You know, like the one that's in every anime ever?\n\nTheir stories develop the more intimate you get with them. Typically, the story arc wraps up when you acheive maximum romance. Your reward for this is a single picture of your own character and chosen love interest giving eachother a big ol' smooch. So, those of you who want to buy this game purely for that (and we all know that some people do) you have your work cut out for you.\n\nAt the end of the day, I reccomend this game. A nice blend of strategy and mystery, easy to get in to and a decent story. Plenty of replayability so you'll definitely get your money's worth, especially if you grab it in a sale.\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about the game, read a real review.

A great atmosphere and intriguing cases to solve, while making sure to keep your balance between karma and reputation, was quite engaging.\n\nThe characters you interact with, were quite good and were interesting, but nothing groundbreaking. Never the less, they helped move everything along and were hardly 1-dimensional. My one complaint about setting was the whole “ruthless leader” image they try to force. (why do I consider the counsel members “minions” again?). It's a bit eye-rolling, especially when you can be quite nice at times, and you are just trying to keep these dang students from burning the school down (quite literally at times).\n\nThe only real flaw is that the game could really use some sort of tutorial or guide for the more confusing parts of the game. It took me almost half the game to figure out how to properly detain a lot of troublemakers, and i lost a lot of reputation just because I knew who the troublemaker(s) were but had no idea on how to get them to stop. Another example was the boss of the game, the “fight” was just given to me, and having not EVER to deal with the new game mechanic, I had to intentionally lose, just to find out what everything did.\n\nIn the end tho, the game was a unique experience that I had fun playing, and ignoring a few bumps, always kept me on the edge of my seat.","September 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The one major negative for me was the fact that the gameplay doesn't at all build on itself/prepare you for the endgame challenges.  You get a tutorial on solving cases, and just as you're starting to feel like you've gotten the knack for those in your first playthrough, you're getting near the end of the game and finding that you lack the appropriate stats to handle the plot-advancing cases.  If you scrape through those, the final boss encounter will still wipe the floor with you.  It's very much a game to play once expecting to lose and then look up a guide for, because there is no natural progression that leads you to expect what you will have to do at the end (or otherwise forces you to build your team to a degree that will let you handle it).","December 7, 2015","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Putting you in the role of the new leader of a shadowy, excessively powerful student council in a prestigious girls' academy, Black Closet tasks you with juggling the various goings-on at St. Claudine's, as well as among your henchwomen. One great strength of the game is its use of randomization. In most games of this sort (if there were very many of this sort), you could safely bet anything that crosses your desk represents a time-bomb waiting to be defused. But that isn't necessarily the case! Some situations can be conclusively proven to have been nothing after all - and other, more ambiguous ones may leave you wondering if you need to keep digging to get to the truth, or stop picking at the "problem" and focus your resources elsewhere while it sorts itself out. Even of those that really do represent some kind of skullduggery that warrants your intervention, the same (apparent) situations may have wildly different causes and solutions. The characters aren't earthshattering, but they're well-written and reasonably nuanced. The replay value isn't fantastic, but some major random variables (like exactly who - if anyone? - in your organization is actually a mole) keep some curveballs coming your way. All told, if you've ever had any fondness for the archetypal "shadowy student council" in some school-setting anime/manga, this will probably suit you nicely.","May 8","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Both packs are hideous.\nSecond, it's not a roguelike where you take a lot of notes and eventually win. It's a gambling game where you take a lot of notes and eventually win - maybe, if you're lucky. You *can* influence every roll outcome but unless you already know every bit of gameplay, the d20 die will decide your fate.\n\nThere are about 30 rolls or so between every save point. Losing a roll means paying with your karma, school reputation or time. When you're out of time you lose karma and school reputation.\n\nThe visual novel bit doesn't make the game easier, it makes it more difficult (except for the Red Mask who can make your life much better in return for some nasty favors). More girls you have, the less you need to take notes and memorize every possible case. You can also completely screw up the story and find yourself in a personal hell. Oh, did you put all the training points in Intimidation for this girl? Well she's furious now for her own story reasons, so say goodbye and enjoy it.\n\nThis game is not fair, it's presented as a strategy but in reality it's just a gambling game.","January 4","false","2.4"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","12","28","2","0"

While your investigation checks do use rng, It's mainly based on your stats. Those can only be raised by completing missions, and the amount of stat points you get are based on how effectively, and quickly, you complete a case. This, combined with multiple cases, and your 4 minions having a fatigue bar to manage, and the game is quite challenging, at least so far.\n\nLike Long Live the Queen you can fail a skill check (and in this game cases) without getting a game over, though you have to maintain your school reputation, as well as that of the student council, so the more quests you fail, or the more inappropriate actions you take, the sooner you're going to fail the game.\n\nI haven't fully figured out the optimal strategy yet, but the game is a lot of fun. The RNG element is also great, since it prevents this game from becoming the mindless walkthrough game some people thought Long Live The Queen was.\n\nAs far as cons for the game go, I don't have many. I think one of the cons I have is sometimes the RNG is brutal. To give an example, I got a case that should have been open and shut. A girl stole another girls watch, after saying she was interested in it. I searched her room and found evidence the girl had the watch, and she acted suspicious when questionsed about it. However I failed to get a skill check that passed by enough to actually pin the blame on her. This escalated to the point where she stole from 5 more girls, and tanked the school reputation so hard, that about a month later my game came to an end.\n\nAt the time of writing this I've only played about 3.5 hours, so I haven't seen if that type of quest difficulty is common, though the fact that level of rng can exist is a little annoying.\n\nBesides that unlucky rng though I have no real complaints about this game.\n\nWith multiple character routes, I believe you can get at least 20-30 hours of content from this game, possibly more if you fail a lot while learning the mechanics. With that being the case I strongly recommend this game, especially if you can get it on sale.","October 10, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a game I think EVERYONE will love, but if you're a fan of detective games with good plotlines, you will definitely be happy with it. It seems simple at first, but you'll quickly realize how difficult it is to keep all of your karma and reputation intact. The dating portion is pretty solid, taking on the feeling of a good visual novel style of game.\n\nThe case aspect, for me, is a bit difficult - not only realizing what needs to be done in some cases, but I also don't understand the case rating system. I've failed some and gotten a C, and solved one in two days (that could have ONLY been solved on day 1 by gambling that I'd interrogate 3 characters successfully) and gotten a D. I think that would be my biggest concern in gameplay, because otherwise, I'm digging the stats and D-20 system.\n\nThey've added tons of replayability, with different story paths for different choices, 5 romance options, case endings differentiating, and randomizing the traitor. I'm absolutely going to continue playing, and will likely play it again!","January 7","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
