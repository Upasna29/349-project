The chainsaw gives you the most money per tree, everything else earns you less so there is no point in buying machinery. You also move the fastest while on foot, when strafing, the vehicles are super slow. Oh and you also fall through the terrain constantly, there is even a button for resetting your vehicle when it happens so it's not like the developers didn't know about it.","December 19, 2013","false","2.4"," 738 of 824 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","738","824","5","9"

You wonder who you are and why you are in front of a house. Right about when you get your bearing you are informed that if you cut down 8 trees in a forest on the other side of town you will be paid $12,000. They don’t phone you or contact you in any way to relay this information but you just know... maybe this is all in your head? All you know is that you accepted this commitment and have only 2 hours and 30 minutes to deliver. You look around, you have no mode of transpiration and no real indication of how you got there. The only option is to walk, or in this case sprint. As you are running through town you notice that there are other houses, other cars parked but no people. You run through the entire town and haven’t seen a single person or any signs of life at all. You arrive at the forest where you will begin your job. You find a flagged tree, carefully position yourself in front of it and get to work. After what feels like forever you finish your last tree. You are informed you have finished your job and money appears in your account. Except you don’t have a bank account, it just appears as if somehow you just know you have more money now. You are informed of another job, this one for 3 trees to be cut down next to a farm on the other side of town. You decide that you will spend your money on a van to drive there, everything goes black. You wake up in the middle of town in a van with no indication on how you got there. Who did you buy the van from? Where are they now? These questions will have to wait as your job ahead at the farm has you feeling anxious. You start to drive to the farm when you notice the van says you are traveling at 80 yet you are going slower than you can run. You do not see anyone anywhere in the town, everything feels wrong. The way the van drives, the way it just kind of rotates on its axis instead of steering. You pass the farm and stop dead in your tracks. There is a cow! You jump out of your van and run over to see the only other living thing in this entire world. The cow does not move it just stands there staring at you. You position yourself in front of the cow and look into its eyes and all you see is blackness. The game is over.","January 5, 2014","false","1.1"," 110 of 118 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","110","118","14","11"

You wonder who you are and how you got there, and why you are standing next to three recycle bins. You see a tree and you decide you want to cut it down. You run up to it in super lag at 1fps and try to stick the chainsaw which you don’t know how you got into the tree. You try to start the chainsaw but it says you are holding the chainsaw in the wrong position. So you give up and decide to explore. But then, all of the sudden, you feel the need that you need to cut down some trees. You have no way of getting this information, you just know in your mind that you must cut down three trees. So you decide to cut down these trees and you realize that you can run faster sideways than you can forwards. You don’t know why, you just do. In your head you visualize a map. You have no way of getting this map, you just picture it (in the top-right corner of your screen). You run to this place where you feel the trees are and you magically stop. You have reached the end of the world. Small world right? Then you turn around and you see a hideous, very scary sight. You see…a mountain that is literally covered in trees!!! Then you see a crane and decide to jump in it so that you don’t have to look at that hideous mountain anymore. You don’t know how you got in it or what you pressed, but you’re magically in the crane. You can’t get out. You’re stuck. The game is over.\n\nSecond In-Game Adventure: You start out as a random guy with a chainsaw standing in front of a house and you see that you are next to four recycling bins. You once again wonder who you are and how you got there, and why there are now four recycling bins. Maybe the garbage man came and dropped off another one? These questions remain in your head leaving you in confusion. You see a tree once again and you decide you want to cut it down. You think that maybe this time the chainsaw will actually start…You thought wrong. Once again the chainsaw doesn’t move. You decide that maybe this tree just has problems and doesn’t like you so you decide to run away from this tree that doesn’t seem to like you and you run up a hill. You then remember that you can run faster sideways than you can forwards. You don’t know why, you just do. So you awkwardly run sideways until you come to another tree. You think that this one looks more friendly and will want to be your friend so you can cut it down…You thought wrong. As soon as you get up to the tree and raise your chainsaw, the tree pulls you into it. You don’t know how, since you were standing about 5 ft. away from the tree. How can this be? You are stuck with these puzzling questions waiting to be answered. Anyway, the tree pulls you into it and you go into the tree. You don’t know how, all you know is that you are now inside the tree. But then, things get much more scary. You then fall out of the tree and start falling into a world of whiteness. You look up and you can see that you have fallen out of the world. You can see the bottom of the world fading as you fall farther and farther into the world of whiteness. You look down into the whiteness. It looks very…white. But then, as you start to think that things can’t get any worse…You thought wrong. Black and white lines cover up your screen. Everything fades. The game crashes. You are back at your desktop. Worst simulator game ever…","June 26, 2014","false","0.8"," 83 of 94 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","83","94","5","6"

Set in a presumably German valley, the player can hear a constant and unyielding cacophony of chirping of birds in the distance.\n\nWith regard to the presentation of violence against trees, you're limited to accepting a contract with specifically designated markers. In order to fulfill this, the player walks towards the tree, checks the radar on the bottom right, and begins to rip into that deciduous flesh. Upon felling the great beasts with the chainsaw you'll hear their moaning creaks and be treated to a third person perspective of the tree collapsing.\n\nUnfortunately the engine does not model physics too well and you're not free to hack away at trees. The act of cutting down a tree is simply a matter of pressing a button and watching an animation. So with all of this in mind I'd say that only simulation devotees and people like myself who enjoy investigating the curios of Steam should pick up this title.","December 19, 2013","false","1.8"," 252 of 357 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","252","357","0","5"

Lots of them. Initially with a chainsaw. For each tree, you need to watch a minute (60 seconds) of unskippable animation that is the same every time, accompanied by cheesy "best of telephone hotline" synth music. This game is making me lose my will to live.\n\nYou'll be bored to tears before you earn enough money to buy the more interesting equipment, and there's no guarantee the boredom will stop even then. I haven't gotten that far yet.\n\nOther "features" include\n* plenty of invisible walls\n* water that doesn't actually do anything (who needs bridges)\n* shoddy modeling (saw one house sunk into the ground up to the windowsills)\n* shoddy forests, looks more like trees stuck on a meadow than natural growth\n* does not actually simulate woodcutting, merely animates it\n* walking is faster than driving\n* the game gives you hours to complete tasks done in minutes\n* glitches galore (autojumps high when running over small obstructions, saw sound continues when going to the pause menu, sun still makes shadows when set and below the horizon, you can fell yellow-banded trees anywhere, not just where your mission says you should - just keep felling in the forest you're in, game puts you in the car no matter where it is - leave cars at different points on the map to travel quickly, van drives 70 km/h over any type of terrain).\n* more boring than any truck simulator in existence\n\nWoodcutter Simulator doesn't actually simulate woodcutting. The "tree radar" is ridiculous, the chainsaw felling technique is downright dangerous (always cut with the side of the saw, never the tip; do remove the wedge after cutting it; the wedge cut should only cut 1/3 to 1/4 of the diameter into the tree; the back cut needs to be at least 1 inch higher than the bottom of the wedge), and the direction the tree falls in bears no relation to the direction of my cut (I've had some trees fall towards me, even). Falling trees can't get stuck on other trees, and there would be no way to free them if they did because you can't fell trees the game doesn't let you (another indication that this is not a simulator).\n\nI recommend this game to people who enjoy the feeling of having wasted their money, or who like to show off to others what truly boring games they own. Everyone else, don't buy at any price.\n\nGoing outside and watching the gras grow will be a better use of your time than seeing badly modeled trees fall in badly done "simulation".","July 9, 2014","false","3.4"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","44","50","0","0"

Its true that I have not progressed very far however I feel the game lacks polish. It was glitchy and crashes anytime i plug in the power cord while running on battery. I also wound up walking on top of trees after finding I was unable to climb up a hill trying to get to my objective. The game and interface are not very intuitive. Figuring out where to go on the tiny minimap is confusing (the tutorial is no help being simply a series of 20 second text overlay videos pointing out UI elements), and once you do reach an area figuring out how to use the chainsaw is frustrating. Once you do it simply turns out to be finding the right spot to stand and pressing the action button, no skill or planning involved. The game would certainly be a lot better if it had a more open world sandbox feel. If I were Stihl I would be dissapointed that customers were having this experience with the starting chainsaw being prominently branded.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltyvampire/recommended/267610/","saltyvampire","Salty Vampire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltyvampire/","531 products in account","I launched this game with some hope. That hope started to die away as I heard the hideous title music, steriotypical of most simulators. I pushed it aside, and continued to browse the menu. I was vaguely impressed by the animation from the main menu to the options menu, and was impressed further still with the video settings. The audios settings were detailed enough, however the controller settings didn't exist. The only options were to invery the 'y' axis and change sensitivity, nothing to do with the actual assignments. So I clicked 'New game'. It gave me the option to do a tutorial or start. So I clicked tutorial, only to descover to tutorial to be a low quality video lacking any form of audio. So, I weeped inside as I saw the last flicker of hope die away, but still I continued and started the game.\n\nThe game loaded quickly, for me to be stood with a chainsaw, and no form of instructions on how to move or do anything. So, I used my instints and placed my fingers on WASD. Surely enough, I moved as normal. However, when it came to looking around, moving the mouse only moved an on-screen cursor, not changing the direction I was looking at all. Again, I used my instincts and held the right mouse button and moved the mouse again, this time the camera moved. I cried some more as I moved about, being forced to strain my finger by having to hold right click for the whole period of play, similar to 'Roblox'. The difference with 'Roblox', however, is that 'Roblox' has some redeeming features. 'Woodcutter Simulator 2013' however, does not. I then attempted to acheive something in the game. I pressed space, expecting to jump, as the game told me I was in the wrong position to use the machine. I so assumed jumping didn't exist. It may still do, but the game seems to lack a control guide of any description, so I can never know. There was a gloing booklet on the UI, and I clicked it. It brought up a quest to chop 4 trees down in the New Forest and an option to accept, decline, or cancel. I clicked accept and a 1 1/2 hour timer came up with 0/4 trees chopped down. I looked at the godawful minimap in the top left and assumed the large tree was my destination. Sure enough, when I got there there was a glowing arrow above it. On my way, I discoved something the game DOESN'T lack in; Invisible walls. I spent a long time trying to find my way around them, like some sort of sick, twisted maze. I wandered around, hoping to find some option to cut a tree down, and none appeared. Some trees had yellow bands on them, and so I walked up to one of them. A radar with a dot on appeared in the bottom right, and I used common sense to figure that the tree was the dot. I got the dot in the centre of the radar, and pressed space. I then started to cut the tree down. About 40 SECONDS later, the tree finally toppled. It's leaves then popped off, throwing the tree into a wild spasm. I was then released from the cutscene, only to find the tree had not registered as one of the 4 I had to chop down. About 20 seconds later, it registered, and I moved onto the other 3. I finished this, only to find yet another quest to chop down 3 more trees a 5 minute walk away. That's 5 minutes PLUS finding your way around invisible walls. I still feel like I have acheived precisely nothing after 2 quests and a whole lot of finger strain.\n\nOverall, this game is utter ♥♥♥♥♥. An ocean with the depth of a tide pool. Drowning in mediocrity.\n2/10 for you number-hunting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Do not recommend.","February 3, 2014","false","0.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoderJet/recommended/267610/","CoderJet","Coder Jet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoderJet/","667 products in account","Oh what a gift this was! This was my first Simulator game, and my oh my what a terrible experience it was.\n\nThis game is riddled with bugs, which makes me question whether it even went through any quality control what so ever. The first bug I experienced was a lack of control of where the hell my guy was moving, at first I thought my 360 controller fell off my tower again and the analogue stick was wedged forward, but sadly it was not the case. Other bugs which players may encounter are:\n- Loading a save game and falling through the world.\n- Just falling through the world in general randomly.\n- Trees falling through the world after being cut down.\n- Trees falling on vehicles and knocking them over.\n- Sprinting into a vehicle can launch the player into the sky (Actually the best part of the game when I got it to work).\n- Driving through trees!\n- Random invisible walls when trying to skip across the terrain when the objective is just behind the hill you're trying to get over.\n- Trees not falling over after cutting them, which means you need to shunt it with a vehicle for it to fall. Otherwise you can't cut down another tree...\n- Random game crashes\nOther than the horde of bugs, sorry I mean features, which this game has to offer it lacks a tutorial which informs you how you actually play this game e.g. how and what trees you are allowed to cut down. This was not so obvious at first, this teaches me for not playing the 2012 version eh? Anyway, there are video 'tutorials', but the videos are just soundless with text displayed at the bottom giving you of very little detail, maybe the developers couldn't record them selves talking without laughing hysterically at what they've thrown together. These videos also don't play some times, I had to restart the game a couple of times in order to to watch all of the videos.\n\nThe map is fairly big and you have no vehicle to help get you around any quicker. But you know, having vehicles in this game is rather pointless because all you need to do is sprint and move diagonally in order to launch yourself across the map to get to where ever you wanted to go. You don't even need to change 'location' to cut the trees you need, you can stay in the same area for a couple of missions until all the cut-able trees are gone, then you sadly have to move once again across the map to cut that last tree you need to earn that sweet sweet 3,000 something. I have no idea what the currency is in this game, perhaps you're paid in wood for the wood you've just wooded (Sounded a lot better in my head).\n\nI could go on and on about the many delights which this game has to offer, but I will say this...It is a terrible game with no clear goal to start with or to continue with. There is no real involvement in cutting the trees, you just need to position yourself and hit the 'GO' button. This game is not worth the full price, nor is it worth half price. At best this game is a gag game to give your friend on his birthday, or a game to gift some one just to show them how much you loathe them.\n\nCan't wait for Woodcutter Simulator 2014.","December 26, 2013","false","5.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

Although my Intel HD 4000 card is quite adequate to play Portal and Demolition simulator at full resolution. For Woodcutter you need a high end card.\n* You have no control over the tree chopping process which is automatic once you have lined yourself up in front of the tree. At this point you may wish to have a tablet or book to hand to entertain yourself while the tree is being felled. Each tree takes 2 or 3 mins to fell.\n* If you buy the tractor chainsaw you might think you would be able to chop trees down more quickly to accelerate advancement though the game, but no, it actually makes tree felling slower.  This is because it takes much longer to line yourself up by the tree and the felling process is more or less the same. Just going into reverse takes a few seconds to achieve.\n* After felling many trees you finally have the chance to own a logging truck and the prospect of doing something else besides watching the chainsaw on autopilot. This you are promised in the manual. YES!. But wait, the assignments are exactly the same as before. I tried a few. I contacted support about this and they assured me the assignments would change after a while. 5 or 6 assignments later, and still I only get trees to chop down. Sorry I am completely bored out of my skull and can no longer bear to play your stupid game.\n* UIG support is slow to respond and not very helpful.","January 31, 2014","false","11.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andy2fine/recommended/267610/","andy2fine","joe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andy2fine/","312 products in account","I'll be honest, initially I bought this game as a joke. I mean, how can a game simulating woodcutting be good? Amirite?\n\nBut when I loaded up this "♥♥♥♥♥♥" little woodcutting game I immediately felt like Judas was to Jesus. How could I hate and laugh at something so beautiful? The main menu is sublime, the quaint melody and the beautiful scenery made me feel like a child again. I shed a tear, called my family into the room and offered them the greatest pleasure of viewing this masterpiece alongside me. Of course, while initially sceptical they accepted.\n\nUpon choosing the single player option you can choose to play either a tutorial or go straight into the main campaign. As I didn't want to keep my audience waiting I chose to jump right into the fray. It was nothing like I expected, there was no waking up, grabbing a cup of tea and calling the wife before setting out to chop wood. Your one and only goal was to chop wood meaning in a dark souls-esque style you wouldn't be able to prepare for the oncoming mission beforehand due to it's open world nature. I was beginning to feel foolish in front of my family for not choosing the tutorial but to my surprise it was all explained in game anyway! After being issued a mission "Kill 4 trees" a picture of a tree on the minimap directed me to my goal and I ventured to it on foot.\n\n*30 minutes later*\n\nAfter reaching the tree marker I was instantly admist a sea of trees larger than those seen during my adventure to the goal. This was the place, the place of do or die. Walking to my first cuttable tree (you can only cut trees with bands around, showing the care for enviornmental safety this game has - a vital feature to stop people imitating the game on any random tree) I pulled out my chainsaw and felt a thrill. This was my first kill. Watching the gruesome yet wonderful animation (lasting approximately 7 minutes) the tree had fell and disappeared but regardless of reasons my objective of killing four trees was marked "1/4". A wry smile and a strange bloodlust filled me as I continued towards the other trees. "2/4", "3/4", "4/4" and I was done.\n\nI felt like a god returning to base. I held the fate of those marked trees and I could sense the fear within them. I killed a few more to make an example to those who would dare rebel, keeping my people (trees) safe from those anarchists. At that point I decided to turn off the simulator, for if I strike the wood too often my people would live in fear.\n\nThe true addiction to this God Simulator lies in the multiplayer. Will the kind, foolish god win the support of the people or will the more assured, logical god win the rise to power? Of course I already know the answer.\n\nI don't want to rate this game as I no longer consider it a game. But to all who purchase it be warned for I am God in this world. Fear me. Loathe me. Envy me.","June 26, 2014","true","0.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I wondered who out there this game was for.  Figured looking over the company managing aspect of the game would at least briefly educate or entertain me.  While I did not expect to mess with it much, one I figured out how to actually cut a tree down (something even the tutorial videos never bother to teach you) I figured out the unintuitive interface I learned that all there is to do is buy a few pieces of new logging equipment.  That is the extent of the "run a whole logging operation" aspect of the game.  Make enough money to buy a tractor with a saw (where you can walk sideways faster than it drives, because you Zoidberg scuttle at absurd speeds) and you get to cut the same number of trees with it.  A major logging operation is still considered 5-8 trees.  The game puts a time limit on this, buy I don't know why as it is 2.5-3hr.  Real time hours.  For something that MAY take 15 tedious minutes.\n\nI understand now why the town you are in is devoid of all life except you.  In a world with this little interactivity where your only lot in life is walk or drive to the next tree and try to get the money to get something else to get to the trees with and hit one button to see the same canned tree-felling animation and repeat, they probably all climbed into their saws.  It would explain why no one is in the sawmills, woodchipper, or train station.  They've all flung themselves into the machines and perhaps murcifully denied you those industry services the game says you interact with.  I wish this game could be so bad it's good.  As it stand I could only see showing it off as a showcase of things that should not be or if you need a mindless repetative task so you can do something with your hands while you watch TV.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't avoid this anyway, but even if you're some sort of business tycoon game fan with a lumberjack lust in you, there is nothing in this game for anyone.","February 17, 2014","false","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It failed to deliver in nearly every way possible.  This is a horrendous failure for the genre.  They essentially remove the player from every aspect of actually cutting wood, and engage the player in every other way possible, all the ways they didn't advertise.\n\nClunky Controls\nI hope you don't want to drive in anything other than straight lines, and I hope you are used to walking around taking 3-foot steps at a painfully slow pace.  The mechanics of the game require you to be in a particular spot to initiate action, and while your slowest walking speed is painfully slow, they seem to want you standing on a dime, because you just can't take a small enough step to be in the right place the first time.  Oh, and did you want to look around with the mouse?  Get some tape for your RMB.  Did you want a chase cam for your vehicle?  I hope not, because once you set the cardinal direction you are looking with the mouse, you're locked on.\n\n"Wanna go for a walk?"\nA more accurate title may have been, "Walk around with a chainsaw simulator" you will spend more time wandering around the map getting to the objectives than actually performing them.  Your walking speed is painfully slow, your sprinting speed is rediculously fast.  Really, why would I buy a van to deliver myself and supplies to the jobsite when I can run there faster and my legs never need repairs?\n\nSafety last!\nThe game makes an utter mockery of safety.  You are felling trees, what would you wear?  At least stick with the stereotype and give me a flannel shirt!  I get the impression you are out felling trees in a t-shirt and shorts, hell, you might even be wearing flip-flops (you can't see your feet, which is probably for the best) As you cut the tree, the cutter keeps the bar only half-engaged in the wood, just asking for a nasty kick-back, and hey, what are wedges? who need one of those? If you are going to simplify gameplay to the point of being no-fun at all, at least be safe and accurate!\n\nBooooring!\nYou know what the most exciting part of felling trees is?  It's the art and science of cutting the tree, getting it to fall with the lay of the rest of your cut logs, gaging the wind, slope, and making precise cuts to guide the tree onto your targeted bit of ground.  They took all this skillful operation of an exciting bit of equipment, and pared it down to a cutscene.  Not a particularly good cutscene.  If I didn't have practical experience, I'd be led to believe that Stihl makes giant red markers, because that's obviously not a kerf you're leaving on the tree! In the height of opposite-land, while it takes you a painfully long 30 seconds to make your face cut and back cut, limbing the tree (the longest and most boring part in real life) and makes it the part you look forward to, because it means you again have control, and can walk up to a tree and push a button... wait, you won't look forward to that.\n\nGraphics, does anyone have any graphics?\nThe max resolution is well below my standard screen resolution, and with all the graphics cranked to max, well, it's lackluster.  You'd think a chainsaw would call for some visible particle effects, but I guess they wanted to reinforce the idea that you're just drawing red lines on the tree.\n\nHeavy Equipment\nYeah! heavy equipment, maybe they skimped on the chain saw parts to emphasize equipment operation, right?  WRONG! the heavy equipment is as irritatingly over-simplified as the rest of the process, and as boring to use.\n\nI've owned this game for half an hour, and I already have buyer's remorse... did I mention I got it on sale? If this game was free to play, it would be over-priced.  You should be paid to play it.  Save your $5, if you want to waste time, there are many actual games that can waste it more enjoyably.\n","April 19, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But if like me this is your first step into the world of woodcutting simulation then what you get will truely surprise you.\n\nFrom the moment this game loaded up I was speechless.  When you start off you have a basic chain saw and some trees.  After an hour of play I had a chain saw, some trees and some wood.\n\nCan't wait for my friends to buy this so we can play multiplayer.  This is probably the best wood cutting sim out there and having played it I am tempted to quit my current line of work, buy myself some kit and go chopping down trees!\n\nThis is even better than Euro Truck Simulator.\n","February 8, 2014","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The controls are almost an instruction from the god of woodcutting. The gameplay is just something else, i've spent hours on this game and haven't been bored for a single second. The word 'simulator' stands out here as there was several times during gameplay when I truly believed to have stepped into Hugh Jackman's shoes from X-Men where wolverine is acutally a wood cutter. This is a good sign for a game. At least, it was until I began to believe I was Hugh Jackman in real life, which led to monumental disappointment. Would not recommend this game to anyone who isn't Hugh Jackman.

You've Tried Melatonin, Alchohol, sleeping pills, a combo of all 3. Or maybe you need something fun to do while you're tripping balls on LSD, mushrooms, or whatever synthetic you kids are using these days (again maybe some sort of combination)\n\nTHEN WOOD CUTTING SIMULATOR 2013 IS YOUR GAME!\nThe game in a nutshell\n1. Walk to tree (Or drive close with your van)  but, not too close not to far away, make sure that tree is in yoru green circle, using the keyboard is a treat while you tap.. OOOOO too close.. tap back.. OOOOO too far away.. Trying another approach, OK I"M IN THE CiRCLE THANKS!!!!\n\n2. Press space..\n\n3. CUt 1 (10 seconds) CUT 2 (10 seconds) CUT 3 (same).. TIMBER (wait 10 seconds to delimb)\n\n4. repeat for # of trees on mission.\n\nI've played for 30 min or so now, and I have a headache from the monotony, I may have fallen asleep for 10 of those 30 min so there's that.\n\nThis is great for your hardcore lumberjack types who want to cut down trees, then walk around to find another one to cut down.\n\nMaybe you like graphics and detail:\nThe amount of detail is too much for my 1gb graphics card, and dual core 3ghz processor, 3-4gb of ram is easily eaten by this 500mb download. I had to lower my resolution and dumb down the graphics so it wasn't choppy. So if you have a High end gaming PC and really want to test it out, get this game as a benchmark.

I would firstly like mention that games such as this must captivate you with its simplest mechanics - and WCS13 does exactly this. Each tree felled offers a rollercoaster of emotions, it makes one feel things that they have not felt since they were a child, emotions such as pure innocent euphoria.\n\nI have "cut" hours from games such as DotA 2 and MineCraft in order to play WCS13, and I am glad I did. WCS13 has not only boosted my confidence and ability as a lumberjack in real life, but has also improved my organisational skills and ability to meet dead-lines. You see, the in depth job-assignment-system (JAS) requires the player to continually think about the most efficient method to complete the given task. Boy, those dead-lines are indeed heart racing. But they are as exhilarating as they are rewarding. With each cash payment for your job you know you are closer to purchasing the next vehicle that will further your experience in WCS13.\n\nDespite all this, the creators of the game were still able to produce such a charming yet casual sound-track. The catchy, upbeat songs will have you almost jumping out of your seat ready to dance!\n\nI give this game five cleared Brazilian Rainforests out of five.","February 19, 2015","true","11.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","47","7","15","8","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the1observant/recommended/267610/","the1observant","the1observant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the1observant/","40 products in account","WARNING: If you're looking for an easy out-of-box type of experience, then stay away from this Sim.\n\nDo I recommend this game?... 50% Yes, and 50% No. If Steam used a Star Rating, I would give it 2.5 of 5 Stars. It's a love / hate relationship. I love the idea of this Sim, the creativity it involves, the scenery, the sounds of nature, and the sounds of machinery. It has free play value, or you can create your own strategy of how to complete a task.\n\nBut, I do hate the technical difficulties the Sim dishes out and you have to waste time fixing them. It's sad you have to do such things on something you paid for. On the other hand, recovering from an object collision detection error has a challenging element of it's own. Some errors you can fix within seconds, others may take minutes.\n\nAfter ironing out the graphical errors and finding the right settings that work best, it's a pretty fun Sim. However, I'm a "chill out" type of Sim person to begin with and I have patience with editing game files. I'm a hobby programmer, so I have an unfair advantage other gamers don't have.\n\nI would also like to point out I've discovered there are 2 different sub-versions of Woodcutter Sim 2013 that both say they are version 1.0.0.6. One version does not include the Flatbed Truck, but the Steam version does. For some people that might not be saying a whole lot, considering it was a last minute add-on that wasn't planned out very well. For one thing, the engine tune sound does not change while driving the Flatbed. Another thing, the trailer has Drive Wheels instead of Free Wheels, which tend to push the tractor over in both slow and fast turns. However, this does amount to combined horse power so you can climb hills faster while transporting the Feller. On the other hand, it's hard to drive the Flatbed around tight corners in reverse because the 2 Drive Chains work against each other. So, there's advantages and disadvantages to work with there. You have to compromise with strategy and learn the terrain.\n\nThe PhysX for the Sim was not coded for entire realism, but you do get the "jest" of things while operating the machinery. You will not find proper weight and mass PhysX in Woodcutter, nor any of the previous Sims released by UIEG. The collison detection still needs lots of work, because you should not be able to fold a tractor parallel to the trailer, that's just absurd. You also should not be able to drive a Utility Van into a Feller at ground level and cause the Feller to fall over, but I guess I'm just nick-picking now... lol.\n\nSpeaking of those Collision Detection errors... If you play Woodcutter using the default settings, then there's a high probability you will experience gradual degrading functionality. Especially with the logs, trees, and vehicle tires. Sure, everything starts out great, but eventually the game engine is going to "burp" and you'll find yourself fighting with the Self-Loader Truck while attempting to pick up "ghost" trees or logs. The crane clamps will begin to pass completely through the objects for no apparent reason. Sometimes shutting down the Sim and restarting it fixes the glitch, but it's not always going to work like that. The same is true for vehicle tires when they find an invisible hole in the pavement to fall through or get stuck in (restarting the game might work, might not). Paying for vehicle assistance sometimes proves to be a failure as well and you'll still find yourself restarting the game to fix it. You might find yourself dropping trees straight through the ground, or see a tree bobbing around in the grass like a fishing cork. You might even discover an invisible object in a place where it wouldn't usually be as you slam into it while moving around in the forest and it causes you to dump your load. Sawmill logs might magically vibrate themselves straight out the end of the trailer and you'll have to gather them back up. If you put trees in the yellow log truck, they might slip backwards as if they are sitting on grease (what happened to tie downs?). You can press the "1" key to jump out of the Self-Loader Truck and your shoulder can tap the tractor and cause it to flip over on it's side, then you have to work the crane again and push the tractor back over. Luckily the trailer is more durable and allows the tractor tires to pass straight through the front-end... LOL... but don't count on it, you can still lose your load in the process. I could go on and on over the crazy things I've seen in this Sim, but the point is to be careful and be aware these things can happen. Save your game often and name them so you'll know where to start over at, if you have to.\n\nThere is something you can do to help avoid the glitches more often. Search the WoodCutter discussion threads on Steam for the file "device.icom" (notice the period) and you'll find instructions. Basically you have to turn down the graphics and increase the refresh rate.\n\nYou can also use cheat codes to help you get out of a jam, so also search for "cheating.login" (notice the period) and you'll find instructions for that too.\n\nWhat is this Sim worth? As it stands now, probably $2.49 and lot's of patience. At least you get material to work with, but you have to figure out how to make it run better.","March 29, 2014","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You'll basically be accepting quests and going to cut down trees to earn money, which you can then use to purchase vehicles.  As I said though, it's all very monotonous and boring (surprise surprise).  You don't actually get to control the chainsaw...you simply find the "quest" tree(s), stand in the right spot (with the help of a radar), and click a button.  The AI does the rest.  Maybe the game gets better, but I was too bored to wait around to find out.  I picked this up during a Bundle Stars sale (10 games for $4) and glad I didn't pay full price.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mog5d-2nICg","December 19, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here's a few reasons why:\n\nThe tutorial videos constantly froze, so I couldn't use them to learn how to play.\nThe in-game help told me that I needed to use my radar on the lower right to position myself for cutting down trees. There was no radar.\nI can walk through 99% of the trees, but there's an invisible wall preventing me from checking out the back yard of my house. I spawned facing this invisible wall.\nI could not chop down any of the many trees near my house because the game said "You are not in the right position".\nI finally found a button that gave me a quest to chop down a tree. Not a tree near my house. One that was about a 5 minute sprint from the house.\nWhen I finally reached the tree, I could not chop it down. I was not in the right position, no matter where I moved near the tree.\n\nI was amazed that this game has the Stihl name attached to it. I wonder if they'd also let someone fill bags with poop and then smack others in the face with them while saying, "Brought to you by Stihl!". Given the choice between that and playing Woodcutter Simulator, I think most people would prefer the poop.","April 4, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Didn't read reviews. "This game is almost 3 years old, all bugs must be fixed by now" I said to myself. I was wrong.\nI started a new game. Spawned in the yard of my house(?) with chainsaw in my hand and I guess eyes taped to chest. I see a tree in my yard which I think is the one to be cutted, walk to it. Can't walk to it, there's invisible wall preventing me. Okay... There's another tree I go cut it. Wrong position. Aww snap... Well anyway.... Let's walk around to see what to do, oh there is gas station but nothing else. I do U turn and wonder where to go... HEY! *Snaps fingers* I need gas to use the chainsaw... Make another U turn, my characters just bumps up to the sky hitting an mystical ceiling. Wtf... Manage to get to the gas station after landing safely unharmed. Can't buy gas. Oh there's a nice book in my inventory(?). Cut down 1 tree and a weird map with marking comes to my eye corner. Go to the mark... See a yellow arrow in the sky pointing to grass. This must be a bug, there's no tree where the arrow is. Try to cut down pretty much everything around... everything is in wrong position. Cancel the task(Cost 450$ without ever seeing the guy who wants it done). Take new task... cut down 3 trees. OK. Run there wildly through trees(?????). Oh there's the trees, someone circled them with yellow tape that's nice... Cut down the trees and get the money... This game sucks badly. Quit the game.

You spawn in and try to look around but find out you cant because you have to right click to turn your fat ♥♥♥ neck. Imsick and tired of this. You can even cut down a tree because you get the "Your not in the right position" error over and over. You have to cut the "marked tree" I didnt know you cant cut specific tree.
