Also, I am recommending this in 1993.","January 7, 2012","true","0.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","90","18","20","20","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/recommended/63640/","TiffanyAK","TiffanyAK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/","1800 products in account","Again, like with the other bonus games in the bundle, we are left with a non-standard point-and-click adventure that is especially perfect for children. This one is actually better for slightly older kids, as it has far more purely educational content to it than the other two while still having the sense of fun that comes with being able to click everything to see what it does. For instance, you can learn the basics about the planets and see what they look like (in the pixelated way you'd expect of a game this old), drop rocks into a hole to learn how quickly it falls to various depths and how long it takes the sound to return to you, and even see how soon thunder follows a lightning strike at a certain distance away, among other things. This is a game you could actually feel fairly okay with letting the kids spend a good amount of time on. At the same time, the sense of adventure that is present when hunting down new things and seeing what it all does is kept intact as well. Overall, this game once again makes the bundle worth it, serving as an excellent little bonus, and I'll definitely keep it on hand for the next time I have kids around to entertain.","June 25, 2014","true","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's so obscurely, anciently interesting. Probably won't last you long, but there's a lot to explore and interact with in the short time you'll be playing. There's something about it that I can't put my finger on, which is probably just a Cyan Worlds thing, but it has a quirkiness to it that just enthralls me.","December 7, 2013","true","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Other than those few features, there wasn't a whole lot to it. It works nicely as an "extra" in the bundle.","March 2, 2014","true","1.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Escape from reality with Spellunx. This exploration game has no beggining, nor end. You play as a wanderer exploring the mysteries of Mr. Seudo (some crazy scientist).\n\nIf you play long enough, you will see the sheer genius of Mr. Seudo. He uses many hard and medical problem words. JUST KIDDING, there is absolutely no dialogue in this game. I think my favorite part of Spellunx is the telescope room, inside of cave, pointing at the ceiling. This magical mother ♥♥♥♥ing telescope can see through the caves ceiling and is pointing at the constellation of Cancer. THIS GAME WILL GIVE YOU CANCER.\n\nVery education, for ages 5-10\n\nHonu's Rating 6/10","April 3, 2013","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanchin/recommended/63640/","ryanchin","grimacingmoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanchin/","402 products in account","i loved this game as a little kid, back when it had 6 floppy disks for the install.\nnot as magical as i remember, of course, but it was still worth getting the bundle for.\n\ngive it to your kid and see what happens :)\n\n\nthe middle floor is gone though. i even emailed Cyan and asked them about it...\n--\nThank you for contacting Cyan Worlds!\n\nYes, the middle floor is no longer in the game and that means the editor is gone (sorry to have to tell you that). The later releases of Spelunx did not have the editor available and this is due to major changes in the technology used. HyperCard (Apple Computer, Inc.) was the original technology used and was required in order for the editor to function – it no longer exists.\n\nWe are glad to hear that you are enjoying Spelunx again :-)\n\nThank you,\n\nVicki","December 2, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it is much simpler and less weird than Cosmic Osmo or The Manhole. Took me about half an hour to see what I think is all of it. Someone actually interested in playing with its simple toys (ie. a little kid) probably could get hours out of it. Also worth noting is that unlike Osmo and Manhole, this one will actually fill up your whole screen.","July 2, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
