"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/recommended/348710/","littlemissmirage","ItsJustaMirage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/","73 products in account","Playing this game was like getting shot back to 1986 when Saint Seiya popped out from the void of an artist's imagination and turned into a popular Japanese anime. Finally, after 29 long years of countless manga, anime/movie adaptions and five game releases, it is good to know that we have yet again been blessed with a sixth addition to the video game series!\n\nSaint Seiya: Soldiers' Souls is based on a very old anime where you take the role of four Saints of Athena; Seiya, Shun, Shiryu and Hyoga -- and sometimes Ikki if he's not too busy being a badass. The Saints' jobs are focused on the constant protection of the world from numerous perils along with safeguarding Athena who, despite being a Goddess of War and Wisdom, tends to get herself endangered quite often. Clad in Cloth -- magical armor blessed from the empyreal constellations above -- the four Saints (and occasionally five) must battle against strong foes and maximize their true potential!\n\nThe game, like the show, is a part of the fighting style genre. The game play mechanics has increased and improved drastically since its predecessors. These Gods are equipped with a variety of attacks ranging from basic to heavy attacks along with special moves; it’s easy to execute successful combos, making this a great pick for those who are not skilled veterans to the genre and would like to start somewhere light and easy. The controls for combat are smooth and definitely feel quick; I enjoyed the wide range of different fighting styles each character had to offer along with a player roster of 72, so trying them all out will be a task in itself but won't feel like a chore.\n\nThe cinematics and graphics aren't at its optimal level, nor is it chiseled to perfection, making the main campaign feel lackluster every time a character is perceived having a traumatic moment. While playing it, the player will come to think, "But is it sad? I don't know, his eyes are too damn pretty to look at!" But it’s to be expected, it’s a fighting game and most fans of the genre don't care much for the emotional rollercoaster, which is what visual novels are for! The price of $59.99 is steep but it's understandable for a big name title since most games standard point is $74.99-79.99, nowadays, so I shouldn't complain. There is quite a bit of replay value, with a campaign that’s long in duration, CPU battle arenas, as well as online battles and ranking systems! For the dedicated and the skilled, this game is definitely for you! However, for those with short attention span, and lack skills like myself, not so much to pay full price but good to try whenever it goes on sale. You never know, Saint Seiya: Soldiers' Souls may be the gateway game to draw you into the fighting genre scene!\n\nDown below is a video preview of the game, it is available on PS4 but the footage below is strictly off of Steam/PC.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_slSsDpENsk&feature=youtu.be\n\nThank you and Enjoy!","November 26, 2015","true","6.4"," 49 of 63 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","49","63","4","9"

Nostalgia.\nBring back memories of our childhood, watching them on tvs and such. Of course, it is also good for people who never knew about Saint Seiya, there will be new wave of fans.\n\n2. Simplicity\nThe combat mode is very simple rather than Tekken, Street Fighter, and Dragon Ball Xenoverse. People will easily learn combos and find a character that will match their own fighting style. The rest is for players to formulate their own combos and play style and climb up the ranking system on online mode.\n\nThe graphics is also quite good, but it feels like a bit below Naruto and Dragon Ball.\n\nOn the other hand, I am quite disagree for the price.

The Shingo Araki style has been emulated but not everywhere and not for everyone: Soari looks terrible, Saga and Canon have terrible hair models, etc...\n\nVisual Narration -- a lot more could have been done to hype a lot of the fights up in the cutscenes.\n\nBackground music -- The gorgeous original series score is not in the game.

It has revamped gameplay and new combo system, allowing final attacks to fit into combos, just what it needed.\n\nI'll go straight to the cons:\n\n- Bad animations in story mode. Yeah. Developers STILL (after... 6 games¿?) don't put effort into this, so you'll see Camus and Hyoga intact without any trace of ice on their bodies after Aurora Execution dialogue or Saga killing himself with the Gemini armor put on. Not to mention Shura's arm. Basic mistakes that weren't even put a single effort in it.\n- Frame rate drops like HELL in certain scenarios like Star Hill, making the game unplayable but that could be just me.\n\nPros:\n\n- Inclusion of the God Warriors was about time.\n- Better combos than the previous game.\n- Better light effects on the scenarios\n- Scenarios beautifully made and their recreation is faithful to the anime.\n\ntl:dr Asgard chapter fans should buy it, the ones that have played Brave Soldiers aren't missing much but the God Warriors.","November 25, 2015","true","47.8"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","17","25","2","0"

If you are a fan of Saint Seiya, then this game is stronly recommended for you!\n\nFair warning to those whom' are unfamiliar with the Saint Seiya series, there is no solid story in this game that will go through explanation for the game's story gameplay. If you are interested in the game, I strongly recommend you watch the Saint Seiya series, so you don't sit there wondering what the heck is going on.\n\nFighting combos/controls are easy to learn and use with almost all characters in the game. If anything, this is just a fun-casual fighting game not a serious one like Dead or Alive. So don't expect anything big in the battle system.\n\nThe animation for each characters Burst Attack (Their ultimate move) is lovely.\n\nFor its price, I say it is well worth if you are a fan of Saint Seiya or fighting games.\n\n10/10 Would use "Rising Dragon" on Saori again.

Instead of buying all kinds of manga and anime to get into it I decided I will be getting this game instead. I was hoping that Saint Seiya: Soldier's Soul  would work as an abridged version of the stuff I would otherwise read or watch…\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the case - pretty sure that this game works best if you are already way into the source material. Storymode tosses you right into the action, without any real introduction to anything. To add insult to injury all the cutscenes  are really bland (unlike the Big Bang Attacks during the actual fights ingame) - so I ended up skipping them all after the first couple of stages. After having completed the storymode portion of the game I now know more or less as little/much about Saint Seiya as before.\n\nApart from that, the game itself is rather boring as well. In the same vein as many of those other Anime-based arena fighters like Naruto or Dragonball Xenoverse. It controls somewhat decent, but a couple of design decisions aren't my cup of tea (like, Special Moves all trigger a cutscene before actually executing the move and you get no i-frames once the game switches back from "movie mode" to the actual fight meaning you will more often then not get punished and kicked out of your special before anything noteworthy happens or limiting the arena with invisible walls). It's a kinda hectic,  buttonmashy affair with no real lasting appeal. The "Super"-Attacks look amazing, but they are merely cutscenes - the rest of the game consists of evades/dodging and fishing for openings to attack/counter-attack. The dreadful camera (angle) doesn't help. I am pretty sure I would enjoy this more if it was a classic 2D fighter, something along the lines of SEGA's / ASW's Fist of the Northstar.\n\nOnce you are done with Storymode, there are a bunch of other modes to try out - but none of them struck me as particularly interesting. It all boils down to 1 on 1 fights, just with different conditions to earn more money or unlocks - but since the fights aren't all that fun to begin with, this just seems like a huge waste of time. I feel like the main reason for their existence is to have something to grind the ridiculous amounts of money needed to unlock a ton of collectibles - turning this game into another stupid grindfest for the sake of longevity or that replay value-BS. Something that I find REALLY off putting about games these days.\n\nAs stated earlier, might be worth a look if you are into Saint Seiya, but everyone else can skip this entirely. You ain't missing out.","June 4","false","5.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, this also seems to make a few of them just completely unstoppable.  I'll admit I've only played the single player, but for instance I have yet to actually take a hit while playing Andromeda.\n\nSpeaking of which, the singleplayer is pretty good with quite a bit to do.  The AI plays pretty aggressively from the outset, which is nice compared with other fighting games where you've always got a few rounds of way-too-easy opponents before any difficulty kicks in.  The cutscenes are godawful though.  I mean okay, to be honest Saint Seiya was never great story/character material to begin with; the characters were always painfully cliched manime archetypes, but absolutely zero time has been put into animating the models or faces for cutscenes in this game, so what you get is a character standing in his respective fighting or standing stance, and moving his lips while the rest of his face remains perfectly still.  Come on guys, it's a sixty dollar game, make the faces expressive.  I also would have liked it better if we could change the stories like in some of the Budokai games.  I find myself just skipping all the story stuff, which is something I generally don't like to do.  Story mode also does that thing where it makes you play all the characters instead of just playing through one's story, which I find aggravating.\n\nAnyway, the fights are fun and a lot more interesting than fights in Saint Seiya ever were, and there's a pretty robust single player mode, so that covers the two major areas for my dollar.","March 14","true","37.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For one, this being a game where you'd have to rely more on strategy than just straight going toe to toe, this works in a fighting game.  For the most part, it's a fighting game where you'd have to anticipate attacks constantly whereas in other games is more who combos first.  Since I relied mainly on both for certain characters, it draws a learning curve more of how you should fight than who to fight with.  There are characters who are fast enough to flat out chase their enemies and catch them offguard with either melee or cosmo attacks, characters who strongly rely on cosmo alone then those who have short ranged melee attacks or just slow with melee but cosmo attacks are just that powerful. The Cosmo Attacks are pretty lengthy and can sometimes cost you the battle but again, it comes down to strategy.  This is a thinking man's fighting game so it's not as spam happy as Street Fighter is. So for those who have it and don't like due to lack of speed and whatnot, it's not that kind of game.  For someone like me, it works.  I'd say this: if you like Saint Seiya or you're a devoted fan of the series, get it for that reason alone. The story cuts it down to where it matters and worth playing through.  Try it if you like it, that's all I can say.","March 7","true","47.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you love the stories and the anime than you will love the game.  The fighting is very action almost like a Street Fighter game.  The story is fun and has lots of cutscenes.  The cutscenes are in Japanese, Portuguese and Español.  I grew up watching this anime in Spanish and the voices are all the same as the ones from the actual anime!  I'ts Great!  There are tons of Warriors/Fighters to choose from,  diferent style tournys that will make you play again and again to farm up enough money to purchase everything in the Saint Seiya world.\n\nIf you have no idea who or what Saint Seiya is, dont get it.  If you love Saint Seiya and are a fan like myself, than its definately a must.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xariann/recommended/348710/","xariann","Xariann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xariann/","153 products in account","As a Saint Seiya's fan I recommend this game if you feel nostalgic about the series. As a fighting game however, there are better games out there. Overall I'd give this game a 6/10, maybe a 7 on a generous day. The fact that most moves are the same on all the characters is a bit of a downer, but it's also nice if you don't have the patience to learn new combos.\n\nLet me clarify: the special moves are all triggered by the same combo. Even though you get different cut scenes and different moves. So you the timings are different and the situations you might use them in are different (somewhat). There are some minor combos that differ, too.\n\nThey attempt to tell the anime's story, but they leave a lot out. For a beat-them-up though, the story is as good as it's going to get. No English dubs, but then I have never seen the anime itself dubbed in English, although it was dubbed in my native language back in the 80s. You do get subtitles but the translations leave somewhat to be desired in places.\n\nYou do get to play the Sanctuary saga, Asgard, Poseidon and Hades, you unlock a lot of characters with their gold or god cloths. That is bound to wet the apetite for the hardcore fans.\n\nTLDR: If I wasn't a Saint Seiya's fan I wouldn't have bought this. I do enjoy it for what it is, and for the fans I'd say it's worth getting but perhaps when a sale is on.","January 14","true","6.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xdantey/recommended/348710/","xdantey","Dante","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xdantey/","297 products in account","Saint Seiya: Soldiers' Soul is a anime-based game, the setting is as the following, five Bronze saints were gathered and trained during their childhood, when the time was right, they were fated to protect Athena, namely Saori Kido (the goddess) and fight for the just cause.\nShe was supposed to be residing in her Sanctuary with her army of saints (the Gold Saints and the Pope) devoted to her, however, instead, the Grand Pope Arles pulls the strings in the shadows and steals the influence she should have had over those said saints by revealing lies to them, such as Athena alread being in the Sanctuary (but not showing herself due to her high status as a Goddess).\nThey indeed believed him and thus, to make sure he'd keep his reputation clean, he ordered one of his minions to end Athena's life with a golden arrow, and so, the five Bronze saints' quest to rescue Athena begins.\n\nOverview:\n\nGameplay: 7/10\n\nSaint Seiya: Soldiers' Soul is a fighting game which involves two buttons combinations as a layout, light and heavy attacks, the purpose of the game is pretty simple once you get used to it. Nonetheless, there's a variety of combos and features that will get you hooked onto your gamepad, I found myself hugging the controller because I was pushed to make full use of it. Most buttons, more or less, have a purpose, whether it's to recover, guard, or go on the offensive.\nThe "ultimate" attacks, named Big Bang Attacks here, are quite satisfying. Being faithful to the anime/manga, the scenes are immersive and the effects are magnificent, however, some of them take quite some time to set-up, you might be missing a few of those due to how different their start-ups may be on several characters, and that's a good thing, it adds to the variety and the obligation to gather knowledge of each character.\nSome characters, however, will be doubles as their basic movesets do not change but their ultimate attacks do, I can understand why in this case.\nOverall the gameplay is pretty solid, you'll find it quite interesting but not as innovative.\n\n\nOptimization: 9/10\n\nDimps pulled off another great PC port, this time for the cult and nostalgic anime Saint Seiya, the port is similar to Dragon Ball Xenoverse, the graphical options are multiple and the scenery is wonderful. There are also more graphical improvements compared to the PS4 version, which encourages PC gamers to pick up the game and have faith in future adaptations receiving good ports.\nThe settings are basic, some, however, are unusual, ranging from Shadows to Light effects, as well as Anti-Aliasing.\nAnd that's encouraging enough for PCs of all ranges.\n\n\nSoundtrack: 8/10\n\nThe music, some being taken from previous games, is quite fitting to the scenario, atmosphere and stages. You'll feel moved by some melodies and blood-boiled by others, each piece of melody that plays in a scene brings out the emotions that our Bronze saints are feeling. Joy, sadness, despair, and so on.\nThe menu BGMs are also representative of the old/Sanctuar-esque era with noble knights serving justice standing around. It's stylish, good for the eyes and a quite good fanservice for the Saint Seiya watchers/readers out there.\n\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n\nThe graphics are loyal to the anime, facial expressions, backgrounds, character models and so on, they're very well made. The stages are superb and various, the background effect in them makes it easy to know which is which.\nAlthough, certain cutscenes felt a bit rushed, to the point where the background was bland, the animations were clunky at times but you can easily overlook that since it only happens in a small handful of cutscenes, and they're barely noticeable, the slow movement makes it seem as if they were relaxed though.\nBut other than that, the armors were eye-candy, the reflection of them is wonderful, they're beautiful, both in design and effects, and when reaching the peak of your Seventh Sense (basically the Ultimate gauge), you'll want to not use it up just because of how splendid the armor set looks on each character.\n\nStory Elements: 7/10\n\nElements were picked from the original manga, but despite that, a few of them felt rushed, namely the start of the game. You're thrown quite rapidly into the Sanctuary with a brief explanation on what happened previously and a small mention of the Bronze saints' background.\nSome scenes will leave the new players discovering the anime confused because some elements were skipped to drive the scenario closer to its objective.\nStill, if we put that aside, the explanations are well put together which makes it easy to remember and understand the general plot altogether.\n\n\nConclusion: 7.5/10\n\nIn the end, Saint Seiya: Soldiers' Soul delivers a quite solid fighting experience with some fan-service added on-top and challenges that will keep you busy for a while.\nUnlockables and purchases are made in-game with the only DLC being Original Color Editions of two characters, Hades and Athena, and these barely matter to those who haven't watched nor read Saint Seiya yet.\nThere is plenty to collect and to complete as well as achieve with a decent list of achievements.\nThe Online Battle Mode is alright, it's composed of a Player Match menu and a Ranked Match one, one for stress-free battles and the other affecting the Leaderboards.\nThe game has a decent amount of hours to put into and the optimization is top-notch, Dimps has outdone themselves once again.\n\nFor newcomers, I do recommend the game if you like main scenario, which I recommend you to read to a point where you can judge whether to purchase the game or save the money for some other title.\nFor Saint Seiya fans, this is a must-buy as the optimization and the work put into the game makes it more than worth-while.","November 25, 2015","true","82.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","5","11","3","0"

I know all their names, constellations, techniques, fighting stances, remarkable phrases... Everything. When I look at the series now they seem a bit silly. But still, I am a die hard fan, and I vowed that I'd never buy another anime game if this one sucked. Thanks be to Athena it did not come to that...\n\nThe game follows a very similar style as DBZ Xenoverse (same game engine I suppose), with graphics going heavy on the idea of preserving the anime-feeling in the air and simple fight mechanics with simple button smashing and timing strategy. I could not find any of the original songs from the series, don't know if I still need to unlock them, but what I heard of BGM on the stages pleased me.\n\nBut of course, the objective here is not a complex fighting game like KoF, SF or MK... This thing shoots at the series' fans, so I'll tackle the matter from this angle: the game is a jab of nostalgia right in the kisser. Seeing those old friendly (and some not THAT friendly) faces again almost brings a tear to my eyes... But what got me were the voices. I am Brazilian, and voice-acting around here back in the late 80's and early 90's was, at least for me, top-notch... And the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s brought back almost all the voice actors from the original series. I laughed with joy like a child at every technique name they cried. I admit that it is not what it used to be. I don't know if the quality really dropped or it is because I remember the voices differently... But still, it touches me (in a decent way, pervs).\n\nSo, if you are a fan of the series, I really recomend it. It is a ticket to the Nostalgia Train.\n\nPara os parceiros BR huehue zueiro por ai: MORRA SEIYA SEU VIADINHO!\n\nEDIT: Why did they censor "b a s t a r d s" ?

Another game. Same contents.\n\nSaint Seiya: Soldiers' Soul is another Saint Seiya game which all fans would buy but not all would love. The most impressive thing about the game is that the moves are almost all overhauled, with powerful and satisfyingly explosive light show. All Big Bang Attacks are brilliantly impressive. The new God Clothes added for Gold Saints look all awesome, and the cinematic of their ultimate moves are done so well I can tell that most of the game budget went into doing it. They are so accurate that they will trigger your nostalgia, reminding you how awed you were when you saw those moves for the first time.\n\nUnfortunately, that area is the only area that has seen improvement. The game STILL have the same story as the previous game. Same narrative. Same characters. Same fighting style. The story is the same one as told the previous hundred times. You fight the same characters over and over, using different fighters, in different places. The narrative tosses away almost all the iconic moments of the series. Aurora Execution vs Aurora Execution was done through a conversation. The fighting is pitifully shallow and doesn't take much to master. Characters, while listed as high as 72, at least a third of them are the same characters wearing different costumes. God Clothes, while beautiful beyond words, are just another aesthetic gimmicks, albeit very well done ones. Big Bang Attacks, while powerful looking, are just aesthetic cinematic scenes. Prominent characters with great roles in the series are slopily skipped. Where is Papillon Mu? The fight lasted an entire volume. Where is Worm Raimi? The one that almost killed Aioria. Where is Barog Rune? The one that almost kill Shun and sent Seiya to hell? Where are all the new characters? The production of this game is like dying a horse and selling it. It gets away with adding the least content while presenting it as a new game. Pass this one if you're looking for something new. Stay away.","May 7","false","31.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

This had to be the perfect game, why did they drop the ball on this one? Even Naruto ninja storm has better voice sync and graphics. The good point is that the original voices are used, so it gave me the nostalgic time I used to watch the anime on TV. The story is a quick glance of each arc, which is good and bad (if you are new to Saint Seiya, you will miss many stuff you should know).\n\nThe controls are weird, because you can't stop a combo sequence when the enemy avoid your attack, it feels very broken. Also, when you use the cosmo-dash to reach the opponent, most of the time I end up rushing to the opponent, and then, instead of stopping when I reach it, it keeps rushing for about a second, which gives to the enemy a golden chance of storming a sick combo on me.\n\nI don't recommend this game. If it was free, or much more cheap, it would be kinda recommended, but overall, I, sadly, don't recommend this game. And I love Saint Seiya. I feel sad because I had so many expectations on this game, and it is too mediocre.\n\n","December 9, 2015","false","21.3"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","5","17","0","0"

Hell, it would've been better if it had no story at all and a much lower price.\n\nThey could've used parts of the anime for cutscenes instead of in-game crappy animations. That would've helped a lot in situations where a character talks about some past events. What happens when a character remembers some past events? – you might ask ~ Well, they show the character on a black, empty, background … talking.\n\nThe story telling is so bad that I'm almost glad they didn't include Black and Silver saints, or the Soul of Gold chapters. Playing through the story mode was painful. You'll be better off skipping any and all cutscenes.\n\nGraphics aren't too bad. Characters are okay. Backgrounds are mediocre at best. The animations during a Big Bang Attack are good. Probably the only good thing about the game.\n\nMusic is awful. There's not much else to say about it. Just. Awful.\n\nGameplay is very basic and becomes rather boring after a little while.\n\nThis is one of those cases where a game developer lands a license for a popular TV series franchise and tries to make a quick buck.\n\nIf you're interested in a game with a strong single-player campaign and good story telling then run away and never, I repeat, never look back. If you, on the other hand, just want to kill some time with a friend, then wait for a big discount. The $49.99 USD asking price is way too much for this game. A fair price would've been $19.99 USD.","February 15","false","24.4"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","1","10","0","0"

So far, it has been an enjoyable way to spend a few hours a day, and as far as fighting games go, there are many aspects to be enjoyed in here.\n\nAt first glance the combat system may be somewhat shallow and simple in theory. The tutorial is quite effective to review the basics, and highly recommended unless you are familiar with similar games. But after some experience and the pursuit to tackle challenges and achievements, you get to appreciate a depth that some fighting games lack, as the combos, supermoves, charged attacks, escapes and throws all coalescence into a much richer and fluid combat experience that more limited games, such as 2d fighting games.  The combat can be quite hectic, and amusingly, I found it much more fast paced, full of action and entertaining than what the nostalgia tinted memories of the show seem to recall.\n\nA controller is highly recommended and preffered, though using keyboard is viable.\n\nPros:\n-Fairly welcoming combat system that will take a little bit of practice, but reveals versatility, fun and plenty of action.\n- Plenty of characters, it is quite likely that you will find your favourite character or learn to love some other characters you never quite thought you'd find useful.\n- Music, sound, multilanguage support both in audio an subtitles. From what I've learned, this is the first time the series includes Latin Spanish. This was a huge plus in my case. But you can configure audio and subtitles in many languages too, as well as the original japanese.\n- Art style is very faithful to the source, the visuals are also top notch with plenty of reflections, special effects and animations.\n-Story, online play, VS mode, and tons and tons of challenges and unlockables to work for. The game has plenty of things to do.\n-Tested the game in 2 pcs, one high end, oone mid end, and performed quite alright and stable in both, even if running at lower settings. High settings are visually pleasing.\n- Pretty faithful to the spirit of the source anime. All our favourite clichés are here: Everybody keeps dying in story mode and getting back on their feet by the next episode; Saori is terrible at making decisions and always plays the kidnapped damsel in distress; Ikki keeps watching over Shun, dying, and then returning to protect his bro even though Shun is terribly powerful on his own right; Hyoga is mama´s boy and keeps losing friends, family and rivals; Shiryu keeps losing and gaining his eyesight and has plenty of wise teachings from his old master; Seiya keeps getting his ♥♥♥ beaten by the final boss and all of his friends keep giving him the last bits of their cosmos so he can overcome... except Ikki, because he's both a hardass and too badass to care.\n\nCons:\n- Lots and lots of grinding needed to obtain IG coins to purchase characters, armors, items, support phrases, scenes, music, etc.  You need to do the story mode and some challenges and then some more in order to unlock your favourite characters.\n- Difficulty level can be too much, but it is adjustable, so that's nice.\n- Some questionable breaks in the tempo of spoken phrases in languages other than japanese, mostly because of "syncing" with character talking animations.\n-Shadows seemed too blocky at times. Might be a driver thing, have to explore more on that, but didn{t particularly impact performance. Just... looked off when compared to how shiny and detailed character and background visuals are.\n\n\nI highly recommend the game to anyone looking into it. It is a fun, fast paced and endlessly playable game, even if you are not a longtime fan of the series.","May 8","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
