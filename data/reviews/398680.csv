"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/recommended/398680/","PresidentSkele","Green Skeleton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/","1181 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n*Don't think my hours on record means anything, as I just idled it for the cards\n\nI have never played such a non-entity of a game before. Sure, there have been games that made me think certain developers should be legally withheld from making more games, but this, this makes me question the very core essence of a programs existence. It's not so much "how?" it was made, but "why?" it was made. As in, why do I have to install this? Why isn't this just part of Steam as a feature? Or more accurately, why isn't this a free flash game on the internet? Oh wait, it is. In various fashions.\n\nWhat this game does isn't very unique. Typing and word learning games have been around maybe since they've had visual GUIs and an ability to input text in a computer (and earlier before that with things like Scrabble). Their biggest strides came in the 90's with Mavis Beacon, JumpStart Typing and even Mario himself.\n\nThen people got bored with just mastering their WPMs, and thankfully SEGA fixed that with Typing of the Dead. As they realised there needs to be more of a goal to achieve, and thanks to TOTD, plenty of others have actually tried to be more edutainment rather than just stiff educational tools. They actually offer something, and if not some kind of engaging single player challenge, they have multiplayer, like Words with Friends.\n\nAce of Words on the other hand, has done nothing to further the cause of mastery of the english language. It's by no means a regression, but trying to think of what this game actually does well enough to be considered a game worth playing... well, there is none. You just... turn it on, play it for 90 seconds and then you're done. Maybe you try it once more, but climbing the leaderboard just isn't enough. There's no progression at all here. It doesn't even attempt to teach you new words.\n\nThis is one of the most forgettable games in my library, and what you see is what you get. I can't imagine that there are people clamoring for something so no frills, so lacking in personality, as there are so many more games that would be better to play that actually get you involved.\n\nBetter word games on Steam:\nLetter Quest: Grimm's Journey Remastered\nA pseudo RPG where you learn new words and relearn the definitions of old ones. Collect gems and buy better weapons to make your words hurt more. Really fun progression system.\n\nTyping of The Dead: Overkill\nWhat better way to test your WPMs than when the only way to survive is to go faster? Must go faster.\n\nBookworm Series\nAn oldie, but a goodie. Only problem is that they lack modern Steam support/features like the cloud or achievements. Still really quality titles.\n\nThis game just gives me an air of people that just didn't try hard enough. Like, just because it was a game about words, they only had to put in the minimal effort. They wanted to remain in their little box and tried to be as inoffensive as possible and be as uncreative as they could, and write it off as "Oh, it's just for some lame educational game! I don't REALLY have to try!". To me, a game being as inoffensive as possible is just as offensive as the worst games ever made. This game is as cynical as they come, and it doesn't even have to say a word.\n\nThere was a time when something like Ace of Words would have been useful. That time was the late 1980's. Thankfully, we have moved on, and so should you. To better games.","February 25","false","7.1"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","42","52","5","5"

A very basic game with a terrible dictionary that was previously free.\n\nMost prominently, keystroke detection is too slow. You'll be typing away words like "sates" and "sate" and "seats" and "seat" and their various permutations and possibly only get half of them due to the poor response time.\n\nThe GUI is utterly basic with only a handful of options/menu choices, and as a fan of GameHouse games like Text Twist this is pretty disappointing. You can only play, restart, or quit, and there are no other modes besides timed play. Hint feature is unlocked after a certain percentage of words have been entered correctly and can be used an unlimited number of times to get enough words to unlock the next level.\n\nActually, the Hint feature is the best part about this game; the dictionary is so bad that you'll need it to move onto the next unnumbered level. Certain proper names and places like "Rosie" and "Paris" are in the dictionary, but basic words like "err" and "oes" aren't. I'm not sure why "Tesla" is in this but "Kant" isn't.\n\nIf it's in a cheap Steam key bundle, you might as well pick it up. It drops trading cards and has some easy achievements.

The basic gist is similar to Word Whomp:  You're given a set of 8 letters and a time limit to spell as many words as you can.  There is a hint option which I did not use for the first couple of games.  When I did use it, I found that quite a few words that the game was looking for are not actual words, but rather intitalisms like IRS or SRS, suffixes like -ism, and other random letter combinations.  In short, save your money on this one.  I'm glad I got it for free.","December 13, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The dictionary is horrible and that in combination with the slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow keystroke recognition makes this game next to unplayable right now. Oh, and as a bonus, the message bar which tells you if the word was accepted or not updates too slow. So you might be seeing "word not in dictionary" for that one misstype you made 17 words ago.\n\nAlso, the music is no peach. But that's not really an issue. ;)\n\nAt this point, I would not recommend this to anyone. However, this has the potential to turn into a nice, simple boredom killer.

There's very little to the game, simply unscrambling words with different letters on each level. It's only early access so possibly more stuff will be added (apparently multiplayer is planned), but for now the dictionary is really lackluster (bot and bots don't work). There was one instance where I had to type "tie" 3 times before it registered, It wasn't spelled wrong or anything, it just refused to accept it. The game seems to not register keys fast enough if you type too quickly and will just leave out letters that you pressed. All this kind of stuff makes or breaks a spelling game, and there are simply just better games out there if that's what you want.

It's a simple word jumble game, where players get a series of random letters and have to make words from them. The only impressive thing about this game is how it managed to screw this up, even with so simple and unoriginal a premise. Its dictionary is full of names, proper nouns, acronyms, and three-letter prefixes, but some words like "True," which are actually...well...WORDS are nowhere to be found. I could tolerate this but for the fact that you need to guess a ridiculous number of words in order to move on to the next puzzle and keep playing. Pair the time limit with a game that expects you to come up with fistfuls of fictional words and you have a recipe for frustration. For some reason this game has been in Early Access for months, so there's still time for these issues to be resolved. As things are now, however, this is a hard one to recommend.","December 26, 2015","false","6.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Well, there are a few things.

Also, on more than one occasion I could have swore I typed a word that later showed up when I used the hint button. It was as if the word didn't register the first time I typed it. I am curious if any one else had a similar problem, or maybe I just typed too fast and spelled the words wrong.\n\nAt this point I can not recommend Ace of Words, even if it's on sale.

Quite simple anagrams game. As people stated in other reviews not many people playing it right now but it might change depending if the devs add some variety and fix few issues here and there. Would recommend gifting it to your friends who are learning english or in need of some vocabulary practice.\n\nIt's enjoyable, easy achievements, has cards, won't take too much of your time, if you're into perfecting games this would take ten hours tops.\n\nNo idea where they sourced the words from but it needs some fixes, accepts some abbreviations, doesn't accept others. Same goes for names, singulars, plurals and even meaningful words. Considering it's still on early access, these issues are on an acceptable level and the game is far from unplayable or broken.","March 27","true","10.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Good job Devs! I've only hit a few, infrequent words that I question whether or not they shoyuld be in the dictionary, but overal, there have been no surprises.\n\nI like the ability to change modes from 6 to 8 letters, but even more options would be cool. Plus, this would add to the replayablility, trying to get into more top leaderboard spots. But with 6 and 8, there's still enough to work with. The essentially endless mode (assuming you can keep it up) is fun, and adds even more replayability as you try to get further (and get a higher score) than previous runs.\n\nSometimes hints are great and help you eek past the level continuation checkpoint, which is nice. Sometimes hints come a little early though, and while you can just not use them if you like, if you decide to, it really takes away from the challenge.\n\nAll in all, the game is fun, and it's good to pick up for short spurts, and the problems I found with the Early Access version have been fixed.\n\nEARLY ACCESS REVIEW BELOW:\nSo here's a revised take on an earlier review: The game still needs work, but this should be expected with an Early Access game. That being said, the dev is responsive to feedback and is actively making improvements, which is why I'm overall recommending this.\n\nOne of the biggest downsides for me is that the dictionary is not complete (i.e. ERRED is valid, yet ERR, which is the same word in a different form, is not). Arguably, it may never be complete, and some may argue that some words should be in the list, while others will disagree. Personally, I feel like the example above (along with others I found just like it) is a reasonable argument to make. I know it is very silly for a hugely popular game like Words With Friends to tell you the word "OK" is not valid, while asking you to click "OK" to continue, but obviously, disagreements over valid words happen in games like this.\n\nThe game concept is basic, don't expect any fancy art or a magical experience, but it kept me entertained well enough to play a number of rounds -- despite the dictionary issue, and it is likely something I will come back to from time to time when I've got a few minutes to kill and don't want to get super involved in another game.\n\nFix the dictionary and you've got yourself a solid game.","March 18","true","37.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

So, is a good way to know they and seek the translate in the cellphone.\n\nI think play in keyboard is nice. When i tryed to play in my xbox 360 gamepad, the last letter option does not work to select it in a word.

Why?\n\nWell the game can be fun, when played in little bursts over time.\nThe problem is, is that there are loads of words that aren't here which should be, at once the word "True" wasn't even allowed, wtf.\nIt's price is also something to be questioned, £2.79? Seriously, I think more on the £0.79-£0.99 might be good, but this is an early access game (Which is also questionable).\n\nAs a whole this game is Meh, it is fun to play in little bursts, but has problems with words not being in the game.\n\nI'd recommend this game when its on sale at a price under £0.99 (And the USD/EUR equivalant).\n\n5/10","March 13","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are given 8 random letters and you make words. That's it. There are much better games eather free or for similar amount of money (like Bookworm).\nIf you want all achievements, you have to make 10.000 words, so you will mostly end up using anagramer. That way the game changes to another simulator on the Steam market, this time "Secretary Simulator". You just keep writting. Give it about solid 15 hours and you may complete it.\nAlso I find very funny that they want to add more languages, yet they have problems even with English (missing plural forms or commonly used words, yet the word "SPCA" is in the game).\nAvoid now, and probably avoid even after release, because I don't see a way how it could become fun.","March 15","false","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got "Ace of Words" for free from a friend and it had been on my wishlist for about 1-2 weeks at that time. I really wanted to enjoy this game but that didn't happen.\nI will list the things that I've found while playing it:\n\nPros:\n- Has achievements and can be 100%-ed too but takes a while.\n- Has trading cards.\n\nCons:\n- The game is missing some words that can be added. Examples : Pee, Peed, Tod, Sob, Ado, Rob, Rip, Wuss, Tad, Tot, Sap, Pip, Mosh, Ores, Porn, Fart, Pep, Sop, Vip, Lier, Bap, Teabag, Mage, Orc. It's odd because some of these words are added to the game's dictionary in their single or plural form but the other one isn't added.\n- The music seems ok-ish at first but after a while you realise it's repetitive and eventually mute the game.\n- I am glad the 10K-words achievment has been reduced to 5K but it's still grindy. I lost interest after 2K words so I was waiting for the moment when I hit 5K.\n- Overpriced. Yep, sad but true. If you manage to get it for 1 euro that would be ok-ish price but if you really want this game   pay as less as you can. I don't regret playing it because I got it for free but If I had paid more than 1 euro I'd be angry right now.\n\nConclusion:\nAvoid unless it's below 1 euro and you want to get another 100% game or some cards.","June 6","false","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
