You never know what kind of a surprise you can encounter with trying a new one. It might either be some clichéd fun RPG, some curious brain scratcher or a really original scenario that could have been one great game with proper budget and engine. 199X is neither of them. It's a dystopic parody that centers on a well written female protagonist that challenges the idea of free will and societal convention thoroughly.\n\nIn Steam Store, the game is briefly defined with these words: "In 199X, you control Clara. That's the problem." Clara is a young woman who wakes up in a hospital building which she has no memory of getting admitted into, only to be informed that her friends made an "informed decision" about her. That is the point that we are emerged into the storyline as the voice and controlling character of Clara. Needless to say, she gets a bit freaked when she realizes that her body is not hers to control anymore. We are controlling her, and we speak in her mind to establish an odd love/hate relationship with her. After that given point, our primary goal is to find a "cure" for Clara's "condition" about the omnipotent and omnipresent "ghost voice" in her head. Namely, the player.\n\nThe game challenges the idea of a conventional video gameplay and its framed characters with predetermined personalities who only exist through one storyline and our choice of controlling them. Clara is so well-written as an original personality, with genuine reactions and a literature of her own, you easily get engulfed into your uneasy relationship with her. Her reality, dystopic and nonsensical at first glimpse reveals to become eerily similar to the collective control mechanics of modern day societies that we know far too well. It's a comment, weaved around psychedelic nuances of an unconventional mind.\n\nI must confess that story mechanics themselves are rather crippled compared to excellently displayed dialogue and concept depth, with lacking environment design and some shallow character designs. The story and gameplay is quite linear, maybe as part of the critique it's trying to accomplish. I particularly enjoyed symbolic dream sequences between different days, and a sit-com version parody of Dungeons and Dragons though. What atmosphere lacks in means of display, it most certainly compensates for dialogues worthy of a Beckett play and soundtrack - an original compilation of Kearney, concerning indie, dark wave and psychedelic rock genres which is distributed free with the game.\n\nA warning is to be added nonetheless, that this game is not for everyone with centering on some historical and societal dysfunctions like female hysteria, and its temporal treatment of hysterical paroxysms in an institutionalized manner. With the warning at mind, I most certainly recommend 199X as a brief and challenging - yet eventually meaningless experience. The worst case scenario with this kind of somewhat funny price, you are buying 3 hours of gameplay and some funny moments.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 9","true","3.7"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","44","46","0","2"

Ever heard of female hysteria? Does Celes ring a bell? Would you like to take over control of somebody who even knows that you are in his head? Are you interested in a good story, no matter how much lack of graphics or gameplay to overcome? If you said “Yes” at least once, you should read further. Sorry for making the last one so catchy..\n\nAt first, let`s have a quick look at the overall appearance. The game was made with RPG-Maker and looks unpolished. If you liked the graphics of To the Moon, expect to be disappointed. There is no interface, no map, no questlog. no inventory. The map is not big at all but since you have no Button for “running” prepare to be patient. Like the title says, it aims to be a game without mechanics so you shouldn't expect it to have one.\n\nWhat we have here instead is an interactive story that mixes mature topics, including homosexual relationships, sexual violence and sexual behaviour in general, with childhood experiences and puts the player in real charge of control. Clara, our pink-haired main protagonist, does not only hear a voice in her head, she has also lost command of controlling her body. You already guessed: You, the player, act like the puppet master now. Why do I make this sound so special? You may have played many games in which you forced one, two, a group or even thousands of characters to move, fight or even kill, but Clara knows that you are there. She knows that you are in charge and even talks to you. So prepare to feel responsible for everything that happens with and around Clara. And don`t be scared upon the start after exploring the same dialogue trees over and over again - It won`t happen twice.\n\nYou should finish the game after 2-3 hours. That sounds quite short but is in fact enough time to understand what the author wanted to show. Or at least try to understand. I`m not sure if I really got the point but moving Clara trough all her struggles with relationships, her past and her future while knowing that it was ME who forced her into this mess after all, made this game a real unique experience. Thus said I want to bring up that the soundtrack, which is available for free, adds a bunch of nice but also disturbing tones and tracks, that made me shiver sometimes.\n\nSummary:\nAdvertised as a game without mechanics, there is no Pro vs Con here since this is not really a game at all. Graphics, UI and gameplay are non existent or at least on a basic level. Sound and especially story are the columns that keep 199x not only a successful attempt to break the narrative wall but offers lots of heart, cruelty and references for 90s kids.\n\nIf you liked To the Moon or Always Sometimes Monsters and hearing stories about antiquated sexual treatments and lesbian relationships doesn't make you feel uncomfortable, you get rewarded with the joy but also pain that sole responsibility has to offer, for only 1,99. And don`t forget: Soundtrack included.\n\n6,5/10","May 22, 2015","true","6.0"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","4"

You, the player, are now in control, and it’s all she can do not to mentally collapse under the realization that her body is no longer hers to command.\n\n199X constantly borders on an epiphany it can see but not touch. Through its bold obliteration of the fourth wall it attempts to question not only how we view the agency we hold over our video game avatars, but also how we fit into the larger social system that often has more power over what we do and how we act than we ourselves. The boldness with which 199X asserts itself grants it a lot of leeway in arriving at what it wishes to say and how, but through these possibilities it fails to hold on to any of the ideas which have been hastily unpacked and mixed together.\n\nThe problem is not so much the number of parallel narratives vying for attention as it is their incompatibility with one another. One of 199X’s most disturbing plot points involves the violating procedures being forced on women who exhibit symptoms of “female hysteria” (which effectively means anything that makes them human and more than happy-go-lucky sex machines), but despite the obvious correlations between discussions of agency and the lack thereof of women living in an extremely sexist society, these lines are never drawn or given time to develop beyond a gross aspect of this otherwise fairly ordinary world.\n\nThis is the case with every character and plotline 199X introduces, which in the absence of a binding central narrative all float uncomfortably somewhere between here and there, trying to get a word in before the curtain call. It doesn’t completely rob the narrative of its humanity, but it does make it difficult to comprehend and even harder to swallow given its often horrifically grim nature and minimal ability to justify it. The only thing holding 199X back from the abyss is its flawed and terrified lead, Clara, incapable of acting for herself and yet the most honest and affecting character here. She feels authentic and relatable in a way that’s atypical of video game characters, as ultimately she’s talking directly to you as much as anyone in the game, which created a bond that made me want to help her despite how much harder I was finding it to connect to her world.\n\nPerhaps most responsible for pulling 199X apart is its design and basic function. Level designs are plodding and tediously large, often failing to properly account for scale (rooms are often bigger than the entire building that houses them) and feeling contextually disruptive through a consistent juxtaposition of styles for narrative’s sake. It’s just too easy to see through the 199X’s seams, with minimal animation, static characters, and a lifeless color palate making it an onerous task to be drawn into the experience when it keeps reminding you of its superficiality. Perhaps that could have been turned around as an intentional reminder that you’re playing a game and thus feeding back into the premise, but it doesn’t succeed well enough to feel like anything but engine restraints and developer inexperience.\n\nFor all its failings 199X is always just on the verge of a breakthrough, and in very isolated moments it feels like it’s even arrived at it. 199X isn’t a complete loss, but it can’t maintain itself, and with such a volatile instability I don’t know if I could say it’s worth the journey. But there are great things happening here. They’re small and they’re unrecognized, but I hope they’ll be picked up again at some point. 199X could have been something exceptional, if only it could bring itself into focus.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","July 17, 2015","false","1.7"," 48 of 63 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","48","63","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/355270/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","It’s difficult to review 199X for many reasons. It’s difficult to criticize it for anything, yet at the same time it’s difficult to praise it as a game. That’s the first point that needs to be made - this isn’t a game in the normal sense. 199X was created using RPGMaker and is essentially an interactive story in which you move Clara around, have personal conversations with her in her brain (yeah you read that right), and try help her resolve the ♥♥♥♥ that is going on in her life.\n\nI think it’s important to point out now that there may be a few spoilers here and there throughout this review. Unfortunately with this kind of story driven experience this is somewhat of a necessity, otherwise it’s even more difficult to review 199X. It will however be avoided as much as possible throughout.\n\nSo let’s get down to business, 199X is self-proclaimed as “The Game with No Mechanics”, it’s in the title and so this should be your first warning sign that if you’re all about mechanics- focused experiences, this isn’t going to be for you. The first thing you’re greeted with when starting your new game is that basically there’s going to be some messed up ♥♥♥♥ going down in this game in terms of both ‘physical and emotional manipulation’. This essentially becomes the crux of the game and where your input is focused.\n\nSee Clara isn’t just any normal person; she wakes up in hospital very much confused about what’s going on, that’s where you step in. You’re Clara’s ‘ghost’, as named by the non-playable characters of the city, and you’re going to help her interact with the non-playable characters, make her do things she might not want to do, and well… control her.  “So what?” you’re saying, “I control every character in a game.” Yeah you’re completely right but what 199X does differently is that Clara acknowledges that you’re in complete control of where she goes, what she sometimes says, and that you’re the one who advises her on how best to avoid those tricky social situations that seem to plague the 7 day period the game spans over.\n\nThe decisions that you make on behalf of Clara are very much hit and miss however, whilst some can lead to some very strange and serious seeming events others seemed very lackluster and I sometimes questioned why the game was giving me the option. For example at the very start of the game you’re told to go and walk Clara to different wards of the hospital triggering a different conversation each time. Whilst being given different dialogue options, this doesn’t really matter as the game won’t let you progress until you’ve used every single one to probe the last slither of information out of the environment.\n\nIt’s difficult to praise the game for making you feel like your choices were really going to affect what happens when, in the first 5 minutes it destroys this notion. The bizarre part about it though was that in other cases the decisions really did seem to matter and, although there are two endings to the game, I felt no desire to go through it again to see how different the game could have panned out. I’m no stranger to interactive experiences, having played Dear Esther, Actual Sunlight and To the Moon, and having completed those once before, I still occasionally boot them up to experience them once more. 199X didn’t have this effect on me.\n\nThat’s not to say that it’s a bad experience, but the throwaway nature of many of these experiences is an ever increasing problem the more these interactive stories are being released on steam. I appreciate 199X for what it is and I think it carries some particularly important messages about today’s society whether they were intended or not by the game’s creator, but it lacks re-playability, and its small price tag suggests its own acknowledgement of this.\n\nThe last 40 minutes of this experience is where 199X will grab your attention with its hard hitting acknowledgements of mental health illnesses, and its ability to make you realize that you actually feel a little compassion for the 8-bit sprite striding around on your screen talking back at your comforting, and sometimes mocking comments.\n\nAgain however, with every positive of 199X comes a negative. I really enjoyed the last stages of the game but it felt like it needed this kind of pacing throughout. Its obvious trigger event that many will pick up a fair while before it actually happens, is the start of the way the game should have been throughout. The portion of the game playing your choice of either ‘Uniracer’ or ‘Clara’s Kissing Simulator’ seemed so pointless in the grand scheme of things as if it was only to allow the developer to add something into that night’s dream sections of the game. These dream sections of the game are essentially Clara’s reflection of the day’s events and as previously mentioned seems to give the player a further insight into mental health illnesses.\n\nAs I’ve said, every positive is balanced out with a negative and the off pacing results in a game which is worth experiencing if you enjoy interactive stories, but it’s unlikely to sway the opinion of those not a fan of the genre. The story the game tells is interesting and enjoyable to experience due to the excellent writing in the game, but I couldn’t help but feel this would have benefited that much more if there were more than the two endings to the experience, and you felt like your dialogue decisions made a difference from the start.\n\nBy all means many may enjoy the experience to be had in 199X, however don’t expect a lengthy nor particularly engaging gameplay experience. You’re there to push the story along with your directional keys and space bar and little else.","November 2, 2015","true","58.3"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","0"

It's a GREAT story, but the mechanics don't manage to hold it up.\n\nGetting from place to place is slow and boring. The environments are too large and full of empty spaces, and there's nothing showing me which way to go. All I'm told is the colour of the building I'm looking for. The *colour*. Nobody refers to buildings by colour, but it's their only distinguishing feature in this game. And if I didn't write down the dialogue where I'm told where to go next, there's nothing to remind me, forcing me to search the entire oversized city to find the next plot event. Loading a savegame made before that dialogue is my only recourse.\n\nThere's no map, no quest log. At least there are constant messages informing me that a particular piece of knowledge has been stored in my inventory - which is a very clever twist on standard RPG mechanics. But I was completely disillusioned when I went to consult a piece of information I'd acquired earlier, because as far as I can tell, the game doesn't actually have an inventory at all! The mechanics flat-out lie to the player about what is possible!\n\nAnd because there's no way to get a reminder of what you're supposed to do next, loading a savegame is an exercise in frustration. I load the game, and it plonks me down outside my house (or wherever) with no context. If I don't remember when I saved, I don't even know what in-game day it is.\n\nAnd all this is a great shame, because as long as you stay on the path the designer intended, it's a very engaging story.  Lots of love and betrayal, brilliant characters, a dystopian future with some very weird ideas about women, and some scary-trippy segments where Clara questions her own sanity. All the characters are well thought out and developed, there's no background NPCs who repeat the same lines over and over. It's moving and thoughtful and just a little bit silly, if you can get into it.\n\nBut it doesn't take much to break my immersion. One minute, Clara's happy to babble about fire extinguishers and vending machines for pages on end - the next, there's no text for examining her neighbours' homes, not even to tell me who lives where. Yes/no choices pop up, but my response is barely acknowledged, and forgotten at the end of the scene. Some rooms don't have visible exits, leaving me to hunt for the invisible trigger block. So there's a lot of small frustrations to distract from the story.\n\nNow, it's cheap, so if you're not sure whether you'll like it I advise you to get it anyway. I don't regret buying this game. I just think it could have been a lot better.","April 20, 2015","false","2.5"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","29","37","2","1"

The entire "game" is on rails, and even many of the interactions yield the same dialogue (or at best a small deviation before returning to the main dialogue), so at best this is the illusion of the game. Honestly writing additional dialogue would not have strained development and would have been pretty easy to do considering the game, so it comes off as lazy. Sure you move the character and press a button to examine things and trigger dialogue but you can't deviate from the linear path of the game. There is also quite a bit of social justice in this game which makes parts feel a little bit like a "educational game" or propaganda. Certain other parts just feel a bit amateurish, such as forced consequence-less battles and flat characterization. Don't expect any male characters to have any depth or role in the plot, it's all about the ladies and the male characters are there for window dressing.\n\nThe good:  The tone and music of this "game" is spot on. I felt creeped out in a good way by the setting. I was decently engaged in the plot and figuring out more about the setting. It's a short game you can finish in an evening, and I think the price is fair for the experience, if you won't be turned off by the bad things I mentioned above. I got it on sale for cheap so I can't complain.\n\nOverall I was let down by this title, as it really isn't a game, isn't interactive as it pretends to be, and has some political messages I found distracting and annoying. I think Tognotti could really make something good if he focuses on making his games more interactive and making characters less of caricatures. I would enjoy something longer with actual choices to be made. You know, like a game might have.","March 29, 2015","false","3.0"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","25","35","3","0"

It has by times some strong statements even if they are good incorporated in the narration.\n\nBesides that, the story is simply strong!

But the story and narrative more than make up for the barebones gameplay as they're truly good: the plot is slowly revealed as days go by and you find out more about Clara, her past and what's happening to the city. The whole thing seamlessly goes from disturbing to surreal to funny without breaking a sweat and it expertly breaks the 4th wall whenever necessary. Clara is also a very interesting character, has a good depth and is hard not to get attached to her as you play the game.\n\nAs good as Clara is it's a shame that the other characters you meet are pretty lacking in depth, even those that are supposed to be important in the story: a bit more interaction would have gone a long way in helping the player get attached to them and care about their fate as much as Clara does. The walking around can also get a bit dull as the few areas you travel through feel a bit too huge and, as far as I know, there's no quick walk button.\n\nIf you're ok with a game that is just interested in telling you a story then 199x comes fully recommended: there's something in Clara, her narrative and the subjects the game addresses that can easily leave a mark.\n","April 7","true","1.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There's great ideas here and nice writing, but it feels less like "a game without mechanics" and more like the first attempt someone ever made to play around in RPG Maker.  There's lots of little spots where, for instance, events don't terminate properly, so you can continually initiate the same scripted sequences and say, have a character keep taking a few steps to the left until they're walking off the screen.  Then you've got all the characters who get statue-syndrome after they've said their piece - have them go away or walk around, or do something, or someone notice that they're just standing there without moving, or it just becomes immersion breaking.\n\nI feel like the developer has potential, but to be honest, I'd personally be pretty embarassed if I sold something this unpolished for actual money.

Now a days we laugh at this psuedo science which originated out of all things from a stupid Egyptian belief that a woman's private area can move and cause her many problems from nervousness, to fainting, to being irritable and so on.\n\nDoctors around the world were hopeless, people were dying everywhere from all sorts of diseases, but doctors were apparently brilliant at solving 'hysteria'. Eventually this coined disease turned epidemic as women thronged in droves to the local doctors to have themselves cured from 'hysteria'. The disease became so rampant that doctors began to experience a whole range of problems themselves particularly arthritis and cramping and begged each other to discover a better way of solving this issue. Soon doctors began to experiment with drilling machines, shower heads and ultimately electronic toys. Eventually it was these toys that began to be marketed out to the average woman and with all these women finally cured from their 'hysteria' it was once again safe for man to step outside.\n\nWe laugh at the fact that mankind in general was ever so stupid to believe this, in fact we are often shocked to find out that this was still being practiced medically right up into the 1950's and 1980's in several locations. The game touches on this subject rather tastefully (but still offers a full refund for those that find the matter too distressing), the thing is though, in the game we are set for some time in the future where for one reason or another this pseudo-scientific belief is once again hailed as the cure for all things and practiced through the curing of pod chambers.\n\nIf this subject itself was not too touchy enough (no pun intended) the matter of mental disability is also majorly explored. You see our main protagonist of the game is 'Clara' who wakes up in a 'Hysteria Clinic' to find out that she is being treated for 'Schizophrenia', a mental illness where she claims that she can hear a voice calling her and manipulating her movements. This brings us to you the gamer. Yes you are her mental illness, her mysterious voice, her religious calling causing her to do things that she may not normally have done.\n\nThe game was principally made by this guy https://twitter.com/evantognotti who goes onto explore various questions about mental illness. Can it be solved? Is trying to solve it a good thing? Should we really avoid people with mental issues? Can a good voice in our head eventually turn bad? Really Bad? What effect does out casting have on mental people? Does a Schizophrenic become dependent on their voice? What happens if they were ever to lose it? Would they lose their identity? Their will to live?\n\nThe game has quite a few laugh out loud moments and plays out more like a virtual novel rather than a game where your choice maybe really matters. There is a heavy amount of written profanity in it, so the game and it's message will unfortunately be appealing to a limited few because of this. There are 6 hidden sound tapes to find in this town known as Delilah and though you can play these audio tapes  as you travel around town the 'true' significance of these tapes will not be revealed until you have all 6 and can open the 'Secret Room' which reveals some very interesting background information and back story involving the audio tapes which i have never seen in game before until now.\n\nBecause of it's original story concept and its novel never done before trick using audio logs I have to reward the game with a thumbs up. However if you are sensitive to coarse language you seriously might want to give this one a miss.","May 10","true","13.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

It's short (about 2 hours) and pretty bare-bones and straightforward -- all you really do is walk around and talk to people. There's almost no set-up and few explicit explanations. But there IS a connection that forms between you and Clara, the protagonist who's aware of your presence. The line between player and protagonist was initially blurred, but became heartbreakingly distinct by the end of the game.\n\nThe beginning of the game is a little tedious but stick with it and you'll get a whole weird self-aware sci-fi feminist story with a ridiculously charming classic-JRPG intermission, some weird existential questions, and lingering thoughts about the way women's stories are told in games and fiction.\n\nPlus this is probably the kind of game that would make Gamergaters ♥♥♥♥ their pants in fury (hella ladies! everyone is gay! blatant SJW propaganda!) so for that reason alone you should totally support it.","March 17, 2015","true","2.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","8","12","3","2"

Though it's short and you can easily finish the game in a single afternoon, it's different and interesting.\n\nOne of the minor issues that bothered me was the lack of an ability to run when you are walking through the town. I'm sure this had something to do with making you 'appreciate' the environment a bit more as some of your answers about it are addressed later in the game. However, it was still slow. I can see why some people who have written things about getting lost, or not knowing where to go could have become frustrated, but just be present for the story.\n\nThe music in this game was very interesting, if you pay attention to the music. However, if you were to play the game muted, it'd make no difference to the game. You wouldn't really have noticed something missing. If you like the music you can get a free DLC that comes with it, by the band Kearney.\n\nOne of the other issues that bothered me is that there were basic issues with level design. Guiding the player toward exits is typically done by showing you were the door is by creating walls toward those doors. That doesn't exist. There are places where you can walk that you shouldn't be able to.\nThe microwave in the Antiquates room\nThe grey building that has bricks running down the center... start from the top\nThere are other things like not knowing which way is the way out, but if you can just get past these small issues, it'll be fine.\n\nPersonally I hope the developer creates another story I can be a part of, but I hope that they fine tune some of the issues above. (I would have rated the game much higher without these issues)\n\nI'd definitely recommend 199X even if it does use stock RPGMaker graphics for parts of it. The story is what you're paying for, and it's worth the story.\n\n6.9/10","August 17, 2015","true","2.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It's certainly not for everyone, and if I had to give it a strict categorization I'd go with "post-RPG".  But I think people are going into it looking for, or expecting, something this game is not.  What it's NOT, is a (stylistically) 16-bit RPG set in the near-future-past.  What it IS, is both a parody and homage to the games that I (and Clara, and the developer, clearly) loved and cherished as a child.\n\nI'm a 31-year-old man, and kinda a "tough guy" I guess -- and I will readily admit I cried at the ending of this game.  Because it's so bittersweet, and beautiful in a way.  That last decision box, man -- wow.\n\nBut beyond that, this game captured that childlike wonder that I vividly remember when I saw a preview for the upcoming "Final Fantasy II" for SNES  (yes, I know the real numbering scheme) in 'Nintendo Power' in '91 or so; the absolute dumbstruck awe me and my little brother experienced when we saw the mechs-walking-in-the-snow intro to "FF VI" the first time; and the sense of loss when we weren't quick enough and Shadow didn't make it.  (Incidentally, we didn't know that wasn't the only possible outcome for years -- the internet wasn't really much of a thing yet.)  The references brought back so many fond memories, made me grin, and helped point me in the right direction as far as where the game was going.  I could see not "getting" the game if you DIDN'T grow up with those SNES/SFC games, though... but even so I think someone could enjoy this game without that background.  And if you DO come from that gaming background, it's gravy.  I personally absolutely loved it.  Not to mention... the dev responded quickly AND helpfully when I posted a question about remapping the control set-up for my gamepad.  (short version PROTIP: Use JoyToKey in addition to built in 360-pad support.)\n\nAnyway, the game only takes about 2-3 hours to beat.  People whining about needing a "run button" or the layout of Delilah, or how buildings are always described by size and color... are just completely missing the point.  RELAX, and enjoy the f*cking experience, man.  For f*cks sake, there are only SIX streets in the town, you ought to be able to find your way around, and if you'd just chill out and take in the details on your first few longer walks, you'd just remember every key location.  AND the layout / simplicity of the city is even a key story point.  Jesus.\n\nThe ONE complaint I've seen a few times in other reviews that I do agree with, is I wish the "inventory" was universally accessible.  Worth mentioning, however, is that in the D'n'D game-within-the-game, you actually CAN open up your "Items" and see all of those little notes -- and it was actually really cute and funny.  Maybe it's better ONLY being able to do it there, in a way?  I dunno.  It is funny how one of the other roleplayers asks about the stuff in the inventory tho, haha.  That joke would still work even if it WAS always available, though.\n\nFor 2 bucks (and I think I got it even cheaper than that on sale or in a bundle or something) it's WELL worth it in my eyes -- clearly, I would hope.  HIGHLY recommended for anyone who truly LOVED 16-bit RPGs... and not just the games, but the CHARACTERS.\n\nI'll miss you, Clara.

I respect that the game lets you call it pretentious. While overall it was a great experience I have a few small complaints. I think it was perhaps too short, or maybe just not dense enough, for how many different subjects it tries to hit: identity, sexuality, control, relationships, sanity, rebellion, enlightenment, and so many more. Any one of these subjects alone can drive stories much bigger than this. In a similar vein I feel like there was a lot more potential in the story/game for more choices or branches, more content. I guess that would go against the feeling of inevitability I got from the whole thing, but I think it could work.\n\nDon't get me wrong, for only $2 you get more than your money's worth even at full price.","January 10","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Despite my disposition to tumblr I really enjoyed this game.\n\nThe story was really enjoyable, depressing at times and joyous at others. The fourth wall break was perfect, and really blended well in the game. Each of the characters showed a lot of depth and emotion to them. The areas of life that this game delves into are typically areas that I'd never expect a pixelated  rpg-maker game to dive right into. The game creator did an amazing job I think, though there were some points when it did get a tad pretentious.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game was the mechanics, though of course this is to be expected as it is self proclaimed to be a "Game without mechanics". There is not map indicator telling you were to go, there is no quest log telling you what has happened, there is nothing in this game but you and Clara.\nPersonally I never fell victim to the lack of mechanics of the game as I played it all in one sitting so I never forgot where I was or where I was going. (though I will say it took me around 10 minutes to find out how to leave the town in D&D.)\n\nI'd strongly suggest picking this game up if you enjoyed games like To the Moon, or Always Sometimes Monsters, especially considering the cheap price for this gem.\n\nInitial play though was around 2 hours. That being said you may assume that it's really short.... well yeah, you're right. But the game is not shallow in any sense, it wraps up nicely. And also I'd gladly play though this again to try to try the get different options, and grab all 6 cassettes.\n\nTL;DR\nTumblr + RPG Maker = You pushing your pinkie against your computer monitor","May 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

At first I thought it was just an annoying glitch but no, you have to go through that and it's just nerve wrecking.\n\nThat added to the fact that within the first minutes I found the main character, whatever her name is, absolutely unsufferable, she is so annoying I can hardly believe it.\n\nFinding the character you control very annoying really doesn't help getting into and liking the rigid mechanic of having to make the same text and questions pop up over and over so you can make the story progress because unless you do so, the game is going to trap you in the room and you can't get out.\n\nThe world is empty in the sense that you can barely interact with or get near anything, the text just pops up by walking near something/walking into a room, the controls are floaty, the dialogs and monologs are poorly written, the dialog options are pretty much the same and it forces you into a very rigid linear path, you're stripped from any personality and just go along with the story. Which is fine, but don't make it seem like we have any choice or that we are free of mechanics and free of choice because this game clearly makes you know you don't have any say on how the story should be told and the game played.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty terrible experience no matter how short or how cheap it was.

I feel they could have been better built (this is just my opinion). I have also found two areas where you shouldn't be able to walk but you can, they are only minor and I mention them just for the developer’s knowledge.

Instead of "controlling" her in the conventional game sense where you play as her, you mainly just control her movement. She speaks to you as if you are a voice in her head, who controls her movements, and you choose dialogue options that are you speaking to her instead of making her speak to NPCs. This caused me to face an interesting conundrum for the first time in my gaming life.\n\nI didn't know what reality to pretend was true as I played the game and made decisions. Did I pretend Clara was a schizophrenic and pretend that I was a voice in her head? I wasn't sure how to do that. I ultimately decided to play the game and answer questions as if I really was myself, playing a game that I bought on Steam, designed by some guy, but in addition to the normal assumptions of reality to indulge the idea that Clara might be sentient, and have false memories of her "life" and, even if her own dialogue was scripted, that she meant what she was saying.\n\nThis turned out to be a rewarding way to play the game, and I really enjoyed it throughout.\n\nOn the downside, the level design does cause some tedium in traversal, the world does not feel very fleshed out and thus the plot developments often seem random and bizarre.\n\nEven so, the writing is quite good, the music is really neat and unique, and the game concept itself really pulls you into the game. It's hard to avoid feeling involved when you have essentially been cast into the game as "you" rather than the main character. Easily worth the couple bucks it costs.","July 29, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though there are some problems with the game in story pacing, I quite enjoyed it. The game created an interesting concept in which you control the main character and have conversations, some of which are quite humorous and others are just filler. The act of you moving the character is the catalyst for the story. Rather than being a proper game, 199X plays out more of an interactive story, in which you move the story forward. The main character, however, moves slowly which drags out the game a bit, as there is a lot of walking. There is “multiple endings”, but nothing you do during the game affects them. There is also an added “secret”, which added to the experience. And that is all 199X is, an experience. The soundtrack is quite good, and the inclusion of other albums makes it definitely worth the price tag.","April 8","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Should not be played by anyone who is easily emotionally affected.\n\nI know it's a fictional game and all, but I've never thought about what happens to characters after you stopped playing. What if they could never go back to how they were? Where do they go next after everything's over? What happens if Celes only had her skills because you were controlling her?\n\nAnd that ending. Damn the creators for giving me one option only.\n\nNOW on a non-emotinal standpoint, don't expect too much from it in general (it's RPG maker after all). There's nothing to point you to the right direction, so remember to read and understand the text directions before moving on. The conversation topics have no impact on the ending, so choose what YOU want to say. The game's mostly just moving around and interacting with stuff.\n\nImmerse yourself in the story, that's where its strong point lies. While it's unpolished (Devs should have lengthened the Asylum section content) it's good story-wise. It's like someone wanted to follow in To The Moon's footsteps, but added their own taste to it (meaning that certain people might not like it that way).\n\nSo if you enjoy simple mechanics of WASD-Spacebar, along with a unique story, give it aa try.

It took more time than that... and it also touched something deep that I never though would happen.\n\nThe graphics are poor, the collisions aren't well done, lots of things strangely done... but you know what?

It's not neccecarily a game, actually- but the constant interesting choices you make throughout the 2-hour run time make it impossible to imagine this as a book or movie, even though 199X requires very little imput from the player. The story includes things I've never seen before in a game, such as a homosexual protagonist, a small town that provides the game's only environment, and a terrorist that isn't neccecarily evil. Adding to that, 199X's characters are amazing, on par with games in which you have a runtime of 100+ hours. These characters are only helped by the fact that 199X's writing is superb, with an excellent last 40 minutes that had me laugh, cry, and touch my pinkie finger to my monitor. Plus, the music goes along perfectly with the atmosphere, making me strive to collect all six casettes. Along with that is the game's price. For it's runtime, $1.99 is perfect, maybe even a steal, as this game is so good. If I had to think of some things bad about 199X, it's that the beginning is very slow, many objects, buildings, and even humans are impossible to interact with, and the game does little to hide it's RPG Maker assets. But beyond all that, definitely buy this game. If you are a fan of breaking the fourth wall, games that break new territory, or an interesting story that doesn't involve the supernatural or military warfare, give 199X a go- you won't regret it.","April 15, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That’s the problem.” Which is a fitting, if not entirely explanative description of the plot you’ll find within the game. A more through explanation is that it attempts to explore the idea of what it would be like to be a RPG protagonist. Most specifically, to have a player in your head controlling your movement and making your decisions for you.\n\nOn one hand, the metaphysical implications of this theme are explored in a intriguing way, and the indications of a world that is subtle different than our own, and disturbingly so are developed in some interesting ways, as well as the indications of how concepts of towns in a RPG world such as unusually small population density and small shops are lampshaded in a good way.\n\nUnfortunately, while the framework is solid, the elaboration on said framework is not done in a excellent manner. Many of the supporting characters lack some necessary spark that makes them feel beyond pixilated entities on a screen, and the existence of rather horrific medical procedures used to treat “Female hysteria”, after the introduction, don’t have a significant presence in the plot beyond “This is a thing that is happening and its terrible so we need to stop it.” The concept of “Show, don’t tell” is one that the designer of this game seems to have lacked, as too often exposition is used in place of demonstration. Most frustrating is that often times the conflict between many of the characters seems forced and unbelievable. And the level design in the game is poorly done, with many of the areas laid out in such a way that only a small chuck of the road you’d wish to travel on to transit to the next screen over has the transitional segment, which leads to a lot of frustration in hunting and searching for the place to go.\n\nUltimately I feel that 199X is a game that has some elements of brilliance, but falls far short of delivering on what it holds on to. While at the price of 2$ one could do far worse at a bargain bin game, the lack of depth ultimately makes me unable to find a audience I can recommend this to, save those who are in more meta games to write analysis about.","November 27, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll admit I didn't always know exactly what was going on but overall I enjoyed the characters and the story to the game. Though rather depressing stuff here.\n\nThe game won't be for everyone and the script could use a little work.

The music was good and well placed/used. The graphics were good and cleverly used at points in the game. It's an all around solid game that I enjoyed immensely. I can't say more about the game itself  because to say what makes it so great would spoil it.\n\nThe only things I'd change about the game are incredibly minor. The ability to remap the keys so I could use WASD instead ot the arrow keys, change it so F12 doesn't exit the game entirely and add one more day so the game could've started on my birthday instead of the day after :)\n\nI look forward to future games from the creator.","November 8, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It explores how a character would act if they were both the lead and a pawn in their own story.\n\nThe game itself is very touching, and is maybe second only to Undertale on the list of games that made me care so much for the character, though in this case it was the player character, not the NPCs. God, I could write a whole thing on that aspect alone, but I know I'll pass Steam's word limit.\n\nThe soundtrack isn't the best quality, but it's strangely fitting for the game. Think like a more ambient, experimental version of Heavens to Betsy. Overall it looks cheap and thrown together, but I actually love it for that. My only real gripe is some sloppy dialogue in which characters swear way too much or just have a few lazily written lines. Not a deal breaker by any stretch, as I've played a handful of RPG Maker games now and that seems to be a common issue.\n\nYour interaction with this game feels permanent, like even if you reset and start everything over there's always a little bit left behind. It's weird to think of it like that, but somehow, 199X made me feel that way.","March 12","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All choices you make are seemingly nonconsequential.\n-Occasional extreme confusion as to where you are supposed to walk to next\n-Some unneeded NSFW-ish themes\n-Some not good story bits\n-Some not cool characters with not-interesting backstories\n\nOverall, I hesitantly recommend it.
