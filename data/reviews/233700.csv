You will be hungry and starved, your equipment will break, your armor will fail, and your ammunition will run dry. You will be stunned, confused, blinded, and terrorized. You will be shot by crazed security robots, shredded by mutated terrors, and gnawed on by countless foes, and occasionally disintegrated.\n\n...so, you've got that going for you.\n\n\nOverview (what is it?):\n\nSword of the Stars: The Pit is a turn-based top-down roguelike, where you play a character exploring a hostile and ancient alien complex trying to find the cure for a plague that is running rampant through the worlds.\n\nGameplay:\n\nWell, for those unfamiliar with roguelikes - this game is not meant to be beaten in a few hours then discarded. As my introduction stated, this is a challenging game, with permanent death (the game mechanics prevent you from saving, except to exit the game) and you can only have one active game per character class at once, so you'll frequently watch as a character you've invested hours of gameplay into is wiped out or overwhelmed. Because the game is randomly generated each time, sometimes bad luck will end a good run with not much you can do about it. Your character has several limiting factors to keep in mind - ammunition is limited, and can only be replenished by finding more (which, depending on the weapon, may not be that common). Food is a concern as well, as there is a hunger mechanism that makes starving a real possibility if you can't find or make enough food to stay alive. Disease is a concern - not just from infected creatures, but perhaps by being forced to eat things you shouldn't...  And, of course, there's just running out of hit points and dying at the hands of the denizens of the complex!\n\nGameplay itself is turn based, with you and monsters alternating turns (though, if no monsters are visible or present, your turns run seamlessly together making it easy to move around). each turn you have a limited number of movement points to move around the grid squares and explore the complex, looking for abandoned equipment you can scavenge or repair, old lockers that might contain food or items you could use - and, of course, creatures that may still be lurking! Somewhere on each level is a hatch leading to the next level below, with monsters getting tougher as you descend.\n\nThe interface is a nice balance of being easy to get used to, though does take a quick reference of the manual to learn some of the finer points. generally, you move with the awsd keys, and use the space bar to interact with objects you face. 'Interact' is case sensitive; for a locker or a freezer, it'll be 'open', a locked vault will be 'unlock', a broken piece of equipment will be 'repair', etc. Combat is similarly simple - equip the weapon you'd like (or select from available hotkeys), and click on the target. (And, yes, there is a good tutorial available to teach you all this stuff!)\n\nOverall, though the game itself is simple, I found (and still find!) it interesting because some of the choices the gameplay provides. I'm hungry - do I dare risk eating my tainted meat, or press a little further in hopes of finding something more suitable? The room ahead is heavily guarded - is it worth the ammunition I'll use (and wounds I'll take!) to clear it in hopes of finding equipment I can use, or should I bypass it? My inventory is full - do I drop some of the parts I'm carrying in hopes of building something useful down the line, or sacrifice some of my limited food, ammo, or extra weapons?\n\nCrafting:\n\nSince I mentioned it above, a note on crafting. As you explore, you will find recipes and blueprints (or, sometimes, discover them yourself) that allow you to combine items you find to create new items. Some of these are intuitive (cook raw meat to make cooked meat. Combine certain meat with bread to make a sandwich, etc.) but the crafting system is very involved, to the point of being able to craft for yourself armor, weapons, and equipment that will drastically improve your chances for survival. How involved? Well, I'm several HUNDRED hours into the gameplay, and still am constantly finding new clues and recipes...   it's certainly a rich and rewarding ara to explore -though sometimes frustrating, as the random nature of the game means you may have a great blueprint, but be short of a needed item to build what you want, and unable to find said item (or, worse sometimes, have all the items you need, but lack a workstation to assemble it!) The limited inventory space means you can't simply carry everything - you have to decide what is important to you, which again leads to some interesting choices sometimes. Anyway, know that crafting is very important in this game, and there's much to discover here!\n\n(Also, note that I play The Pit with several DLC installed; this does add some to the crafting, but to be fair, I don't think I'm close to finding all the recipes from the original game yet!)\n\n\n\nCharacters:\n\nYour first choice when you begin a game is which character you'd like to play. The original game provides three options - a marine, who is very capable in combat but lacking in the finesse and scientific skills; an engineer who has lots of technical know-how but limited combat effectiveness; or a scout - a sort of jack-of-all-trades character, a mix of some finesse and technical skills combined with some light combat skills as well.\n\nAvailable DLC (downloadable content) allows you to broaden this class list: Mind Games adds psionic powers to the game and allows you to play as a human Scion or an alien Tarka Ranger, and the Gold expansion adds four more (three immediately and one unlockable) characters.\n\nI won't go into too much character detail here - the info is out there if you choose, but suffice it to say that each character has strengths and weaknesses, different starting equipment and skills, as well as a personal backstory for why the character is descending into The Pit.\n\nAnd the choices you make are very relevant, too - for example, the marine excels at combat, so you'd think he'd be easy to play, as monsters don't really scare him. However, his lack of foraging skills mean he's more likely to go hungry from not finding food, and he may run out of ammo faster from not being able to find more - plus his limited science skills mean he's less able to craft new equipment for himself.\n\nOverall, most of the classes are well balanced - there's one I find to be a touch overpowered, and a couple I don't play because they don't fit my playstyle (one in particular seems a little weak) but with this much to choose from it seems to me that the average player is going to find at least a couple they really enjoy.\n\nCharacter Advancement:\n\nYour character has four attributes (might, finesse, brains, and power) that you can increase as you advance, as well as various skills. Skills include weapons skills (pistol, rifle, blade, to name a few) and equally important non-combat skills (foraging, lockpicking, psionic skills, decipher, electronics, etc). The basic game has something like 20 skill areas available to your character, and the mindgame expansion adds five more (five different psionic skills) for a total of 25. Each time you gain a level, you're given a number of skill points (dependant on character class) to assign. Again, it comes down to choice - you can't be good at everything, so what's important to you? Skills will level with use to a certain point - but to be really good takes some added skill points.\n\nYour character also has various other values (hit points, armor, etc) that are fairly self-evident, but I do want to make note of the hunger mechanism. Each character has a 'food' bar, similar to a life/hit points bar- eat some food, this goes up to a certain maximum.","June 9, 2014","true","522.3"," 131 of 139 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","131","139","0","2"

I've never been one for Roguelikes, albeit content with minimalist graphics, ASCII lies beyond my tolerance, so I'm fairly new to the genre. Also, being a compulsive cleptomaniac in RPGs, permadeath and losing all my gleefully scavenged goodies has never been a positive factor. However, this has gripped me. Starting out is a little grindy, as you must unlock vital crafting recipes (i'd recommend the wiki) to really stand a chance at not starving to death early on. However, due to heavy randomisation, progress can hinge on redundant plans and experience is required to know how you can adapt.\n\nThe more you play, the more you learn and damn, is there much to learn as you desperately try to manage your equipment and potentially useful crafting items to survive another floor. Utterly brutal, but brilliant.

You'll have suffered at the hands of Risk of Rain, but eventually felt the sweet taste of coming out on top. You'll have been bruised and battered by ToME, but in the end, you showed that game who was boss. Probably you've gritted your teeth in the final boss battle of FTL at least a dozen times, swearing at it, but coming back for more, and eventually succeeded.\n\nSo when you play Sword of the Stars: The Pit, it's going to kick your ♥♥♥, and your first reaction will be: "Well, it's like those other games, I just have to learn how to play it." It'll happen again and again, defeat after defeat, spurning your best attempts to master the game, and slowly, but surely, you'll start to wonder: "Am I just bad at this game? Is it just THAT tough? That complex? Something beyond my skills?"\n\nAnd the answer is: No, it's not. It's just a ♥♥♥♥ game. Unfortunately, SotS: The Pit, suffers from having too many resources to manage(durability, Psi, food, health AND ammo), and aside from Psi, which can eventually alleviate two of them(health and food), there's no way to trade between your resources, and getting the right things to recover said resources is entirely random. You'll also have no idea which of the dozen or so crafting-and-foraging skills will be relevant on a given run, as the containers provided are entirely random, not to mention that you may simply get none of the necessary crafting stations even if you have all the ingredients, and since there's also about a dozen different kinds of ammo, and some armor and food don't work for all the characters... I think you get the idea. It requires such absurd luck to actually get what you need, and at basically no point is your own skill involved. You rarely get the choice of whether to engage or not, either, since anything you spot will likely move to engage you, sneaking isn't a skill and almost any hostile can outrun you.\n\nThe game also suffers from the fact that some of the playable classes have non-functional features, like the Lich. It's roughly a 50-50 chance whether his minions will ignore enemies or just wander in circles while said enemies liberate your femur for a chewtoy.\n\nReally, there's so much random chance involved that you may as well not even play the game, just roll a die to determine whether you succeed or not, keep doing it until you get a success, and then go play a more fun game.","March 1, 2015","false","36.2"," 211 of 321 people (66%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","66","211","321","24","26"

The monsters (of which there are so, so many different and unique types) get harder the deeper you go, the loot gets progressively better although is still wonderfully randomised -- sometimes you are cursing your lack of equipment, other times you get lucky. Food is scarce, so you must scavenge to stay alive. You can craft items and food from recipes which you can discover through experimentation or by hacking computer terminals and gradually uncovering pieces of text leading you to the full recipe. This element adds to the replayability as you'll likely learn something new from each run.\nThe game is brutally hard as you crank up the difficult level, but for those looking for an easier time the Easy setting is much more forgiving.\n\nSo yeah, if you like Rogue-likes and want an extremely polished turn-based game with wonderful graphical style, sound and huge replayability, I can't recommend this enough :)","November 26, 2013","true","63.3"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","37","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/233700/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","(In the interests of full disclosure, this review is based on the Gold Edition - which should be considered the best option available).\n\nA metacritic of 68? Who reviewed this game? Ben Kuchera? Did it not have enough empty houses for him to rummage through with stories of teenage girl angst to get voyeuristic over?\nIt's nethack, but not your father or your mother's nethack. This is tried and tested "Get in from the frozen exterior of a planet into a secret underground base that extends downwards further than any greedy dwarf dared dig." model, but brought up to date with a solid lick of paint, high resolution graphics, and a clear and consistent approach to enemies, objects and overall design.\n\nThe story, what there is, is much the norm for such roguelikes, it's merely the pretext for getting you to the front of the dungeon, the reality is that this is a true roguelike, you go as far as you can, aiming to reach the bottom of the pit, or die messily along the way. You only have one life, no do-overs. Unlike a lot of "modern" nethacks, this one goes back to roll style checks for skill tests, and gives an extensive list of possible talents to sculpt and model your character. The Gold edition additionally features several extra classes, giving you a respectable pool of choices, both human and nonhuman in nature (playing as an alien ranger is -awesome- ).\n\nIt's base levels all the way down, they're all evil, they all want to kill you.\nScattered throughout each randomly generated floor is a variety of traps, both tile and door based, locked chests and rooms, and various devices that may help or hinder your ability to progress. Ranging from defunct cookers that need repairing to prepare a simple blandwich (Don't ask what's in one, really, you don't want to know..), to advanced and somewhat dotty security computers that may just as readily electrocute you as deactivate the several heavily armed and armoured droids patrolling the area.\n\nThe game operates functionally as a turn based game, with each discrete action you take allowing the AI the opportunity to respond (hint - if the game pauses briefly between moves, there's something nearby, and it's almost certainly unfriendly). You take an action, the AI takes an action, repeat until either you or whatever the AI sent your way has collapsed in a pool of it's own fluids.\n\nMake sure you know what you're killing, and you're killing it with the right gun.\nWhen dealing with multiple foes, target selection becomes important, you can if you feel confident let the computer handle targetting and it does a sensible enough job, but on occasion you'll want to step in yourself to ensure that the scariest thing dies first. Combat employs a wide variety of melee and projectile weapons, and in keeping with the future sci-fi aesthetic, these can be pretty fantastical, including laser, plasma and other interesting effects.\n\nWith the addition of extra characters, Mind Games and all the extra ways to die, The Pit has become highly complex, very well supported, and a deep and involving creature, there's now many ways to die, many ways to survive, and many accomodations for various playstyles. This is -not- however, baby's first nethack. You will want to start with say, Dungeons of Dredmor, because this one will kill you in good order if you're not at least familiar with the concept of being pragmatic and cautious and making efficient use of your time. Hunger can ruin your life far easier than you might expect.\n\nIn such games, death can come in many ways, here is no exception. Simply being impaled is for novices, try being irradiated, choked by a mimic pretending to be a med station, diseased by an out of control experiment, or being melted in acid. It is important to note that in these games - Death is an opportunity to learn, not a signal of failure. Go in expecting to die a lot, and the ultimate victory will be that much sweeter.\n\nClosing thoughts\nThis game is not for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the effort, and for an intermediate roguelike player, someone who's cut their teeth on more forgiving entries to the genre (Dungeons of Dredmor is a great place to start), this is the logical progression. Welcome to The Pit. Enjoy your stay.\n\nVerdict : Highly recommended, and to the so called "professional reviewers" who say otherwise, hang your heads in shame you overpriced wastes of space. You no longer deserve the sites you work for.","November 26, 2013","true","19.7"," 61 of 85 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","61","85","0","0"

Completing a full successful run of The Pit is a pretty length endeavor as well, so if you are looking for a game that offers you a quick play, this isn't it either. If what you want is a scarcity-driven roguelike with a great interface and a well done setting and theme, The Pit will not disappoint.\n\nI also highly recommend this game to experienced players who feel that today's games are easy to the point of boredom. The Pit is hard, and in a good way-at first it seems that you lose to randomness, but usually it's due to playing sloppy or greedy and this game punishes mistakes in a way that most games don't.

Sword of the Stars: The Pit is an exceedingly competent entry into the genre that is well executed.  The graphics are a bit strange but familiar to those that have been with the series, and in the scope of it's own series are done fairly well if not extraordinarialy.  (The character animations definetely look to have been done on OpenCanvas or something similar and stand out against the rest of the game, though).\n\nThe roguelike elements are definetely the strength of the game.  Combat is intuitive, fair, and reasonably balanced.  The creature AI can be relied upon to act in a consistent manner which is fairly important for combat in roguelikes, and the different weapons actually add a variety of game mechanics rather than just being incrementally increased versions of the same guns, which is a pitfall of many roguelikes.  The random nature of the game can make things in some runs much more difficult, but I never felt the randomness broke a game in the way it can in many roguelikes.  If you got a bad roll on a level you can still have an entirely legitimate change of making it through the level if you play skillfully, such as utilising beserk mechanics to cause enemies to fight each other, luring enemies into environmental hazards, through grenades around corners, or placing traps.  Which also leads into another of the games strengths - there are a lot of mechanics such as those I just mentioned and they're fairly intuitive for the most part.  If you have any experience with roguelikes you likely don't need the tutorial or the manual, although both of those are actually quite well done.  The one mechanic I do have a gripe with is the idea of the crafting recipes.  It's supposed to be able to find recipes through some of the data panels but I have never done so.  Most of them can't be found this way and it turns the game either into experimentation with blind luck, or consulting a wiki.  There's some people that like their games like that however, and it's a subjective preference of mine that I don't.  The voice acted parts - albeit fairly rare - are actually pretty well done, as well.  The whole game just seems to be a game where a significant amount of time and effort has been taken on polishing the game, something sorely lacking from many releases big and small these days.\n\nThe biggest criticism I have about the game is that is very "safe".  It takes no risks and as such is very generic in the truest sense of the word.  However it's a well-executed implementation of the genre with an interesting background story and theme that offers a huge amount of replayability and a variety of different levels of challenge for someone to find their individual level of comfort.

I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. The first thing to know is that this is probably the only modern roguelike on Steam. Sure, there's CoQ, ADOM, TOME, NetHack, etc. But those are ASCII roguelikes with tile interfaces. This has true ground-up, fully constructed graphics, sound, and music while maintaining the challenge and replayability of the others listed.\n\nHere's the love part of the relationship. This game is infinitely replayable. The different classes handle differently (ahem, other roguelikes that have nominally different classes that basically handle the same). This creates massive variety in playstyle. There is an epically huge amount of items and enemy types. Choices matter. Strategy matters. This is a roguelike with the greatness of a modern UI.\n\nThe hate part of the relationship. The recipe system was a hugely original and clever way to put persistence in the game without altering the gameplay or permadeath components. Unfortunately, it is a bit too steep. After 100 hours, I'm not even close to having completed the recipes. This drives me away in frustration every now and again. Once this part is completed, I'll probably enjoy the game more.\n\nThe other thing is that it takes a very, very long time to complete a successful run. This means you'll find yourself blaming RNG and the cruelty of the difficulty a bit much. Sometimes this drives me away. To be fair, this is an illusion. Anyone who claims the game is too RNG dependent doesn't know what they are talking about, and you can safely ignore their review. Go watch people who are excellent at the game.\n\nIf you play in the Easy - Hard difficulty settings, and you consistently die, then it is your own fault. Post a video of your run, and people will point out the hundreds of tiny mistakes you make each floor that caused you to die in the long run.\n\n\nAnyway, this game is excellent, and the flaws do not hinder it enough to ever truly pull me away. If you're a roguelike fan and you haven't played this yet, you're missing out big time.","December 16, 2015","true","157.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

You can't miss with this basic premise, but you can certainly sweeten the pot.  Making the loot drool worthy is a complicated exercise in tug-of-war: too strong, and you'll never find improvments, not enough and you have your players getting bored.  SotS deftly walks this tightrope with a deep crafting system and the depth of the game itself.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by that a little more:  The game is pretty difficult (if you're playing correctly :^)) but there are A LOT of cool things to find that can be a big help.  Whether it's a electronic chip that boosts your computer skill to max level, or a sick, sick piece of armor, every cool find is made cooler by the hope of getting deeper into your run they represent.\n\nYou start the game having to choose a difficulty (at least hard for the most fun) and a class.  The differences in the classes are refreshingly pronounced and greatly influence how the game plays out.  The Commando has a big advantage with starting equipment and stats, but doesn't grow as fast as the Scout (whom will get one or two shotted on the first few floors of the Pit).\n\nCombat is fluid and lovely. The game is actually turn based so standing still gives you time to size up situations and make a decision.  Everything takes place on a grid.  The game has a magic ability to shoot at the square you want even when you misclick.  Seriously, it's uncanny.\n\nAs with most roguelikes, your goal is to get as far as you can.  I think you can actually beat this game but it's harder than a mother ♥♥♥♥er.  Replay value is built in with the roguelike genre, but The Pit particularly so since the game changes even more than normal from run to run and class to class.\n\n8.4/10","November 29, 2013","true","24.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Between these two loosely defined and ocassionally overlapping categories, Sword of the Stars: The Pit is the latter. If you have experience with roguelikes, especially older ones, you have seen the elements that make it up before: heavily randomized level layouts, a prominent hunger mechanic to penalize idleness, and turn-based movement and combat. If all you care about is new game mechanics, this roguelike may not be for you.\n\nYet what Sword of the Stars: The Pit lacks in innovation it more than makes up for in polish, setting, and play style diversity. Each of the classes, with or without the additional ones from DLC, feels sufficiently different that relying on the same strategies in a universal manner is going to get you killed. With a host of stats and systems for gunplay, psychic powers and melee combat there is a class or two for everyone.\n\n\nChances are you will still die, of course. As rogue-likes go, this one is relatively forgiving, but the key word is relatively. You will still ♥♥♥♥ up and get murdered or starve, possibly several times in a row if you are unlucky or careless. If all you care about is getting to the end of a game, this probably isn't for you. If you can accept and embrace failure, however, Sword of the Stars has plenty of fun to be had on the way to the reaper.","October 9, 2014","true","9.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

It's a Rogue-like, and, if you know what that means, you're probably a fan of the type. If not, do a little research because the sub-genre isn't for everyone.\n\nFirstly, the game is very broad for how simple it is. There are a ton of interactable objects within the Pit to interact with, all relying on your particular class' skills and some RNG to determine the effect when using them. (Typically, pass/fail, but sometimes the reward or punishment can be greater than standard.) Tons of weapons, armors, utility items and the like to aid in your overall objective which is to reach the bottom of the Pit!\n\nThere's a crafting system in place, but you'll have to find the right Interactable objects and the recipes (sometimes, you can guess or cheat if you want) to craft the items. However, your recipes and 'deciphering' progress are saved across playthroughs, so you'll be able to access previously acquired recipes or progress to acquiring them regardless of your deaths. (And you will die, often).\n\nThe graphics are semi-retro but colorful and pleasing, and despite their somewhat lighthearted appearance, the game has this eerie feel to it that is enhanced by the imagery.\n\nThe audio is fine, nothing spectacular, but it isn't bad or unfitting. The soundtrack can become a little redundant once you've put a lot of time into the game, but the track changes ~5 floors. And honestly, I feel its atmospheric quality makes it acceptable 'background' music, in that it doesn't grate on your nerves.\n\nThe interface and controls are excellent. Straight-forward and for the most part, comprehensive. You can play the game completely without a mouse but I don't really see any advantage to it.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very different. You have 'moves' available displayed above your health/stats bars that dictates how many squares you can move before two things happen. 1) The 'time' increases by 1 point each time you exhaust your moves. 2) All the enemies on your particular floor will take their turn, whether or not it interferes with you. So it is at your behest to do more research on this style of turn-based play, I remember it being a little disorienting at first.\n\nAs time progresses lots of passive systems take effect, like your 'food' levels, health regen (you and enemies) buffs/debuffs etc. On the higher difficulties, time can become VERY crucial, making each step its own calculated decision. Some actions use 1 or more time units regardless of your Move allowance. Things like reloading or interacting with the world. There's a pretty sharp learning curve at the very beginning but it all makes sense very quickly and there are a ton of beginner guides that are far more comprehensive than this little review.\n\nALSO! Learn to make use of Ctrl+W/A/S/D this allows you to turn without using a move-unit, which is critical for observing your surroundings before potentially allowing the enemy a turn.\n\nI only just came back to this game after almost 2 years because someone commented on a forum post from way back. It reminded me how much I love this game and the punishment it can deliver. It's a great game by a great Indie company and it comes with a ton of DLC that add lots of little pieces and additional classes. My suggestion is to get it all at once, as some of the DLC adds quality-of-life and UI improvements that I wouldn't want to deal with anymore.

The story is rudimentary and will neither surprise nor impress you from beginning to end, which is standard for the genre.\n\nThe game, with its DLC, currently features a single, procedurally generated 40-floor dungeon along with achievements, crafting, eight playable characters and four difficulty levels. Progress may be saved and resumed until death, which is permanent.\n\nCombat is turn-based and primarily involves guns and grenades but, since ammo is a finite resource, your fist and bladed weapons are there to back you up.  The bulk of enemies are either robots or run-of-the-mill insectoid and little green alien types.  In addition, you’ll have to deal with the threat of traps, status effects, starvation and equipment degradation.\n\nCrafting is necessary for survival and allows you to create food, medicine, tools and equipment out of components scavenged from enemies and containers.  Recipes can be found by decrypting messages on computer terminals and every action in the game requires you to pass a skill check with a chance to fail.  Electronics, computers, lockpicking, mechanical and medicine are a few examples of non-weapon skills.\n\nThe Pit is a traditional roguelike, where magic and generic fantasy have been replaced with uninspired technology and sci-fi.  Even so, the sci-fi setting is a breath of fresh air.  Despite feeling a bit slow at times, the game does a good job of forcing you to make the most of your supplies and surroundings.

As I was playing, I eventually had a fatal thought. Why am I playing this instead of DoD, Dungeonmans, ADoM, or another vastly more enjoyable roguelike?\n\nI had no answer whatsoever and so I stopped - in the middle of a pretty good run that may well have led to victory - and uninstalled it. I feel better already.\n\nThe trickiness is that the game appears well-crafted and designed, and nicely executes on that addictive formula of needing just one more key ingredient or item to make a solid run. So you keep going, searching every crate and biopod for your holy grail. And when you don't find it and instead die, you think JEEZ I was SO close. And that thought, that sense of ALMOST is so overwhelming that you forget to ask yourself: was I even having fun?\n\nWell no, and here's why:\n\n-Every run begins with a boring grind. That's how it's designed. You have to be moderately idiotic or unlucky to fail within the first 10 or so levels, yet if you want to succeed in the later 20, you have to play those first ten conservatively and thoroughly. This means using your fists and knives to conserve ammo and durability - which means taking longer to kill every monster. You have to lockpick every door and station in order to raise your skills and get exp. This takes hours and it's not fun because...\n\n-Tactics and variety are both nil. Except for rare situations, combat tactics do not extend beyond conservation of durability and ammo. Most of the classes play remarkably similarly. The biggest difference is starting gear. But they otherwise have the same skills and stats, just different starting numbers... which primarily affect RNG success or failure. Weapons all function more or less the same. Not that it would matter anyway because the only choice you have is to use what the game gives you, and that's just how it's gonna be.\n\n-Inventory and itemization sucks. First off, as I said, nothing you get offers drastic new tactical opportunities. It's mostly just numbers. This bread can be combined with this meat to raise this hunger bar by this amount. This repair kit raises this durability number. This necklace gives 5 to your stats so you have a 1% greater chance at the RNG game. Nothing that will totally change how you play the game. Second off, crafting blows. Finding recipes is laughably grindy (and on some characters impossible), so basically everyone resorts to the wiki. But even using the wiki, I never once crafted anything cool. Not armor, not a weapon, not a robot friend to follow me around. At best, I put a scope on a rifle which -- yep you guessed it! -- gave me a slightly higher chance of winning the RNG game.\n\n-All of this combines to make death entirely unenjoyable and onerous. Which yeah kind of a weird statement. But not really. That's supposed to be a roguelike's modus operandi. Yeah, sure, your char permadies BUT here's some metagame progression to lessen the sting. OR hey that just means you get to try out a new character with totally different tactics! There is NONE of that here. You die - and it's 50/50 whether it was your fault - and that's that. And then you pick a character who essentially plays the same as the one who just died.\n\nBasically, if this were the ONLY roguelike available, I'd probably recommend it. Roguelikes are sweet. But there is NO particular reason to play THIS one. If you're tempted to buy it, don't. Get Dungeons of Dredmor or another roguelike instead. Or if you already own one, go load it up. You'll have more fun, I guarantee it.","March 31","false","17.1"," 29 of 50 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","29","50","0","0"

It does everything a roguelike is supposed to do. Procedurally generated levels with a high degree of randomization. A class based system that can radically alter your playstyle as well as your access to items. An unforgiving difficulty that is a mixture of luck and skill.\n\nFrankly every roguelike does that, however, and this one has very little else going for it and a lot of strikes against it. For instance, you require food to survive, a resource which can be very limited. You get plenty of ingredients, but even if you do find a cooker it is most likely broken, requiring a skillcheck and a dice roll to fix. Even if you do fix it, you have to trial-and-error your way into a valid recipe, costing you precious resources with each failure. Even if you do find a valid recipe, that valid recipe can fail, consuming those resources anyways. It's a prime example of the artificial difficulty that plagues the game. Nearly every valuable item is secured behind some sort of skillcheck.\n\nCombat is clean and simple, but boring. Warrior types are simply left-click to win, while psionics-- the game's version of magic users-- have more options, but most will be constrained to a single attack spell until well into the game. Weapons and armor have durability and proper replacements are precious, forcing you into sub-optimal strategies in order to preserve your most valuable equipment from an unseen acid trap or simply usage damage.\n\nThe greatest asset to the game is its unique genre, as scifi roguelikes are relatively rare, and are helped by the Sword of the Stars IP by allowing you to play varied races in the DLCs. Despite that, expect to spend your first couple of levels fighting rats and bats all the same.\n\nAll in all, simply average. Would only recommend it to people who have exhausted the many other roguelike options and strongly needed a fresh challenge.\n\nTake a look at the gameplay here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNHDxZiYysY","January 28, 2014","false","1.6"," 37 of 66 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","37","66","0","0"

It's frustratingly difficult. Sometimes too frustrating, and sometimes too easy. Which is to say two things:\n\n1. The RNG in this game can be decidedly cruel or benevolent. Getting that one weapon from that one locker on floor 3 could mean the difference between dying on the next floor or 10 floors later. And then, sadly, sometimes you'll get that weapon and it'll be meant for another race. Or you'll get a power suit and you're not a marine (who plays marine anyway?). Considering the wide variety of items, and how exclusive many of them are, it stands to reason that they implemented my second point...\n\n2. ... that being the "blue rooms" on every 5th floor. Now, here's where you can basically cheese the game to make it easy, depending on how much time and effort you feel like spending. Every 5th floor there is a room somewhere that contains two storage units that can be accessed by any character on that same difficulty: one for experience, and one for items. A character who REACHES this floor may ONLY deposit into both of these, but they can deposit *anything*. Including all of your experience gained from level 1, if you chose to not level up your character at all, allowing you to donate a gigantic amount of experience (since it multiples your donation by 5). As well, you can donate any items, including any of your starting gear, which can allow for some nasty combinations. A NEW character that STARTS on the floor you donated to can access and withdraw from these, but not deposit.\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue to me if the system were implemented in an easier way. This is really my only gripe. A more thought-out way of giving your new character an edge based on how well you did/lucky you were on your last runs would've been appreciated--I choose to simply ignore the blue rooms.\n\nOkay, one more gripe: crafting. You'll find all sorts of stuff and have a hard time crafting. Your inventory will fill quickly and you'll not want to get rid of all the puzzle pieces you have for stuff. It's frustrating.\n\nThat's it, though. This game frustrates the ♥♥♥♥ out of me and I love it for it. Great survival gameplay, starvation is a very real threat (especially if you're Striker), as is running out of ammunition or having weapons break, things exploding, acid eating at your armor, traps destroying your favorite gadgets, poisons from annoying, screeching spiders with crazy movespeed that can kill you in a few turns, bullets that'll mow through the uncautious... fun for the whole family, really.","October 19, 2015","true","91.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are 40 floors(with all dlc),5 difficulty modes,3 different game speeds(default for the normal gamer, the other 2 for casual gaming and people who want to play at a faster pace). The A.I is decent and not dumb,weapons have ranges + different accuracy rates,and abilities. Armor,weapons and items can degrade over time but be fixed. Devs are active with patches and any tweaks the community feels the game needs, and are responsive to questions of concern.Cheapest price for Gold (comes with mind games + gold edition dlc) was $1.74 @ amazon and $3.25 @Gamers gate over the winter 2013 sales. I advise you get the game with the mind games and gold edtion dlc(yes this is a dlc). Get the game already and have fun.\n\n##Detailed Review##\nDon't let its basic looks fool you,graphics although in a 2d style some might now like are well done.There are 5 various difficulty settings as well as game speeds(rate in which you can progress through floors).So the game should be good for the casual gamer,to the hardcore gamer.There are lots of skills you can level up with skill points + with use of the skills themselves.\n\nThe animations,environmental graphc effects are a nice touch. There are a number of races you get to choose that serve as the  character classes in the game. You have various status effects that can thwart your fight through the floors. In all 40 floors to fight through,various trap types to avoid,things to hack,safes to crack,things to forage through,food to cook etc.\n\nStarvation,illness,degrading armor and weapons are just some of the things that you have to worry about constantly.Weapons/armors can be repaired if you have the skill and the repair tool needed.Food can be cooked various recipes to make different things with chances of failure to make losing you the ingredients.Lots of craftable stuff in general.\n\nCombat wise with guns act as you might think ,shot guns have bullet spread,pistols have high accuracy but not limited range ,rifles can multi-target mobs per turn.Various melee weapons daggers,swords,etc,different types of throwables, and even psychic powers that have multiple types that function differently.\n\nMobs are varied quite well with different attack types,stats,behaviors,etc.The A.I. is pretty decent and they get tougher as you get deeper and deeper.Different environments/biomes make up certain sections of the floors as you explore.There are various debilitated items which can be restored (if successful) and then used.Lockers,beds,broken down medical items,etc can be found repaired or searched.\n\nAll the dlcs add character classes,weapons,armor,items,new mobs,new skills and more difficulty.Vanilla gives you 3 classes , Gold Editon DLC adds 3 more and mind games adds an additional 2.TBH I would suggest you get the whole thing as one package.Gamers Gate had SoTS:The Pit Gold for $3.75 during the 2013 winter sale and amazon for $1.74 durin the winter sale.Retailers outside of steam sell the game + 2 dlcs as Gold/Gold Edition.The devs actively patch and tweak things the community finds to be wrong.","December 27, 2013","true","96.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

Difficult gameplay and RNG can make for some really fun games for me.\n\nPro: (1) I really like the style/tone of the game. Having a sci-fi Rouge-lite is pretty refreshing, given how much of the genre is generic fantasy. (2) The gameplay and variety of items/weapons/armor is really diverse. There are plenty of items you will likely never see more than 1-2 times. Ranged weapons, melee, and psychic powers (basically magic) are all valid playstyles. (3) The large variety of characters allow you to pick a focus for a playstyle you like; however, they are all (mostly) able to eventually shift into other playstyles with a little work.\n\nCons: (1) The game is a little slow. I like Binding of Isaac and FTL for the short 30-60 minute playtimes. A good run at the Pit will last at least 10-ish hours though. This does help build the tension though. (2) The interface can be a little counter intuitive and annoying to scroll through, given the large amount of pages you need to access.

It's a tough game to win because even on easy, other than unlocking doors, it is not forgiving. But it's usually hard because you can't find food, you can't find a gun or the right ammunition to fight, or you can't find ingredients to craft that precise recipe to cure disease--not because you died in combat.\n\nThe combat aspect of the game are indeed fun. The levels are small, yet rich with monsters to kill and other stuff to interact with. Every 5 levels down, the enemies gets tougher. Then at the bottom of the pit, the game becomes 20x harder than the first 29 levels combined because, well, they throw 20x monsters at you.\n\nOverall, the game is entertaining, but it primarily suffers from a bad crafting system that requires very specific ingredients for even the most basic items. Plus the crafting stations are usually nowhere to be found when you need them most. So ultimately you keep a bunch of items around in your backpack taking up precious space, but can never use them because that last ingredient will never be found. Still, five quarters was money well spent.","July 31, 2014","true","47.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Now with some skill under my belt, I never feel like the Random Number God puts me in an unwinnable situation except on very rare occasions. With your strategy, wits and a little bit of luck, you will pull through, and unlock safe rooms to start farther along. It's a fun system, and this game even has a story ingeniously implemented into a Roguelike; you find messages in terminals and desks, and must decrypt them. Some are random, some give much-needed recipes, and some still deliver snippets of story that lead you wondering what happened to Tamiko Hoshinara, the scientist recently vanished to the Pit, and why the twisted Suul'ka kidnapped her. It's dark, but comedic. It's challenging, but not impossible (except on the highest difficulty). Definitely a good buy, expansions recommended.\n\nWell, now that I've explored more, I can write a more in depth review. This game understands what it is to be a roguelike. It perfectly captures the fear, desperation, and loneliness of descending into a near-Lovecraftian monster's favourite toybox. Every step of the way you're worried about food, medicine, equipment, keeping armour repaired, finding food, but most importantly to what makes this game great: What that noise was. That deep throated growl followed by the stomp of a massive foot. It's the nature of the game, you never have any idea what's around the corner. There are monsters that are cannon fodder, ones that you will always shoot first to avoid the fatal diseases they carry, mechs to fill you wiith bullets, and of course, powerful, magnificent and terrifying monsters waiting around every corner that will make you their dinner if you aren't ready for them. As you descend (into perfectly created environments, with their own atmospheres might I add, every now and then there's a change of scenery that makes things more ominous- where can I get food here? What kind of enemies are there? From sleek hallways to blood splattered chambers, some of these wouldn't be out of place in a horror game), you never know what you will find next. And that's whats perfect about it. Mystery. Exploration. Atmosphere. It almost feels like you're there, if you can really get into a session. Kerberos? I cannot find another game that does this so well. Thank you so much. Final verdict: Buy it. Buy it now. It only gets better the more time you put into it, I have given it many hours and I suspect it shall have many more. Also get DLCs! They improve the variety many times over. I hope you find my enhanced review helpful.\n\nExpansion number three! The game has just undergone a massive overhaul and acquired a new DLC. HURRAH! Just a few comments here. I was noticing, I am encountering much more varied and surprising things much earlier along. Just by some different RNG, this game is now more than twice what it was before, every step you have to think- even early on, which was once merely finding food for the more dangerous lower floors. Never before has it been a better buy. Also expect my Juggernaut review soon!\n\nSorry to ramble in a disorganised manner, but character DLCs are highly recommended. Many a time, I have outthought my enemies as the Shephard, clobbered them under my warhammer as the Mercenary, and now, am in the process of watching them be torn apart by zombies as the skeletal Lich. The character expansions offer new and exciting playstyles, well worth the 2$ price tag per. Kerb just keeps making good content.","May 12, 2014","true","54.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You do this by scavenging for supplies from breaking open freezers to hacking locked storage units, utilizing the available instalations (the ones working and the ones you're able to repair) like med bays, repair units and recharging stations to keep your self and your gear healthy and last but not least by using labs and cooking sations to cook food and and craft usefull gear either by trial and error or by using recipes you find by hacking into the varios computers arround the facility.\n\nBut as opposed to most other rogue-likes the thing that makes each play-through different is the knowledge of the player and not so much a change of the game itself. The game will however help keep track of things you learn from each playthrough, stats of enemies, different weapons and recipes, but it's up to the player to utilize this added information on each playthrough. I imagine you can find most of this information on the net, but part of what makes this game interesting is the discovery of this information on your own during play.\n\nThe progression within each playthrogh is done by increasing your skills and stats at each level-up but also by having your skills increase as you use them.\n\nThe difference between the 3 classes cosist mainly in the differen starting point eg. gear, stats and skills. The engineer start with a lot of utility items like different tool kits, better utility skills like lock-picking and computer skill, but with a lesser arsenal containing only a knife, a revolver and a few grenades. The Marine starts with a bigger arsenal that for instance contains an assault rifle and an auto pistol, but with lower utility skills and almost no tools. The scout is sort of a middle ground between the two but also with her own specialties. However the game doesn't limit what you can do with each class, if you want to only level the utility skills of the marine, he can pretty much end up as competent as the engineer for hacking computers and picking locks.\n\nA fair warning though, even though the game alows you to save and exit any time, it is very difficult to let go of once you're in the middle of a playthrough, so you may very easily end up spending loads of hours exploring the depths of "the pit" and all you have to show for it is a recipe for eggs and bacon and a not about how an experiment got out of control.","January 2, 2014","true","14.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls are smooth and functional. The graphics are polished. The setting is immersive, and there is loads of content available even without any of the expansions.\n\nRoguelikes often suffer from too-steep a learning curve and impenetrable interfaces. Sword of the Stars: The Pit is really the first roguelike that has sucked me in without me feeling like I needed to do a lot of work to get into it. There's a tutorial, for starters. Then you can set a difficulty level. On easy, it takes a long time for the game to start feeling difficult - plenty of time for a new player to get used to it and confident in their ability to play.\n\nThen there's the atmosphere. You're sent into this place on a mission that really matters. No macguffins hiding behind an evil wizard here. You're on a mission to save an entire colony from destruction. People's lives depend on you surviving, exploring, and finding some sort of answer to their plague. There's not even a specific goal spelled out for you. No one knows what might be in there, but there's a chance there might be some kind of salvation, if only you can find it. You're on your own, and no one has ever come out of this place. There could be anything in here.\n\nAnd the gameplay really serves to increase that feeling. As you walk through the halls and decaying rooms, you hear the sounds of the creatures behind the doors. You can't see behind you (a fact that is graphically represented clearly and understandably), and there have been plenty of times when I've heard something sneaking up behind me and whipped around to find it about to try to kill me. There is a very serious survival element to this game. Food and resources are limited. This is not a dungeon strewn with discarded weapons and armor. Your equipment breaks down, and chances to repair it are rare. Items you discover are really valuable. Food can be very scarce. And around every corner are crazed robots and strange sentient blobs that ruin your precious equipment as they try to kill you.\n\nBut there are many possibilities for survival, as well. You have a starting choice of 3 classes (in the base game), each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and equipment. Raw physical strength is necessary, but there's also a frequent need for technical expertise, without which you won't last long. Fortunately, every character has at least some chance to learn every necessary skill. When you level up, you can choose a few skills to increase, and you also get skill points for successfully carrying out certain tasks, so it pays to take chances. Just be careful, because when you fail, you might set off an alarm or even make something explode in your face.\n\nMy only complaint is the recipe system. Some recipes for cooking and crafting items can be found by deciphering computer logs found now and then in the complex, but it appears that the devs intended players to learn mostly through trial and error -- and there are far too many possibilities for that to be viable. This is the one thing I needed a wiki for, and it seems silly, really. The game is difficult enough without making us destroy ingredient after ingredient trying to figure out what all that stuff is for. Fortunately, it's all been figured out by other players by now, so a wiki will solve the problem.\n\nAside from that one point, this is really a superbly crafted game, and I highly recommend it to everyone.","May 24, 2014","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is set in the Sword of the Stars sci-fi setting, there are aliens and it is set on a far away world. You have skills and equipment and there is a crafting and levelling system.

Wide variety of weapons, locks, armor, and plenty of recipes for crafting makes for a different game as you play through. Unfortunately, hunger, disease, poison, and other nasty effects await you as well (but there are counter-agents you can find or synthesize, if you find the right places and ingredients). Graphics are low-tech but that's part of the "oldskool" charm. No two game will be like, with 3 separate starting types. (Optional DLC adds 10 more levels and 2 more starting types).

The graphics are good enough for what they're supposed to do and the gameplay is easy enough to understand even without playing the tutorial. Assuming of course you have played a Roguelike of some description before. The biggest flaw upon the games release was the lack of content, so to speak, as only three classes were available to play as. For this reason I recommend getting the Gold Edition from the get go as it ups the number of available classes to ten. It also adds the gameplay element of psionics, which is the magic-version of this game.\nWhat however is probably the biggest critique I have for this game is the absurd ability of the RNG to absolutely shaft you. I had a perfectly good run once with plenty of ammo and weapons, but no food drops whatsoever, which doomed my run to end with starvation, which was actually pretty sad to watch given how it's not instant, but procedual death as your character becomes weaker until suffering the so called Stat-death or simply being overwhelmed by enemies because of the ton of debuffs that gets heaped onto you.\nNonetheless, if you're into Roguelikes and you want one settled in a Sci-Fi setting then I can wholeheartedly recommend this game.","November 30, 2013","true","46.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Pit brings a refreshing change to the saga as it introduces the world of SotS to players in the form of a dungeon crawler/roguelike. And what a way to enter the genre it is.\n\nI suppose the first thing to get out of the way is to mention that this game is hard. REALLY HARD. If you aren't a fan of dying over and over again in order to gain progress on your future runs, I suggest you to turn away and leave this game be. Don't let even the large variety of difficulty levels to fool you. Where as most games should never be played on any difficulty below Hard to experience the game how it should be, SotS:The Pit offers you a challenge harder than any I've experienced before when it comes to games and their normal difficulties. And of course in the spirit of roguelikes, every death is permanent. Every death is one step further in the line of progress.\n\nThe term roguelike might come off as the meaning of unfair to people who are familiar with it and SotS is no exception. It in fact takes the unfairness to a whole new level. The harder difficulties in this game are just brutal and they often don't even offer a realistic chance of it being teh urn. The whole grinding aspect will teach you to conserve ammo, items and just generally survive the life in The Pit better so you would have a higher chance of completing the game on your next venture.\n\nYou start off the game by choosing from a variety of different classes to play and truth be told, this is probably the biggest flaw of the game. Some classes simply cannot complete the game on harder difficulties unless you get extremely lucky. You should probably be using that amount of luck on winning the lottery though since that's an appropriate depiction of the luck needed. Once you have figured out the viable classes and the ones you love playing after several hours of dying, let the fun begin. Don't get me wrong, you can get most classes to work on most difficulty levels, but it's not really worth the effort.\n\nThe item variety in this game is really wide and the game even features a large number of crafted items. The crafting system is really enjoyable for only those who are really dedicated, hardcore gamers as the only way to discover recipes is to have high enough skill to access the computers you find in the dungeons. You are honestly just better off googling the recipes so you have even the slightest of clues about what half of the items you will find on your runs are good for. In the war that this game features, you will most definitely learn to conserve your ammo as it's very limited and you need to save every single bullet possible. Conserving ammo often means needing to learn which enemies can open doors and which don't and proceeding to trap those unable to do so in meaningless rooms.\n\nAll in all, I suggest this game for pretty much anyone looking for a good gaming experience and not getting butthurt over the game being cruel. Once you get into the flow this game will suck you in and you will keep coming back to it time after time. There's a fine line between the game being good and the player being masochistic. I endured it. Now it's up to you to figure out whether the game enthralls you or absolutely disgusts you, simply because the game is just that damn good if you happen to fall in love with it. At the current set price it's definitely worth finding out as this game will definitely offer you a superb bang for buck value.","February 27, 2014","true","108.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although i suggest picking up the DLC Mindgames aswell, since its make the game even more accessible, even to players who are new to the genre.\n\nThe visual style of the game has a hand-drawn retro cartoony feel to it, which i like and attracted me in the first place to this game. The interface and combat may take a few minutes to figure out but after that it is smooth sailing. Its by no means the best rogue-like u'll ever play, but fun nonetheless and hard to put down.\n","December 23, 2013","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wide variety of weapons, locks, armor, and plenty of recipes for crafting makes for a different game as you play through. Unfortunately, hunger, disease, poison, and other nasty effects await you as well (but there are counter-agents you can find or synthesize, if you find the right places and ingredients). Graphics are low-tech but that's part of the "oldskool" charm. No two game will be like, with 3 separate starting types. (Optional DLC adds 10 more levels and 2 more starting types).

The point of the game is to get to the bottom of the 50 level dungeon (i think its 50, and im pretty sure it's 100 with the dlc). when you start you can choose from 3 different classes (5 with the dlc) each with different specialties and items they start out with. for each level you pass the game gets increasingly harder and new items and enemies appear. The game is turn-based because you get a turn where you can move a certain number of spaces, use items, open lootables and attack, and then the enemies get a turn. Although the turns go by so fast because you can only go 2 spaces each turn (with the marine), use items, or attack once, so you'll barely even notice its turn-based. personally its one of my favorite games of all time. everybody should play this.

The rouge-like dungeon crawling RPG provides a rewarding experience for novice and hard core players alike. The game offers a casual lvling system that probably will not appeal to players looking for an in depth character customization experience, but in turn offers a pick up and go go go experience. The action in the game flows fluidly and isn't hindered by lengthy and boring story lines. If your looking for a game with a great narrative you need not apply to this game or you will be disappointed. However if you are looking for a game that cuts all the BS out and delves into action, treasure, strategy, and crafting then this is the game for you.\n\nI personally love this game. I've been gaming for 24 years now, and i've played virtually everything. Most games haven't held my attention very long recently, but i logged 6 hours on my first session of this game. I've been wanting to play a game that cuts all the tired and boring stories out of the game for straight up action. This game delivers that. I can hop on this game and play for 10 minutes or 3 hours there will always be something fun to do.","March 30, 2013","true","107.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This carries across playthroughs in the form of an ingame database, another plus.\n+ What of it isn't flawed in design is well-polished.\n+ In terms of both metagame and individual playthroughs, the length of the game is pretty good.\n\n~ Decent graphics.\n~ Decent SFX.\n~ Acceptable controls, messy in areas.\n~ The vast majority of the items are highly situational, and because there are so many, any given resource is fairly scarce. Not all bad, since it usually just forces adaptive strategies.\n\n- Many categories of events are TOO random, the game's biggest flaw. This is most pronounced in poison, disease(both of which can randomly be fought off or worsen, but you cannot influence this in any way except direct usage of a health kit[which are uncommon]) and finding weapons(which eventually break, leaving you with absolutely no way to defend yourself).\n- Questionable balance between classes.\n- Levelups fully heal you and don't necessary need to be applied the moment your XP bar caps, providing a ready source of instant, full healing. Maybe it's an intended feature, but that doesn't make it any better.\n\nValue: $6.50","June 29, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're used to Roguelikes where everything must die you will end up running out of stuff and dying yourself. Fundamentally, it's about attrition. Weapons break, ammo is scarce, food is a real limiting factor. It's a constant, tense balance between forging forward at less than full strength and risking starvation, a balance between killing stuff for the XP and draining your ability to kill things. There's a shift that begins about halfway down; you go from gaining stuff to maintaining and then losing it as the enemies take more shots to kill relative to available ammo.\n\nThis means you're making choices all the time instead of whacking popcorn absentmindedly until you mistakenly whack a unique and die because you weren't paying attention.\n\nThere are two major problems:\n1. The crafting is vital but also highly annoying since recipies are hidden from you. It's kind of fun at first but eventually I just started wikiing it.\n2. The blue room mechanism veritably invites cheesing the game by starting characters, dumping their gear at level five, and starting over. It's tough not to do but removes a lot of what makes the game great. At the very least there should be some achievements for winning without using the blue room.\n\nDespite the above this is one of my favorite roguelikes ever.","April 5","true","471.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being a roguelike you should already know that the combat will frequently threaten to kill you. Call me a masochist but that's enjoyable to me. I'm usually not a fan of gear durability in games but here it adds another layer of threat that requires you to strategically consider how you use the tools at your disposal. You'll also find some comical bits throughout the game.\n\nI'm having a hard time deciding whether I agree with the inclusion of barely more than the minimum story needed to set the stage. On the one hand it puts more focus on the strengths of the game and differentiates it from other turn based RPGs like Fallout. On the other hand it made for an experience that began to feel monotonous as I got to the deeper floors and an ending that had no heart to it. Even adding a small insertion of story every 5 floors could have broken up the monotony without getting in the way.\n\nIn playing the game I believe I accidentally stumbled on a good order to go about playing this game. First I tried each of the 3 classes on Normal difficulty (and died on floor 8, then 6 and then 9). Then I picked the class I enjoyed the most (Marine) and started again on Easy. Doing it this way I was able to try out each class without getting too invested before settling in for the long journey downward.\n\nI'll close with a few tips that I wish I had discovered earlier. First, you can craft more than one of a recipe at a time. That's especially useful for food and conserving your limited uses of each cooker you find. Second, you can turn your character without consuming a move point by holding Ctrl + [the key for direction you want to face]. Finally, moving one square and then attacking during each turn is an effective way to either keep your distance or close in for melee combat.","February 18, 2014","true","19.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I had to keep a mental list of "this monster is scary enough to donate some bullets to it's face" and that was it. No positioning, no abilities, few combat consumables.\n-The game felt like a total grind. Every door can be picked for exp, every crate jimmied open, every station hacked. There are a large number of such objects.\n-Character customization felt... lacking. You can put points into various skills on level up, but I did not notice a significant impact, particularly for combat skills. It seems equipment is far more important for what form your character takes, and as that is pretty much totally random, it can hardly be called customization.\n-The crafting is awful. Even Morrowind stored past recipes for you. SotS? Better keep a notebook of what strange combinations of bindings, cloth, and animal detritus obtain you useful equipment.  Sure, you can find hints to recipes in-game, but cross-referencing the ingredients listed in hints. (Note that crafting or absurd luck seems to be necessary to get decent equipment)\n-Hoarding ingredients for crafting is awful. You can't craft just anywhere, you need to find a specific bench to craft each variety of item. You can either horde every ingredient (bad idea, inventory space is valuable) or track what ingredients are needed to make the thing you want.\n\nI'm sure it's possible to derive enjoyment from this game, but to me it felt like a slog.","June 21, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The main problem comes with the limited variety of gameplay, and the methods to attempt to make the game more fun and unpredictable. This review is of the base game, without the use of any downloadable content or otherwise.\n\nThe game is always biased, giving a painful experience almost every playthrough due to such luck-based gameplay. Skill of the player is judged simply by how much one can utilise poorly thought out and tedious mechanics. The game seems to try to portray an extremely hostile environment with just enough for a competent player to survive but in reality the gameplay is almost completely based on finding overpowered items.\nThe textures and animations in the game are mediocre at best, usually including painful delays on attack animations and slowing the game down unnecessarily and forcefully without option to remove the feature.\nWhen one modifies their computer, the save data including logs and recipes is completely wiped from the game due to lack of utilising of the steam cloud and inability to find save data on the computer's memory, despite such data being automatically recognised on most other games, wasting countless hours of gameplay.\n\nTo conclude, the game is unique in it's role as a turn-based rogue-like, but lacks any decent amount of strategy for serious gaming, and since most fun is taken from collecting new logs and equipment, it is hopeless to think many who would enjoy the casual uncontrollability would enjoy the slow-paced, turn-based gameplay for a prolonged time unless they enjoyed obtaining collectables.","July 2, 2015","false","70.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogrep/recommended/233700/","ogrep","Vino [Olive Garden]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogrep/","985 products in account","Swords of the Stars: The Pit is a bad game. Don't buy it. If you're a roguelike veteran, you're going to be bored out of your skull, and if you're a newbie, there's a cheaper, deeper, and more flavorful option in Dungeons of Dredmor. Here are more reasons not to buy this bad game:\n1. It's slow.\n--This is the number-one killer for me. Each turn, each attack, each use of an item, takes between one and four seconds, depending on how many animations have to play (for attacking, getting attacked) and how many things are moving (you and all monsters). For those of you who aren't familiar with classic-style roguelikes like Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, this might not sound like a big deal, but trust me, when you have to spend 3 minutes walking across a level you've already cleared, or a minute on a fight against a horde of small, easy to kill monsters, you will begin to get bored very quickly.\n2. It has bad mechanics that aren't properly balanced.\n-- Your weapons disintegrate over time and with use, which in theory could be an okay mechanic, assuming this is balanced with reliable ways to repair your weapons or a steady influx of new weapons to replace your broken ones. Failing that, your base attack with no weapon should be a viable last-resort option that gives you some hope of staying alive until you find a new weapon. SotS:TP takes none of these options. Weapons are very rare to find, as are repair stations, and your base attack does almost no damage (and does not scale with level, melee weapon skill, OR strength!). Around level 15-25 you will find that you are entirely out of weapons, and that you have just wasted the past 4 hours of your life, and that you want to kill yourself for having bought this bad, bad, game.\n3. The crafting/item system is horribly flawed.\nThis game has the ability to craft about 60 different items. Discovering these crafting recipes organically is right out, because the game destroys your items on a failed attempt, some of the ingredients are very rare, and you have to combine between 1 and 5 of these 30 different items to make a new item. There's absolutely no indication of what will work, and what won't. Do the math and you'll find there are literally tens of thousands of ways to combine these items. There is a way to slowly uncover a few recipes in-game, which is a nice touch, but personally I went to the wiki after 5 hours of play netted me about half of one recipe.\nThat's only part of the problem with the crafting. A much bigger issue is that there are only one to two uses for each craftable item. Your inventory is going to start filling up with dozens of useless items very quickly, and if you don't go to the wiki and spoil everything, you won't know what to keep and what not to. It's really shoddy design.\n4. It is Dungeons of Dredmor, but worse in every way.\n--Don't get me wrong, I don't like DoD either (many of the complaints I've levied here could easily be applied to it as well). But The Pit feels like a giant step backwards in every way. No spells or activate-able skills, all passives. Only three classes (five if you get the DLC). Way fewer monsters, rooms, traps, weapons, and everything else that makes roguelikes so fun and replayable. The writing is worse, too. The Pit brings literally nothing to the table.\n5. Combat is boring and choices are non-existent.\nThis is inexcusable in a roguelike, because combat and choices are pretty much all the genre has going for it. In The Pit, all of your skills are passives, all of your combat is melee and ranged attacks. There is nothing to this game except for moving towards/away from enemies and attacking them. It is unbelievably boring.\nIn conclusion, I would not play this game again if I were paid to do so. I hope the developers read this and put some serious thought into their next game. I would say that there's potential here, but the best The Pit could hope for is to be as good as a game that's already out there and already has a decent following, as well as several expansions and a modding community.","July 20, 2013","false","5.0"," 51 of 104 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","51","104","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kektimus/recommended/233700/","Kektimus","Kektimus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kektimus/","283 products in account","A roguelike should be difficult, IMHO, but not impossible. You can do great and conserve ammo and health and fail because the game decides you're never going to get more ammo, health or to destroy all the machines you try to repair/use.\nThe game looked great at first glance, but after hours of playing it never felt I was rewarded for being good or punished for doing bad decisions,	 it just felt random. And the thing is, because of this imbalance, you won't know that the game has decided to starve you (leading to your inevitable demise) until it simply does which can be in many levels and there will be nothing you can do about it.\n\nTo clarify I'm not saying the game's impossible. What I'm saying is that it can be, from the very start, and you can't do anything about it and it might take an hour or two of playing before you realize this. A game whose best outcome is pre-decided entirely by chance, and can possibly be "failure regardless of the skill and experience of the player", is not a game. At least not by any modern standards. It's flipping a coin and "winning" on heads. Saying that the road up to the inevitable defeat is "the game" is like saying lifting weights is "the game part" of flipping a coin.\n\nSo you got skills in that particular weapon and you've actually had the luck of finding that sort of weapon? Sucks to be you then, because you're not getting any ammo for it. Trying to make due with that melee weapon of yours? Well, it'll break soon and we will never give you any replacement because random. Out of weapons? Look, a repair machine. It blew up because random. Having fun yet?\n\nNo. Stay away.\n\n\n\nThis review was originally written for GOG. Removing comments referring to my Steam playtime and other ad hominem fallacies since it's irrelevant and misleading. Same goes for direct impoliteness, of course. Also, I'm reviewing this from the perspective of determining if it's an enjoyable game or not (...or a game at all).","December 21, 2013","false","2.9"," 86 of 175 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","86","175","0","34"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033602078/recommended/233700/","76561198033602078","Citronvand","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033602078/","394 products in account","I believe everyone know that this is a roguelike. Roguelikes have a big emphasis on being random (floors, enemies, loot e.t.c.), being hard and having permadeath (can't load once you die). You shouldn't be discouraged from playing a roguelike because you die a lot and have to start over. It is part of the fun experience since every run is unique. Thus this game has something to live up to since it is a roguelike. So here's what I don't like about this game:\n\n1. Gameplay. Since it is expected to die over and over it is important that every run feels unique and fun. While the game has random floors and loot you only have 3 different classes and all of them are humans. In the expansion 2 more are added and one of them is an alien, the tarka ranger. But the game doesn't differentiate between races and classes so you can't be a human ranger or a tarka engineer. Race and class is all in one package. Now compare these 5 different "starting kits" with what other roguelikes offer. DCSS (Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup) has for example 24 races and 27 classes. That means there are 648 different "starting kits". So unless you have played that game for very long you can always try something new when you die. And it's not just starting skills and equipment that are different, most races in DCSS have something unique to add. Such as if you are playing as a Mummy you don't need to eat food, if you are a djinni you don't have health and mana, you have essence which is both your health and your mana. If you're a Troll you can't wear most armor since it's too small for you but your health regenerate very fast. This game doesn't have that.\n\nAnd it's not something unique to DCSS either, most roguelikes has several races and classes. ADOM (Ancient domains of mystery) has 12 races and 22 classes. Dungeons of Dredmor doesn't have races or classes but instead something they call "skills". There are 53 of them and you pick 7 of them for a character. So you could take for example Swords, Blood Magic, Vampirism, Assassination e.t.c.\n\nSomething else I find lacking in this game is the loot. The game uses a crafting mechanic which means you find ingredients and you craft something with it. The problem is that unless you play the game for a long time and find the recipes you can't use the ingredients. You could check the wiki but that will ruin the whole "find recipes as you play" experience and will make classes such as the engineer less useful since he's good at finding recipes. So since most of the loot you will find are ingredients and you don't know the recipes it means that the majority of the loot you find will be useless. Items such as armor and weapons are very rare, for instance in 6 hours I have found 1 armor. The game doesn't have the typical unidentified scrolls, potions and wands you can find either. Now I'm not saying that a sci-fi game should have magical potions, it could be for instance nanomachines (Hideo Kojima forced me) instead of a magical potion.\n\nSo I would say that the loot is very unsatisfying.\n\nThe next point I would like to make is that the gameplay is slow. Specifically because you always have to do some check and wait whenever you manipulate something. The classic example is a locked door, and there's a lot of them. You lockpick it, but you have to wait about 2 seconds. This is because it takes a few turns to open it so enemies could come and attack you. The general idea is good, that enemies could come but since you have to wait in real life for every single thing you manipulate (opening fridges, lockers, doors, repairing stuff, hacking computers, reloading e.t.c.) it slows the game down quite a bit. And all the loot you find will be in something you have to manipulate. Except enemy drops. Even resting takes a long time to do. You are already paying for it with food, why do you, the player, have to wait a minute or 2?\n\n\n2. HUD/Graphics. First of all, I very much enjoy the graphics. Most roguelikes don't have graphics and those who do have sub-par graphics. So it's not that which is the problem. One thing I don't like is that you cannot see your health, mana and food in numbers. You have to hold your mouse over the bar and wait for a tooltip to show you exactly how much health you have. You could also open the character screen. Either way it is annoying. The info on food for instance tells you how much food it will give in numbers. To make that information useful you have to know your characters food value in numbers. A lack of mini-map is also something I don't like. There is a map that is called a mini-map in-game but there is nothing mini about it since it covers the whole screen. This leads me to my next point which is the zoom system. The game has 3 different zooms, the problem with using any zoom other than the largest is that the graphics will suffer. Things such as door icons will look blurry and you will lose the sharp graphics which the largest zoom has. So naturally you want to play with the largest zoom, obviously this is a problem since now you cannot see all the enemies, for example they can shoot you off-screen. Navigating will also be a problem since you can only see a small portion of the floor you're on and the game doesn't have a mini-map. So you have to constantly zoom in and out and check your map. Which just adds to the already slow gameplay.\n\n\n3. The locker. The locker was added in the expansion pack and it is a locker which you find every 5 floors. You can dump items in the locker but you cannot remove them. There is also a "xp locker" where you can dump xp instead of items. The only way to access these are to start a new game and select whatever floor you dumped the xp/items at. Then you will begin at that floor and you have access to the items and the xp with your new character.\n\nThis is very much against the spirit of roguelikes. Not only can you skip part of the game but it removes the whole "make due with what you find" experience which roguelikes are known for. It also promotes grinding since the best way to tackle the game would be to make several characters, dump their xp and items in the locker and then make the real run with all the xp and items. What happened to every run is a unique and fun experience? How many runs do you have to intentionally ruin to make your real run? And your real run is a joke since you don't start at the beginning and you have all these items to start with. If you die on that run you have to start your grind all over again. I asked the devs why they implemented this in the first place and their reply was:\n\n"They were implemented to innovate and give people options. SF is about evolution of the form ;)\n\nAnd I am sorry about your likes or dislikes but a rogue that introduces valid meta gameplay elements is, in my opinion, worth a dozen rogues with minor gimmicks. It's kinda what we do around here citron...we take chances and we innovate. Hopefully that will grow n you over time ;)"\n\nI'm all for innovating and especially devs that talk to their community but I don't see how a feature that promotes grinding and removes a aspect of the genre is something good or fun. Surely there were some thought behind this feature? If I were to implement a thing I would first think why I do it and then if it would make the game or whatever I'm working on better. Not "It's innovative". It's not just a optional thing either, you are artificially raising the difficulty of a already hard game if you're not using it. Saying it's optional is just a cop out. You could say that anything with a problem is a optional feature. If psionics could kill all the enemies in the game just like that I could say it's not a problem since it's optional to use it.\n\nTo sum it all up: I find the game has slow gameplay, unsatisfying loot, lack of unique starting choices, questionable hud design and it promotes grinding. That's why I won't recommend this game.","December 21, 2013","false","6.6"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","28","58","0","1"

There is a story to the game (which you collect in bits and pieces) and there are several starting characters to choose from.  You can take as long as you like to plan out your moves, because enemies only act when you take action.  For me, the degree of randomness was just too high.  In games like FTL, you at least always have a chance (unless you limp along to the final boss with no real weapons or extra systems).  That doesn't seem to be the case here.  The game is also long enough that doomed runs just seem to carry on and wind down slowly.\n\nGet Dungeon of the Endless instead.","January 17","false","4.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/okram/recommended/233700/","okram","okram2k","http://steamcommunity.com/id/okram/","289 products in account","I spotted Sword of the Stars: The Pit listed as a flash sale on Steam for 75% off of the normal price of $9.99 for a low down price of $2.49. Curse you Valve and your ridiculous summer sales! You managed to suck quite a few bucks out of my debit card on games I may or may not ever get around to and Sword of the Stars seemed to be one of them. Intrigued on trying a top down turn based RPG rogue game this time I decided to try out The Pit and see what is up.\n\nThe plot of The Pit, as simple as it is, is pretty straightforward. The Zombie Apocalypse or something close to it is occurring on some remote planet and some magical mcguffin that could end it all might be in some place referred to as unoriginality as… The Pit. So you start up a game as a Marine, Engineer, or Scout (actually a pilot, but we called her the scout class anyway!). Ready. Set. Procedurally generated dungeon crawl!\n\nAnd off I went with a Marine, hacking and shooting my way through a seemingly unending supply of rodents and bats. Then a few robots, a couple aliens, all the while watching my health and food bars slowly drain away. And then refill them up with heal kits or rations I brought along then watch them drain away again. Then fill up health from leveling up then watch it drain away again. And then finally, I died. It wasn’t some great last stand or some frightful fleeing for my life, just eventually ran out of health and died. Ho Hum.\n\nAnd then I went again with an engineer. There’s lots of… things scattered randomly around in the rooms and they can be opened with different skills. The engineer is the best at this but he is horribly outgunned and unless you get lucky with one of these loot drops eventually he’s going to die soon to. And then I tried the scout expecting a more sneaky fast person who can run past everything. Nope. The scout is just like the Marine except she’s better at using crappier weapons. *sigh* Speaking of weapons the promo page on Steam boats of “Over 50 weapons and armors with a variety of special effects including flamethrowers, rocket launchers, plasma cannons and powered Brawler armor!” but all I found in my play-throughs were a dinky sword, a piece of ‘stealth’ armor, and a rifle. Meh. I’m sure there’s better stuff way deep down but I never made it and started getting bored quickly.\n\nAnd I started to try to figure exactly why this game is so hum drum boring. At first glance there appears to be some very some good ideas. A complex and important skill system. Lots of loot, a variety of different looking enemies, a randomly generated experience each time you go. But each level looks depressingly bland, the enemies all act boringly stupid, and I was yet to find any awesome loot to scratch at that progressing itch. Outside of having slightly higher chance of succeeding at unlocking things and getting a free heal, leveling up feels downright pointless. I didn’t feel exceptionally stronger at level 5 as I did at level 1. Worse is I felt an incessant need to scour each level and attempt to open every box, fix every console, and unlock every door in hopes of collecting every precious drop of exp I could get my hands on. All in a false hope it would make me strong enough to press on but instead it just wasted my time. There even appears to be a complicated intricate crafting system but I could only scratch the surface of it while trying in vain to get deeper into THE PIT.\n\nAfter seeing a rogue-like game done so well, The Pit feels uninspired. Each time you go into a level you pretty much stand in one spot fighting enemies, waiting for them all to rush at you one at a time. Walk around the level clearing up what’s left and then go deeper. If you are unlucky you’ll run into a high level mob earlier than you should and get crippled. Or worse, you’ll run into a trap and want to rage quit. I wouldn’t exactly call the game unforgivingly difficult, more of just cheaply difficult. Open up a door and stand face to face with a giant machine gun toting mech that fills you with bullets, or worse, the only way to progress is to pass through a door trap. Unlike floor traps which you have a chance of detecting and deactivating, I found no way to deactivate door traps. The most sadistic of all destroys a random item from your inventory. And if it decides to destroy one of your weapons or your ammo, well you might as well just quit now and start anew.\n\nIn stills the graphics look decent for the sprite style often common of indie games but in action it feels incredibly blocky. It feels exactly like what it is, token pieces moving around a large square grid system. And for turn based combat it is an incredibly uninspired repetition of: point, click, kill. Target an enemy, shoot ‘em with a gun or hack at them with a melee weapon. Or after you’ve gotten really deep and your melee weapon was destroyed and you’re out of ammo, hit them with your fists until they kill you. I especially hate the limitations placed on combat with only 2 moves and performing a combat action ends your turn. The game could have really taken a page from other turn based RPGs with a more intricate action point system that actually felt like I was doing more than just standing in one place and clicking. There also are no stances, cover to hide behind, you cannot move after attacking, jump, sprint, anything. The light scout has no real speed bonus nor does the heavy marine have any speed penalty. Its just simple and dull and really needs a lot of work.\n\nIn the end, even though the game cost me less than what I’d spend for lunch, I wouldn’t recommend it. There is a lot of potential here for a nice intricate game but the combat system is just so bloody boring and uninspired.\nFinal Score:\nGraphics: 4/10\nGame Play: 2/10\nMusic / Ambiance: 3/10\nStory: 4/10\nValue: 8/10\nOverall: 4.2/10\n\nRead more indy game reviews on my blog!\nhttp://markofithian.com","November 26, 2013","false","2.9"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","3"

The joke enemy "easter bunny" attacks eight(8!) times every turn, but barely damages. The devs know you're just wasting time.\nThe combat is simply you and the enemy alternating fire until the other dies. You can't ever flee, everything wants to kill you, and everything is able to find you. There are no choices to be made in combat.\nEVERYTHING is random, from the map generation and enemies to every container you open to the amount of times you can use a stove before it explodes.\nHealing is instant even during combat but mines take five turns to arm. Mines already set when entering the level don't explode on enemies, so you're not even safe walking a path an enemy just did.\nCrafting destroys items used, even when experimenting for a recipe.

The gameplay experience is bogged down by simple turn to turn game-play that should be (in my own opinion) part of a board game not because of the dynamic but because of the mediocre control.

Is it a good roguelike? Well, that's where opinions differ.\n\nIt seems to be missing that key roguelike experience that the community values. But what is it? It has hunger, a scarsity based ammo system, spell trees, randomized numbers and chances, and different classes. What's missing?\n\nFun. That's the statement of this review. SotS: The Pit is missing fun.\n\nRoguelikes have always been a unique genre in which its fun to win OR lose. And losing in The Pit is not in the least fun. You either have enough ammo, or you don't. You have food to explore, or you don't. That computers skill roll works, or it doesn't.    There's no "mushroom" in this game of rock, paper, scissors. No surprise element to keep the early game from feeling like a grind; no hilarity to make bad runs enjoyable or memorable.\n\nThe Pit ends up being too binary. New roguelike players might not understand this, but The Pit definitely suffers from the poor design choice of bad or good. No middle. There's no crazy builds, no adaptation. You place your stats in nearly the same things, find your first weapon, and go from there. Experimentation is reserved for easy mode or not at all.\n\nIf you enjoy challenges, you'll enjoy this game. If you enjoy games, you won't enjoy SotS: The Pit. Even if you are the first of the two, you may find your frustration venting out at the developers for clearly not knowing how to balance roguelikes.","February 12, 2014","false","53.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Here it goes: Plague starts on some planet, dude/chick (you) goes to mysterious alien mountain base full of dangers in hope to find a cure. Messages can be found at terminals which contain some more lore, story elements and crafting recipes, but only if your character can decipher them.\nYou can pick between 3 classes (Marine, Engineer, Scout) that come with different stats and equipment and play reasonably different. More classes are added in DLC (up to 10 in total).\nSo what do you do exactly? Well, you fight your way through many (30 I think) randomly generated floors full of increasingly difficult enemies, while trying to find better equipment and prevent starvation. To help you with that, the game comes with a wide variety of guns, armor and tools as well as recipes for food and more guns/armor. In order to get those you must pick locks on containers, hack terminals and, when you're desperate, rummage through recycling bins. To increase your odds of successfully fishing a piece of yummy bacon out of a rotting garbage pile or hitting an enemy, you gain XP and spend points on several skills like "Foraging" and "Assault Rifles". Combat is (semi-)turn-based: If no enemy is near you can move freely but once spotted, it goes turn-based and you can only move a few tiles or attack each turn.\nSotS is not a short game - Although it's perfectly fine to play for 30 minutes and clear 1-2 floors every now and then, getting to the bottom floor of the alien base will suck a lot of time out of your life, even more so on higher difficulty settings when you dying will become a regular event. The difficulty curve is quite steep - on my first easy playthrough I pretty much breezed through the levels, but now I'm already struggling to make it past the 10th floor on normal. There are many different enemies with different abilities and strengths and an important part of survival is knowing how to counter them (and keeping cures ready for all the negative status effects they can inflict).\nSoundtrack and effects aren't that good, but like the story it's not something I care too much about in these games.\nI don't see anything wrong with the controls - simple but effective. The only thing that keeps bugging me is the limited inventory space. With all the guns, food, ammo, crafting materials, etc. your inventory is constantly full. But I guess the hard decision between keeping a potentially life-saving food item or an equally important Medkit is part of the fun.\n\nI enjoyed it a lot and will keep playing. It's fun to tune in for 30 minutes to clear some floors and find loot. If you played a lot of roguelikes, SotS might not offer you anything you haven't seen before, but it's still a very solid game. If you're new to the genre, it's a good albeit difficult start.\n\nAbout the DLC - As mentioned before they add new classes but also new equipment (+recipes), enemies, messages, status effects, etc. Mindgames is the biggest one, adding all that plus new skills (Psionics), extra floors and new rooms. More than what you would expect for DLC and worth getting. Gold Edition DLC has less content (mostly equipment and new classes) but is also cheaper. Nice addition, though not a must-have. Can't say anything about The Pilgrim DLC since I don't own that one.","July 20, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Luck is a factor, but not so much that the game can screw you over in one move. Playing as the marine on easy, the combat was very forgiving, but I still had to be careful when low on ammo or when my weapons were badly damaged. Normal is actually very brutal and I haven't even got halfway yet. There are two higher difficulties for crazy people :) Combat is turn based and there is alot of weapon and enemy variety, which adds up to good tactical depth. Non combat skills and equipment can help in interesting ways. Graphics and sound are okay, but unfortunately the story is hidden in encrypted data files that I didn't have the skills to read. I didn't notice any bugs. A full playthrough should take around 8 hours so you get good value for money at full price.","June 15, 2013","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Animations could have been more varied. The game is in 2D from a top-down perspective. You know if you like this style.\n\nSounds: Again, sounds are on the simple side. Nothing was done bad, but there is simply nothing really to hear. You won't miss anything if the sound is off.\n\nGameplay: The game is addictive. It's easy to get into the routine (one more floor, one more ingridient, one more recepe). There is decent amount of variety in the game. However, at later levels and numerous playthroughs, you may wish for more variety in all aspects (level design, bestiary, recepies and inventory).\n\nVerdict: Get it.

And of course, it won't be.\n\nEven after a successful playthrough (finally!), I'm still finding myself spending hours painstakingly hacking my way through the levels all over again, this time on the next difficulty level, or with a different play-style.  Character classes that seem strangley overpowered at the start suddenly reveal their fatal flaws at inopportune times.  I found out the hard way the sudden vulnerability of a Liir without its moisture suit, which seemed so strong at the beginning, crashing through room after room of monsters, armed to the gills and backed with powerful psionics.  The Pit makes you feel strong and humble in the same breath.  To round out the whole experience, the game boasts a polished but simple old-school visual style, a deeply creative world (with enough backstory to make you curious about more, but not to much as to bog you down in reading), and just enough loot, crafting, and randomization to make opening every locked crate a genuinely exciting experience.","January 24, 2014","true","277.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The enemy designs have a lot of character. The player sprites get a little boring to look at after a while so more variations would have been nice.\n\nEven without the DLC there is a lot of replayability to this game.

There is a demo available, you should probably check it out if you are interested in this game. Also, for a more intricate look into skills/stats/characters, feel free to visit a community wikia at http://sword-of-the-stars-the-pit.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Content\n\nTD;DR #1: My opinion of this game - Amazing, even if with a few pretty major problems;\n\nTL;DR #2: Short summary of impressions (Good points, Debatable poins, Negative points):\nGood points:\n+ Randomly generated - alot of replayability and variety in your gameplay, each game will be different; You will get your money's worth, if you like these sort of games;\n+ Many character classes (as of Gold Edition - 8 + 1 secret character) - different strengths/weaknesses which must be accounted for;\n+ Simple and functional graphics - this will run on a potato;\n+ (personal) Gameplay - I enjoy these types of games and this is one of the few games that really nails it, think NetHack and you will probably understand what kind of game this is, minus the item interaction hilarity that NetHack had;\n+ Bloody hard as nails;\n\nDebatable points (these are as subjective as they can be):\n+/- Relatively simplistic gameplay - I like the simplicity, but there's really not alot of nuance to it. Although many advocate that your skill (decision making) is more important, I do not believe it is so, as not finding any equipment by about mid-game is NOT salvagable by your skill;\n+/- Randomly generated levels can dictate how easy/hard your game is going to be;\n+/- Some characters are easier to play with - Some characters start out with psionic powers (Psion(Mindgames)/Seeker(Gold Edition)). This allows them to be less dependant on luck and more dependant on skill due to having all the tools necessary (Psionic powers in this case), which allows them to be less dependant on equipment for starting levels;\n\nNegative points:\n- Each run will require alot of time to play - clearing even 10 floors can easily take about 2 hours for me (as I have a tendency of trying to clear the whole floor) and as you go deeper, each  level requires more time, due to stronger enemies, unless you are fortunate with your gear;\n- This game features unlockable recipes (crafting), which you get from Consoles. Unlocking all recipes (or some potent ones) will require alot of time "grinding". This game does not require crafting to win, but some recipes are nearly essential for survival (Aggressive Antibiotics, for example. Without this, you are very often going to die on your run);\n- Bloody hard as nails, damn it!\n\n\nA short review of the content:\nSword of the Stars: The Pit is a roguelike game, where the levels are randomly generated (rooms/loot/enemies), but to some extent (i.e. you will see harder enemies/better loot the deeper you go). There are multiple characters which you can play as. During the game, you gain levels for your character upon gaining enough experience points. Each character starts with different strengths/weaknesses and different statistic and skill point gains.\n\nThere are 5 difficulty settings, with the most notable is 'Easy', because it is not, and also, you can only unlock first 50 messages (Messages #1-50), which do contain very good recipes, but will limit the recipe unlockability. Anything above 'Easy' will allow un unlock all messages.\n\nAt the most basic level, the combat is very simplistic, all you can really do is choose your weapon (good luck with having any!), aim at a target and shoot, hoping the dice rolls go in your favor, although Psionic Powers (Mindgames and Gold Edition only) add additional threats (now there are monsters that use psionic powers) and elements in combat (you can use psionic powers as well).\n\nThe resources are extremely scarce at the beginning (because you don't find weapon lockers too often on early levels). And the deeper you go, the more you have to try to avoid combat, since enemies get alot stronger and there is more of them. This game can be really harsh on the dice rolls and on more than one occasion, I actually didn't believe the silliness of the dice rolls I got. Also, items (armour/weapons) have durability, which can decrease on successful use, depending on your skill.\n\nThis game features crafting. Now, this is one of the biggest problems I have with the game - to create something, you require a recipe telling you what you need to create this something (you do not need to unlock the recipe to craft items, but, for the purpose of the exercise, I assume we do not use external resources to find out the recipes before we unlock them). Unlocking those recipes requires alot of time, as out of all the messages (I believe it it about 250+), less than half contain some recipe.\n\nThe process of unlocking is: finding a console (may requires repair - chance to fail), downloading a message (chance to fail) and decoding a message (you have a percentage chance to decode each word, rather than the whole message, which causes you needing to get the same message multiple times to get the recipe - although sometimes you can figure out the recipe from reading unfinished messages. After crafting something, you will be able to see the recipe, regardless of whether or not you had it decoded fully). Some recipes are damn near essential for living - examples of such are Aggressive Antibiotics (must have, unfortunately) and Hero Sotswitch (less must have, but still a must have).\n\nThe "grinding" of recipes, along with the general time it takes to play out a single run (I often clock at about 3-4 hours for about a 16 level run due to my tendency of clearing the whole floor) means that it will take a long time before you unlock all the recipes. And the best character to unlock these recipes (Engineer) is extremely poor in combat, which means you will die alot more often.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is amazing, even if it does have a few flaws (I am sure only a few of what other people may have found). It has amazing replayability, simple combat (which is a flaw to some degree, but I really like it), although somewhat alleviated by psionic powers (but not all characters can get them, realistically speaking). The variety of characters is beneficial to the gameplay, there are also alot of items/weapons/armour. Also, Kerberos (the developer) are a really great company, they released 2 DLC, which are actually expansions, because each adds alot of content (Mindgames - not only new items/enemies/whatnot, but an entirely new gameplay element - Psionic powers; Gold Edition - no new gameplay elements added, but, in my opinion, still totally worth it; a lot of content was added - new classes/items/etc).\n\nThis game will eat your time, which is both a blessing and a curse...\n..and trust me - there will be alot of cursing involved. Good luck!\n\nP.S. The Casual genre tag is an absolutely ludicrous claim, this game will kick you in the groin and laugh in your face, while savoring your tears of frustration. I guarantee you, you WILL rage at some point during the game, because this game is bloody hard as nails.","December 2, 2013","true","99.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, the combat and exploration get repetitive fast, the multiple characters don't have all that much distinguishing them apart from different voice actors, the dungeon is MUCH too long, and gaining access to the crafting system that makes higher difficulties less impossible requires replaying the lower difficulties again and again to harvest recipes.

For the cheep price of $6:99 USD you can get yourself hours of gameplay! The game is insanly hard but doesn't cop out on the difficulty, every time I died I knew what from and how to avoid it next play through, I was prepaired and ready to strike! There is a little bit of unlockables, such as recipes for items (Which stay with you after death, thank god!) and characters if you choose to buy a DLC, which i would recommend as it extends the games like ten fold! All and all, if you are looking for a rouge-like that stays true to the orgininal meaning of the genre, 'turn-based' action adventure, this is for you!","July 8, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Certain classes seem to rely more or less on RNG, and some runs can feel like The Binding of Isaac where unless you get the "correct gun" or "best equipment" for your build you're going have a lot of trouble. A lot of the game is about learning and skill-based though, meaning the more runs you do -- and I'd recommend your first completion on Easy, as it's a lot more forgiving -- the more tricks you're going to learn. That means you're going to have an easier time on your next trip, and an easier time on your next trip, and it goes on... Worth the $10 price if you're the kind of person who boots up roguelikes every so often for a run or two.

No correction it's so much more then just a game experience / eye-opener, I always found that games where becoming really easy over the past years, with most of the games holding your hands and a general feeling of every one is a winner, but this game does something else it's unforgiving from the enemies you encounter to the food that you eat to satisfy your hunger, and what I found really interning is that even when you think a food type is save it's not a guaranty that it's truly save, and you might be poised and the more move you take the more health you lose because of the position ticks, and you find your self with only 10 bullets left and your trusty knife, it makes you nervous and careful and you start to doubt every thing you find, Levels are procedurally generated each time a new game is started, the interface is beautiful and you can level up and spend your points, so if you want a Pretty good roguelike with fun action and crafting system Buy This GAME!

Add the great Sword of the Stars Lore, a great art style, hundreds of cratable items and several unique character classes and you have all the makings of great game.\n\nAs an added bonus, this game has gotten tons of support and added content, if you look at the DLC options you will notice a total of 3 DLC with even more to come. And this isn't "vanilla ware" DLC with like 1-2 weapons and some skins or whatever, each DLC adds character classes and tons of items, resulting in an extremely varied game.\n\nIf there is one criticism though I think this game is not mod friendly, so compared to something like say Dungeons of Dredmore it has less content even with all the DLC.

Each move or attack takes one "moment" and to keep you from just grinding there is a food mechanic where you will starve if you don't keep going and finding more.

Certain classes seem to rely more or less on RNG, and some runs can feel like The Binding of Isaac where unless you get the "correct gun" or "best equipment" for your build you're going have a lot of trouble. A lot of the game is about learning and skill-based though, meaning the more runs you do -- and I'd recommend your first completion on Easy, as it's a lot more forgiving -- the more tricks you're going to learn. That means you're going to have an easier time on your next trip, and an easier time on your next trip, and it goes on... Worth the $10 price if you're the kind of person who boots up roguelikes every so often for a run or two.

Playing as the marine on easy, the combat was very forgiving, but I still had to be careful when low on ammo or when my weapons were badly damaged. Normal is actually very brutal and I haven't even got halfway yet. There are two higher difficulties for crazy people :) Combat is turn based and there is alot of weapon and enemy variety, which adds up to good tactical depth. Non combat skills and equipment can help in interesting ways. Graphics and sound are okay, but unfortunately the story is hidden in encrypted data files that I didn't have the skills to read.

Here it goes: Plague starts on some planet, dude/chick (you) goes to mysterious alien mountain base full of dangers in hope to find a cure. Messages can be found at terminals which contain some more lore, story elements and crafting recipes, but only if your character can decipher them.\nYou can pick between 3 classes (Marine, Engineer, Scout) that come with different stats and equipment and play reasonably different. More classes are added in DLC (up to 10 in total).\nSo what do you do exactly? Well, you fight your way through many (30 I think) randomly generated floors full of increasingly difficult enemies, while trying to find better equipment and prevent starvation. To help you with that, the game comes with a wide variety of guns, armor and tools as well as recipes for food and more guns/armor. In order to get those you must pick locks on containers, hack terminals and, when you're desperate, rummage through recycling bins. To increase your odds of successfully fishing a piece of yummy bacon out of a rotting garbage pile or hitting an enemy, you gain XP and spend points on several skills like "Foraging" and "Assault Rifles". Combat is (semi-)turn-based: If no enemy is near you can move freely but once spotted, it goes turn-based and you can only move a few tiles or attack each turn.\nSotS is not a short game - Although it's perfectly fine to play for 30 minutes and clear 1-2 floors every now and then, getting to the bottom floor of the alien base will suck a lot of time out of your life, even more so on higher difficulty settings when you dying will become a regular event. The difficulty curve is quite steep - on my first easy playthrough I pretty much breezed through the levels, but now I'm already struggling to make it past the 10th floor on normal. There are many different enemies with different abilities and strengths and an important part of survival is knowing how to counter them (and keeping cures ready for all the negative status effects they can inflict).\nSoundtrack and effects aren't that good, but like the story it's not something I care too much about in these games.\nI don't see anything wrong with the controls - simple but effective. The only thing that keeps bugging me is the limited inventory space. With all the guns, food, ammo, crafting materials, etc. your inventory is constantly full. But I guess the hard decision between keeping a potentially life-saving food item or an equally important Medkit is part of the fun.\n\nI enjoyed it a lot and will keep playing. It's fun to tune in for 30 minutes to clear some floors and find loot. If you played a lot of roguelikes, SotS might not offer you anything you haven't seen before, but it's still a very solid game. If you're new to the genre, it's a good albeit difficult start.\n\nAbout the DLC - As mentioned before they add new classes but also new equipment (+recipes), enemies, messages, status effects, etc. Mindgames is the biggest one, adding all that plus new skills (Psionics), extra floors and new rooms. More than what you would expect for DLC and worth getting. Gold Edition DLC has less content (mostly equipment and new classes) but is also cheaper. Nice addition, though not a must-have. Can't say anything about The Pilgrim DLC since I don't own that one.","July 20, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game requires knowledge and skill to win, while the random luck factor keeps you on your toes. There are many interactions between monsters, the environment, and the player to create interesting situations.  It is very tough to win when playing on normal difficulty and above, and each of the 8 playable characters has their own strengths and weaknesses that can make certain aspects of the game harder or easier. Items and loot are unique and meaningful, with every item having a purpose. Many of them can be used to craft new items and weapons, but limited inventory space makes hoarding every item you come across quite difficult. Conserving resources and using the right tool for the situation are key to the gameplay.  Highly replayable, Highly recommended.\n\nAs a side note, I also recommend using the wiki for crafting recipes. While you can unlock all the recipes through experimentation, the game doesn't lend itself to that well. You can also unlock recipes by decoding messages found on computer terminals. This takes a looong time though and for me, it detracted from the initial experience playing without the full set of tools at my disposal. It was much more enjoyable once I knew why I wanted to keep this or that ingredient rather than agonizing over whether to carry it around or not with no idea what it was for.","December 31, 2013","true","428.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's turn based, there is a crafting system (of sorts) although I didn't bother with the painstaking process of figuring it out, it's quite difficult, and it has plenty of potential hours. Rogue-like is definitely an adequate adjective for this game. My only qualms are that the story that's in it is sparse. I would like to see a sequal that perhaps involves a change of scenery instead of just the same old dungeon crawl, and perhaps a little more story to get attached to. I recommend this title.","March 8, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is quite a big bit of content and is very hard. But, has a lot of RNG which is OK for a roguelike. There is A LOT of resources to manage ( Health,PSI,Food,Ammo, also durability, your medical stuff you want, junk, blablabla) and you have a limited invertory. Unless you have a item that increases it. The learning curve is huge and a lot of stuff that is like "I can't use it or mix it" so you drop it and then 10 games later you find a station or mix it and blablabla. IT HAS PERMADEATH, kinda. There are special storage pods to put gear/exp in and pass them to other runs. You will die a lot, like ALOT ALOT ALOT ALOT. I recommend it if you like RNG heavy game and hard game.\n\nP.S THERE IS ALOT OF SKILLS AND I DONT KNOW WHAT MOST DO SO...

It has a lot of content, but not too much to completely overload your brains. Anyway, It's amount still impressive and charming - bunch of playable classes, a lot of recipes, encrypted messages, variable drop, rooms full of different devices and crates, and tons of mosters waiting to tear or blow you apart.\nGame mechanics are addictive and interesting, also having a lot of random elements and some tricky stuff, confusing player for a first time and being totally unforgiving even at the normal difficulty. Turn based system always giving you a chance to think and avoid most of troubles. Yes, the difficulty is about being quite hard, charcters has some specifical benefits and most of the things and tricks you would realise reading decoded messages and as usual - dying very often, sometimes incredibly stupid, being shocked and confused. Otherwise - read the manual coming with the game before playing - it would save a lot of your nerves and teardrops.\nIf you aren't a hardcore gamer - this is not your game, forget about it. Seriously. At last because you don't want to join crowd of crying people were looking for fun, but found hard, painful and repreating deaths in this unforgiving game. When I reached floor 10 for a frist time (of total 40) on a hard settings I've seen that there were less than 2% of people on steam for that moment who made it too, and it's without mentioning two more cruel difficulty levels.\nYou also should know one thing before you start playing (no matter this game, or any other) - computer games and games at all weren't designed to make you pleased during endless winning, the real pleasure - is in the process of gaming no matter loose you or win. Each step you do making you more experienced, it's just like life with all it's benefits, black and white sides. Series of looses would lead to win, series of wins would lead most - to loose, and it's normal. Yes, life is a tought thing and in a crowd always just a few people really happy and enjoying it, with all its sides, because they learn, try and get, when most of the people - annoying with their problems actually doing nothing useful, where most because of their misunderstanding of reality, irresposibility and other gifts for the weaklings. People thinking that games were created to win and to be happy because of that - just a bunch of loosers trapped into their own illusions and can't accept how things are really working, that's it. If you aren't agree with that go and beat the Tetris, and similar games, I would be pleased to see you doing it, punk.\nPS This review is actual for the Gold Edition of the game (with all dlcs). DLCs are organic and making game bigger, even more complete and variable due to new classes. Juggernaut DLC seem to be weakest though, having less content that any of previous DLCs, but it's worth to be bought on sales to unlock all the newest stuff and catch a complete pleasure playing it full, if you loved it.\nI bet this game got to have a better metascore rating, if it wasn't so unforgiving to the most of pussicats...","January 17, 2014","true","302.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only sad that studio kinda fell on their face with SOTS2. The pit is a fun roguelike that takes all of that backstory and makes great use of it, as well as being obstensibly a fun scifi version of your typical roguelike.\n\nGet alot of bang for the buck too. The graphics and sounds are very good, wonderfully animated which is actually rare for the rogue like genre where aside from FTL most of these kind of games go the retro pixalated look or skimp on visual design for gameplay. This has both. With the gold edition they also added more of the interesting SOTS races as playable characters and they each have a unique strength and downsides to change up the challenge of playing through.

"Kind of". For once, I will aim to give an extremely brief review.\n\nRoguelike games are a dying genre - as in, actual roguelikes, games that follow the genre of the original title for which the genre is named. One can make a powerful argument that so-called "Roguelite" genre - games that incorporate the 'permadeath' aspect, and often have some kind of progression system between multiple runs/tries at the game - are the successor to Roguelike games, and they are numerous with countless quality entries on Steam alone, from Binding of Isaac, to Risk of Rain, to Sunless Sea. Games that may not share typical 'genre' mechanics - they can have elements of platformers, action-RPGs, exploration titles, side-scrolling shooters, first person shooters - but all share that same 'you'll die, but you'll get better' overarching progression path, or unlock path (and, possibly to play into the permadeath aspect, most have a rather dark tone).\n\nBut actual Roguelikes? Turn-based, resource-management driven games? Very rare, and this is one of the few titles that fits the genre to a T. Huge amount of content, high production quality, and obscenely difficult. If there's a weakness to the game, is that your only hope of success is to 'exploit' non-intuitive mechanics, like not entering your stats screen for a time in order to 'stock' level-ups like a resource, or unequipping armor in the early levels to avoid damaging it, or unequipping weapons and punching doors and other objects for stat points. However, even un-intuitive mechanics still are balanced in some way - the cost making itself known in food, health, psi, anything.\n\nThis game is a niche title by every definition, but if someone was already into roguelikes, I'd encourage it highly. If someone wanted to TRY a roguelike, I'd honestly recommend the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games (at least the first two generations), which are very high quality games but, obviously, aimed at a younger and lower-skilled audience, and THEN this.\n\nIf you're 'on the fence', don't get this game. Nobody can deny that it is a frustrating experience.","August 24, 2015","true","44.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hope you have a second controller/keyboard. All of this said, learning and understanding the nuances of this game make it quite rewarding, and it's definitely worth a look.

Thousands of items. Millions of interractions.\n\n- Non combat-based skills that matter in regular game-play. It takes more than dealing damage to succeed.

Seriously, the art is adorable, the audio is aural candy, and the enemies are so unforgiving of your mistakes that you'll learn to enjoy surviving just one more turn.\n\nIf there is a free demo available, by all means try it if you are on the fence.  However, The Pit is well worth the full asking price if you like a good, brutal, permadeath gaming experience.  With love, of course.","March 15","true","294.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I noticed other reviewers commenting that it can get repetitive but I don't think that's a dealbreaker. The starter characters are interesting & fun to play (although the lizard has an absurd advantage with a built-in melee ability), the recipes are discovered in a cool way and there's lots of different ways to play. I usually find a single "type" of build and play that for a long time but with this game, I was experiementing with different characters & skills fromt he start. I think anyone that likes a good rogue-like would like this game.","February 6","true","30.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly isn't.\n\nIt feels like Fallout 2 dungeon exploration with System Shock (predecessor to BioShock) mood. Great mix - and since both were dark sci-fi schemes it blends well.\n\nMost of the levels seem tiny. So they also seem to start to look alike.\n\nOn the + side all the side skills (computers, repairs etc) seem to have a point in this game. That's great! Happened rarely in other games.\n\nIn conclusion - good another rogue like, but still just another rogue like. With Tome4 and venerable adom available for free we should start to demand more :)","February 8","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
