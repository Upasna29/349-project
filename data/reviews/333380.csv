There's no content and no goal. You can't progress your character and combat isn't functional.\nIt hasn't been updated since March at the time of this writing and there's been no word about any further updates from the devs since August.\nDon't fall for this scam.","December 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","1"

A rosy reminder of fueled days with milk and cookies from yer youth? SQG could be what you are looking for. Important to note SilverQuest: Gaiden is in Early Access and nowhere as fleshed out as it should be. What grabbed me was its aim to be a very moddable game which allows the adding and expanding of what you like by the user. The current price IMHO is an invesment into what will hopefully end up as a nice rogue-style game.","September 23, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

I am very excited to follow the development of this game , as it shows a certain promise in regards to implimentation of small + cool details alongside an interesting aesthetic + promised modularity.","January 1, 2015","true","1.2"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","11","27","3","2"

Ok, that's just early access and stuff. Dare i can write roguelike in python within 1 month including more features.\nGuess how you can add content and edit it? Recode it. Just finish the devs job, have fun there.\nExpecting them to add actual gameplay to "game".\nRecommending it for those who love they games in fetus pre-omega form.","December 31, 2014","true","1.1"," 15 of 37 people (41%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","41","15","37","5","2"
