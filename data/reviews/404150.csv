The answer is an honest "no". It lacks substance, objectives, there is very limited exploration and an overly confined world even if the weather concept is interesting (albeit not extremely new). I found a way to jump across the fence behind the backyard into the "Void" and I thought to myself that there might be something more to this game than I originally thought! I will probably fall into a fantastic alternate world beyond The Void, maybe another part of the Earth with a different weather, maybe even another planet with its corresponding atmosphere! But no, it's just a bug where if you jump across the fence into the The Void, you don't respawn or anything. The screen just stays white. Thought the devs should know.","November 11, 2015","false","1.2"," 65 of 77 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","65","77","3","0"

I suspended my disbelief with the 'u' and the 'ur' in the synopsis. It could have, after all, been from the heart.\n\nI get that it's only what it is. A decoration. Amusement. But it seems to lack something of a thematic foundation. It's about going outside. So what?\n\nIt's not obscure enough to qualify as intriguing outsider art. The quirkiness is too forced to leave an impression of genuinity.\n\nThe presentation is unpolished and the concept feels like a stump.","November 11, 2015","false","0.4"," 58 of 74 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","58","74","0","0"

Naturally, those who are opposed to 'walking simulators' will find nothing of interest here, however, it did seem to have more to it when compared to other walking sims that are available.  That said, the world was very small (or maybe I just never found the rest of it).\n\nThe weather, supposedly, correlates with your local weather. If that's the case then I don't know where it thought I was because it was hazy and foggy in game whilst the sun blazed away outside my window without a cloud in sight.\n\nThe artstyle is fun and light. It has a claymation sort of vibe to it.  Also, the various characters that inhabit the world are quirky and, for some reason, remind me a little of Adventure Time characters.  That said, they lacked any real substance and conversations were awkwardly stilted.\n\nIn short, the game is not objectively bad but is unlikely to sustain a player's interest for more than an hour or so.  As a result, I can't recommend it.","November 13, 2015","false","0.4"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","24","35","4","0"

So if you check in at night, or on a hot day, or when it's snowing, you'll find different people or people will talk about different stuff.\n\nYou don't play it in long bursts, you just sort of come by once a day to see what's up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/404150/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","434 products in account","There’s something wonderful about Lovely Weather We’re Having, by Julian Glander. Maybe it has something to do with the bright pastel colours, off-the-wall characters and adorable little pug that faithfully follows you wherever you go? It’s a delightful plaything, that’s undeniable, but it leaves me craving more than it can offer.\n\nYou and your little pug friend have been locked out of the house, and have nothing but roaming around the village and talking to the locals to pass the time. And what a weird bunch of locals they are. There’s a giant sea monster, for one thing, who is much more approachable and friendly than his exterior may suggest. Then there’s the guy with the rockin’ afro, slumped beside his house and always asking philosophical questions. I’m pretty sure he’s the game’s token stoner, though. There’s over a dozen of these lovable characters to encounter, and they will always be happy to spit out some mystifying conundrum, or piece of advice.\n\nThe game, in a clever little piece of technological jiggery-pokery, can extrapolate time and weather details based on where you are playing, and the town and townspeople will react accordingly. At night time you’ll receive a torch to run around with and so on. Little touches like that keep things interesting, and add a little variety to your encounters you’ll have with your neighbours.\n\nYou aren’t supposed to play for extended periods of time. Rather, a few short 10-15 minute bursts at different times of the day. That way you’ll get to experience the day gracefully fade to night, and the various mood changes your neighbours have throughout the day.\n\nIt’s just a kick in the pants that there’s not much more to Lovely Weather We’re Having.\n\nI’m not new to these “goal-free” games, where exploration is your only real objective, but I’m a little disheartened nonetheless.\n\nThe game’s world and the people that inhabit it are so well-crafted, that it’s difficult to believe that there isn’t more to discover. Just a little more interaction, please, that’s all I ask.\n\nDon’t let my slight grievances put you off, though. Lovely Weather We’re Having is a gorgeous game to explore, and Glander’s signature art style will appeal just as much to adults as it will to children.\n\nPeople of a more serene disposition will glean more enjoyment out of Lovely Weather We’re Having than the rest of us, but I suspect that was the intention all along.\n\nIf you enjoyed my review, please feel free to visit my website for more!\nhttp://criticalindiegamer.com/2015/11/lovely-weather-were-having-is-a-delightful-disappointment/","November 15, 2015","false","3.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/s1ic3r/recommended/404150/","s1ic3r","Kritty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/s1ic3r/","404 products in account","Lovely Weather We're Having? No, that's not the ever-so-awkward pickup line spouted by hundreds of teenage boys to cute girls daily across the world, it's the name of an indie explorer game on Steam. Now, whether you can call it a game or not depends on how you define the word “game”. If you define it as an application that has interactive elements, then this would be a game; however, if you desire your games to have a defined plot-line, an actual ending, and/or a reason to actually continue playing beyond the first 10 minutes, you might find this particular offering wanting.\n\nFor the sake of this review, I won't call it a game – rather, I'll refer to it as an “interactive experience”, in some ways similar to Journey, though nowhere near as polished or meaningful. Lovely Weather We're Having is done in a clay animation style, which, while simple, can be a bit grating after a few minutes of play. The controls are also fairly simple – use WASD to move your character around, and the Space bar to interact with the various characters scattered throughout the world. The whole time you're wandering about this fairly barren landscape, your little puppy follows you without so much as a sound.\n\nIn actual gameplay, it is simple, almost annoyingly so. There is very little to do but talk to other characters and kick around some rocks; the biggest draw is the fact that the weather in-game is supposed to change based on your local weather. I have to admit that the developers added a bit of an interesting element by adding sounds to various things that you walk over or kick around; however, this feature would have been more intriguing if they had added variation in the sounds. It can be obnoxious when every flower you walk over creates the exact same tone, and every stone you kick sounds the same no matter the size.\n\nOverall, while Lovely Weather We're Having might be ideal for young children looking to enjoy a few minutes of pointless running around with cutesy graphics, I cannot recommend it for anyone over the age of 7. The lack of purpose, interaction, and general things to do will become boring incredibly quick for anyone who enjoys truly interactive games.\n\nhttp://www.thedrastikmeasure.com/2016/01/08/we-touch-games-lovely-weather-were-having-pc-review/","January 7","false","0.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
