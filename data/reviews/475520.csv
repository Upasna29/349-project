For how much fun this is I cant believe how cheap the game is. This game is a mental and physical workout and your constantly dodging enemy fire. I love how you move around and how gravity plays a factor. I have to add, make sure your wrist straps are secure with this game. This game involves a lot of throwing motions so lets just say your controllers get sweaty and are way harder to grip. I can definitely picture people accidentally throwing their vive controllers with this game.","May 20","true","1.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I AM SWEATING, fianallly I AM SWEATING ! ! !\nThe first VR game that achieved that!\n\nThe game is fun, thrilling and challenging. Actually for me in the TOP 5\nof VR games you can get on steam! Finally sth. worth to play in VR.\nIt would not make sense in 2D, not in 3D and not seated.\n\nbtw. ... You should stripe your HMD as thight as possible :D\n\n@ Fox: Looked at this game, just because of ur scripts for unity. Thank you again btw. Helped me a lot! But actually, the game REALLY IS GOOD! Totally worth it's money! Too cheap compared to\nthe expansive trash you can find on steam.","May 20","true","1.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"
