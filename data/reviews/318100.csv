This is exactly why users look at Early Access, and write it off immediately.\n\nThe game is not even in an alpha state in my opinion. No menu tips, no descriptions of what to do in game. It does not teach you anything. Which in a game that indicates "MOBA, WARGAME, FPS", is pretty god dang important. You get thrown in there. Graphics are meh. Sound is missing key portions of it. Hit detection is problematic, with feedback when YOU get hit, but not feedback when the enemy gets hit.\n\nOne map is avaliable. Apparently, you're supposed to destroy lines. What are those lines? Unsure, just blow stuff up. Running around the map made me feel physically sick. Can't change resolution without the game freaking out. No windowed mode?\n\nthe developer says: "Now, game is completely ready as a multiplayer shooter with the MOBA elements". That is a joke. It's by no means ready on any sort of level. And if they believe that, Then don't buy the game: it's obvious the quality will be complete ♥♥♥♥.\n\nMore at a Youtube video here, but note this is a dive into gameplay, and me being angry about this game:\nhttp://youtu.be/80pt7ENcFGE\n\n","October 31, 2014","false","1.1"," 164 of 239 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","164","239","7","19"

I've received this "game" from developers... And YES, my level of rage on this game is so high, that I've decided to attack devs and blame them for making this game. Game like this in my opinion should be removed from Steam, because they are in early pre alpha of alpha. I'm fair guy and kind for indie devs. But... This game isn't indie game. This is some kind of mix of most poor made stuff avaiable in Unreal Engine.\n\n- Only ONE MAP, some containers, some walls, two trains and that's all. Everything described in the Steam Greenlight page IS A LIE, it's not avaiable in the game!\n- Idea of FPS-moba. There's nothing about moba. Just some objectives like towers that players must destroy, these towers are not defending the bases, they are just... standing\n- There are no hitboxes. Torso and head. You can shoot 10 bullets from Makarov into somehone foot and he will not die\n- Features: Destruction. Lold. I laughed so hard - you can blow up AntiAircraft cannon. That's all.\n- Graphics. Game looks like most poor made Unreal Engine based game... Something around 2006. Most options in main menu are not working.\n- Player moves. Head boobing and no option to disable it. You are running like someone without foot, without offense for people without foot, ofc.\n- You can stuck yourself on everything, you can't run smoothly because EVERYTHING in this game is stopping you and bugging your running animation. Most funny thing is about enemy resp - when you are entering enemy main base you are gettin killed by shots from heavens. Just bang bang bang and you dies without reason, without warning.\n- There's no server browser yet, so you have to lottery server by in-game system. Most often player is joining... empty server. What a disabled programmer made this?!\n- Weapons have recoil and bullet spread somewhere from early 2000s, sniper rifle doesn't have head boob when you are moving or standing\n- Shop with some typical weapons. Devs added money to the game that players are earning and they called this MOBA... WTF?! If I will add money system to Mario or Tetris, it's also MOBA at once?\n\nBuy CSGO if you like fast close-combat for same amount of money. Play Planetside 2 if you are looking for massive free FPS. Don't let the devs earn money on this uber poor made game.","November 5, 2014","false","2.1"," 80 of 117 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","80","117","9","1"

It felt like a simple sandbox engine littered with stock assets.\nGive this a miss and maybe look them up again once they have invested some time and effort into making a game that doesnt resemble a simple concept demo.\nTo hook customers in at the early access stage you have to give them something has the WOW factor... either in looks, gameplay or originality, at the moment this title lacks all three.\nI wish the developers well regardless and hope they can take the feedback (some of which has been a bit over zealous and in places downright rude) and from that ignite the flame of determination to bounce back with something that will grab the end users attention.","November 12, 2014","false","3.0"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","30","41","2","0"

I feel as if you just spawn in and see an enemy barely at all. I prefer faster combat. Which probably means more players, smaller maps. Just a suggestion. I just don't feel the flow.\n\nNeed some tips on how it works. Like how to destory things, whats what. I was shooting at the enemy turret thingy, and it took no damage. Not sure if that's right or not...?\n\nEven the main menu doesn't tell you what button does what. You got to guess between a world symbol and two dice what is what...?\n\nAnd what does that mean, play with different characters? I guess every game could show off because they got a few different player models. Skills? What, like different guns, or just all the same? I didn't see an option to change my skills. I didn't even notice skills. You need to show these off more and tell people how the game actually works.\n\nI'm not 100% sure how this is a MOBA. I thought it would more be like lanes and turrets and stuff. And Wargame, not sure on these, but I swear they are were you like control your units, which I thought this game was going to be like. So you control the units and can play as them as well.\n\nGood try to mix all these together. And if you change things about a bit, explain the game better, maybe add lanes and turrets, or something to stop people from progressing right to the end, explain better once again since I am probably writting this review incorrectly because of no explanation, a lot faster paced combat. More sound or music or something in the background. Three Quaters of the time, it's just silence...And just change things around and listen to the community a lot!\n\nSorry, but I will have to give this a bad no. I will change it though, if I can see you are starting to improve it.\n\nAnd really neatek, give a good review on your own game... -_-","October 31, 2014","false","0.3"," 59 of 96 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","59","96","0","0"

While playing you can feel that this game is at a very early stage - there is only one map, there is no options for classes, everything looks simply and is missing some basic information. There is barely any fun also because of lags, even players that have good connection and ping have this problem. Not sure if not being able to jump on even small things was made consciously but it's kind of annoying.\nWhat makes me worry is that there are many better and finished multiplayer games that doesn't have any player base or those are very small that you need to be lucky to find someone to play with.

Great in appearance and has potential. However, that says little as many great games have been ruined by their publishers. And while in a single player game, that may not matter, in a multiplayer game, it is fundamental that the publishers understand the importance of not harassing their userbase.

Not gifted, not stolen, not given away, but purchased. And of course, the developer decided as well to harass their userbase, demeaning the userbase, suggesting that they had nothing that they did wrong because the users bought the keys outside of steam. With their reasoning, they implied that IndieGala, Humble Bundle, and many more places should offer the keys, but not actually give them out.\n\nIn other words, that you shouldn't receive what you purchased.

You can spawnkill all you want, there is only small time invisiblity when you spawn.\n\nTurret gadget makes enemy team unplayable when you place it at enemy spawn.","January 20","true","7.2"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","22","34","2","0"

An Unreal Engine game that feels like Modern Warfare and Battlefield. But with the speed of Unreal Tournament! this game is definitely Legit.\n\nGamers Facts:\n\nIf you see my Library, I have and love FPS games.\n\n+ Excellent Graphics\n+ Excellent Gameplay\n+ Excellent Potential\n\n- Only played Bots so far, but MINOR if I can find some players, it might work\n- NO INVERT ON GAMEPAD AND MOUSE!!! Inexcusable. Every Single game I have played Allows this option.\n- LEFT TRIGGER NO RESPONSE (just allow us to enable or disable the controller, if you choose not to fix this right away)\n\nKeep in mind that this is an Early Access game. I bought it when it first came out, and I fell in love with the potential, when I could get on and play before it crashed. but its fine now.I have no Idea if the netcode works or anything yet, but the Bots are in, and you definitely will LOVE whats here.\n\nThe fact that it is an UNREAL ENGINE game means it can practically run on anything. I want to try it on my Toshiba latop, then move it over to My dedicated gaming PC to see it on Ultra. But I love running stuff on this particular laptop.\n\nI Really need to see what the Devs are doing, and I hope they are really going to finish this game.\n\nWishlist? Yes. I have a wishlist.\n\n-Survival Mode\n-Ability To furnish maps and models\n-Split screen (just 2, and I have seen the plug in for sale in the Unreal store, so if you need a loan, I know we will help you)\n-STRAIGHT UP DEATHMATCH\n\nthats all.all of the bones are here, and its phenomenal the amount of stuff that works here so far. I cant wait to play any updates. PLEASE fix the INVERT issue.I cant fully enjoy this like I want to.\n\nother than that, KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!\n\nRecommended? YES!!!! this would be considered an investment. especially since you can ♥♥♥♥ the bots for practice, and to see the progress of the proof of concept.\n\nThanks Guys, I needed this today.","September 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","10","15","3","0"

There are only 3 maps to play on.\n\nAt least the graphics and animations are kinda good, unfortunately the gameplay is way too boring (not because of the bots).\n\nIt´s still "Early Access", but I highly doubt that this "dead" game will ever reach a final build.\n\nJust do yourself a favour and don´t buy it, or if you like to spawntrap bots all day, go for it ;)","June 28, 2015","false","3.5"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","21","37","6","1"

It basically all comes down to killing players on the opposing team and upgrading your weapons/armor etc.\n\nThe graphics look good in my opinion but the maps could've been a bit larger.

However, i can tell where this game is going with its MOBA FPS gameplay with its special abilities like tempory armor, stimulated healing, Slow-mo bullet time, and even the ability to push and pull objects and players. Currently, the shop contains: Primary weapons, secondary weapons, explosives, and two slots for abilities and so far i can tell that they will add armor including helmets, body armor, gloves that will increase stats and what looks like to be equipment.\nOf course the game has bugs, what else do you expect from a Pre-Alfa game, but that does not take away its playability. I play PC games with a laptop not made for gameing having only 4 gb of RAM, but i am still able to play this game with my friends on its lowest settings with slight lag. Just from the menu screen you can tell its a Early Access Game, but once youre in a sever you can feel the decitation and the hard work put into it. Things that i have found playing this game that could use work is:\n-The players movement so it doesnt look the people are swimming (Which i actually find amusing while trying to shoot mermaids) and also the couch machanic so you dont bounce up and down a bit before settling down.\n-A more user friendly menu screen (eventhough i've found my way around already).\n-A better hub to make health and ammo easier to observe.\n\nHonestly, these bugs and improvements dont bother me a bit as they are now, but these fixes will help to make a complete and finished game. Some might wonder why im not complaing that there are not enough items in the shop or that the stats of the guns are unbalanced, well that's because if didn't, it wouldnt be a Early Access Game!\n\nI bought a four pack of this game to share with my friends and we have enjoyed every bit of it and are convinced that this game has what it takes to hit it big. Im happy that i can support this game and follow it as it the community grows and a new genre is prefected. 10/10","July 29, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Now anyone who owns the game is gonna say " why the hell are you giving this a positive rating?" and heres why. While the game is very broken and really isn't very fun at this point, i can see that once the updates start rolling in, this game might end up being pretty good for the 99 cents i payed for it. Heres some pros and cons ( devs if you fixed the cons you would have a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good game!)\n\nPros-\n\n-the graphics are pretty good. You can definately tell that the unreal engine is being put to use.\n-The weapon textures also look great, especially on the sniper rifles.\n-The running movements aren't terrible, and look alright\n-The overall game feels a bit like a rough copy of battlefield 3 ( in a good way)\n\nCons (oh sooooo many)\n\n- The way you run just feels awkward and unpolished\n-while using a sniper rifle, you have to stay aimed on your targed for at least a second before the kill registers making it extremely hard to get multi kills\n-The main menu is just icons, and it is very hard to navigate\n-there is nearly no ambient noise on maps\n-the sound of guns and generators are so loud that it blocks out almost all other noises\n-npcs seem to just bunch together and it feels as if youre playing a cod custom match with all bots on easy\n-the "game modes" are confusing and all seem to just be team deathmatch, also, no instructions are given.\n-there is like one server that is full of bots and that is it. literally ive only seen one other person on the game.\n-you cannot kill more than one enemy with one shot, making it impossible to get a collateral\n-maps are basic and look like something someone made on the farcry map editor.\n-npcs voices are too quiet and then always blocked out by said loud noises of guns.\n- two turrets are at the enemy spawn on at least one map making it impossible to go past 3/4 of the map.\n\nNow after all this, you might totally not want to buy this game, but if you can get it under 2 dollars, go for it, because the developers seem to be pretty nice, and an update with a bunch of fixes is coming in october. Maybe im saying this because i waited too long and can't get a refund, but i don't know, its a pretty ok cheapo battlefield clone.

The graphics may not be the best but are definitly good enough (keep in mind the game is still in Alpha). The gameplay is fast paced and fun and the attribute, weapon, and item systems are great. Ther are currently only 3 maps and 1 main gamemode but the Devs are doing a great job and i can't wait to see what they do next. Some things I would like to see are mechanics that encourage teamwork and larger, more detailed maps. Im hoping for a new gamemode in the next update or at least a little refinement on the current one but for now I highly recommend trying this game out. Additionally I noticed that by your profile screen it says character and weapon customization not yet availible, wait for the Beta. I'm excited to see what kind of character and weapon customization mechanics they implement besides for just skins.

It's missing a lot, and I hope the devs see this and try to implement new content. More maps, more weapons, more special items, etc. Also, I feel like the textures and especially the animations can be improved, animations look a little strange, but for the most part its fine. It has the potential to be a really pretty game, it's current state is impressive. So far it's pretty solid for an indie title, and frankly quite fun.

This game more than exceeded my expectations, which were not extremely high as this game was only $0.49 at the time of purchase. This game is incredibly fun and shares some similarity with MOBAs in the sense that you can buy upgrades for health, shields, invisibility, accuracy, chain damage (think this is damage for consecutive bullets), weapons, and both defensive and offensive abilities in game. This game rewards those ahead with feel good upgrades in game and truly is a game that does it well. The graphics aren't terrible and this game reminds me a lot of Battlefield (similar models and lots of light rays). This game also has a night and day version for the map I was playing on, with night mode having much less visibility and lots of fog. Overall, this game is amazing and plays similar to csgo/battlefield, but has the eventual tankiness and abilities of a game like Halo.\n\nI would rate this game a 8.5/10 for a great time.\n\nOh, and this game is in Early Access, meaning there is tons more content to come!","January 19","true","7.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I dont know how many times I spawned to be killed instantly\nAiming is weird and framerates drop at times and casued me to die because I was helpless.\nMaps could be a little bigger but for 3v3 I think the current size works.\n\nI think this is a promising Early Access game, if more people played it more often it would help speed along development I am sure.  With some balancing fixes, spawn loactions, more weapons, maps, heros which I have read are scheduled to come out at some point, modes I think this game could go somewhere. 7/10","March 24","true","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It could be a good game down the road.\nThe graphics aren't bad. It looks decent.\n\nCONS:\nBeing in the basic state that it is, the game is well... very basic.\nThe gun models "down the sight" view is often akward or bad looking. I.e. an M4 with no rear sight. An AK that sights way off of where it should be sighting. Etc.\nThere isn't much content.\nThere isn\t anything special keeping me coming back for more.\n\n\nBottom line:\nIf they add more stuff, I will come back. For now though I don\'t see anything special with this game. I have nothing against the developers and think it's great when people try to make new games, I just see nothing in particular that is extra special that would compell me to suggest my friends go and buy this game.","June 1","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is garbage. I paid $1.49 for the 4 pack so i could give this to my friends, and so i could have a steam purchase in the last year. Plain and simple. People say you get what you pay for. In this case thats definitely not true. You get less than what you pay for. With only 5v5 matches and finding a match is tough, this game gave me literal cancer. However it does have some positives.\n\n-It's so cheap you might as well pay for it. However you'll regret dropping the $.49 if you buy just a single copy. Trust me\n-If you want a reason to play battlefield and call of duty this is the reason. The spawns, sensitivity, and just general gameplay are just so bad that you might as well just cough up the money for one of those titles and save yourself the heartache.\n-I guess that last one wasn't a positive. Oh well.\n-If you just want a quick way to shoot some kids and get in some sub-garbage FPS gameplay. This is your game.\n\nIn conclusion,\n\n10/10 would buy again and will continue to play until further notice.","January 18","true","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","1"

GIVE IT A TRY right now its JUST 0.50€,,,, thats NOTHING for a game like that,,, CODBO3 is 60 bucks,,,,60 F,,, BUCKS,, no more to say. As I said, give it a try, for me its worth it","January 22","true","2.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Some recomendations!\n\n-Animations for your abilities! I would love to see some cool animations for some of the abilities. Such as the invistibility getting an improvment lets say, just as in example, once you buy invisibility, it attatches a wrist band that looks closely related to a watch to your characters arm, and once you activate that ability it plays an animation where it shows him clicking a button and turning invisible.\n\n-Weaken the RPG! omg I cant believe how many times I got killed by, or killed someone, unfairly with the RPG. It is frustraiting! And don't get me wrong, it does serve its purpose for taking out those pesky drones, its lethality to humans is just unfair. In reality, yes it will tear you to shreads... but then again, its a video game!\n\n- Guns, Guns! GUNS! Like any other shooter, a good game will have lots a variety. Take for example, battlefield 3 or 4, this game is very similar because of the military shooter aspect. In battlefield, you do not see everyone running around with the same exact gun and equipment (in your case, abilities) because everyone situation is different. If there is more variety of guns in axyos, it could almost be a feature to have one of the most customisable gun games out there. If anyone has played blacklight retribution ( a ftp 1st person shooter) they would know that part of the game is weapon customization. The game just keeps on encouraging you to customize your guns and character and so on... If this game had this gimic, I'm sure it would sell.\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading my review, at the stage this game is in now I will give this game a 6/10. If the devs take into consider these recomendations, then I will definintly change it for the good. And, say they don't, but the game gets better over time, my rating shall go up.

For an early-alpha game, this is amazing. A good investment for anyone who likes FPS games. The upgrade and weapon system is very cool, but there are some things I would hope to see in the beta or final release of it. What I would want to see is more upgrades, more weapons, and a way to buy weapon attachments. I also would like to see more servers up, as there aren't many of them, and they all have high ping in my area. Other than those things, I think this game is really good fun and am excited to see what the developers do with it.","March 18","true","3.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

Looks good, optimization isn't too bad, amazing reload animations, easy to pick up gameplay, and just fun to play. Now the bad side. The menue's defintely need some improvement. The function perfectly, they just don't look to good, nothing is labled (it is still pretty easy to figure out what is what, if you passed middle school and have played any fps, you should be able to figure it out) and they are low res, but still functional. Some more detailed options would be nice, especially for the graphics. There is only a low, medium, high, and ultra setting, you can't change anything else. Sometimes jumping can get a little glitchy, but most of the time it is fine. Movement seems pretty good. Character models aren't bad. And other peoples movements don't seem glitchy. AI are fine, except on one map. You can make a cargo crate fall, and the AI try to walk through it. The guns sound good and look good. There just isn't a lot of them. Some more guns would be nice. And the rocket strike doesn't seem to be working. But everything else seems to be fine. Some more abilities would be nice, since this game is striving to be a MOBA/FPS. And the belt thing (I can't remember the name at the moment) that can push objects and stuff should be made to be able to pick stuff up and move it around, kind if like in GMod. Because there isn't a whole lot of usefullness with it, maybe if the enemy took the time to make a position with boxes you could destroy it, other than that there isn't really a whole lot of use for it othere than messing around and distracting people. But i do like the fact that boxes and pallets and stuff are moveable. There are also some cool enviromental hazards. And I definetly see where the MOBA aspects come in. Also, I don't know if it is the matchmaking or there are just not a lot of people playing, but i don't find more than maybe one or two people at times. Overall, I do recommend this game. It is only in Aplha and I thing that there are going to be updates and that this game will vastly be improved. And for the price, it is on sale for a little over a dollar, very much worth it to me. My friend picked up five copies for around $5, and gave me one. Definetly worth it.\nUpdate: since update, new maps, much much better menu and hud. Optimization is soooo mmuucch better. I have a GTX 750 and I am running it on max settings (which look amazing by the way) at 60 fps. AI is a lot better, and servers have gotten better (ping). Still not too many people, but still a blast to play. Ignore a lot of the reviews. As they are old and before some of the updates came out. This game shows a lot of promise.","July 29, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The maps are tiny which means in a few seconds your in there base but overall very polished game just needs more content and luckly for us its in early access so im sure it will arrive.

This game is really well done for being in alpha, I'm not sure what will follow in its development but I can say as of now it has good graphics, the combat feels good nice amount of recoil (so it isnt as simple as point and hold to handle enemies at a range), you earn $ per kill to spend on weapons items and perks for only the duration of the match (which is great for not having a newb get completely overwhelmed). It does have some negatives though. At this stage there are very few maps and theyre very small which i dont see as positive but that depends on the player, and the spawns are static (non-mobile) which makes it easy to get spawn trapped with little chance of escape if more than 1 or 2 enemies are watching it. All in all I would say its completely worth its current price of $5 and I can't wait to see what comes later in development.","January 24","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is really fun and looks gorgeous.  It has  a csgo buying system, where you need to earn money in a match to get weapons.  It is based on skill, and not at all pay2win.  I got it for 49 cents, which is probably the best deal I have ever paid for.  One downside to this game is the optimization.  There isn't much of a texture change when you compare ultra and low, and I dont have a very good laptop and getting 30-40 fps on low.  I would really like that 60 fps, so please devs, if you are reading this, just make sure you make this game playable on low end pcs.

Looks good, optimization isn't too bad, amazing reload animations, easy to pick up gameplay, and just fun to play. Now the bad side. The menue's defintely need some improvement. The function perfectly, they just don't look to good, nothing is labled (it is still pretty easy to figure out what is what, if you passed middle school and have played any fps, you should be able to figure it out) and they are low res, but still functional. Some more detailed options would be nice, especially for the graphics. There is only a low, medium, high, and ultra setting, you can't change anything else. Sometimes jumping can get a little glitchy, but most of the time it is fine. Movement seems pretty good. Character models aren't bad. And other peoples movements don't seem glitchy. AI are fine, except on one map. You can make a cargo crate fall, and the AI try to walk through it. The guns sound good and look good. There just isn't a lot of them. Some more guns would be nice. And the rocket strike doesn't seem to be working. But everything else seems to be fine. Some more abilities would be nice, since this game is striving to be a MOBA/FPS. And the belt thing (I can't remember the name at the moment) that can push objects and stuff should be made to be able to pick stuff up and move it around, kind if like in GMod. Because there isn't a whole lot of usefullness with it, maybe if the enemy took the time to make a position with boxes you could destroy it, other than that there isn't really a whole lot of use for it othere than messing around and distracting people. But i do like the fact that boxes and pallets and stuff are moveable. There are also some cool enviromental hazards. And I definetly see where the MOBA aspects come in. Also, I don't know if it is the matchmaking or there are just not a lot of people playing, but i don't find more than maybe one or two people at times. Overall, I do recommend this game. It is only in Aplha and I thing that there are going to be updates and that this game will vastly be improved. And for the price, it is on sale for a little over a dollar, very much worth it to me. My friend picked up five copies for around $5, and gave me one. Definetly worth it.\nUpdate: since update, new maps, much much better menu and hud. Optimization is soooo mmuucch better. I have a GTX 750 and I am running it on max settings (which look amazing by the way) at 60 fps. AI is a lot better, and servers have gotten better (ping). Still not too many people, but still a blast to play. Ignore a lot of the reviews. As they are old and before some of the updates came out. This game shows a lot of promise.","July 29, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Add more achievments, faster trading card drops (I haven't gotten one yet.) etc. AXYOS has a lot of potential, it needs more players. I found 2 games that had players in it, thats not a lot.

I purchased it for 79 cents in early access and really enjoyed playing it. The only things I would like the developers to do with this game are to add a ranked playing option and a training / tutorial option. When I first opened the game, the only way to practise was to jump into an onliine match, where I get wrecked by people who have played about 100 hours of the game.

Such as:\nThe hitboxes on the moving boxes and pieces around the map make it difficult to jump on them.\nThe M24 sniper rifle kills rediculously easy and should be atleast slightly nerfed.(just a little less damage)\nThe M24 sniper rifle also gets jammed occasionally if you stay scoped in and continue to shoot, I've found out that you need to unscope after every shot.\nAccuracy upgrades don't really seem to do much, (maybe make assault rifles have a little more spread)\nStill have no idea what the chain upgrade does. (maybe make some little information buttons beside the upgrade buttons)\nSome games just turn into spawn camping. (maybe make some invincability as you spawn for a short period)\n\nAnd thats it! For a game in pre-release it seems very well polished and if you've played a shooter before the menu's seem right at home. i'd give this game a 4/5, but that's only because it's still bieng worked on. That's all for my review, hope you enjoyed. Later!","June 6","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
