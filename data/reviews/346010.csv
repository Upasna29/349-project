The animation quality, texturing, modeling, and even the music are all fantastic!\nEven the menu for the levels is addictive in a way... I'm actually HOPING they get around to finishing this because the framework of it is really astonishing.\nMy only complaint is the lack of a tutorial; it kind of sets you out in the middle of the first level with the VERY basic blocks and such and doesn't tell you about certain mechanics.\nFor instance: You can add steering devices for wheels. STEERING DEVICES FOR WHEELS. I'VE LITERALLY NEVER SEEN ANY OTHER GAME DO THIS BEFORE.\nTruthfully, I feel this is going to be one of those great games once (or if... though I hope not if!) the devs finish it.\nReally I think I'm going to play more, because this game is something special! :)","January 30, 2015","true","14.9"," 585 of 608 people (96%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","96","585","608","65","12"

A+++++ 11/10, best ever. Together we've learned about physics, gravity, centre of mass, flight, ballast, geometery, engineering, problem solving, and other great topics. As a bonus is it probably the first game my wife has shown any interest in too! It's also sparked more interest in the kids toward real-life building, and they've dusted off their lego and are often inspired to build in real life after playing.\nIn the course of 'beating' the first island we built a number of tanks with progressively better steering and durabily, a couple flying machines including a kamakazee model, a crane, a couple cars, and a number of mostly useless but fun "prototypes." Awsome.\nI've found many games like this have been too complicated or been burdened by a cumbersome UI. This game perfectly strikes the balance between simplicity and complexity. The game mechanics are deep enough to stay very interesting for a long time, and simple enough that we've never been frustrated. I really hope the devs stick to this winning formula they have here and just work on content, refinements, and more building pieces.","December 2, 2015","true","10.8"," 394 of 406 people (97%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","97","394","406","38","9"

I watched a stream of it and i instantly bought it.\nFor the first hour, i thought i was playing the game wrong. Because the game encourages creativity with your machines.\nYet all i built was a block with wheels and studded with cannons.\nIs that at all original? Nope.\nDid it even work? Kinda.\nWas it enough for the objectives? Sometimes.\nDid it get wrecked? Yeap.\nDid it look totally awesome? Hell yeah!\n\nSo far, when you start the game, you are greeted by the main menu which is basically the title of the game, an options menu and a moveable 3d model of the earth (or rather, besiege's version of the earth). Much of the parts of the globe are clickable and they correspond to a level or area in the game. When you click one, it takes you to a table top figurine looking 3d model that again you click in order to choose a level to play in. For now, ipsilon is the only playable area. There are more areas to come soon in future updates.\n\nIt was a little hard to figure out how to make working siege machines but when you figure it out, those knights had better watch their backs. Aaaaaand maybe the sheep too. Yes. The sheep. They litter the fields of ipsilon and just graze there like they expect you to just leave them behind. Diabolical little critters, those sheep.\nGetting their blood and guts all over my nice siege machine, clogging and gumming up the works with their entrails.\nClever little sheep. Clever indeed.\n\nI really like the charm of the game itself, as it reminded me a lot of crush the castle on iOS only much more expanded and you aren't limited to trebuchets. I hope the devs add more parts, more ammunition types besides the flaming ball and the bomb ball, more weapons and more customization options as well as more enemies cause crushing a ton of em under my siege machine is just plain fun.\nThe game looks absolutely beautiful as it gives off that kind of tabletop looking vibe and the fact that your siege machine can and will take damage and you see the damage actually happening. Your siege machines have to be structurally sound otherwise your machine could break, burn or explode before you even get the chance to move the machine, kill anything, or blow up stuff.\n\nI just can't get over the tabletop feel of it. It is just so damn cool looking to me.\n\nI recommend it to anyone that likes the medieval era kind of war, anyone who likes simulations and anyone who enjoys building games. Support the devs!\n\n9 Dead sheep out of 10.\nWould be a 10 when they add in new stuff for sure.\nI hope they add goats in too.","January 31, 2015","true","9.7"," 248 of 254 people (98%) found this review helpful 113 people found this review funny","98","248","254","113","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleb4est/recommended/346010/","caleb4est","[UNiT] caleb4est","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleb4est/","303 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBesiege? Where do I begin?\n\nWell, what is it?\nIt's like Call of Duty, except less shooting and more quality. They give you the tools and the objectives, you make the epic machinery. Essentially, it's a medieval construction simulation, with some exploding sheep.\n\nHow's the gameplay?\nI play on a really crappy laptop. Pretty sure it was handed down by my grandfather when he was a child. Anyways, this game still runs smoothly on it. I mean, when I add 124 cannons to my invention it does lag up a little, but c'mon. Who needs 124 cannons, really?\nThe controls are very easy to learn. As long as you know how to read, you shouldn't have trouble. It falls into the category of easy to learn, but extremely difficult to master. There are literally unlimited possiblities. You just need to have the skills and the knowledge to bring out the true potential this game has.\n\nHow're the graphics?\nUgh. They're gorgeous.\nYou think that literally popping enemies open, watching their guts and blood splatter all over the map as you shred their bodies to pieces with your deadly innovation, wouldn't be beautiful? Well you're wrong.\nEvery animation, every explosion, every texture, is spot on. Definitely one of my favorite styles of graphics too: clean, organized, easy to navigate, and elegant. You see, I like to be elegant while hacking flocks of birds to pieces and sending pieces of rock from castles and monuments flying into the air.\nIt makes me feel better about myself.\n\nIs the game buggy? And no, we're not asking you to compare it to an insect.\nIt does have a few glitches and faults.\nBut really, don't we all? *whoa man that's deep*\nSometimes, I'll be driving along in my flame-throwing-saw-wielding-semi-flying-ten-wheeled-construction-of-destruction, and the wheels will just decide they can't even anymore, and they flip up in the air and my innocent little vehicle getting torn to pieces. By the air.\nThat does happen. Sometimes.\nBut the bugs certainly don't make it unplayable by any stretch. If anything, they're just funny. I'm usually too busy laughing my tonsils out to actually get annoyed at the glitches.\n\nIs it worth the price?\nYES. If a game costs less than the price of a sandwich at Burger King, you really can't go wrong. And Besiege does. Enough said.\n\nDoes it have any replay value?\nAbsolutely! Every level leaves you with the feeling of: 'Did I make the awesomest and most effective invention possible for that objective?' ... 'Could I have done it faster?' ... 'Could I have done it without blowing up my entire invention?'\nAnd, generally speaking, that drives you to try again, even if you've already beaten the level.\n\nSo, all in all, is Besiege a good game?\nGood? GOOD?!?!  IS IT GOOD?!?!\nLol yes.\nIt's amazing.\nIt's better than the meal at Burger King that costs the same amount of money, it will last you a lot more time... and heck it has less saturated fat too!\nAnd get this: it's not even done.\nThere are only 2 areas publicly available as of yet. The second isn't even all the way done.\nIt's in freaking Early Access. And it's this good.\nIf you don't buy this, and by the time it's done it's an epic game that costs a lot more and has a huge fanbase, don't say I didn't call it out.\nDo your dietary health a favor, skip your lunch at Burger King, eat some celery instead, and buy this game.\nYou won't regret it.\n\n~ caleb4est","June 18, 2015","true","7.1"," 247 of 281 people (88%) found this review helpful 171 people found this review funny","88","247","281","171","16"

Correct, especially considering the fact that this gem is still in early access. The inclusion of the steam workshop allowing players to share their creations with the community is another positive.

Just awesome. And here's why:\nYou know when you go around on youtube and see someone play a cool game, and you're all like "OMFG I WANT THAT GAME TOO!"? Well, Besiege is one of those games, but most of those games are most fun when you didn't watch those videos, because it will spoil alot of the fun. But Besiege on the other hand, is early access, so the most of the fun has yet to come. Also can you create many, many, many different sorts of things, and thus creating almost endless joy.\nNow, let's get down to business.\n\nPros;\n-Physxx duuude!\n-Wide variety of levels, also lots of room to mess around in sandbox\n-It's early access, and for one of such, it is quite big.\n-Unlimited resources\n-Good framerate. I mention this because my laptop can't handle much, but yet, if i keep the graphics normal, it works fine.\n-Fun to look at-graphics\n-Being indirectly able to share creations. I feel like they should be saved on Besiege's own database. My laptop broke down, and I lost everything.\n\nCons;\n-No way to change objects' color\n-No tutorials for (for example) aviation(=flight)\n-No information on objects' mass\n-The enemies, except for the archers and the bombs, don't even touch you\n-> You should have a button for this in levels with knights, so that you can make it a bit more challenging\n-No custom maps (yet?)\n-Not alot of information on what stuff does. This doesn't necessarily bother me, but for unexperienced players this will be a problem.\n-The basics should be explained at the 1st stage, the weaponry at the first fighting/explosive stage, and so on.\n\nConclusion;\nGreat game, but minor things that I expect to be updated and patched pretty soon.\nOne of my all-time favorites 8.7/10 - Cpt.

A great game with good physics, beautiful graphics, a relatively easy to use building system, and overall fun gameplay. Smash sheep, splatter soldiers, or just build to your hearts content, the endless possiblities that besiege offers are simply astonishing. I am writing this review in early access, however from what I have seen so far into the game, although only being one campaign level, and a bit of a bugged sandbox, I see a game with the potential to turn into one of the best games on steam. If you enjoy a game that gives you the power to smush over affectionate sheep, create elaborate contraptions, and build practically anything, this is the game for you.

Its wheels creaked and groaned as it began to bear down on this sole survivor.\n\nPercival gasped, and picked up a bow from a fallen comrade. He nocked a single arrow towards this horrendous behemoth of war. His only hope was to find some sort of weak spot in the massive wall of iron that protected the monstrosity. Already mounds of blunted arrows lay cast all over the battlefield, fired by archers who had failed at the very thing Percival was attempting to do.\n\nIt came now, closer. A bead of sweat fell to the ground from his forehead. He spared a thought for Gwendolyn: about what their life might have been like had he not been drafted.\n\nThe machine was in range.

If you are apprehensive about touched up images being put in screenshot section of game, don't be. It looks exactly like it indicates it would. Also mechanics play out really nice,there's lot of freedom when it comes to construction of machines. Lack of proper tutorial can be the only factor that I consider to be against this game, i.e. it expects you to know the mechanics of how torque of rotors affects the flight pattern and so on. It would be nice if they included this information in game, not as a ready to build model or anything but some material explaining how various parts behave. Even if they don't there's going to be community made guides about this stuff, so not a deal breaker.\n\nMajor factor that's in favor is that it plays incredibly well for an alpha. Framerate drops when there's many blocks but it may also be due to my system not being powerful enough, it's on the minimum side of requirements.

I have messed around with this game a bit and I have to say: It's pretty great.  Not only does it allow you to lay siege upon medieval buildings and sheep, but it actually challenges you to "think outside the box".  For an early access game, it is worth every cent.  So far, bugs are minimal and gameplay is enjoyable.  The controls take some getting used to, but you will be constructing mobile destruction units in no time at all.  What's more, the implementation of realistic physics is astounding.  I'm an artillery-buff myself, so of course I treasure every moment  where I can utilize the CANNONS of Besiege!  I strongly suggest this game as a purchase and at very least a wishlist item.  PHYSICS! EXPLOSIONS! GORE! CANNONS! What more could you want as a repressed continental tyrant!

The building system is simple enough to pick up easily, but complex enough to be limitless. The 20 currently available levels are incredibly fun, with countless solutions, and the sandbox mode will entertain you between updates. It runs very smoothly, and the lighting engine is just milky and delicious. While sometimes it will skip frames calculating physics, there is an option to modify timespeed, so you can always adjust it to something more plausible. The community has come up with some crazy stuff, so you can just download other people's hard work when you're too lazy to think. And, you can release your "ingenious" garbage to the Workshop, only to be shot down by massively superior projects.

The game is not finished, there's a campaign but only about what looks like 1/4 of it is actually built.  So what does that mean?\n\nDo you buy a game like this to play a campaign?  Probably not.  You buy it for the physics sandbox and the fun you can have trying to make the damn things fly without crashing.\n\nSo, the campaign as it is, is fun, but over quick.\n\nThe great stuff is, there's an almost infinite number of ways to 'win' each mission depending on what you like to build, for example, one mission I think you're supposed to build a flying machine to kill birds, I couldn't figure out how to build one that'd work so I put a bladed windmill on a post and raised that in front of the oncoming birds and chopped them up, job's right.\n\nYou'll find this game will challenge your ingenuity, like what do you do when you need an angled piece of wood?\n\nThe not so great stuff is, it's short, not always intuitive and has a reasonably steep learning curve.  If you invest into it (plus there are already a lot of youtube tutorials) you'll be rewarded.\n\nIf you like to build, buy this game.

In your face, medievals!"\n\nI'm not at all far into the game but the satisfactions gained from each missions straightforwardly tells me that I simply like the game.\n\nThe first thing to point out is that the game has a very short tutorial at the start and it will expect you to do a bit self-learning by doing its earlier missions that are all catered for you to use various tools and weapons for your machine's design.\n\nUnlike plenty other games, this game doesn't require you to unlock a certain materials or weapons, rather everything was made available to you from the start and there is no currency in the game thus you are able to design your machine with maximum capabilities and resources. Upon knowing the available selection of materials and weapons and how they work, you are then left to your own creativity on how to accomplish a mission and it can be done in any way possible, only restricted by a maximum size of how large and wide your machine can be. Basically, this game does not have a high learning curve and it doesn't require anyone to master physics to enjoy it.\n\nThe game looks and runs brilliantly. The UI is simplistic enough and you won't have to go through much exploring to get used to it. You may need to get used to the camera's movement and control at the start but I assume that is the case for any games at all.

Worry not, for this is no bad thing. Besiege is an absolute delight to play. You are given a task to complete, and using a finite space and unlimited resources, you are to complete this task with whatever wacky contraction your humble brain can conjure up. It's a fantastic idea for a game, and it is done near flawlessly in Besiege. Its builder, rightfully so, is extremely in-depth too. Not to worry, though, you hardly need to be the captain of the Junior Architect Squad to be good at this game. I have little to no creative spark when it comes to builders, and I'm getting along just fine. The art direction might be my favourite part of this game, as sad as it is. As someone who adores unique art-styles, Besiege does it all. It has a simplistic, colourful vibe to it. The levels are akin to paint on a canvas; a vast white expanse with the goal variables on top. In a nutshell, it looks beautiful. This game is in Alpha, but my God is it polished. Everything is so refined that you can barely tell it's Early Access, even though the physics can get slightly janky. The drawback of the game being in Alpha, of course, is the lack of levels. One world containing fifteen levels and a sandbox mode is all that's present at the time of writing this review. However, these levels are challenging. The goals given to you get progressively more exigent as you slowly climb the stage selection. Which is good. Besiege is a game of trial & error, and you will have most fun when experimenting with different results; this is where the sandbox mode shines. You are given a skate park-esc stage and unlimited space to build... well, whatever you please. It's a lot of fun, but feels very empty. You can't do very much, bar build something. There are no soldiers to kill, nor structures to knock down, which is a shame. To conclude, Besiege is utterly brilliant. It's a game that screams creativity. If you're a fan of builders, you owe it to yourself to give this game a go.","July 19, 2015","true","4.4"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","42","44","3","1"

While you'll likely begin with a simple wooden go-cart covered in spikes/saws/drills/giant spinning blades, each level nudges you into building some new type of monstrosity, and oh, the monstrosities you shall create.  You'll build catapults, you'll build flying machines, you'll build things that look like medieval torture device carnival rides.  Your engineering failures will be massive and catastrophic, and just as much fun as the successes.\n\nThe range of weapons and mechanical pieces provide plenty of options without being redundant.  The mechanical bits (hinges, springs, joints, etc.) allow for an incredible amount of freedom in design (Tip: each activated piece can have both its parameters and hotkey reassigned - e.g. to give each of two opposing springs different elasticity and make them pull separately).  Everything functions smoothly, the physics engine is excellent, and the artistic design is (subjectively) very easy on the eyes.  The Early Access aspect appears to be mainly in content, with additional levels being added over time, but also making it an absolute steal for the price.","May 9, 2015","true","23.4"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","45","49","11","0"

Okay? Okay.\n\nThis game is amazing. Compared to other early access games, it is outstanding; the graphics are polished to perfection, the controls are incredibly user friendly, and it is simply a good game all around. That being said, I only have two complaints.\n\n1: There needs to be some other form of tutorial in which the game guides the user through making different types of machines, possibly even giving the player examples. I only got so much from the tips, and couldn't figure out how to build a plane whatsoever. Regardless, I made death machines. My concern is that unexperienced or close-minded players will begin playing, not understand, rage, and leave a bad review. So, yeah. Just a suggestion.\n\n2: There is not much content.

Actually, right now.\n\nWhy haven't you bought this game yet?!  It's like all the violence you always wanted out of your lego/erector kit, with none of the "What happened to the neighbors' RV and where is the lawnmower??"awkwardness.  Sorry, dad, I was actually aiming for the boat.\n\nThis is not a physical /simulation/ in the strictest sense, but I sure have burned and bombed and flown and driven and chopped and sliced and dropped and spun quite enough to be duly impressed with the engine.  Looking forward to the Unity 5 build!\n\nPROS!\n\n- Blow stuff up!\n- Drive over your enemies.\n- Slice through your enemies.\n- Whirr violently.\n- Crash and die in a fireball of glory from oversteering.\n- Flexibility and control, like Lego and Erector\n\nCONS?\n\n- Your imagination might not be awesome enough.  Start besieging and give it a workout!\n- Blow yourself up!  Over and over and over!  (may not be an actual con)\n- Early access, which is also not necessarily a con, just a warning that if you want to 'beat' the official content part of the game, it won't take too long.  But that's not why you're here, is it?  No, you're here for glory and blood, and likes and votes on your favorite online community.\n\nPROSE\n\nA couple details I've noticed - stacking motorized wheels in the same rotational direction compounds rotational velocity, and this is great fun for creating massive lift in a high-speed rotating wing.  If you're building a quad copter with proper rotors (vice the tiny flying screws), flip the opposite corner wheels and blades - the torsion in one direction from the NE/SW pair will offset that of the NW/SE pair and provide tons of lift for massive cargo capacity with a gentle lilt for airborne control.  And you can easily get enough kit into the legal bounding box to build a total Ipsilon conquerer.\n\nRemember, every action has an equal and opposite reaction, more or less.  That thing you're spinning is pushing forward against the mass to which is attached, which is likewise pulling backward, y'know, relatively.  Don't forget your swivel joints, and try not to rip yourself a new axle.\n\nGet used to using a keyboard!  Every control is assignable - imagine doing all these things: releasing bombs, firing cannons, moving forward/back/up/down/left/right, igniting/extinguishing flamethrowers, pulling springs, turning gears, steering, flapping, et cetera ad infinitum.  Now imagine doing them all in multiple sets.  Yeah, you're going to need all of the 101+ on that keyboard for your ulimate besiegery monster.\n\nI look forward to a standardized best-practice sort of control scheme from the community, similar to the WASD standard nowadays.\n\nMy wishlist -\n\nFluid dynamics - air, water, and fuel, with related containers, pumps, dispersion... volatility [daisy cutter, anyone?]\nMicro- and mega- parts, or adjustable (stepped) scale for existing parts.\nUse the standard bounding box for 'normal' difficulty, but add a larger size for 'medium' and larger still for 'easy', which would still allow level advancement (but forfeit street cred, you lamer).  Or a smaller box for 'hardcore' difficulty.\nPaint, Colors, Decals!\nThe moon and low gravity glory!\n\nI'm off now, to test out an idea with some sliders and create a proper DoomTrain.","April 13, 2015","true","282.6"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","93","39","42","21","2"

There is a wide variety of things to choose from and the ways you can build are very limitless so that creating things can be done with a lot of freedom, you can build huge moveable towers, seige engines, catapults and even flying machines!\n\nWhen it comes to the execution of your builds everything is physics based, your machines structure is affected by gravity and many other realistic factors, this allows you to apply common knowledge to your build and also makes it challenging and introduces this games aspect of experimentation. It is very enjoyable tweaking things around and making things work and at the same time it is quite hilarious watching some dumb builds fall over and sometimes explode. Destroying objects such as farm animals and players is quite hilarious, watching masses of bodies spinning in the air without limbs. God i'm weird. Destroying buildings is like knocking down a tower of playing blocks, and it's quite enjoyable to watch!\n\nThe game is quite small but it is definately worth the price, although the base of the game is small, it seems to be a game I would personally easily spend 50 hours on!","January 28, 2015","true","7.7"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","37","42","8","0"

It's one of the few non-broken steam greenlight/early access games.\n\nThe engine is beautiful and I'm really impressed by the visuals. It's a really nice toy-box kind of look that gives a kind of serenity to your slaughter. It also runs great and I have had no performance issues whatsoever. I haven't heard how it runs on low-end systems, however. I'd be interested to see it run on potato-like laptop to see if the minimum specs listed are truely accurate.\n\nThe building works well and personally I don't believe that there is anything they need to do to improve it. It's intuitive and works well. It's pretty clear what the parts do from the 1-2 word names that the parts have. I'm also assuming that there is going to be more parts added to the game as the alpha progresses.\n\nOverall the gameplay is fun and has replay value. A major concern of mine that the physics engine would be broken or glitchy turned out to not be true. Everything works how you would expect it to and the consistency of the engine makes troubleshooting your designs easy.\n\nMy first straight run took about 100 minutes. However, I am going to replay it many times to see just how ridiculous of contraptions I can make to complete the objectives.\n\nWith some really minor improvements and expansion to the content already present, as well as levels being added eventually, this is going to be an even better game than it is now. Well worth the $7. 8/10\n","January 29, 2015","true","3.8"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","29","30","3","0"

Though at the time of writing this review, the game does suffer from some minor problems due to it being early access. The game itself is fun, engaging, and challanging. It's a unique experience at full of replayability.\n\nThe objectives are simple enough. Currently you will either be asked to destroy something, move something, or go to something. The levels are also simple and clean, much like the (very attractive, though still simple) graphics. In fact, the entire game is only about 100 megs, which for a full 3d game with this much dynamic content, says a lot about how much the developer(s) care about keeping it efficient. The interface is a little bit more complicated, but only because of the inherint complexity of building things.\n\nAnd this is where the game really shines, with building things. There are only about 40 parts, at a guess, but with them you can build pretty much anything you set your mind to, so long as you aren't too ridiculous. Catapults and go-carts are only the tip of the iceburg. Build a machine gun! A helicopter! A transformer! The only limit is your imagination and you mechanical prowess. After beating all the currently available levels (about 15, at another guess), I had the urge to go play them again, but differently, and possibly with self-imposed challanges like 'no wheels'.\n\nI doubt that the game will give you hundreds of hours of playtime, but it will deliver nigh-unrivaled entertainment (and potentially, challange!) in a much more compact package than most games these days.\n\nThe only real problem I can see someone having is if they are extremely impatient and easily frustrated. A friend of mine who is a little impatient enjoys the game, but if you're the type who mashes buttons and yells at your computer, well, we don't need you, but you're probably on a console anyway.","February 14, 2015","true","28.3"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","35","40","10","1"

Also, it's a game where it would definitely benefit from having mod support, with community content flowing into it to keep it alive and kicking for a really, really long time. Worth the purchase?

The maps, the displays, UI, physics; just all beautiful.\n\nI had difficulty in the start because all my cannons would fire at once or my contraption would snap from tension and being to rigid and thats when I realized that this is not just some clicking simulation, no sir. You need to account for torque, being too rigid, weight, moveability, wheels snapping, key mapping, or even just being a big rubberband of wood and wires...\n\nOnce you have a stable block of wood that doesnt crumble or self destruct you can add some weapons like cannons or flamethrowers or spikes. Now you don't want all your cannons going off at once since its a one shot weapon so you'll have to change some key mapping for those. Oh right, lets not forget; every action there is reaction, so if you have a weapon on a flimsy limb the force can snap it off...\n\nSo after meddling with things maybe you want to head to sandbox (if you're not already there) and try building ballistas' or catapults, all capable with the handy dandy wire thingy that lets you quickly expand/contract it like a rubber band. Or there are these things called pistons that expand/contract themselves into smaller/larger blocks. There are so many possibilities right now it's crazy.\n\nTired of being on the ground? you can make a FREAKING AIRPLANE. No jokes.\n\nBeing an early access there are some bad things of course.\na) Trying to change item when building can spawn one at that spot of clicking instead of changing items (not often, mostly sandbox)\nb) The amount of levels is pretty slim but other continents are already laid out for future updates\nc) Enemies are slim variety; but as with (b) I'm expecting more as it progresses!\n\nUsually these early access games can cost you an arm and a leg but this one is pretty dirt cheap in comparison and is a ton of fun. If you reaaally don't want to scringe on $7ish and you ever see it on sale, you go buy the crap out of it.\n\nI'm expecting great things from this game; hopefully workshop compatibility, more items/enemies, gamemodes. I don't think I can stress this enough though, this is early access so its missing alot yes, there are a few minor problems yes, but is this still a great game currently? yes.\n\nI thoroughly am enjoying this game. 9.5/10","January 31, 2015","true","15.4"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","27","28","2","0"

Any comments here about bugs and design issues may have been corrected in an update after this Review has been posted.  Please consider the posting date before using this as a gauge on the quality of the title being looked at.\n\nA physics-based sandbox wherein users are encouraged to create their own war machines using a series of simple mechanical devices; Spiderling Studios' Besiege lets users' creativity run wild with how to be the most destructive and does so beautifully.\n\nWhile Early Access and Kickstarter began as a way for users to help shape the future of games it has quickly degraded into a way for developers to get a quick cash-in that leaves half-baked messes in end-users' laps.  Titles like Double Fine's Spacebase DF-9 and Broken Age are examples of how to take people's money and give them less than what they paid for in return.  Developers like Double Fine abandon games like Spacebase DF-9 only half completed and missing all the promised depth and challenge.  Besiege, by having promised little more than the ability to make your favourite doomsday device and giving a great deal of mechanics that users can use in any way, has already surpassed my expectations wildly.\n\nAt this stage in development Besiege has two game modes: Sandbox and Campaign.  Sandbox sets the player in a space filled with many things to destroy and interact with but no explicit goal.  Campaign however sets the player in a much smaller field with the need to build their war machine to fulfill a specific goal.  Players can be tasked with destroying a castle or village, navigating a minefield to reach a specific point, killing an army, or several things at once.\n\nJust as with Garry's Mod or the Kerbal Space Program, Besiege gives players the ability to do whatever they want and rewards them with an entertaining if not always expected result.  The Internet is already filled with screenshots by more creative users that show off flying cities, walking automatons, and dune buggies.  The limits of ones imagination are really the biggest thing in a player's way.\n\nSpinning bladed death platforms like in the BBC's Robot Wars television series are easy to make, sending streams of blood everywhere as soldiers are rend limb from virtual limb.  You can make ornithopters, helicopters, blimps - it is truly a wonder to find yourself creating a machine to drop a series of flamethrowing platforms on people.\n\nGraphically Besiege takes a light, cartoonish feel while at the same time providing pools, spurts, splashes and mists of blood when killing enemies and innocents via the games many weapons.  Fire and explosion effects give a pseudo-realistic spread and additional destruction that can help and hurt the player's plans.\n\nAnd then there is the physics.  Besiege's physics take my not entirely useless PC and make it grind to a halt at times.  The more complex you build your war machine, the slower the results will play out.  This of course will be improved by the team at Spiderling Studios as the game continues to grow and take shape, but it can be quite annoying now when you make your bomber rise into the air to drop its payload of flaming bombs and time begins to slow.\n\nDevelopers are presently looking to refine their physics and add more weapons and mechanics in addition to completing upcoming game modes like the heretofore mysterious Moon, which Spiderling Studios have yet to give concrete details on, but may end up with new physics and enemies to play with.  And where the current campaign mode is just a single continent they are working on an additional four campaigns in order to progress to global domination, and it would be great if with these new continents came new art styles and enemy behaviour.  Where the current continent campaign of Ipsilon is strictly European, perhaps Phi will end up Chinese, Persian, or Indian.  And it would be a nice way to spice up the game were the dev team to introduce a map maker and integrate Steam Workshop for sharing of challenges.  There is a world of potential that Spiderling can bring to the game.\n\nEven as a staunch opponent of Pre-ordering and Early Access purchases - by promising little and giving users a great many ways to do it Besiege has won me over.  If you want a quick laugh as you accidentally blow yourself up, or a challenging interactive puzzle game, you will not be disappointed with this Early Access title.  At 7 dollars, this game is a steal for any creative-types out there.","February 24, 2015","true","8.6"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","29","33","2","0"

I can't resist the demolition and bridge builder style of flash games, so I really couldn't help but get it. For $7.79 it's hard to say no anyways.\n\nThe game on a whole is very slick. The graphics are very smooth and easy on the eyes, minimalistic. but in such a way that looks very proffesional. The pictures on the store page look cinematic, something you wouldn't expect to find in the game, but it's almost the exact same in game, no added filters to glam it up, the game really does look good. You won't find pictures of it, but the in game menus are stunning, really clean and incredibly proffesional looking.\n\nThe gameplay is absurdly fun. You can do pretty much whatever you like and beat the level a hundred different ways. In one of the first levels you destory a small building. You can destory it with a few blocks and some wheels. Or you can create a trebuchet with 78 Cannons attached and 37 flame throwers. If that doesn't tickle your fancy you can make an plane loaded with half a dozen massive bombs and drop them over the tiny house, or just fly right into it.\n\nTonnes of fun, you can easily spend half an hour building just one machine.\n\nPros:\n\n-Cheap\n-Good graphics\n-Really fun\n-Good for a quick game\n-Good for long game\n-Can play a level over and over\n-Minimal bugs\n\nCons:\n-Not much for levels right now\n-Controls can sometimes feel a little weird\n-Could use a bit more variety in blocks\n-Still has some bugs (expected, usually hilarious)\n\nOverall, for an early access game, 9/10\n\nCompared to most early access, 11/10.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of stuff on the way, and a lot of it is also there as "Coming soon", so you can get idea of what is to come as well (like playing on the moon).","January 29, 2015","true","7.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","0"

The lag.\nThe lag is a problem due to many entities moving at once. This is not the greatest for low-end computers. I have a computer with 6GB of RAM and a 1GB GPU, and an iMac with 4GB of RAM and a 128MB GPU. They both run the game fine with small items, but builds with around 100+ blocks lag the computer and start decreasing the framerate dramatically. I would recommend a non-attatched entity remover built into the game. Cannonballs are an example for this. With one of the newer updates, we were intoduced to the Infinite Ammo option, allowing you to spam cannons. There are so many cannonballs not removed that it will start lagging the system trying to calculate all of those entities.\n\n2. Controls\nDon't get me wrong, but the controls are fine, but in some ways, they are sorta on the "eh" side. Placing braces or blocks are an example. The game will make it move to an undesired location, making you have to remove the block. (That's pretty much it for this.)\n\n3. Semi-glitchy Gameplay\nThe gameplay is amazing, and sometimes, the glitches are funny as hell, but shaking is something most of us with 30+ hours in the game have noticed. I have made creations that are amazing, and out of nowhere, it will start shaking insanely and throw the entire creation into pieces. I don't know why it happens, but it will need to be fixed in the future. It can get really annoying. Another way of glitching in Besiege is some blocks get caught on other blocks. I have only experienced this a few times, and it isn't that big of a deal, but when you are trying to fling a bomb at a tower and it explodes in your face, that can be a problem.\n\nAnyway, this is just a review in the Early Access time. In future updates, everything will more than likely be fixed. This is NOT to turn away people from buying this game, as it is an absolute rollercoaster of creativity at your fingertips. I would HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone with an extremely creative mind, such as myself.\n\n10/10. I will play this game until the end of time.","February 17","true","43.5"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","20","26","3","0"

It requires a lot of creativity and imagination. The game is very simple, yet very complex, as there are simple things like pistons, but with a unique mind, you could use them to create something like a rapid-firing cannon!  What I really love though, is that it costs way less than its worth.

Your noble sponsor grants you access to all the resources you will need to build machines beyond imagination and sanity. No-one of the royal court will object your decision to siege a castle using a helicopter-catapult and neither they will question the viability of placing a flamethrower next to a wooden beam within your own construction – you are the military engineer and as long as enemies keep falling, you shall be rewarded generously. I say generously, but I simply mean that you will not be seeing your head on a pike of your own bewitched machine, which, frankly enough, used to be quite a big thing for anyone who practiced science in the medieval times.\n\nThe game is relatively short at the moment, in fact it is extremely short, but there are promises to expand it significantly. Overall, it is still a nice and a simple game to enjoy in the evening at a price of your fancy Starbucks coffee drink. However, I do need to confess that I consume Starbucks coffee drinks on semi-regular basis, but no-one can judge me as for I am… THE (pronounce “e” as “i” in the word “this”) military engineer.","March 1, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","9","10","6","0"

But it's not the ammount of levels that matter in this game! It's the ammount of different machines and creation you can construct to pass those levels!\nYou won't get bored of playing the levels over and over again because they'll never be the same! Today you may build a catapult, tomorrow a hammer, the next day a freaking helicopter!!\n\nAll I have to say is, for this cheap, this game has more content and stuff to do than many other games out there that cost twice as much or more...\n\nNow, I'm no game critic nor am I quite the game connoisseur, but if someone asked me I'd rate the game as follows:\nGameplay: 8/10 - because if you don't put some effort and thinking into it, chance is, it'll be a simple and possibly clunky machine.\n\nDesgin: 9/10 - Actually I'm not giving a 10/10 because my 10 goes for reallistic graphics, but this is a different realm, and the style is amazing and I wouldn't change it a bit!\n\nLevel design: 8/10 - They're simple and straight forward. That's the best and the worst of it. I'd like to see some more intricate levels and I'd love to see community made maps (if that hasn't been implemented yet)\n\nCommunity creations: 10/10 - I love games where the community can share their work and this game allows it by letting people use others machines blueprint files, and it's as easy as copy pasta :P\nAnd believe me, I've seen some amazing creations. They're just incredible!\n\nLast, but definetly not least...\n\nFun: 8/10 - You can replay this game over and over again and you'll want to go back to it as soon as you close it!\n"But why just 8?", you might ask... Well... As mentioned above, you'll have to put time, effort, and thought into your creations, and TO ME, not being able to be objective in a game, makes it less fun at times - with this I mean I'M LAZY AND I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO THINK AND BUILD SOMETHING. It's not the game. It's me xD\n\n\nFinal score - 8/10 for all the above reasons.\nRemember, I'm not a game critic nor connoisseur. I'm just giving you my 2 cents and also remember that your experience and opinions may vary.\n\nLasly, I just want to say that this game is awesome, and you should buy it!

What's there is actually very solid, especially for an Early Access game. The visuals are beautiful, the gameplay is entertaining and well put together, and the whole thing is all quite fun......\n\n......for about 5 minutes.\n\nYou see, Besiege's biggest problem is that, well, there's just not a whole lot to do. Thanks to this being an Early Access game, there are only about 20 levels or so in the main "story" mode, with the devs promising to add more later on.\nAlmost all of these levels revolve around destroying something, with occasional breaks to grab something and deliver it somewhere, or get to a certain point in the map or whatever. While entertaning at first, these levels quickly become repetitive (at least for me) and lose their charm after the first few stages.\n\nYou can go to the sandbox and screw around with making ridiculous, absurd contraptions, but this also gets very dull very quickly.\n\nBottom line:    Besiege has all the trappings of a fantastic game. It is just brimming with potential, and IF the devs stick with it, it could become something truly special. For now, though, Besiege just doesn't have enough content. I would recommend waiting until they finish the game before you decide to buy it.\n\n*EDIT*\n\nSince this is an Early Access game, it is always updating and adding new content. Thus, as more and more stuff is added, this review becomes more and more outdated.\nHowever, I believe that my message still stands. Be wary and be smart. Besiege is simply too lacking in things to do at this point, and that will certainly change over time.\n\nOnce (or if) the game exits Early Access, I will re-review it.

The game's only constraints are the current number of block types available and the bounding lines for your creation (which can be shut off in sandbox mode.)\n\nMy only complaints for the game (still in alpha atm, of course):\n\nNumber one is the camera. It's horrible right now, forcing you to look at very odd angles to see something. A problem that is compounded when testing your contraption in combat. You can't zoom in on a certain point, but rather at the center point of the creation box.\n\nThe game can quickly bog down your computer on some levels, the framerate plummeting as an entire group of soldiers goes from alive to blood smear without the in-between animation.\n\nThe music, minor but still an issue, quickly gets annoying. It sounds like "No Particular Place To Go" and I can only take so much Chuck Berry when the same two lines of a song play through my head as I'm trying to kill. I'm sure it's just me and shows I'm only nitpicking as the mute button works just as well on here as it does on ads.\n\nOne thing that is worth noting is the lack of a tutorial. This game is fine with starting you out with nothing as the first few missions are only testing beds and have no risk but challenge you to add onto your initial creations. But a tutorial for basic designs (or starting with a few simple designs) would have been helpful. Learning what use a few blocks have or how to make the most of other blocks would be useful as well. Otherwise, there's always youtube and the trial and error process.\n\nThe graphics are wildly entertaining and makes me feel like I'm tearing through the glass villages my mother used to set up during the winter. Which actually makes it far more satisfying. Your creation has no limits at all to what you want to put on it, BUT keep in mind that weight is a huge part of this physics engine and your "liberator" can break apart under its own weight.\n\nThe only thing I'd say is that in its current state the price is on par for a large game. Meaning you are spending more on this than you would for a phone app of the same content. Worth the price but will only be giving you new stuff for about two hours upon which time you will need to replay missions with impractical contraptions. However, the main menu shows that LOTS of stuff is still planned for the future.","March 15, 2015","true","12.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Very simple controls and building, but you can do a lot with what it gives you. I was really impressed with the different interactions between the parts, There are a ton of different ways to approach each mission, and comparing and contrasting methods with my friends is the best part. I can't wait for more levels. Some things i would like to see for the future with this game:\n\n1. A Map Editor.  This would increase the life of the game indefinitely, because you could download and share maps. A good Map Editor would be amazing.\n\n2. Multiplayer. Either in sandbox mode or the above mentioned map editor if that's possilbe. Being able to load in multiple different machines would add a lot to the game. You could have races,  dog fights, tank fights, or anything. That would be the difference between a game that you can put 40 or 50 hours into and a game that you can put 300 hours into.\n\nThat being said, even without those features this game is great and I highly recommend it.","January 24","true","30.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I became pretty curious about this game, and thought: Why not?\nI am not disappointed about my purchase. Time flies by when building these machines. And the interesting thing is: you don't have to build a war machine in every level. Sometimes you just need to build a vehicle to complete a level. You can be creative in the things you build and how you want to complete the levels.\nAnd it is not always easy to build a good working machine. Sometimes you find out that the construction is not strong enough and the machine falls apart. Or maybe you find out that you had to use other weapons to destroy something.\n\nIf you just want to build machines without any limits and see how they work, you can play it in the sandbox mode, which gives you a lot more freedom.\n\nThe graphics are simple and cartoony, but they still look nice and pretty.  The UI is simple but also very clear. There are also a few tutorials about the very basics, but later you have to find out how you build something.\n\nAlthough this is an Early Access game, I think it is a good one so far. It is not finished yet, they add more building parts in updates.  And there is yet one zone with 16 levels to complete, but here are more to come in the future. And I am looking forward to the new levels to complete.\n\nMy rating for this game: 8/10.","March 11, 2015","true","5.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I absolutely love the look of it, the art direction is stellar and the developer really nailed a unique look that blends perfectly with the style of the game.\n\nThe gameplay consists of you utilizing a variety of pieces, parts and equipment to make unique and interesting machines and use those machines to complete objectives.\n\nThere is only 15 levels currently with the early access version, but they get the gameplay ideas across quite well. There is also some kind of sandbox mode, which I have yet to dip into but I imagine its just straight up building crazy ♥♥♥ devices with less restrictions.\n\nI build a lot of dumb things, and solved the puzzles in odd ways.

Then, when you hit "play", it's your job to fullfill a task given, for example killing sheep or warriors. Another common task is to destroy a building. That's pretty much the gameplay, nothing more to say. The longer you experiment, the more effectiv your builds become and the faster you can finish the level.\n9/10 by now, it's a hell lot of fun for a that simple game!\n\nParts:\nAs of yet, there are not that many parts in the game. However, I'm sure that more will be added soon, also, the little variety at the moment already makes for a large diversity of buildings/vehicles/...\n6/10 by now\n\nGraphics:\nI personally like the graphics, they're little details and it looks quite empty, but the important things are clearly visible. Additionally, the art-style of the game is very appealing to me. It looks identical to the screenshots on the official page and the Steam-page, so if you enjoy those you will enjoy the graphics ingame aswell. What I don't like, though, is that the focus is somehow strange, it's extremely blurry pretty much everywhere on the screen except for some little parts. I didn't find an option where to correct this, but I didn't spend much time in the option menu aswell, so this might aswell be able to being turned off.\n8/10, without the strange blurry effects it'd be a 10/10, subjectively\n\nLevels:\nThere aren't many as of yet, I finished the available ones in 2.3 hours, however, I experimented quite a bit already. I will surely put more time into the game, as I want to finish the levels better and more effective. You can somehow guess from the menu that the game will have around 6 times the content when it's finished, so roughly 15 hours I'd say. For 7€ at the moment this is quite good, others give away 30 minutes of DLC-content for 15€. Also, there's a sandbox mode soon, so there'll be loads of more content in the future, even without the devs working on more.\n4/10 by now\n\nAI:\nThe AI is simply doing what you think it'd do (except for sheeps). Normal villagers run around when they spot your vecicle, archers shoot arrows at you, the knights simply run for you and the sheep... they run directly into your vehicle or just walk around in a little area. Nothing more. If you have spikes on your vehicle you can pretty much enjoy them killing themselfs. :P\n11/10 for suicid-sheeps.","January 29, 2015","true","7.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'll try to make this to the point and cover the things that matter to someone considering buying.\n\nSimply put, you're given a square space and an unlimited supply of different modular parts to build a vehicle capable of accomplishing a given task depending on which island/mission you're on.\n\nGameplay overall is solid as could be for an early access game. It generally bodes well when an early access alpha's architecture is as well put together as this one is. 9/10.\n\nThe building system is good, I'd say 8.5/10.\n\nNumber of blocks and parts is also very good for the tasks they give you. Easily 9/10 for parts.\n\nMission variety as of this date 5/25/2015 is not great. I beat this game in a single sitdown of an hour and a half before the update, and another hour and a half for the new missions. Luckily since this game is still early access we can at least hope for greater mission variety in some future updates. But as of right now, I'm going to say 4/10.\n\nSound/Music quality is inconsequential at this point as there is no music and what sound effects are in the game are more atmospheric than anything else. Sure, cannons make a shooting noise or bombs blow up, but there really is no reason to try and check this aspect at this early a stage of this game's development.

It does have its bugs and occasionally clunky UI but it is a beautiful sandbox game with real potential. Besiege sparks the imagination to conjure weird, bizarre and wonderful creations that somehow manage to kill all of those suicidal sheep.

However, I decided to give it a shot just because I am a sucker for physics, building, and medieval genres. Besiege is on the path to be one of the best simulators on Steam.\n\nThe goal is simple; complete the objective by any means you wish. The tools are quite versatile and allow you to go as far out as you want with your creations. Another dynamic aspect to the game is the physics engine. You could build the most awesome machine but every moment of force is calculated. Even just pulling too hard on your catapult and the whole thing might shatter into wooden bits. Watching shrapnel fly around and bodies ran from the sky will billows of smoke and fire is just purely satisfying.\n\nAs of this review (2/10/2015), there is only one world available (a collection of levels) and a free building mode. There are quite a few worlds and modes that are listed as "coming soon". So hopefully we see further development of this title. 7$ is more than fair for what is available right now but I would pay even more money for a game full of levels, challenges, environments etc. Basically, the foundation as been laid out so well that as long as they continue to produce content, this game will be one of the top indie games of 2015.\n\nBut as of now, considering how well polished the game is (I mean, just look at dem grafeeks), the intelligence of the physics engine, and the great tools, it's definitely worth a purchase.","February 10, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's 1 and bit islands to conquer, plus a sandbox mode for all your demolition needs. I haven't encountered any bugs (yet), so I think most updates will be content over bugfixes.\n\nWhile Besiege relies on player discovery for making things, I think a tutorial or some hints wouldn't go amiss, for concepts such as flight.\n\nBut like I said, it's Early Access, so there's still work to be done. But what's here is already very well put together and is perfectly playable.

However, I decided to give it a shot just because I am a sucker for physics, building, and medieval genres. Besiege is on the path to be one of the best simulators on Steam.\n\nThe goal is simple; complete the objective by any means you wish. The tools are quite versatile and allow you to go as far out as you want with your creations. Another dynamic aspect to the game is the physics engine. You could build the most awesome machine but every moment of force is calculated. Even just pulling too hard on your catapult and the whole thing might shatter into wooden bits. Watching shrapnel fly around and bodies ran from the sky will billows of smoke and fire is just purely satisfying.\n\nAs of this review (2/10/2015), there is only one world available (a collection of levels) and a free building mode. There are quite a few worlds and modes that are listed as "coming soon". So hopefully we see further development of this title. 7$ is more than fair for what is available right now but I would pay even more money for a game full of levels, challenges, environments etc. Basically, the foundation as been laid out so well that as long as they continue to produce content, this game will be one of the top indie games of 2015.\n\nBut as of now, considering how well polished the game is (I mean, just look at dem grafeeks), the intelligence of the physics engine, and the great tools, it's definitely worth a purchase.","February 10, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a great little building game where the objective is (usually) to smash enemy castles and armies to pieces with a siege machine of your own making. The game also mixes up the missions you do, so you may have to make a crane to collect resources and deliver it somewhere or torch a flock of seagulls. This adds a little spice to the flavour of the game.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of Garry's mod - but with objectives. That is a huge plus in my book. Add multiplayer to this and it could well be one of the best games of all time. The price tag is also very welcoming for an EA title - too many devs these days are pricing their games over £15 for EA, which is a huge gamble for a game that is not finished.\n\nBesiege is also fairly bug free and plays very well. It looks and feels very polished for an Early Access game.\n\nAll-in-all, this is definitely worthy of your time and I look forward to future developments. This is Early Access done right and I wish there was more like this on Steam.\n\nJimbo Rating: 8/10","June 23, 2015","true","6.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

An in built video editor: The trailer for Beseige is one of the best that I have seen in a long time, but not everyone can make their videos that good, my first idea is an in built video editor which allows you to record clips and then edit them with music and such. (Basically like Rockstar video editor, but for Beseige)\n2. Multiplayer building mode: Get players to build a machine for a set task or fight, and them place them in an arena for the worlds most insane fights\n3. Brakes: One thing that annoys me a tad about Beseige is the fact that when you stop moving a wheel it keeps on spinning, an item that could be used to prevent this could be an item such as a Brake, it would work by attaching it to the side of a wheel and pressing a keybind to activate it, when the keybind is pressed the wheel or gear that it is attached to will stop completely.\n\nSo just to reiterate these are some personal ideas, and the game is epic!","May 23, 2015","true","7.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Far more fun, and is sheer catnip for creativity. It's probably the first game that made me use the same thrust pods found on a LEM in order to create a precision XYZ control method for a stable floating platform with detable weapons packages. The fact that I just typed this should be reason enough to fork over some support money now and reward the duo responsible to finish what is probably the tightest most finished Alpha ever.\n\nIt's what RUST aspires to be - and can't - because RUST isn't fun. This is fun. This is insanely polished (the rough edges being some lag for massive machines and some levels - but we're talking optimization - not show-stoppers).

But if you ask me i can see lots of potential in the game .\n\nwhy you will as ? well let me explaine-Because it does something not many games even dare to do in our days , is make a game where you need to think and use your Imagination.\nSadly in our days most of the games are based on simple rules or maybe not even a single rule , leaving you just looking at the screen and clicking.\nAnd besiege is not one of those games. Besiege has no real tutorial as you get into the game. So its your duty to figure out how to play. But don't worry its not just trows you into the water and says swim ****! No its starts slowly with an easy task and slowly moves to bigger and harder challenges.\n\nRight now as its in alpha its not much contant, yes .\nbut as i said its only alpha so meaning lots of contant will be added in the near future. And already you can see whats the map size is going to be and what the devs are working on and (hell know how many levels every piece of land contains).\nPlus for the price tag of 6.99$ you can't really complain , and the replay ability is huge.\nAnd if you're still scared picking this game up just because its in "alpha" and its "100% full of bugs and all those things" forget about it. As long as i have played there are no bugs at all, yes im pretty sure its not gonna be some bugs here and there. But even if you find some they are so little and unnoticeable at first you would not even care.\nSo if you ask me the game is in alpha just because its really not that much contant, but even now its lots of what you can do.\n\nSo if you ever had an idea of picking up Besiege go for it 100% i think its a wonderful game and its for sure deserves your attention.\nThank you for reading my review and peace ! <3","February 6, 2015","true","39.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's, as you can probably already tell, a medieval-styled Crazy Machines with unlimited parts and well... medieval objectives.\n\nWhy settle with a Trebuchet though if you can take to the skies in a Da-Vinci-like flying machine just to rain down fire on the enemy? Build a giant chariot with sawblades like in the trailer and watch your foes crumble and be gored to perfection, and if there is any true siege work on castles to be done, you can always deliver explosives right to the enemy's doorstep. How? Your way!\n\nBe wary of your amazing contraption taking fire though, those cannons and blades are going to be hard to use when your machine falls apart into ashes. Armour provides proof against hazards like oil pots, arrow fire and gouts of flames, but with the main part of your contraption made of reinforced plywood and medieval acceleration at it's finest/weakest, it's going to slow you down quite a bit.\n\nThe Scenatios only restrict you in how big your vehicle/tower/plane/gun platform/glider/paradropper or hybrid can be and if you already completed a level, you can switch off this restriction at any point for unlimited siegecraft.\n\nI also must say that the game is very hardware-friendly and performs well for a freeform physics sandbox. Add to all that the spectacle on which you are probably most likely (I hope so for you) is served at an absolute bargain price and getting updated regularly, I only have one question to ask to you, dear reader:\n\nWhy are you NOT playing this game right now?","February 20, 2015","true","23.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have a selection of blocks that behave in certain ways, then you have fairly open ended puzzle levels which call on you to construct a slapdash/rickety/barely effective and dangerous looking contraption.\n\nThe graphics and UI are nicely stylised and they have really done an amazing job at making the building process intuitive, and in that I mean that if this was implemented badly the building process would go from quick and pleasurable to arduous and unpleasant. Immediate comparisons can be drawn with Kerbal Space Program which I also love, though I would say that this game has more polish and I find myself hitting the 'undo' a lot less with this very well laid out and implemented UI.\n\nWhile this game is in early access it is not a buggy piece of S*&^T but essentially a release ready game that just has a limited feature set. I already feel that I have got my money's worth out of this and there are still additional levels and content to be added.\n\nThis game does what it says on the tin, and it does it well. To return to the negative point mentioned in many other user reviews of a lack of tutorial however.... I really think this is unecessary, the lack of a tutorial is part of what I liked about this game, it is about trial and error....'I wonder what this thing does?' you add it, push space, and see what it does, your contraption ineviteably blows up, press space, make modification, press space, test, repeat, PROFIT.\n\nAll of my catapults use steering hinges, when I push left, the catapult arm raises, if my catapult also requires steering, when I'm moving and turn left, the catapult arm raises, often an unwanted result.  BUT IT IS PART OF THE CHARM! Half the puzzle is figuring out how best to implement the pieces at your disposal, a tutorial will just end up giving you preconcieved notions in that area, it is more fun to end up with a whole lot of half-♥♥♥♥♥, barely working deathmachines as opposed to slick and boring, 'correctly' put together deathmachines (less hillarious mishaps and explosions for one thing).\n\nIn summation.\n\nBuy it, enjoy figuring out how things work, and then determine exactly HOW many bombs you can launch at one time....\n\n$7 well spent....","February 8, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Thus far I've built a siege-worthy lawn mower, equipped with a bomb launcher, naturally; a Da Vinci-style aircraft capable of destroying castles from the air; ballistas and siege-engines galore; planes, tanks, and assorted little instruments of doom.\n\nThis may still be early alpha, but it already feels polished enough to be a full - if small - game. The only thing I want from it right now are more levels to conquer, and maybe more parts. If all a game leaves you wanting is more, that's probably a good thing.\n\nIt won't take long to finish at this stage, but it's a real blast for the time you spend.","February 9, 2015","true","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For now It makes up for these short comings for being just fun and imaginative. Even with its limited set of tools (which they have been adding to) you can pull off some interesting and wild contructions.\n\nThe art style is clean, cute and has a board game feel to it. The physics are fun and feel spot on. If you are willing to deal with the possible headaches that come with a early access title, and enjoy games such as space engineers and other forms of building block games, you should get a kick out of this.

There are no options in switching controls, or how to navigate the camera, so you're just stuck with whatever settings they give you. While this didn't ruin the game for me, it did make certain aspects more difficult to enjoy; especially when you're driving your craft, trying to blow up that citadel, and then the camera never moves, so you're stuck right-clicking, using the arrow keys, and attempting to press 'Y' at the same time.","February 14, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played through the entire campaign & messed around in sandbox mode. I’ve spent a total of about six hours in game which equates to about a dollar an hour for its current price; however, when they release more content I’d hope they increase the price as the developer really deserves the money.\nEven if development was to completely halt and future progress was not guaranteed it’s still worth buying in its current state.\nAnyone that says it doesn’t contain enough content for the price is a fool. It costs about the same as a standard DLC for other games and equates to about the same length of playability before it gets boring.\nThe only real issues I had was I felt like the driving of the siege engine could have been improved (however it’s still fantastic as it is), and sometimes the camera / object placement could be a little janky.\nIt’s important to note that if you want to get your money’s worth (which in my opinion is about 6-7 hours) don’t just rush through the levels… take your time and enjoy them, see what crazy contraptions you can build to achieve your goals.","February 13, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's, as you can probably already tell, a medieval-styled Crazy Machines with unlimited parts and well... medieval objectives.\n\nWhy settle with a Trebuchet though if you can take to the skies in a Da-Vinci-like flying machine just to rain down fire on the enemy? Build a giant chariot with sawblades like in the trailer and watch your foes crumble and be gored to perfection, and if there is any true siege work on castles to be done, you can always deliver explosives right to the enemy's doorstep. How? Your way!\n\nBe wary of your amazing contraption taking fire though, those cannons and blades are going to be hard to use when your machine falls apart into ashes. Armour provides proof against hazards like oil pots, arrow fire and gouts of flames, but with the main part of your contraption made of reinforced plywood and medieval acceleration at it's finest/weakest, it's going to slow you down quite a bit.\n\nThe Scenatios only restrict you in how big your vehicle/tower/plane/gun platform/glider/paradropper or hybrid can be and if you already completed a level, you can switch off this restriction at any point for unlimited siegecraft.\n\nI also must say that the game is very hardware-friendly and performs well for a freeform physics sandbox. Add to all that the spectacle on which you are probably most likely (I hope so for you) is served at an absolute bargain price and getting updated regularly, I only have one question to ask to you, dear reader:\n\nWhy are you NOT playing this game right now?","February 20, 2015","true","23.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There already are a lot of possible ways to construct deadly machines which means that even if you managed to succeed in an area you can try to approach it a bit differently. Plus it can also mean a lot of fun if your construction terribly fails :).\n\nSo although this is just version 0.05 - you can actually spend a couple of hours having fun with it and experiment with new constructions.

It doesn't have masses of content, but all of the content that is there is polished very masterfully.  It is a game based around building siege engines of amazingness, doom and destruction. Of course they have to be functional and not break. As of the time of writing this review, you only have the Isle of Ipsilon levels and the Sandbox, but they are plenty to sustain as the creation of machines is addictive and amazingly intricate things can be created. In the levels you are given a simple goal and you need to build a machine to wreck that puny little foolish goal under your timeline breaking wizard building powers! There is a limited area to build in and there is a fairly small ammount of bits to built from at the time of writing, but those parts are so versatile that a person with a good imagination and skill/experience can build many, many different fun and interesting machines. In any level, or the sandbox, you can remove the building limitation and build massive, insane things. All the content is polished, the game is addictive as hell.

So I bought this in it's earliest form, so I could eventually enjoy all of the content at the cheapest price. And to be honest, I was surprised by how robust this V0.04 alpha already is. The mechanics feel very near completion. My only problem is the lack of actual levels, but for 7 bucks this game is worth your money. And if they deliver upon their promises this game will eventually be worth way more than the 7 bucks you paid for it.\n\nIf you're into building vehicles with physics and driving them around, this game's just the best there is.

Every stage can be completed in a multitude of different ways, as long as you complete the required objective(s). This game is open from start to finish, you dont have to beat every stage to unlock certain parts, cheats, or any feature, You can even disable the box which limits how big your creation can be, and where it spawns (this ofcourse prevents level progression, but all the levels are already unlocked for you). There are quite a few parts, ranging from construction bits, to mechanical moving parts, and weapons. You can build anything from a medieval tank, a catapult, and even a giant walking death robot with the right skill and parts.\n\nYou dont need a NASA gaming computer to run this game (however it does help if you build absurdly large creations with tons of moving parts), and for only $6.99 this game is excellent. There are few to no game breaking bugs that I can think of or have encountered, and the game runs very smooth. If you dont know what to buy, and have 7 dollars, pick this game up, its great.","July 2, 2015","true","32.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics and models are easy on the eyes, the music is serene, and the physics are pretty darned realistic.  My only complaint is the lack of a tutorial, which is significant considering the learning curve.  I admit that I did partially have fun failing in the creations I made, but I also found myself frustrated at times because I couldn't figure out how certain parts worked together.  I'm hoping to see some sort of in-game video tutorial showing first-time players how most of these parts function as a whole.  For now, I'll be consulting Wikis and YouTube videos.  Considering the price however, I'd say that $6.99 is a great deal for what you're getting here.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfStN6pWhgE","March 2, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I bought this in it's earliest form, so I could eventually enjoy all of the content at the cheapest price. And to be honest, I was surprised by how robust this V0.04 alpha already is. The mechanics feel very near completion. My only problem is the lack of actual levels, but for 7 bucks this game is worth your money. And if they deliver upon their promises this game will eventually be worth way more than the 7 bucks you paid for it.\n\nIf you're into building vehicles with physics and driving them around, this game's just the best there is. Even at this stage it's a blast, and that's at version 0.04.

Despite not having very many levels at this point in early access, the existing ones are diverse and fun to replay. The physics are simulated well and the game looks very nice, with a kind of "vignette" effect. The tutorial is sparse, but the UI is simple and easy to understand (and looks GREAT!) so you can tinker around freely and get a feel for how each part works within an hour or so of gameplay. Since it's a very open-ended game you really have to think about how to complete the objectives, so you'll pass through the levels only as fast as you can engineer working machines.

It's one of those games that you spend an hour on, but realize it's been 3 hours, it's just so entertaining. Levels have a lot of variation and are pretty satisfying to complete. The graphics are very appealing and have a nice mixture of cartoon and reaistic looking stuff. The physics is generally pretty top notch, although it's a bit glitchy at times, but what game isn't? It would be nice if the collision on objects could just be touched up a bit, but it's really no big deal, barely effects the majority of gameplay. Looking forward to future updates for more levels and stuff.\n\nOVERALL: I'd give it a 7/10 right now, but it looks like that's going to eventually be a 10 in future updates, considering the most recent one was so good.

I mean, I light them on fire and/or take out half of them, and they just keep shooting arrows, with little to no effect (while they are burning!).  As for building, I have yet to figure out how to fly, but what I have done on the ground has been some of the most amusing time I have spent in a game in a while.  My best creation at the time of writing this has 5 cannons, 2 flame throwers, 10 blades attached to it's weels, and a giant launcher that shoots a flaming boulder.  The one thing this game could use (aside from more levels/level editor/better sandbox/more parts) is Steam Workshop support.

I decided to splurge. In my country with terrible exhcange rates even 7 bucks amounts to 130 times that amount. Which is a lot. But holy cow 7 bucks well spent. This game is extremely good looking. It is absolutely fantastic. The building is so simple and easy to understand, but the physics is realistic enough to frustrate you and force you to build realistic machines. Don't get me even started on the aesthetics. Dang this game is beautiful. Sometimes I just look at it. Its just nice to look at. Anyway buy this game if you like fun.

It can get very frustrating, just like for me. I tried playing it casually, thinking that it was going to be a simple, yet challenging game. Needless to say, out of probably a hundred different vehicles; twenty of them didn't completely fall apart as the game started.

Building siege weapons is easy enough even for someone not bless with engineering skills. Though if you think that you can build something that turns and moves quickly and gently - think again. Its more or less "cow on a roller-blades" situation with everything you are going to build.\n\nFlying... doesn't really work. I've tried different ways to build flying mechanisms and all of them cannot be controlled for more than 3 seconds before falling down and breaking into pieces.\n\nAt the moment there's nothing really to do here. First island can be finished in under 30 minutes, a lot of the sounds are missing, there barely any music, very few parts and enemies as well. The sandbox is fun for exactly 10 minutes before you realize that you pretty much tried everything you could to build something amazing and failed miserably.\n\nSo... yeah - it has potential but right now its barren. Though i suppose that the small price is its redeeming quality. You can buy it if you are prepared to wait for whatever amount of time it takes the developers to finish it.","February 5, 2015","true","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Bikes sometimes. Vehicles that moved, and I would come up with all these little mechanisms for them that surely wouldn't work.\n\nAnd now Besiege has come along and I'm doing it all over again.\n\nThe thing that makes this such a great Early Access game is the content and the price. It's currently in active development, not even close to complete, and the content that I have right now is fully worth the $7 price tag to me. The experimentation is simply so joyous. In the few hours I've played so far, I never take the time to fully think my ideas through. I throw them out there, see what works, see what doesn't, and keep adapting them until I have exactly what I want. It's great fun to play with friends around too, as group idea sessions are the best kind of idea sessions.\n\nAny negatives? Obviously early access and unfinished, but again, worthy content already, My only qualm is the guilt I feel when I accidentally murder an innocent sheep, but I'm quickly becoming numb.\n\nDefinitely recommended.","February 24, 2015","true","14.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","3"

It's like lego on steriods. It is such a simple game but allows you to be so creative in making some really unique, interesting, complex, hilarious, and disasterous machines. It is also such a beautiful game, very well done art style, love the look of the game.\n\nI can't wait for some more advanced scenarios, really look forward to solving some very hard puzzles that require some serious design thought. I mean what's currently in the game is nice and sandboxy and does a good job acquanting the player to how the game works, but some I'm eager to see some seriously advanced scenarios.\n\nAlso, if this game had a multiplayer system to pit multiple players machines against each other in a battle bot style scenario I would be just about the happiest camper in the world.\n\nLove this game, my kudos to the devs/designers.

You start out with the siege engine you made during the last level and if it doesn't work, you can either alter it or start fresh. Really great game. Very unique and gorgeous graphics. My only real critique of this game is that camera controls are a little confusing starting out and it's not initially clear how all of the driving/flying parts work.\n\nI'd give this game a strong 8.5/10. 10/10 if they include a tutorial.

It worked fine, but by the time I got to the fourth level, I needed some protection and a way to dispatch the wall in front of me.  So, I countered that wall with a wall of my own, covered in armor plates and cannons.  When I fired it, it blasted the opposing wall apart and was sent flying backwards from the recoil and rolled (surprisingly harmlessly) over my vehicle, which I then drove around the flaming wreckage of the wall to destroy the rest of everything.  When I got to the iron stealing level, I dropped the vehicle entirely and went with a cannon turret which knocked the ore balls into the target zone from afar.  Since then, I've mostly been trying to find ways to complete every objective with pretty much cannons only.  What I'm saying is, buy this game and use cannons for everything.","February 3, 2015","true","69.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I was hooked on various drugs until they could no longer please me, so I would move to more intense, more addictive drugs. I ended up with a crippling heroin addiction. Luckily, my wife and family were there to support me and try to get me back on track.  They put me through therapy, but I just couldn't put down the needle. My therapist suggested I find a hobby that could keep my mind off of the drugs, but every hobby I tried just couldn't supersede the addiction heroin. That is, until I found this game. Since beginning to play this game, heroin has never crossed my mind. The addiction I feel for this game has completely obliterated the addiction level I had for heroin. I never thought it was possible, but since purchasing this game, my life has gotten far worse.  My addiction to this game took everything from me. My wife, my house, my kids. Everything. So if you're looking at this game and deciding whether or not to purchase it, consider your life as it is now.  Because once you purchase this game, you can't go back.

Is there a possibiltiy of multiplayer? Putting my machines against a friends would be fun to do. Or have team games to make it a lot more tense. Another idea I have is to allow players to create castles with pre-built walls/towers/gates/other, then submit them for friends and other players to try and destroy. This could be real time with both players trying to destroy or protect an objective within a time limit or maybe just have the castle pre-made by a player for them to try and destroy within a time limit.","February 24, 2015","true","34.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even if they didn't I would be happy knowing I spent $7 on it. There are some serious lag problems when your machine gets very complicated, but I found you just have to adjust your design to work around it.

If they finish the game using design which is this good, it's going to be great. Even with a relatively limited amount of building blocks, you can build really nice machines, since the blocks are well chosen. They will probably add more, but even like this, it is a good compromise between having a compact set of blocks (so that they are easy to remember and find) and a lot of building options. Also, since you can define which keys control each block, you can even do things like differential tank-like steering, where you control wheels on each side separately, allowing you to turn on the spot.","February 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you wanna make a longer arm for your catapult, you have to delete the whole thing and build it again instead of just making it longer. But that will come, I'm sure.

I can build a very serious catapult or trebuchet and spend and hour fine tunning it, or I can build a giant, 20x20 mat of bombs just for the heck of it. I've done both. A game that, for a very low price, allows you to do whatever you want (as long as you have enough braces!) and watch it work beautifully or fail fantastically and have fun the entire time is a game that should be up there with the greates. I just hope, niet, pray that the developers keep it simple and open as it currently is and that they do not give in to greed and pressure like other indie games.

You can build your own war machines in a medieval landscape. The levels that are out now include building a machine to slay soldiers, destroying castles and even slaughter sheep.\n\n+ Your imagination is the limit. Flying machines, tanks, and even simple catapults, it's all there.\n+ The challenges are quite nice. They try and have you create different contraptions for each level, so the building will not get boring quickly.\n+ It's still in development, but the game is almost bugfree. I am yet to encounter one myself, and I find that quite the accomplishment for it being alpha.\n\n- If they don't come up with many different types of levels and challenges the game might get repetitive. This is not yet the case, but you can never be sure.\n- The tooltips ingame don't help you make use of every single tool. The items themselves have good tooltips, but some of the universal tools don't get enough explanation during the game. For a few of the tools I had to watch youtube videos.\n\nOnce again, I'm very excited to see this game on Steam. Having followed this game for quite a while now I'm happy to see the popularity.

It's like lego on steriods. It is such a simple game but allows you to be so creative in making some really unique, interesting, complex, hilarious, and disasterous machines. It is also such a beautiful game, very well done art style, love the look of the game.\n\nI can't wait for some more advanced scenarios, really look forward to solving some very hard puzzles that require some serious design thought. I mean what's currently in the game is nice and sandboxy and does a good job acquanting the player to how the game works, but some I'm eager to see some seriously advanced scenarios.\n\nAlso, if this game had a multiplayer system to pit multiple players machines against each other in a battle bot style scenario I would be just about the happiest camper in the world.\n\nLove this game, my kudos to the devs/designers.

You start out with the siege engine you made during the last level and if it doesn't work, you can either alter it or start fresh. Really great game. Very unique and gorgeous graphics. My only real critique of this game is that camera controls are a little confusing starting out and it's not initially clear how all of the driving/flying parts work.\n\nI'd give this game a strong 8.5/10. 10/10 if they include a tutorial.

It worked fine, but by the time I got to the fourth level, I needed some protection and a way to dispatch the wall in front of me.  So, I countered that wall with a wall of my own, covered in armor plates and cannons.  When I fired it, it blasted the opposing wall apart and was sent flying backwards from the recoil and rolled (surprisingly harmlessly) over my vehicle, which I then drove around the flaming wreckage of the wall to destroy the rest of everything.  When I got to the iron stealing level, I dropped the vehicle entirely and went with a cannon turret which knocked the ore balls into the target zone from afar.  Since then, I've mostly been trying to find ways to complete every objective with pretty much cannons only.  What I'm saying is, buy this game and use cannons for everything.","February 3, 2015","true","69.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It is easy to construct a basic working siege engine in a few minutes though more time and experimentation is rewarded as the simulation and construction tools allow you to create everything from basic catapults to walking/flying/transforming death machines.\n\nThe only thing that could be said to be missing at this point is a suite of puzzles/challenges commensurate to the tools you are given.  The current puzzle set serves as a good basic tutorial but does not offer much challenge on its own.   Once beaten, the available levels and the sandbox mode mostly serve as testing grounds in which to play around with building even more insane creations.  There are many more levels in development, but if sandbox construction doesn't sound like your thing it might make sense to hold off until the rest of the levels are completed.\n\nEven at this early stage it is worth the price of admission; if you do not tend to buy early access titles then keep an eye on this one as it is sure to be even more impressive at launch.    While the devs are still adding more features at this point and have yet to add most of the pre-built challenge levels, there's still enough here to provide several hours of great entertainment already - if you enjoy making giant dancing robots who tear themselves to pieces as they crush medieval villages under foot.","February 25, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The DoF is used very well, as is the vignette and everything else to give it a very 'crisp' and 'smooth' feel.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fairly simple, but with tons of possibilities. Each level can be solved in a multitude of ways, and that's just assuming you actually want to solve it and not make a trebuchet that fires smaller catapults with flamethrowers on them.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that it has very few levels so far, but it's quite obvious that the developer plans to add a lot more, so take that with a grain of salt. I'm not sure if it's planned, but a level creator would be very advantageous in this game, because even with the dev releasing more levels there'll still be a demand for more, and given how most levels are constructed I can see a simple level editor being quite easy to use.\n\n10/10 would fire a flamethrower catapult out of a trebuchet again.","February 4, 2015","true","32.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This, for once, is a game that isn't a rip-off on early access and I hope people will contribute to making it a real winner.","February 8, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even if they didn't I would be happy knowing I spent $7 on it. There are some serious lag problems when your machine gets very complicated, but I found you just have to adjust your design to work around it. I'd LOVE for them to add Joystick support and maybe even an advanced mode where you can change even more properties (hinge friction, weight of blocks, etc.) All in all it is a great game and part of that is its simplicity.","February 9, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If they finish the game using design which is this good, it's going to be great. Even with a relatively limited amount of building blocks, you can build really nice machines, since the blocks are well chosen. They will probably add more, but even like this, it is a good compromise between having a compact set of blocks (so that they are easy to remember and find) and a lot of building options. Also, since you can define which keys control each block, you can even do things like differential tank-like steering, where you control wheels on each side separately, allowing you to turn on the spot.","February 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gorgeous graphics and artstyle. Nice looking minimalistic interface (maybe a little too minimalistic). Right now, the game sorely lacks the ability to move segments of the machine independently from each other. If you wanna make a longer arm for your catapult, you have to delete the whole thing and build it again instead of just making it longer. But that will come, I'm sure. I just hope the development will be rapid and will lead to a finished product, which is far too uncommon for early access games, unfortunately.","February 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Running it on a not terrible but not gaming worthy laptop with a i7 and 4400 integrated graphics, I have to really try to make the game lag. I love the openness of the game too. I can build a very serious catapult or trebuchet and spend and hour fine tunning it, or I can build a giant, 20x20 mat of bombs just for the heck of it. I've done both. A game that, for a very low price, allows you to do whatever you want (as long as you have enough braces!) and watch it work beautifully or fail fantastically and have fun the entire time is a game that should be up there with the greates. I just hope, niet, pray that the developers keep it simple and open as it currently is and that they do not give in to greed and pressure like other indie games.

The current accessible continent is a good tutorial with some simple objectives using the items avaliable. On each level you can use all the blocks for building a seige engine with various weapons for the situation.\n\nI really like the look of this game, the plain white back ground with the scenery surrounding the objective colourful and interesting to look at. The textures and graphics are very good and i have no noticed any bugs or missing textures for objects. The camera controls are good but would like to be able to move the pan controls to the number pad!\n\nThe basic physics and mechanics work well and are totally usuable now to build some mad devices of destruction. I found the framerate dropping when using large structures (over 200 blocks I believe) but most of the time it barely faultered. I hope to see more of the levels using what can be seen in Sandbox mode to add more challenge.\n\nI have to say for an early access this is very promising and will be very interested in what happens with each update and what will happen when the modding community gets going.

It plays solidly, and is very polished (for an alpha). I have noticed no game breaking bugs thus far, and the only serious inconvenience comes in the form of chugging with more complex structures. The camera controls could also use some work (there is no veritcal movement, just horizontal). So with only two minor problems I've noticed, plus a good deal of polish, I'd say that it's worth the low price as is. It reminds me a lot of Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts.\n\nThere's still a lot of potential, and I hope they fully explore it. I have the feeling that they'll change the way supports work, but right now they're really convenient, and I hope they don't. The game is a sandbox, so your creativity is only limited by what tools they put in place. I'm hoping they'll give us magical blocks or weapons, such as lodestones, or staffs of lightning that you can strap to your machine. We've got the basics, and they're good. The game is solid. Here's hoping they fully explore the possibilities and don't limit themselves.","February 7, 2015","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is minimalistic building siege engines simulator, with very small amount of missions for now.  The game has a TON of potential though, and replayability for the few missions is only kept low by your imagination and interest to build and try out your own contraptions. The things I've made so far include: Helicopter, Catapult, (still working on a Trebuchet since it is real hard to make on this), Tank. I've also seen people make a transformer in this so as you can see there's much to try out.","February 22, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was hooked on various drugs until they could no longer please me, so I would move to more intense, more addictive drugs. I ended up with a crippling heroin addiction. Luckily, my wife and family were there to support me and try to get me back on track.  They put me through therapy, but I just couldn't put down the needle. My therapist suggested I find a hobby that could keep my mind off of the drugs, but every hobby I tried just couldn't supersede the addiction heroin. That is, until I found this game. Since beginning to play this game, heroin has never crossed my mind. The addiction I feel for this game has completely obliterated the addiction level I had for heroin. I never thought it was possible, but since purchasing this game, my life has gotten far worse.  My addiction to this game took everything from me. My wife, my house, my kids. Everything. So if you're looking at this game and deciding whether or not to purchase it, consider your life as it is now.  Because once you purchase this game, you can't go back.

When (hopefully) these come out, the game will quite probably take many hours to complete. My current playtime of 3.2 hours was enough to complete the current levels, while mucking about with various ways to kill sheep, and so is probably 2 hours play for someone new, with no ideas borrowed from videos. For only £4.99, and the hope of another 3-5 campaigns of the same length, this gives better £ to hour ratio than I expected, and certainly beats some of the more expensive games availble.\nI highly recommend this, however, before you build a metal plated explosive firing tank, be aware, I did this, and my FPS promtly dropped to 5. Whether this is unavoidable or not I don't know, it may have been the object I made, but I hope the developers add either better optimisation for more 'parts' of vehicles, or add larger blocks, such as a 5x2 metal plate, so you can armour things without playing a slideshow.\nHowever, other than that small qualm, this game is absolutely excellent, and will easily provide hours of entertaining play.","February 24, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
