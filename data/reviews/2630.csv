"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FruitNooters/recommended/2630/","FruitNooters","A Bunneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FruitNooters/","86 products in account","With almost 200 hours (give or take) on the old 360, I wanted to get a taste of the old WWII theme of CoD. I bought this purely for the nostalgia, and to see if it still played as well as I remembered it. Turns out, it does. I'm prepared for all the flak of being a "CoDfag" and other completely original jeers, because this game makes it worth it.\n\nThe game puts you in the boots of 3 different soldiers in a Russian, English, and American Campaign. Each with 4 missions comprised of 2 or 3 sub-missions. As I played this on the 360 way back when, I don't recall that kind of setup, and requiring to beat so many missions to unlock the next campaign threw me for a loop. However, I'm willing to look past that.\n\nPros:\n-The combat, much as people hate it with its typical "Run and gun" nature, the combat was this game's biggest selling point back in the day; and remains to be to this day. Guns feel lifelike, the sounds accompany each shot perfectly, and the spray of red allowed the game to keep its "T" rating. Melee leaves a lot to be desired however, but you shouldn't ever resort to it anyways.\n\n-The soundtrack, which people often ignore as it's only truly present on the main and pause screens, as well as at the end of each mission. It may be subtle (unless you have the game at full volume) provides the slight ambience you'd expect from a gritty WWII FPS. The low hum of the deep brass and drums truly puts your heart in the action (not literally, that'd be weird.)\n\n-The difficulty. Remember when CoD games were hard? Yeah, you most likely don't, as apparently adding regenerating health apparently made the series "Casually easy". But oh no, not in its first appearence. This game, especially on Veteran, is regarded as one of the most difficult in the series (Besides CoD 1 and WaW, highly recommended). On Easy, you could take an MG42 for about 15 seconds before your screen turns red and informs you to duck behind the nearest dirt pile for all the ice bullets (my reasoning) to vanish and your wounds to heal. But on Hard and Veteran, expect A LOT of deaths, and even more rage. On Veteran, one bullet puts you at near-death, and the second is fatal. Don't expect an easy run with this game.\n\n-The story. WWII did in fact happen, I have a Veteran Neighbor to prove it. And to me, that adds a little something. No random Russia/Korean/Whoever-the-UN-Doesn't-like-currently attacks. It's you, against the Nazis, end of story. You may not like it, which is fine, but I enjoy that realism.\n\nCons:\n\n-Game reasoning. You see that building full of enemies that needs clearing? You're not supposed to go in there until your buddy goes in first. And you'll die a few times before you notice that. Sometimes you're tasked with clearing a room or providing covering fire, other times not so. It's a bad case of Trial-and-Error gameplay. Like another game I won't mention...\n\n-Infinitely Respawning enemies. When I first played this, I remember sitting at a grove wall as an endless swarn of enemies rushed through for almost half an hour. Only to find hopping a single wall forced them to retreat. This game does this A LOT. Be prepared to rush virtually everything, because the game expects you to.\n\n-Technical Bugs. I remember manning an AA Cannon to gun down planes, only to get killed by the same grenade about ten times. I rage quit, start the game again, and complete it first try, sans grenades. The game will often glitch and force you to the next checkpoint without wiping all the current enemies, forcing a restart.\n\n-Forced gray-zones. If you've played this before, you know what I'm talking about. Moments, almost always involving tanks, in which you suddenly drop to the floor, your screen goes gray, and you think you died. But nope, you can get back up, take increased damage, and move at a snails' pace.\n\n\nI recall this game being something I'd play for hours on end. There's something awesome about storming the Normandy Beaches and moving around as artillary shells explode around you. This game was great fun back then, and it's even more fun now. If you're a nostalgic, this game is completely worth $20. If you're new and have grown up in the "I hate on CoD because it's a meme" group, I'd recommend waiting for this to go on sale.","November 15, 2014","true","6.0"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","37","39","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/2630/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Call of Duty 2 is a First Person Shooter set in World War 2 and like its predecessor features three campaigns that follow Russia, United Kingdom and the United States in their fights to push back the German menace. The first campaign has you fighting in the snow covered outskirts of Moscow and one of the most noticeable things right of the bat is a pretty significant graphical overhaul compared to the first game. It is not very impressive in this day and age but it has not aged badly at all. Much has also been revamped under the hood like friendly AI that is actually useful this time around and will occasionally shout out the enemies’ location in real time. It sounds like an insignificant thing but when your squad is being mowed down by enemy fire and you have no idea where it's coming from, having an ally yell out his location can be the difference between life or death as well as being very immersive to boot. The revamped AI in this sequel really help give it a more dynamic and intense feel as enemies are now much more adapt at hiding behind their environments while also being more capable of flushing you out of cover, forcing you to move around the environment instead of playing a deadly game of whack a mole with your enemies.\n\nEnemies will use their grenades far more liberally making it vital to keep your ears open to that ping of a grenade being dropped on the battlefield so you don't get near it. Once you get close enough to a grenade there is an onscreen icon alerting you of the threat but if you are moving around the area and come across one, chances are that there is very little time left until it detonates making it a rather solid compromise between player approachability and punishing your carelessness. A new addition to your arsenal are smoke grenades which are invaluable when cornered by overwhelming firepower and must run across gunfire towards a better vantage point. There are times when you must run towards a tank with nothing but satchel charges to destroy it and it is pretty awesome to run out of the smoke, plant an explosive on it and then disappear back into the thick smoke. This works both ways however, the Nazis just as easily can throw a smoke grenade onto an open plain and rush your company. It is a really cool addition that helps to further encourage you to stay on the move rather than to stay behind a good hiding spot for the duration of the fight.\n\nCall of Duty 2 is a more difficult game than its predecessor and will test your mettle with very one sided situations, especially when the Nazis are near defeat and fighting with tooth and nail in an attempt to turn the tides towards their favor. On some occasions you will be surrounded on all sides and have to hold out for a set amount of time which leads to some really intense, chaotic battles in where you must be very alert, least you get flanked by enemies or shot from behind. It often leads being overwhelmed and constantly having to move from location to location to avoid being pinned down while having your allies location in mind so you don't end up shooting them in the heat of battle. These events were both my favorite and least favorite part of the games as your goal goes from trying to defeat the enemy to simply trying to survive an extremely bad situation while what little allies you have left are dying before your eyes and you very well could be next. As cool as these sections of the campaign are they do feel too common place to the point of feeling like they are just there to pad out the game with an arbitrary time limit until you can proceed with the story. Speaking of the story you will not be fighting in iconic previously covered battles such as Berlin instead it focuses on the more “minor” battlefields and events of WW2.\n\nBoth the American and the Russian campaign take a far less major roll than the previous game. This time around it is the British campaign that shines in stark contrast to their pretty lackluster journeys in the original Call of Duty. The British campaign are mostly centered on their struggles in Africa and is a location very rarely explored in video games. It creates some interesting situations whenever you must get in a tank that show off the German's superior tanks that have much better range and armor forcing you to withstand their shells until you are in range to fire back. Kicking up dust and smoke clouds when you destroy an enemy will disrupt your line of sight as well. While it is a rather short sequence it helped to break up the monotony of shooting Nazis in the face and was the only time you can control a vehicle. Your missions will have you following a handlebar mustached Captain called Price across many fronts but there is no real character development or personal story, it's all about the journey towards winning the war.\n\nRussians have the first and shortest campaign that is not all that interesting. Americans on the other hand are getting hammered by their daring offensive strikes and their first mission is the Normandy landing which is probably the most brutal level in the entire game. The American campaign is short as well though it does have a lot of memorable moments such as invading a small town and having to fall back multiple times as the Germans proved far more fearsome than anticipated. The final mission of the game is also from the American side though it was a pretty disappointing ending to a series of intense missions. One of the most disappointing changes to this sequel was that health packs are now gone and in its stead we have regenerating health. It really takes any fear out of getting shot since you can now get shot until near death and hide for a few seconds to be good as new. It is a far cry from taking a lucky shot on the battlefields of the original and hoping you can crawl your way through the warzone in hopes of finding a health-pack to treat your wounds. In this game getting shot means nothing and you can simply shrug it off as long as you don't take too much damage making it feel a lot less dangerous and making carefully fighting your foes a thing of the past.\n\nUnfortunately I have not been able to stop the game from crashing while trying to access the multiplayer portion of it so I do not know if there is still an active community nor can I properly review it. Another oddity is that unlike the original there is no more manual or quick saving in this and instead relies on a checkpoint system. It's not a problem since checkpoints are frequent though it is a rather weird design decision. All in all even though this sequel loses a few of the things that made the original great I would still consider it on par or better then it's predecessor. While it is true we no longer have to fear a bit of damage it also forces you to move around the area with the addition of smarter AI and grenades can easily kill you if you are caught in a bad place. It is a case of fast paced, guns blazing action versus “realistic” slow combat where the danger comes from taking unnecessary risks. Neither is objectively better than the other though this tweak to the gameplay may be something that deters fans of the original. If that is something you are fine with or don't care about this is definitely a great sequel that expands on many key things like having larger levels, better graphics and more satisfying enemies to face as well as many small tweaks that makes it an overall better experience.","March 3","true","8.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nick930930/recommended/2630/","Nick930930","Nick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nick930930/","256 products in account","Call of Duty 2 is a major step up from its predecessor in practically every way. With improved graphics, mechanics, and epic missions, COD2 is a must have for any WW2 history nut or shooter fan.\n\nWhere Call of Duty 1 borrows heavily from "Band of Brothers," Call of Duty 2 seems to borrow elements from both "Band of Brothers" and "Saving Private Ryan." The standout American campaign towards the end of the game is easily the best part and worth the effort to be able to play. Unlike COD1, COD2 finally puts you on the frontline during D-Day (albeit, one of the lesser known and smaller scale battles at Point Du Hoc), where you scale the cliffs of Normandy and face off against the defending Nazis. Not only that, but you then have to secure the nearby village, fight off attackers until you are eventually pushed back and forced to defend with limited ammunition and man power in one of the more epic missions I've seen in a COD game. But the other campaigns aren't too bad either. The game starts off with the Russian campaign a few weeks after the events of the first game in Stalingrad during the harsh winter months. You are tasked with pushing through Nazi forces to the town hall in an effort to push the Germans out of Stalingrad. In addition to this, there's also a signfiicantly improved british campaign with some really enjoyable missions that take place in the Africa theatre of war, which is already very rare to see in a WW2 game. There's a few missions that still task you with moving with a small unit and getting into stupid car chases, but they're not nearly as long or as ridiculous as before. So to summarize, COD2's campaign is fantastic and offers plenty of large scale battles and a few memorable (but not necessarily that significant) characters like Captain price and Seargent Randall.\n\nAnother major improvement in this entry into the series is the graphics. They have significantly improved and surprisingly hold up rather well today despite this game being an Xbox360 launch title. Textures on friendly soldiers pop out and their wet uniforms look muddy, heavy, and dirty giving a real authentic feel to the game. The smoke introduced in COD1's expansion back are reintroduced here in the form of smoke grenades which not only look good but are a core mechanic to the game. Lighting is fantastic, character animations are improved (albeit a little dated to todays standards especially considering there is no rag doll physics at all), and overall presentation is very well done.\n\nThe mechanics have recieved some major imrpovements. This is the first call of duty in the series to feature regenerative health, and one of the first shooter games in the market to introduce the concept as well. Instead of searching frantically for random health packs, you simply need to rest behind cover without getting shot in order to recieve full health, allowing you to get back into the action without any significant interruptions. This feature may seem like it makes the game easier, but the difficulty of the enemies has been increased dramatically. One issue that I found pretty frustrating as I played is that enemy soldiers will now throw grenades at you almost all the time, and they are generally really good at throwing them right at your feet, even if your upstairs in a window shooting down at them. Not only that, but your own grenades are pretty much useless in the game because 75% of the time, the enemies will pick up your grenade and throw it right back, sometimes resulting in an instant death.\nThe same problems with enemy AI still exist from the first game into this one. Whenever you peak out from cover to engage the enemy, every single soldier in your line of sight will immedietly drop what they're doing and aim directly at you with insane accuracy, almost always dropping your health down and forcing you to sit back down. Enemies also seem to be bullet sponges, taking several shots just to get them to drop their gun. And then they still sit back up with their pistol that has even more damage somehow until you finish them off. The game also tasks you with infiltrating buildings filled with germans and expects you to kill all of them by yourself while the 5 guys you stacked up on the door with are just waiting downstairs. If an enemy drops a grenade or starts rushing you, its possible to get stuck in the doorway because friendly AI act as barriers, keeping you from retreating or moving into doorways which can really get annoying. Also, for some reason the sprint feature introduced in the last expansion was removed, forcing the player to "walk" to the fights while your friendly units can sprint all over the place. Not sure why this design choice was made, but thankfully it doesn't seem to impact the game that much.\nSo aside from all those complaints, the game improves in several other areas in terms of mechanics. Smoke grenades are now a major gameplay component that allow you to conceal your squads movements as you cross "no mans land" in an attempt to flank enemy gunners. You are now given access to binoculars that you can use to scout ahead so you can try and figure out what exactly is shooting at you. And like I said before, the regenerative health is a major improvement that really makes the game move at a faster and more enjoyable pace.\n\nThis game also features a multiplayer component but I didn't bother with it. I was more interested in the lengthy single player campaign.\n\nIn conclusion, Call of Duty 2 remains one of my all time favorites because of its incredibly tense missions, great graphics, and fun gameplay. I highly recommend this game, if you haven't played it, you are missing out.","July 19, 2015","true","8.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

It does offer some problems with startup, setting settings and/or crashing on initial startup and when setting settings. You may also experience problems with a black-screen on initial startup, simply close the .exe via task manager- then start again. The game should work- no problems whatsoever. Just make sure to set your ideal settings in the first instance- this may take a few attempts.\n\nOther than that, it's a playable, enjoyable, challenging and exciting game- which hones into the classic CoD/MoH styling of games- which offers a solid few hours of gameplay (estimation roughly 10-20'odd).

You fight your way through creepy skiny and fat hated nazies. One good part of the game is Dday. Where you can go almost 3 differnt ways. Dday was the best by far even if your team keeps runing striaght at the enemy. And the best out of all is the big AI fights, some times I just watch them both fight for ever. One thing to do is try to speed run even if you leave your 50 soilders to die.

The way that the battlefield was operated in was overhauled from the first Call of Duty, Finest Hour and United Offensive.\n\nThe most obvious overhaul in gameplay is the addition of regenerating health. This arguably makes you feel like a super-soldier, going against the theme of the first game in which you were a single average soldier. However, unlike its sequels, the scale of the battles means that normally this is not the case.\n\nAnother large change is the largest engine overhaul in the history of the series (at least until Advanced Warfare). This was the first game to make use of the IW Engine, which performs far better than the original games, looks much better and allows for far better quality textures, models and animations. The game looks significantly better than the original, has higher quality sound and much better animations than the original. Just like the original game, the game features support for high framerates, and unlike the original, native high resolution support for modern monitors is also supported.\n\nCampaign-wise, the game is great. It’s longer than the original Call of Duty, and longer than any of its sequels. The campaign, just like the original, features Russian, British and American soldiers. The Russian campaign is brilliantly done, with a mix of large open fields with little cover, narrow alleys and trenches, and a sniper mission in a surrounded building. The British campaign also combines trench warfare with large open dust plains for tank commanding, tight alleyways for urban combat and hold objectives in France and against the Afrika Korps. The American campaign contains the games landmark moment, the D-Day landing and Hill 400, which is brilliantly done, while containing more large battles. Call of Duty 2 features a campaign that can stand o its own, without multiplayer, just as the first and United Offensive did.\n\nThe multiplayer is still populated by some players. The maps range from new to re-mastered versions of the best from Call of Duty, Finest Hour and United Offensive. Unfortunately, the vehicle combat from United Offensive does not make a return in the multiplayer, which is somewhat disappointing, as the game appears to disregard much of what United Offensive added, such as the ability to sprint.\n\nThis leads into my main problem with the game. It doesn't take on board the new features added in United Offensive, instead only building on the original Call of Duty. Although the game is still solid, if it had taken on board these features from the expansion pack, it could easily be the best of the series, and possibly one of the greatest first person shooters ever made. Despite this, the game stands up much better than its sequels as a brilliant first person shooter, a highlight of the series, and a sign of what this series once was before it was slaughtered unjustly by Activision and its need to milk a franchise for it was worth. Instead of buying next year’s new Call of Duty, why not buy the Warchest and treat yourself to three epic World War II shooters that show what the franchise is truly about, and how these games should truly be done.","February 15, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is probably one of the best games to play if you want a cinematic experience out of a WWII shooter. I originally played this on Xbox 360 several times so there may be a form of biasness so be warned.\n\nThe game features the same three campaigns playing as three soldiers from the Russian, British and American armies and a British Tank Commander as well. Each campaign offers a good amount in variety in locale as the majority of each campaign is set in a different nation. The Russian campaign was by far the best as it had a good balance between making you immersed in the game as well as having a great amount of variety in gameplay objectives. The American and British campaigns are still pretty fun and the American campaign in particular has the best starting level on the beach landings of Normandy. There is actually a small form of humor in a cheesy way which I like compared to the more modern games which try to be outgoing but coming accross as more awkward. Russians have their dark humor, British with their dry wit and the Americans with their more silly banntering makes the game feel more at home with an old war movie.\n\nVisually it still holds up for the most part. Nothing looks terrible but nothing looks great either. It gets the job done. Combat is fun giving you a nice variety of WWII weaponry. One problem I had was that out of maybe the 6-8 weapons each nation has, only 3 of them are properly given to you so if you want to play with the more interesting guns you're gonna have to wait for one of the AI soldiers to die and hope you have enough ammo for it. The health bar has been removed with regenerating health which I'm a little mixed on. I don't mind either but I think I probably lean towards health bars as personal preference goes. Music is nice but since there is much more action happening at the one time it's either more absent or you're not going to hear it as much. One thing I didn't like is the checkpoint system. Manual saving is always going to be superior no matter what. I don't like replaying 5-10 minute sections all over again because I did one thing wrong. Still this game usually does it in a more tolerable fashion so it's not as bad. I was unfortunately unable to play the multiplayer which was again like the last two Call of Duty games a little dissapointing if understandable.\n\nCall of Duty 2 is probably the pinacle of WWII shooters. It was also the Call of Duty title I believe that got its full identity and the franchise having its own personality rather than being inspired with the Medal of Honor series. This is one of the most cinematic WWII games you can find (maybe Call of Duty 3 but I haven't played it for a long time so I might have to check that out again). It has good variety in missions, gameplay and locations. I give it an 8/10.","August 14, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Developed on the first iteration of the IW2 engine, it provides a visually enhanced experience for the ww incursions.\nGameplay-wise there are a tremendeous amount of scripted moments. The game expects you to do all the hard work, regardless of how many squad member fight along side you on each mission. The squad members will constantly shout and yell for incomming grenades, after that they'll brazenly sit on them/near them or they'll act as terrible soldiers, missing their targets all of the time, unless the script says otherwise. I am writing this after multiple failed attempts on final stand of the second campaign (according to the online wiki there are 3) and also thinking to resign, because of that final stand sequence where the game transforms into Serious Sam and the squad members are completely useless. The squad members with their inept AI clicked the "uninstall" button.","May 30","false","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Shooter after endless shooter bombarded our systems, and then there were the really bad ones in between the Call of Duty and Medal of Honor yearly releases. Call of Duty 2 was highly anticipated because it was the actual sequel to the award winning original. Does it stand out like the first game did? Is it full of cinematic finesse and finely nuanced mechanics? Not really.\n\nThere’s not much of a story here because it’s based off WWII. Black and white footage with a dull narrator telling you about different theaters of the war, then there’s the typical journal entry during the load screen, nothing interesting at all, and even when the game came out I was sick of these WWII shooters. What does Call of Duty 2 build on? Nothing, it’s just more of the same, but at least it has high production values and it does the same stuff right. The game has you following three different soldiers from the Russian, British, and American side. One thing I did like was that you get to play a different side of the Normandy beach storming and that’s the Rangers. They climbed up the cliff side trying to shut down the German pill boxes and various artillery so our troops stopped getting slaughtered on the beachhead. Call of Duty 2 tries to tell the smaller stories in the war which is a nice change of pace.\n\nThe same weapons are here that you have shot a million times. Lee Enfield, M1 Garand, Mp40, MP44, Sten, and various others. Of course not ALL WWII weapons are here, but I wanted to see some of the more obscure ones like the Browning or BAR. At this point in time it was just about better graphics and who’s weapon textures looked the most realistic. Call of Duty 2 delivers on the visuals and was a benchmarker much like Crysis is now back in 2005/2006. It was one of the first game to support SLI and really pushed PCs and made you get those $500 graphics cards. It was a must have for PC owners, and was also a GPU seller. With that aside, the textures look great even today and the visuals really pop. The sound is great as well with gunfire chattering in the distance and soldiers yelling all around you. It may seem dated today, but you can really see how much the Call of Duty series hasn’t evolved. There’s striking similarities to the Modern Warfare series because it’s all the same, shoot anything that moves.\n\nThe game can be pretty easy at times, I could just rush into a building and blow everyone away with one clip and survive. I still find it painful to know that grenade physics are still really bad and bounce around like rubber balls. There are various things I just really can’t stand about these shooters and that’s the lack of realism. When I shoot enemies blood doesn’t even come out, where’s the gore and violence? Brothers in Arms was the first WWII shooter to use this violence in the genre, but Call of Duty just feels like some sort of censored theme park ride.\n\nCoD2 had a huge multiplayer following, but sadly no one’s online anymore. Even so, it’s just a typical online shooter and isn’t anything special. I was really disappointed to find that CoD2 wasn’t as cinematic as it could have been and just felt the same throughout the whole game. Blow up this door, defend this position, destroy that mortar nest, kill this Flak 88 crew. It’s the same stuff we play in every single WWII shooter and nothing ever changes. Sure it was mindless fun, but I have come to realize why I was so glad everyone moved on.\n\n--Score: 8/10","November 25, 2013","true","8.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

And then I got to these missions where there were these panzershrek guys that would spawn and would be immune to anything that you did to them and they'd destroy your tanks and kill your teammates and that ruined it for me.  NO MATTER WHAT, they should not be programmed to not die.  That's unrealistic.  COD 1 feels so much better, you try not to take many bullets.  In this game it's impossible not to be shot a lot, so you probably get shot like 100+ times and just keep regenerating the health.\n\nThis is where they took off the 3 main guns and 1 sidearm mechanic.  So you either have a main gun and a pistol, 2 main guns or 2 pistols, etc, it's just stupid.  Everything was annoying, it didn't feel like you were a team like in COD 1.  In COD 1, you felt like everyone was doing their part, in here all your teammates die except a few main characters.  Everyone else just dies no matter what.  Oh yeah and SCREW THOSE FLIPPING PANZER ♥♥♥♥♥es that are invinsible!\n\nEDIT:\n\nI decided to go back and play it some more, I got to the American campaign and it got A LOT better.

That's not hyperbole, that's the honest truth.  Infinity Ward didn't want to make this game at all so from phoned-in briefings (simple text and Military Channel excerpts) to phoned in map designs (recycled ideas from Call of Duty 1 and lots of linear corridors) to a whole litany of design decisions deliberately intended to get the game out the door as quickly as possible in order to fulfill their obligations to Activision so they could move on to the game they did want to make - Modern Warfare.\n\nHowever, this game is worse than all that; it clearly jumped the shark.  Regenerating health, whack-a-mole play, loss of selector switches on select-fire weapons, smaller arsenal compared to previous games, worse map design, plot holes where any plot exists at all and a near total lack of any characterization set in place all the trends that would see the series become the object of near-universal contempt from PC FPS enthusiasts while its increasingly juvenile and insufferable fanbase became the object of universal contempt from everyone else.\n\nAvoid it like the plague it set in motion which has only just begun to roll back.  Stick with the first game and United Offensive which are superior in every way that counts.","December 12, 2015","false","9.0"," 0 of 11 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","11","0","3"

They also have built-in grenade indicator - because grenades are their most fearsome enemies. Your teammates are capable of insta-spotting the MG42 machinegun and they will always tell you if there is one (and there is ALWAYS one so every fight they shout the same phrase about it).\n\nThe game looks pretty good, supports 1920*1080, has some nice effects (especially hot air in the desert).\n\nI cannot recommend this because it is just boring and you can complete all three campaigns in 5 hours even on hardest difficulty due to regeneration and BLOODY SCREEN.

Not only are characters dulled, but there will be spouts of intense challenge, where one may be repeating the same action at least five times until he gets lucky. The campaign as a whole feels incorrect and biased; it causes more disgust than fun.\n\nThe multiplayer is OK due to more mechanics than the single player (???) and a good modding community. However, I believe some servers on this game's multiplayer are perfect examples of how over-modding can ruin a game.\n\nAll in all, this game doesn't come close to the first Call of Duty and its expansion, although may fair better against more recent Call of Duty games (not much of a challenge there).

It's primitive even for the year it was released in with pretty much nothing besides the WASD controls, jump, crouch, aim and shoot. The graphics are outdated, yes, but what strikes me is how uninspiring and repetitive the environment feels. Throughout the game i felt like I saw the same houses and ruins over and over again. The backstory offered as much as I expected from it but only in one chapter, during capturing Hill 400 did I feel any connection with the character.\n\nAll that set aside, the biggest disappintment for me was that the game offered no stealth support. The levels were built in a way that the only way to advance was to storm a rallypoint and then hold it for a short time. Sniping out enemies from the distance proved to be a waste of time and ammo since new ones spawned immediately.\n\nWith all the game has to offer i can't imagine I would have been impressed even back when it came out. My opinion is that it's just not worth it. Least today.","September 13, 2014","false","12.7"," 2 of 31 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","2","31","0","0"

Both Singleplayer and Campaign are still being played today since 2005, and that's a good message. Hope in humanity is restored.\n\nBoring stuff below:\n\n''Call of Duty 2 lets players experience four individual soldier stories as they overcome insurmountable odds in multiple campaigns. Players have the freedom to follow each of the four storylines through for the ultimate character-driven experience, or they can engage in the historic battles chronologically for quick hitting action. Infinity Ward has also expanded the scope of combat to deliver a truly realistic battlefield experience. Squads now have the freedom to take on a variety of mission objectives, on expansive battlefields that allow for multiple paths and the ability to utilize actual combat tactics like outflanking and fire and maneuver capabilities. Call of Duty 2's new engine and A.I. technology set the stage for authentic squad combat and astonishing action. Concealment can be key as battlefield smoke or even deployed smoke grenades cloud visibility. Weather effects such as the dusty sandstorms of North Africa and whiteout blizzard conditions of Russia, for example, will keep soldiers glued to their bunkers. The team has also employed a state-of-the-art Battle Chatter System that brings the action to life as squad-mates bark out context-sensitive updates in real-time to players through an advanced A.I. system.''\n\nBuy it.\n\n86/100","May 23, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Russian bit starts off brilliantly with the most clever introduction I've seen in a video game yet.  After that, I found the rest to be mostly forgettable.  It's pretty standard run and gun sort of Call of Duty fare.  Nothing really stood out for me with the rest of the Russian section.\n\nThe British section starts off strong, stays intense, gets super freakin awesome with the tank level (best tank level in any game ever--with the possible exception of battlefield 3), and then sort of peters out with the last level.  All in all though, the British section showcases one of the lesser known aspects of WWII with the desert campaigns in North Africa and truly makes you feel like a badass for King and Country.\n\nThe American section starts out with what might be one of the most memorable, intense, and all around amazing video game experiences ever.  Even today, the lighting, the graphics, the sound, everything hold up so well.  After the D-Day mission the American campaign remains pretty basic but the D-Day mission alone makes this game worth every penny.  Just play that one mission over and over again.  It truly is phenomenal.\n\nSo all in all Call of Duty 2 is a fun time and worth the buy.  It remains one of the high points in the franchise and worth adding to your collection.\n\nIt is worth noting however that Call of Duty 2 introduced the automatically regenerating health eliminating health packs and the health bar.  Not that removing "realism" in a video game is a bad thing but let it be known that this began the trend of Call of Duty moving away from gritty historical realism to hollywood action star type gameplay.","April 12, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it is not enough time for charecter building, so if a charecter dies it doesnt effect you. Which can also be great(If your heart less). I have probaly played the campain 3 times over. I would give the campain a 7 1/2 or 8 out of 10.\nNow for the really fun part of this game. The multiplayer still has alot of players, which is great. There are alot of hackers but, just about all of them are good hackers to make the game 10 times better. Even with out the custom maps the game still has AWESOME regular matches. You can get custom gamemodes like, call of duty zombie survival, actual zombies for cod 5, bo1, bo2. Also have snipers only servers, and modern weapons teamdeath match. There are many other gamemodes. I would give the custom modes and maps a 9 out of 10, and the regular gamemodes and maps a 8 1/2.\n\n\n\n\n\nCampain: 7 1/2 - 8\nCustom Multiplayer: 9 out of ten\nRegular Multiplayer: 8 1/2\nTotal: 9 - 9 1/2","March 23, 2015","true","51.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The formula is all here: you play multiple random grunts, with continuous side characters who are invincible (unless you kill them), an emphasis on cinematic, high-octane action scenes, regenerating health, highly funneled navigation paths, and repetitive shootout encounters where hordes of cloned opposition troops sit in defensive positions and plink at you 'till you whittle them away. The formula is so well worn that my interest was only held in the environmental details that separated one battlefield from another.\n\nThe big problem with single player is you're always aware you are playing a GAME, with game conventions, but the game demands you suspend disbelief and play like it's real.  It doesn't work and it gets tiresome when you know other games let your skill have greater impact on the events.","October 1, 2011","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And this was also from the era they didn't release a new COD every year.\n\nIn this game you'll fight as Russia, British and American soldiers in the frontlines of WWII. The Soviet campaign is mostly kicking Germans out of Stalingrad, the UK campaign is mostly in the battles of North Africa which was refreshning to see for a change. US campaign is yet again about Normandy.... Don't game designers get boring doing D-Day again and again? I mean it was important but I think they should get some new battles. The US campaign climax is crossing the Rhine which was nice!\n\nAnd the multiplayer is balanced and fun. Except no vehicles like in COD:UO. But the game is a masterwork of a genius back in 2005. The graphics back then were stunning, similiar to F.E.A.R (2005).\n\nI had no issues playing the game on Windows 7, so feel free to buy!\n\nProtip: Buy the warchest of Call of Duty. You get all the games for 30 bucks (otherwise it would be 20 bucks per game=60 bucks)\n\n10000000/1 would kick nazis out of Russia and North Africa again","April 23, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Russian bit starts off brilliantly with the most clever introduction I've seen in a video game yet.  After that, I found the rest to be mostly forgettable.  It's pretty standard run and gun sort of Call of Duty fare.  Nothing really stood out for me with the rest of the Russian section.\n\nThe British section starts off strong, stays intense, gets super freakin awesome with the tank level (best tank level in any game ever--with the possible exception of battlefield 3), and then sort of peters out with the last level.  All in all though, the British section showcases one of the lesser known aspects of WWII with the desert campaigns in North Africa and truly makes you feel like a badass for King and Country.\n\nThe American section starts out with what might be one of the most memorable, intense, and all around amazing video game experiences ever.  Even today, the lighting, the graphics, the sound, everything hold up so well.  After the D-Day mission the American campaign remains pretty basic but the D-Day mission alone makes this game worth every penny.  Just play that one mission over and over again.  It truly is phenomenal.\n\nSo all in all Call of Duty 2 is a fun time and worth the buy.  It remains one of the high points in the franchise and worth adding to your collection.\n\nIt is worth noting however that Call of Duty 2 introduced the automatically regenerating health eliminating health packs and the health bar.  Not that removing "realism" in a video game is a bad thing but let it be known that this began the trend of Call of Duty moving away from gritty historical realism to hollywood action star type gameplay.","April 12, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Multiplayer is somewhat problematic - existing populated servers (4 of them are almost full at any given time) are full with age old players that get you killed within a few seconds, so this is far from being fun. Other are populated with bots. I recommend find a half full server- it's easier to get into the game this way.\nLater CODs multiplayer are better to my taste, but it's OK to try...\nThe downside to this game - many crashes concerning compability. I ran the solutions but still the game crashes on startup or between MP maps.\nWorth buying in a 5$ deal.","June 23, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All these coupled by smooth animations and movement controls makes for a gun-trotting action-filled campaign like no game has done before. One other major change is the introduction of regenerative health, as replacement for health packs. A feature that would later be adopted by every other future action game that came along.

(Works well with Gryo on ADS)\n\nOk so this game is alot of fun, there's no cutscenes which is nice bc I'm kind of beginning to not care about narratives in games.\nRegardeless of the fact that this game is 10+ years old, it has a phenomenal atmosphere and a great respect to it's source material (WWII), way better  than World at War (COD 5 felt way too emo).  I'm currently in the British Campaign, I just finished the Russian missions and after that I get to kill some facists for Uncle Sam.\n\nIf you have an urge to play this game to see what Call of Duty used to be, I reccomend you pick this up on a sale, $20 is a little steep.\n","December 25, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are a pretty big improvement over the first game, and it still looks surprisingly decent for a game that came out in 2005. The game play still holds up pretty well, and the campaign is a lot better than Call of Duty 1 (imo). Unfortunately, like the previous game, there are some parts that can feel a bit repetitive.\n\nMy only con is the lack of a manual save feature. Having to go back to a previous checkpoint after a constantly dying during a hard part of the game was very tedious. As for any bugs, the only one I encountered was a crash when I tried to change some video settings before I started the campaign. It only happened once, and it could have easily been a bad graphics driver on my end.\n\nCall of Duty 2 is my personal favorite in the entire series, and it was fun to play this game again after so long. It was especially great to experience how the series was back in 2005 before it ended up into the juggernaut that it is today.\n\nI highly recommend Call of Duty 2.","December 23, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's certianly unlike most modern shooters, mainly because you really do feel like you're fighting in full armies most of the time instead of being a one man hero.","February 16","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iTzAshley/recommended/2630/","iTzAshley","OG ♥Ashley♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iTzAshley/","37 products in account","Overall continues on with the CoD franchise.... or the first ever CoD.\n\nThis time draws in more historical aspects to the game itself- Russian, American and British Campaigns which all individually focus year-by-year as it were.\n\nMore concise, varied and detailed than to its predecessor, allowing for 1920x1080 display (which wasn't available in the original) and high-graphics (more detailed than previous).\nHowever, being a 'port' from old-PC to New PC. It does offer some problems with startup, setting settings and/or crashing on initial startup and when setting settings. You may also experience problems with a black-screen on initial startup, simply close the .exe via task manager- then start again. The game should work- no problems whatsoever. Just make sure to set your ideal settings in the first instance- this may take a few attempts.\n\nOther than that, it's a playable, enjoyable, challenging and exciting game- which hones into the classic CoD/MoH styling of games- which offers a solid few hours of gameplay (estimation roughly 10-20'odd). I like it, and so should you.... if that's your thing!","April 10","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
