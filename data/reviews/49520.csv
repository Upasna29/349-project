On the first playthrough you can get by with just picking up gear as you travel along, choosing stuff that looks better than your current gear, and maybe occasionally buying something in the vendor that looks handy.  The deeper you go down the rabbit hole however, the more there is to discover.\n\nThe story is decent for a First Person Shooter (albeit one with RPG elements), and dialogue is often amusing to a degree.  Handsome Jack, the main antagonist is a cartoon villain with M rated attitudes.  He believes, or at least pretends to believe that he is the good guy, and you are just a "Filthy Bandit.".\n\nGraphically, the game has a lot more variations in design and color scheme than it's predecessor (which was brown, brown, and a bit of color here and there).  Cell shaded graphics with thick, graphic novel like outlines is the style of the game, and does a good job of separating it from the average FPS.\n\nNow, on to the gameplay itself!:\n\nAction is often fast paced and exciting.  So long as you don't allow yourself to get too far ahead of the enemy levels, you'll find battles where you have to fight hard to win.  The game does a decent job of easing you into the various elements, such as different gun types (Pistol, SMG, Assault/Combat Rifle, Shotgun, Revolver, Rocket Launcher, and Sniper Rifle), the importance of a good shield, grenade mods (alter the way your grenade behaves, including damage bonuses and special effects), Class Mods (Class-specific devices which can boost skills, and have other effects like increasing fire rate with specific weapon types), and lastly Relics (Device which generally boost damage or defence in some way).  Equipment rarity is also made fairly clear.  It goes White, Green, Blue, Purple, Magenta, Orange, Seraph, and Pearlescent.  The final two rarities (Pearlescent and Seraph) are special.  Seraphs require you to have at least one of the season pass DLC to obtain (and you need all 4 of the Season Pass DLC to obtain all the Seraph rarity items), and as to Pearlescent rarity weapons, you need to be in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (Playthrough 3) for them to have a chance of being spawned.  Don't assume that a blue is automatically better than a green rarity item, even at the same level.  Experiment!\n\nPlayable Characters and Skills:\n\nThere are 4 included playable characters, and two DLC characters.  Each class has it's ups and downs, and a special game changing skill unique to them.  For example, Salvador (Gunzerker) will dual-wield guns when his action skill is active, meaning TWICE THE FIREPOWER.  Axton (Commando) drops a turret, which damages enemies and draws aggression away from you.  Maya (Siren) locks an enemy's movements for a short time, allowing you to get in free hits.  Zer0 turns invisible for a few seconds and launches a decoy, and his first attack made whilst in this mode does increased damage.  The DLC characters are Gaige (Mechromancer) who launches a flying robot that attacks nearby enemies, and Kreig (Psycho); a schizophrenic musclebound maniac that will whale on everything within reach with increased offensive and defensive capabilities and can even throw his axe at more distant targets.\n\nAside from the action skills unique to the character, there are various other skills that you can put points into, and have an effect on gameplay in some way.  For example, increasing fire rate or damage for a few seconds after a kill is made.  Each character has 3 skill trees, each ending with a final gamechanging skill modifier.  For example, Zer0's Bloodlust (Melee) tree ends with the Many Must Fall perk, which will instantly re-deploy the hologram if he kills the enemy with one melee strike.  As mentioned before, Class Mods unique to a character class will boost certain skills.  It's possible for them to go as high as +6, meaning some skills can be boosted to 11, as the normal limit on points you can put into most skills is 5, though some skills are only 1 (those usually affect the way you play).\n\nPlus, there is a gun that shoots swords....EXPLODING swords...In DLC4 (Tiny Tina's Assault on the Dragon Keep).  So yeah, there is that too.\n\nI hope you found my review useful, even if it might be a bit messy XD","November 26, 2013","true","739.1"," 1,754 of 1,865 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","754","1","0","45"

Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere. Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance. You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game.        Audio    10    No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout. Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk!). The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion.       Gameplay    9    A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play. So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through. As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles.        Story    9    The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging. The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time...         Replayability    9    So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text).         Multiplayer    10    For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication.         Overall    9.5    I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

I have owned this on console and played through TVHM at least 4 times with 4 different characters there. Played all the DLC except Tiny Tina on console, but when the GOTY edition became so cheap on PC I jumped at it and bought all the Headhunter DLCs, and the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack as well. So I can now play through the game THREE times on a character. Dar\n\nI'm so addicted to this game still, but the funny thing is that I don't even finish it, or even come close to it now. I'm in a mass addiction to boosting my Badass Ranks so I just keep trying to "prestige" it instead of moving on and going towards UVHM. xD\n\nI feel like I can pick this game up and play it at any time. Do a few things, and then quit playing. Unfortunately, for me anyways, I don't do that. I keep playing for hours, and I let all the other hundreds of games in my library continue to pile up.\n\nI play this game EXCLUSIVELY in SINGLE PLAYER. People will tell you that it is much more fun playing with friends, and truly it can be, but don't disregard this game as a single player game. It is insanely addictive, and it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo. Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishment, if you can actually do it. They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player team, but you CAN beat many of them solo. The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies. Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power. Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs. damage defense.\n\nBorderlands 2, simply put, is one of the best games ever made in my opinion. The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts. I recommend this to anyone, even if you think you won't like it. I thought Borderlands 1 looked stupid for years until I bought it for $5 with everything and realized how amzing the concept is and how it was made for OCD gamers. Now they are both 2 of my most played games ever, and I don't see myself stopping BL2 anytime soon. After all I ahven't even used The Psycho yet!\n\nBuy the GOTY Edition. It is the best deal by far and has most of the relevant content you will want. Forget about the Season Pass and regular game. GOTY has all that stuff and more. Then buy the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack to get extra level sand a 3rd round. The headhunter DLCs are worth it too for the cheap prices. Only thing not to buy are the stupid skin packs. Unless you like that sort of thing. Wait for it to go 75% off and you can get GOTY, UVH Pack, and allt he Headhunter DLCs for less than $20. BTW...these DLCs are legit and worth buying. This isn't some garbage map pack DLC, or jsut skins. These are high quality and large DLCs on the scale of the FAllout DLCs, and add even more than that in some of tehm. GOTY edition has almost too much content. >_>","July 11, 2014","true","394.8"," 524 of 563 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","524","563","0","9"

Its a shooter with role playing elements. Players loot enemies to collect gear that best compliments their play style.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with BL, the best way to explain this is to take the addicting looting system of Diablo and combine it with the basic elements of an FPS, throwing in some RPG via an inventory and skill tree. That's essentially the mechanics of the game, and it all slams together so well here. You have four basic classes to choose to play from, and each class has three paths to focus on in a skill tree -- this means there's plenty of variation to play. In addition to these basic mechanics, the game is open-world, though it may feel semi-linear as you can only explore on an area-by-area basis (think the opposite of an Elder Scrolls game, where you can walk around the entire map without hitting a loading screen until accessing a dungeon).\n\nI have to say, with combining so many of our favorite gaming formulas, this game has so many highlights. Sometimes I felt like I was playing something akin to Skyrim. Other times, the ambiance of a specific area or the design of a specific feature reminded me of BioShock. And sometimes certain things brought me back to my Fallout 3 days. However, I never forgot I was playing a completely new adventure that easily whisked me away for hours in the unique and captivating world of Pandora. Lastly, I can't forget the guns. No joke, there are millions of guns you can find. It is so satisfying to find a ridiculous weapon and destroy enemies for the next three hours with it, only to find another weapon that is even better.\n\nOne thing many BL veterans mentioned is the lack of a good narrative beyond funny one-liners in the original game. I never played Borderlands 1, but I can tell you that in BL 2 the characters are memorable, the writing is well-thought out and downright hilarious, and the story moves at a great pace with scenes of great emotion and other scenes of great sarcasm. This is all coming from someone who is used to epic stories from Final Fantasy or Mass Effect. Also, be sure to keep your ears peeled while you fight the various enemies. They say and do some hilarious things themselves. But seriously, the writing is just super clever.\n\nIn conclusion, this is one heck of a game. I feel that it combines the best of so many game genres into a single FPS while adding in a memorable story that motivates you to find out what happens next. Of course, you'll be laughing your face off the entire way.","December 23, 2013","true","95.9"," 511 of 583 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","511","583","0","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/49520/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Borderlands 2 is an action role playing first person shooter, developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2k Games in September 2012. It is the second game in the Borderlands series and the sequel to the popular 2009 hit Borderlands 1.\n\nAs with the first game, you are able to complete a campaign with the main story quest and optional side missions as one of the four Vault hunters.  All of the key gameplay features are all present, such as online co-op, randomly generated loot and character building elements such as talent trees are all found in Borderlands 2. There has been a game of the year edition released last year which includes all the DLC apart from one.\n\nThe gameplay at it's core is the same as Borderlands 1. The focus on randomly generated loot plays a huge part. Each of the characters you have the option to play as have their own specialty, and will bring a feel of originality to each playthrough on either of them.  We also see a new elemental effect in BL2, Slag, this is a substance that increases the damage a target takes if they are covered in it. You will also find Eridium bars as you play the game, these can be used to purchase storage upgrades and increase the amount of ammo you can carry.\n\nWe also see an element of customizing how your character looks as well, you can unlock different skins, head designs, colour schemes and vehicle paint jobs.  Another major addition to BL2 is the "Badd@ss rank" system; points are awarded for completing certain in-game challenges, that in turn award tokens that will allow you to increase your base stats. These stat increases also take effect on all of your other single player characters too.  Also similar to the the original, we also see the return of a New Game Plus mode, in the form of "True Vault Hunter Mode", which increases the difficulty, and gives you a higher chance at even better loot drops. You are also able to level up to 50 in this mode too.\n\nThe graphics in Borderlands 2 are virtually the same as the original, but with just a more enhanced look to them. We see the vibrant colour schemes in each zone come to life. Along with better quality textures too.  The style of graphics in Borderlands has always been a huge drawing point for me as there are hardly any other games which pull this style off as well as this.\n\nYour first playthrough Borderlands 2 will have a number of difficult encounters, but these can easily be overpowered by returning to the same bad guy, mission or zone after leveling up one or two more times, or getting a bigger better gun. If you stay on top of all of the side missions as you progress through the story mission, you will stay at the right level so that you won't just hit a brick wall of impossible monsters/enemies. To make matters easier when it comes to deciding how tough a mission will be, each one also has a recommended level - so you can easily see how hard a single mission will be without actually having to test the waters first.\n\nA full playthrough on single player of Borderlands 2 took me just under thirty hours. That is a pretty decent amount of content on offer, with the side missions and a decent amount of loot farming involved too. I have put almost 140 hours into Borderlands 2, as I have played various different characters through the story a number of times. This is a game where you can easily spend 300 hours and still be having the same amount of fun.\n\nI had zero amount of technical issues throughout BL2; the game is perfectly optimized, will run at 60 fps, and the cloud save feature makes it even better technically.\n\nBorderlands 2 is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Just like the original, Borderlands 2 is a perfect game with no flaws in it at all. I cannot recommend this game enough. Most people will already have it since it goes on sale so much, but PLEASE play it. You will NOT be disappointed.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The DLC adds even more to that. So far\nI have 250+ hours on the game and I'm not even done with all the modes.\n\nMy only problem is that it kinda forces you to play with other players, playing multiplayer gives better loot,\nand makes the game much easier to play. Playing alone will get you killed alot unless your ready to grind a bit for the best weapons. But if your buying this game you'll probably play online anyway, since there's usually always at least one player around where you are in a public game.","November 25, 2013","true","276.3"," 321 of 380 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","321","380","0","8"

Like the first one, it is a chef-d'oeuvre of gaming. It boasts a masterful blend of FPS and RPG elements with an elaborate loot system to make for truly delectable gameplay. Complementing the gameplay is the unique and self-identifying art style and graphics, the blithe and cartoonish atmosphere, and the lighthearted narrative and zany NPC characters. All of these factors working in concert generate one hell of a gaming experience that should be able to bring pleasure to nearly any gamer out there.\n\nBorderlands 2 plays very much like the first game, except there is just a little bit more of everything. Also, there are numerous small tweaks that go a long way to improve the tiny nuisances of the first installment. It is a direct sequel, but the lighthearted nature of the narrative allows for players to safely not worry about having played the first in order to understand the plot.\n\nAt the core of Borderlands 2, we find the same exemplary elements found in the first installment of the franchise. The gameplay is designed to offer both the face-paced action of an FPS with the character progression elements and gameworld massiveness of an RPG. There is an XP system that awards level-ups and ability-boosts. There are scores of quests to complete; some ancillary and others pivotal to the core narrative. There is a crazy world to explore, filled with various interesting NPCs. Enemy spawns and combat occur in real-time, right in the midst of everything else that is going on in the gameworld. There is never a dull moment or a lack of something to be working towards.\n\nBorderlands 2 also has an elaborate and semi-random loot drop system. In the style made popular by games like Diablo, loot spills out of chests, crates, and enemies to pile up on the floor for you to peruse. Much of it will be junk, but you must always keep an eye out for the rare high quality drops. This is the same style used in the first Borderlands, except it has been amplified to offer a much wider variety of goodies. Due to the nature of the stat-progression of the weapons and the sheer variety, you will find yourself experimenting with many more and various weapons than you would in a standard FPS.\n\nWith Borderlands 2 comes the return of the self-identifying art style that was made iconic in the first game; except the graphics are more crisp and detailed in this installment. The graphics fit the theme of the game with perfection, as they expertly relay the feeling of zany, cartoonish raucousness that the game is striving to evoke. This atmosphere sets the tone for the burlesquing narrative which never wastes an opportunity to poke fun at the other, more serious games it relates to.\n\nAlso returning in Borderlands 2 is the option for a cooperative multiplayer approach to playing the campaign. The multiplayer also borrows from the style made popular by games like Diablo. You are able to play with other people by either allowing them to join your session or by joining theirs. You bring your own characters and earn your own XP and loot, but the game will be progressed up to the point that the host has reached. Playing with friends, or even with random people, can make the experience exponentially more hilarious and fun.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","December 30, 2015","true","73.0"," 229 of 264 people (87%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","87","229","264","15","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Woskis/recommended/49520/","Woskis","Woskis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Woskis/","238 products in account","This is a kinda game that you pick up, play until your balls are busted, drop it for a while and then pick it up again later.\n\nIt's really fun, with a lot of guns (It is a lot of them. I thought I knew it but I've been told that in vanilla, BL2 had est. 1 mil guns). With a very well made combat and RPG system, this kinda game is something that everyone will gain a laugh out of, especially with friends. However that does not excuse it of the flaws it has.\n\nAs you start the game, a Russian-ish man by the name of Marcus Kincaid tells you the introduction of the story, saying what happened in the ending of B1 (The original Vault Hunters finding and opening the vault only to find "tentacles and disappointment" which is weird since I find tentacles alone disappointing.) However, Hyperion has decided to step into power, by putting a H-formed Space Station over the sun/moon/whatever that thing is, making many of the areas overshadowed, and it also gives the game a "Big Brother" feeling with Hyperion watching Pandora.\n\nYou are one out of 4 (6 with DLC. It's explained that Krieg got involved by riding on the side of the train in the end of "A Meat Bicycle Made For Two" but not how Gaige got in the train) Vault Hunters on a train, to find the new vault that Hyperion has discovered. Then they attempt to kill you, but Axton (as the Commando), Maya (as the Siren), Salvador (as the Gunzerker) and Zer0 (as a number Assassin) manages to together, survive and get into the last train cart, only to find a doll of Handsome Jack the antagonist, wired with loadsa bombs, welcoming them to Pandora before their supposed demise.\n\nThis is where the game begins, with one (or depending on the friends you start with) Vault Hunter waking up in a snowstorm only to have a Steward Bot by the name of CL4-TP (Nicknamed "Claptrap" by his deceased non-existent friends) dig their grave. He finds you waking up, and enlists you as his "Minion" right from the get-go, and instructs you to get to Sanctuary with him.\n\nIt may be a cheesy setup, but it's hella less cheesy than what B1 had.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much "Grab the best that you can deal with until you find better guns to make bullets go out of them and into the enemies' heads and/or bodies." Where you pretty much side quest until you've got guns good enough to face an army without having a Hulk with you (Unless you're playing Psycho where you are the Hulk.) Gearbox are pretty much "Quantity over Quality" when it comes to guns.\n\nHappiness is a warm gun when it comes to this game.\n\nThe RPG system isn't like them Call of Duty games (This is a line you expected didn't you) where you can trade items, bid for them or duel for them with other players. One thing that I HATE though is that you only get 45 skill points instead of 50 when max level (Without DLC).\n\nThe classes available are different from one another, and none of them are your average "rooty-tooty-point-'n'-shooty-man" due to their different trees and action skills. The Commando is the guy who likes Tower Defense games and has a turret with him to shoot and distract different enemies. When upgraded, it can cast a shield for your allies, be thrown on ceilings and walls, carry more guns and even rockets, plus having two of them!\n\nThe Siren is a very much support class, her Phaselock lifts an enemy into the air and surrounds it in a ball of energy, which when upgraded can draw enemies towards it, deal elemental damage to everyone around, make your guns fire faster, and you can even make so that an enemy killed in Phaselock can heal you and your allies. She's also got a skill which lets you heal your allies by shooting them.\n\n\nThe Gunslinger is all about compensating for his (presumably small) dong. He can wield two guns instead of one, and when upgraded can make so that you can distract enemies towards you, being able to gunzerk while downed, have a chance of not spending ammo when firing a gun, and... Just in general shoot two guns.\n\nThe Assassin can turn invisible, and can regenerate health while cloaked, be able to perform backstabs, mark targets which makes them take more damage, throw Kunais with random elemental effects,  or you can make bandits be like "He's like the wind..." by getting increased gun and melee damage when moving (per level). There's also a skill called "B0re" which makes so that your shots have a chance of penetrating enemies and deal more damage every time it goes through someone... Gross.\n\n\nThere are 5 elements in the game, Fire (great against those without a shield), Shock (Great against shields), Corrosive (Incredibly effective towards robots), Explosion (Which is pretty much self-explanotary) and Slag (By "slagging" an enemy, they take more damage when attacked by non-slag weapons.) Guns can either have one of these elements, or just have regular bullets which are all-rounders really.\n\nThere are Pistols, SMGs, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Rocket Launchers and grenades. There's also E-Tech weapons. How do they work? Well, to quote Dr. Zed, "It turns bullets into... Stuff that ain't bullets!" They're different from bullet/rocket launchers. Normally they have better stats than normal guns but are harder to use. To quote Dr. Zed again, "E-Tech is friggin' dope."\n\nHowever the game expects you to do all the side quests, and such can get ahead of you quite a lot of times for people who just wanna beat the story real quick. It also has lots of difficulty spikes throughout the campaign, especially in the New Game Plus (named True Vault Hunter Mode).\n\nDespite all of this, it's a really good game, awesome with friends too. I'd say that you all should go and get it when it goes on a sale.","February 20, 2014","true","256.9"," 172 of 196 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","172","196","0","13"

The game has lots and lots of dlcs for you to enjoy, not to mention all the different guns this game has. It has such a massive variation  , almost every gun spawn with random parts from each manufacturer which makes it even more interesting. The art style is cartoon-ish which i think is absolutely great makes it really cool to play.\n\nThe game has alot of replay value since they give you already 4 characters with their own uniqe skills to play around with plus the two dlc characters. The game is fairly long and there is still alot of stuff to do if you actualy complete it. The world is completely open and there is alot of exploring to do in the game. I've spent up to many hours getting just one gun that i wanted, but when you finally get the gun you have been farming or hunting for you really feel that you have achieved something.\n\nI made alot of friends in the past playing this game, either i joined random games or i found someone through the community, we had tons of fun together and we always kept on playing it every day. The coop has space for up to 4 players which i think is just fine considering the balancing of enemies (The more players you harder the game becomes, the better loot you will get.) That's really all i have to say about this wonderful game, I give it 10/10 probably the best game I've ever played, recommended to the highest.","June 22, 2015","true","571.3"," 150 of 167 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","150","167","13","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/recommended/49520/","HSquirrel","HalfSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/","66 products in account","My favourite thing about this game is it’s captivating story. With a lot of humour, this game pulls off an action shooter with RPG aspects and a storyline you should follow. There are lots of sidequests that will take hours to complete, but the benefits of completing this game are well worth the time. With millions of different guns, a lot of different character skins and a unique experience with all the various classes, this game has hours of fun built straight in.\n\nThe game will be fun no matter which class you play, but that’s not entirely due to the class. I found that most of the classes really lack something to keep you interested in, and throughout the whole game it feels like more attention was given to certain classes over others. Story-wise, the siren is pretty much the only class that gets any attention and backstory, as an individual with a history and as a class with abilities. All of the classes have a slight amount of backstory that becomes obvious throughout the game, but Siren has significantly more, and even then it’s very little.\n\nBeyond that, the entertainment value of playing as certain classes over others was very noticeable to me. I played as all the classes, including the 2 DLC classes, and some of the abilities and skill trees and other class-specific aspects were lacking for a bunch of the classes. Some things that were common for all of the classes were that there are certain skill trees that seem obviously better than other ones and significantly simpler to think about, making them seem more attractive, and all of the classes lack enough in-game backstory to really get a feel for them. With all these classes, it comes down to a matter of opinion, what sort of playstyle you like and other such things, but I’ve found that there are some that are distinctly more enjoyable than others.\n\nI think if there were more random Echo Recorders placed around the maps with a bunch of stories about the characters, with more information on them the game could be a lot more interesting. Throughout my playing of the game, I found a couple about Maya (the siren), one about Zer0 (the assassin/ghost) and nothing about any other character. That’s always been something that annoyed me. The stories of the characters may exist somewhere, but if they do, they are probably too hard to find.\n\nIn terms of story, I loved this game. There was a hint of humour in just about every interaction you had with the other characters, and the story overall was very captivating and kept me playing. I think the end-game was a bit lacking and didn’t completely match up with the story, but it was still interesting and I don’t regret playing this game through at all. The side quests in this game were very extensive, and easily one of my favourite aspects of the game. Some sidequests are very tedious and boring, but others are absolutely a blast, like those given to you by Tiny Tina (pun intended ;) ).\n\nThe replayability of this game isn’t infinite, it does get boring to play through the same parts over and over again in this game, but that doesn’t mean you can’t play it more than once at all. Replaying the game in True Vault Hunter Mode, a difficulty increase that allows you to replay the game using your already powerful character, can still be quite fun. The difficulty of the game overall becomes harder while maintaining the same story with no new additions aside from more powerful guns.\n\nThe playstyle in this game is very different from that of most other shooters. In Borderlands, you don’t really need to conserve any ammo and you can run around, jump and do a bunch of other crazy things while still attacking enemies. This makes the game more casual and relaxed, which I found to be pretty enjoyable. You very rarely run out of ammo, with all the excessive boxes with tons of different types of ammunition and the cheap price at which you can buy ammo in shops.\n\nThat brings me to my next point, which is the excess of money in this game. There is very rarely an opportunity where spending money makes much sense or is beneficial, with ammo being really cheap and not really affecting your money and most of the items in shops being pretty bad compared to the ones you can get outside from drops. I know a lot of people enjoy using the slot machines at Moxxi’s bar, but I never found it that entertaining when it for the most part doesn’t get me anything decent. Pretty much the only point of collecting money is to get the badass ranks.\n\nThe whole badass system is something I really like in Borderlands. Being able to slightly upgrade your character in about every way imaginable pretty awesome. Slowly, you’ll amass badass ranks by completing these missions, the more difficult missions resulting in more badass ranks, and for every 25 badass ranks you’ll get 1 badass token which can be used to upgrade one of the 5 stats presented. I really like the additional content that this adds to the game.\n\nPersonally, I far prefer playing this game with other people. I don’t like playing very many games alone, and even if I’m playing a singleplayer game, I like to be talking to other people at the same time. I find it a lot more enjoyable, and the same thing applies to this game. I’ve never played this game without other people simply because every moment allows for a lot more laughing and interaction when you’re doing it with other people. If I had played through this game alone, I might have noticed some interesting bits of humour, but I never would have started laughing hysterically at some glitchy motion or funny joke. The enjoyment is multiplied by a lot when playing this game with other people.\n\nSomething I noticed is that everyone plays this game differently. Personally, I like to play it patiently, doing all the sidequests, and being sure I’m making the right decisions with my skill points and gun choices. When I play Borderlands, I also like to play for as long of a period as possible. Of course I know nothing is that big of a deal, but I like being patient with this game and spending time on everything because I like feeling that I’m making the right decisions. Some of the people I have played with like to speed through the game and skip any extra content and make the easiest decisions possible. I think it’s important to play with people that have at least a similar mindset to you so that you aren’t being forced to play in a way that you aren’t entirely comfortable with.\n\nWarning: Slight spoilers in following paragraph. Reader discretion is advised.\nThe final boss of the game really irked me. There was a whole obsession with how it was summoned using a siren and the key, both of which are very eridium oriented. The final boss used a lot of fiery attacks and swam in the pools of lava that surrounded the boss fight. I think it would have made a lot more sense if they were pools of molten eridium or something, with the boss spewing out eridium, or at least something purple, rather than fire.\n\nThis game also has some really amazing individual lines. They are scared all throughout the game, but easily my favourite is the line that Scooter says when you meet him in Sanctuary. I’ve probably ruined the rewatching of that line several times when replaying the game with friends, through my inability to repeat the line properly and because I keep on trying.\n\nOverall, this game can easily be worth $20 depending on how much you play it and how much you enjoy it. I’d recommend getting it on sale simply because I’ve seen it go on sale reasonably often, for at least 66% off, but the game is also getting older and the Pre-Sequel (another game in this series, taking place between the first and second games) did come out recently. Quite simply, I love the amount of humour in this game, it’s a fun game to sink plenty of time into, and probably one of my top 10 all time games because of how much of a blast I had with it.","November 7, 2014","true","84.3"," 177 of 204 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","177","204","5","3"

See CONCLUSION\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nBorderlands 2 is the sequel to the popular first-person co-op action adventure game Borderlands. Developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K games, it uses the formula which made the first game good and expanded it in astronomical proportions. The game promises larger maps, expanded co-op play, new classes and most importantly, procedurally generated items resulting in an almost infinite weapon & item variation.\n\nThe story picks up after the events of the first game. Hyperion Corporation headed by Handsome Jack has arrived on Pandora, stolen the Vault Key and is driving the inhabitants to near extinction. The Vault Hunters from the first game (Roland, Lilith, Mordecai, & Brick) has gathered what was left of the Crimson Lance and reorganized them into the Crimson Raiders to stop Handsome Jack. The player takes control of a new set of Vault Hunters in their quest to help the Crimson Raiders stop Hyperion from opening a second Vault and unleashing a sleeping monster within.\n\nPROS:\n+ Cell-shaded textures that works well with the art style of the game\n+ Great voice acting and characters, most notably, Handsome Jack\n+  Expanded world which is almost 3 times larger than the first game\n+ New classes with new skills that are fun to play\n+ Entering and inviting for Co-op play is simple and easy\n+ Improved story from the first game with well paced missions\n+ Re-playability. The fun does not end after the final boss! There are new unlockable modes and expanded  adventure with...\n+ Quality Story DLC that adds several hours of game time per DLC campaign\n+ A lot of guns. “87 Bazillion Guns” as claimed by Gearbox\n+ Improved enemy AI that goes well with...\n+ Enemy Variety. Fight of bandits, robots, worms, armoured spiders, flying monsters and a whole lot more, each requiring the player to adapt by changing play-styles.\n+ Substantial amount of unlockable Character customization\n+ Good use of Physx for the benefit of PC gamers\n\nCONS:\n- Texture pop-in. Mostly noticeable when entering the game or entering a new area\n- Loot sharing needs to be improved since ninja looting is a concern for most players\n- In-game voices and messages, even story related ones, can overlap each other. New messages will cancel out any playing messages which is very annoying if your trying to immerse yourself in the story.\n- No ECHO (in-game voice message) replay like the first game. Once a voice-over message given by an NPC is overlapped, there is no way to listen to it again, aside from starting a new game plus.\n- Some DLC maps have glitches\n\nCONCLUSION:\nGREAT GAME and with a good blend of first-person shooting action, coupled with the progression and quest system of an RPG and all the fun and excitement of co-op play. The game expands the world with new classes, new interesting and scenic locations, weapon types, enemy variants and customization. Re-playability is massive due to the unlockable game modes and multiple high quality Story driven DLC. This game can be enjoyed by both Singleplayer or Multiplayer oriented gamers alike due to a well paced story and a very charming Antagonist.\n\nI RECOMMEND this game to anyone looking for a fun coop experience with their buddies or story oriented gamers who likes an immersive experience. Although the game is well worth it's full price, I would still recommend this to be bought on SALE because of how often this title get discounted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

This review is coming from over 2000 hours of game time (Steam and xbox combined) so i know the ins and outs of nearly every part of the game.\n\nTo start with, its a great solid game in which will provide plenty of entertainment for you and friends, solo or in a full team of 4. Yes the game is a blast solo, though alot is said about its co-op experience however that doesn't mean it isn't fun for single players, but obviously you can get more (or less in terms of loot) from playing with friends. This game is addicting, you just want more and better loot and to level up, kill the raid to get loot to kill the raid again, run arenas, play slots, chest farm, boss farm, toilet farm... well those aren't that lucrative. The fast paced gameplay and tense combat is great fun and when you get through without dying or going down you get a real sense of achievment, or relief if you did happen to do down or die. A first playthrough is always a blast and that alone is worth its cost, then if you REALLY enjoyed yourself you get to do it at a higher level, with more challenge, but more reward.\n\nThis game for me is about gameplay, not the story telling, yeah there is a stronger story than BL1 and more narrated side missions it still isn't up there with the likes of halo, GoW or other top, story focused games. So don't go in expecting to have a brilliant campaign story, go in expecting to have fun, and to have a good laugh.\n\nThere are plenty styles of play that Borderlands supports. Like being the center of attention, taking fire, tank it all and kicking out lots of dps at close range? Gunzerker. Like sitting back and sniping? Zer0, who isn't affraid to go ninja and stab enemies in the back. There is the siren, a support character for that team player. Then there's Axton, well, axton is a tricky one, tough to play at the top levels however early game, he shines with his huge tank, area of effect (the nuclear kind) and crowd control. then there are two bonus to provide lots more hours of fun after you get bored of the other four.\n\nYeah the game has its downs, its buggy, the scaling of certain skills, mechanics such as damage over time and certain types weapons just lose out to level. At top end level the game almost becomes unfair to the player forcing them to use only the best gear in the game, specific builds and so on, but then again, it is the top level. Its easy to break certain parts of missions forcing you to reload your game which can be very fustrating, also the AI has some weird quirks but overall isn't too game breaking.\n\nOverall this is a game I would recommend even now just before the pre sequel as this is a game that will never grow old, will allways be fun to pick up and play, yes it has some flaws but to a flawless game is nearly impossible and well this is a game that triggered the looter shooter genre and so it must be good!","September 29, 2014","true","940.8"," 76 of 87 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","76","87","4","2"

The main story is truly funny and enjoyable.\n-Replay value: Having different characters with different play styles, Borderlands 2 stands out as one of the best games.\n-Achievements: You can get all the achievements with some work. None of them are bugged\n-Raid Boss fights: challenging and hard. See my guides on how to beat the Raid bosses under steam community guides. Many people consider Voracidious on op8 solo as hard as any Dark Souls boss\n-You will find yourself laughing over and over again. Handsome Jack "Hey buddy it's me Roland lets go out for milkshakes". Claptrap "Your ability to walk short distances will be Handsome Jack's downfall."  Herbert "this concludes the sound of scarlett sleeping tape 96."\n-Co-op: You can play with your friends which makes the good very fun. The people in the community overall are very nice. I would like to thank the community.\n-Character diversity: You will like this game regardless of your playstyle.\n-Easter eggs: The game has tons and tons of easter eggs. For example, the vault dweller skin is a reference to Fall out.\n-NPC's: Very funny. Tiny Tina is one of the best NPC's in this game. Marcus very greedy (He reminds of Mr. Krabs from Spongebob).\n\nThe Bad: I wish these things Gearbox would improve\n- Vermivorous: he spawns so rarely. While good in theory, Vermivorous hardly spawns even with 4 players\n-While Gearbox improved the legendary drop rates, it is nowhere near as good as Borderlands 1. I hope Borderlands 3 has better drop rates.\n\nThe Mordecai: This was the joke part.\nThank you for reading my comment","May 20","true","941.9"," 59 of 66 people (89%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","89","59","66","25","0"

Borderlands 2 is my favorite shooter franchise, besting Halo for me personally. I love every thing about this game, from the story to the humor. The loot you gain throughout the game as you kill enemies and level up is what makes Borderlands 2 a great and amazing game overall. This game may not be for everyone, but if always was interested in Borderlands 2, then I say go for it.\n\nI personally never played the first that much and jumped straight to Borderlands 2, loved this game so much that I went ahead and got Borderlands 1. Overall Borderlands 2 gets a 9.8 out of 10 for me. For being both original in bringing in RPG elements and shooter elements in a perfect blend of fun which is always a joy playing though.\n\nAlready did 3 playthoughs of this game already and am far from finished with this game at the moment.\n\nWould recommend this gaame to my friends and to those who might want to try this game out.","June 5","true","222.2"," 46 of 47 people (98%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","98","46","47","7","6"

The cell shading art style is different - but beautiful - and can be removed with a minor tweak in the config files if you want to take it off for a small increase in performance. Removing the cell shading does not detract from the beauty of the game, just changing it slightly.\n\nThe storyline, voice work, and pace of the game are all fantastic. And I loved the humour and subtle (and some not so subtle) jokes throughout. Not much else can be said about it without giving too much away.\n\nI would highly recommend purchasing the Game Of The Year edition and playing through the game as each of the characters to explore the differing fight mechanics that come with them. Go in guns blazing as a Gunzerker, or sneak in as an Assassin; the choice is yours. There are a few more characters and others ways to deal with enemies, and those methods will keep you busy for a long time in this game as you explore the world anew each time.\n\nAlthough many of the side quests are not mandatory, they are recommended to be completed to gain experience to be able to progress through the story missions without having to empty hundreds of rounds of ammo into enemies. If you try to run through the story as fast as possible, you will find yourself coming across enemies many levels above your own, and you will die, a lot.\n\nIf you like first person shooters, you'll like this game. If you like 4 player co-op with friends, you'll like this game. And if you want a game that provides a lot of content that is good value for money, you'll like this game (GOTY Edition, anyway).","March 19, 2015","true","144.6"," 54 of 64 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","54","64","7","4"

Yet, the more I play BL2 the more I notice that, if you dissect Borderlands 2 and look at this game piece by piece, it's really not that great, mediocre at best.\n\n- The graphics are mediocre which is cleverly covered up by the comic like art style and its   black lining.\n- The individual places are sometimes "ok" or just nearly unnecessary as you just have to pass through and never come back. To be honest, I found myself saying "I actually dont like this part of the game that much" far too often if.\n- Compared to Borderlands, Borderlands 2's variety of weapons is... lacking. Restrictions of gun combinations appearing ingame give you a lot less options (not that there aren't a lot).\n- Also, it was very much possible to find Purple Weapons in BL that were far better than Legendary Weapons, as they were often just a gimmick. Now, almost every guns best variant is Legendary, which takes away from the regular weapon drops.\n- Lacking animations\n\n\n\nBut as I said, I played a lot of BL2  - and there is a reason for that. You are not supposed to look at BL2 as it's components, but as a whole. Borderlands 2 is one of the most fun experiences I had when playing Video Games so far.\n\n+ Very big variety of weapons and a sh*t ton of loot in general\n+ Humorous Jokes throughout the game that still make me chuckle after playing it the 10th time mixed with lovable characters\n+ Wonderful Muliplayer with friends\n+ Raid Bosses that are challenging but fun (well mostly) to do\n+ Good amount of DLC content\n+ Great Story and Soundtrack\n\nAnd for the final positive point, the option to play the game as you want to play it. I think what brings me back so often, is the possibility to create my own Builds, mess around with my loadouts and just do what I want. Sure there are restrictions or "best" loadouts you find online but for me, a big part of Borderlands 2 is experimenting, finding new stuff progressing skillwise.\n\n\n\nAll in all, Borderlands 2 is a great game and one of my favourites for sure. Should YOU buy it? Yeah sure, go for it! This game has A LOT to offer and if you are a fan of RPGs, Shooters, Comedy or Raids its worth checking out. Despite some of its flaws I mentioned before, I totally love this game to this day and will probably still play it multiple times in the future.\n\nThe GOTY-Edition costs about 16 bucks if I'm correct when on sale, and the rest of the DLCs about 10 bucks when on sale, so why not, you probably wont regret it! :D\n\n9.5/10","May 14","true","292.3"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","47","53","6","3"

Has a lot of replay value. It has a lot of different locations to visit, many quests to do.

I decided to start my experience and somewhere between that moment and the multitute of hours played non stop that preceeded, I had discovered something special indeed. Everything about it sucked me in; the creative art direction, the addicting grind in search of rare loot, and the insane characters that are voiced acted to perfection. The soundtrack plays a major role in this game's success, perfectly lending itself to the atmopshere, as well as some remarkable minimalistic songs used in towns (almost reminiscent of idling in Tristram in Diablo).  It also has something else up its sleeve, something that only comes about every decade or so; the feeling that a definitive classic has been forged, in a modern generation flooded with regurgitated cliches.  Borderlands 2 clevarly adapts gameplay mechanics from tried and true classics such as Diablo and Diablo 2, yet, has been able to produce something entirely unique, a game of the highesty quality and replayablity.\n\nBorderlands 2.

Is there a better visual barometer for satisfaction in videogames than damage numbers popping out of an enemy’s bullet-riddled head? The original Borderlands revelled in this instant gratification, complementing this core conceit with a ‘bazillion’ guns, tight shooting, addictive loot and a droll sense of humour. There’s little wonder why it was such a surprise hit back in 2009, and just as unsurprising that we’re back on the bombastic world of Pandora for Borderlands 2; a sequel that once again basks in the glow of numbers and bullets, hidden treasures and boner jokes.\n\nSet five years after the events of the first game, Borderlands 2 features an entirely new cast of playable vault hunters. After the original group opened the fabled vault and dealt with what was hidden therein, an arrogant prick by the name of Handsome Jack took credit for their actions, declared himself the dictator of Pandora, and is now attempting to plunder the planet of its most valuable resources, hoping to awaken some sort of ancient alien power. You’ll team up with a resistance movement led by the original cast of vault hunters, intent on stopping him and looting the entire planet along the way.\n\nThose same original vault hunters also now have dialogue, fleshing them out as actual characters after their previous stint as mostly silent protagonists. Borderlands 2 presumes you have some sort of reverence for the original cast despite their previous silence, but their inclusion and subsequent portrayals pay off in some interesting ways, both in regards to the narrative and the game’s humour. Most of the dialogue is fairly sharp across the board and its multitude of zany characters, new and old. The first game’s wacky sense of humour remains, with continuous pop culture references and a ludicrous amount of hidden Easter eggs, and this carries into some of the quest design and its inherent physical comedy.\n\nThe humour’s in-your-face nature can be a little much at times, especially when jokes miss or drag on for far too long, but the near constant stream of dialogue keeps Pandora feeling alive, especially in the once-lonely single player. It can be immature at times, relying on cheap gags to generate a chuckle, but there’s also a lot of humorous dialogue that will consistently muster more than a laugh or two, and the majority of its voice acting sells each character with aplomb, delivering some fantastic performances.\n\nThe most substantial improvements come in the gameplay and how you’re able to spec your character. In the first game you could pick the Soldier class, for instance, and by the end of the game you were essentially invincible if you spec’d in the right directions. Your deployable turret could not only lay waste to everything in sight but could also regenerate health and ammunition, leaving you free to stand still and eradicate an entire group of enemies with relative ease. Borderlands 2 has been reworked and is much more balanced, giving each character class a specific playstyle that comes with their action skill and making sure to never overpower them to tedium.\n\nThere are three skill paths to choose from, each one focusing on specific areas, whether it’s improving your action skill, allowing you to do higher damage with certain weapon types, increasing your maximum health and so on. The Assassin, for example, is very similar to the Hunter class from the first game, focusing on sniper rifles and improving their effectiveness. But each class plays much differently in Borderlands 2, so the Assassin’s action skill is comparable to the Siren’s previous phasewalk ability, allowing him to turn invisible for a brief amount of time where he can utilise his melee attacks; something the Berserker class focused on in the first game.\n\nThe gun manufacturers now produce particular kinds of weapons with their own distinct visual characteristics. One such manufacturer is Jakobs, who build Wild West style guns so you’ll find lots of revolvers and rifles that can fire as fast as you can pull the trigger but reload very slowly. Maliwan, on the other hand, builds weapons that deal out elemental damage, so they’re your go to guys if you want to set someone on fire.\n\nWhichever concoction of assorted weaponry you choose, Borderlands 2’s gunplay is tight and intuitive. Whether it’s popping the heads off bandits, melting a robot down with corrosive ammunition or hitting a Skag with the butt of your rifle, the combat remains entertaining long past your first playthrough and into new game+. This is thanks in no small part to improvements made to enemy AI.\n\nIn Borderlands 2, enemies now move with more purpose and dexterity, keeping you on your toes and forcing you to adjust your aim as they dodge and roll, duck and weave. It’s not a massive enhancement in artificial intelligence, but it’s an improvement that gives the combat a more frenetic pace. Suicidal psychos will often charge you, explosives at the ready, while various projectiles are thrown in your direction. You’re constantly dashing from place to place and there’s a fantastic freedom of movement.\n\nThere’s a phenomenal agglomeration of enemies, each befitting of some sublime character design and enjoyable AI. You’ll face off against cloaked monsters, robots that can transform into makeshift tanks and a gargantuan bandit that bursts into a fit of rage, killing friend and foe alike. Each enemy requires a different tactic to beat, whether it’s utilising your action skill, equipping a weapon with a particular type of elemental damage or inciting enemy v enemy combat.\n\nThe game looks sublime on PC as well, particularly if you can run it on close to the highest settings. The cel-shaded art style never fails to shine and there’s some outstanding lighting effects that complement the level design. This is still the same Pandora as the first game but it’s been injected with a burst of colour and environmental variety. The desert wasteland still remains but now there are plains of green grass, snow swept icy caverns and a deep underground mine coated in luminous green acid. The colour pops with the art style like a comic book; Pandora’s exalted sense of place and character still remains.\n\nBorderlands 2 successfully maintains every aspect that made the first game such a surprise hit and improves upon them in all the ways that matter. The majority of these improvements may only be incremental which gives the impression Gearbox took the safe route, avoiding major iteration, but the formula still works. Whether that formula still appeals to you is the real question. If you’ve already spent countless hours with the first game is more Borderlands something you want? If it is then Borderlands 2 is a better game than its predecessor in every way. Just only by a smidgen.","July 21, 2014","true","84.9"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/narukoopa/recommended/49520/","narukoopa","✯ Narukoopa™ ✯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/narukoopa/","178 products in account","All of my reviews are based around my personnal opinion, they're not swayed by a majority of people liking or disliking it.\n\nBetter than  Destiny [www.destinythegame.com]\n\nWorse than  Borderlands 1\n\nNOTE:\nAll of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game.\n\nTL:DR\nBorderlands 2 was quite an experience. It has everything. Guns, enemies, story, badassness, psychos, annoying robots. Borderlands is one of those games that you don't play for just a couple of hours. If you have friends you can play this game with, the game has become twice as more fun. With beautiful locations, an amazing story and hilarious characters this is an absolute must recommend! Buy it already!\n\nAbout\nBorderlands 2 is a first-person shooter RPG where you choose one of four characters, (six if you have the dlcs) and start through an epic journey. The game is set on a planet called Pandora, which is inhabited by bandits. You may notice in the trailer, there are a lot of guns. All unique in their own way. You can have a gun that shoots fire, you can have a gun that electrifies people e.t.c. Borderlands 2 is one of those story rich games that is even better with other people. A successor to the original, with added detail, more characters, and whole new locations ranging from freezing ice plains, to deserts, and even to countrysides, Borderlands, even with death everywhere, has a beauty to it.\n\nGameplay\nIt's a first-person shooter, gameplay is going to be the main part in it. This game is filled with action almost all the time. There are dozens of types of enemies which can harm you in different ways. The game may make you rely on different types of weapons. For example, an armoured enemy will take more damage from a corrosive weapon, an enemy with a shield will take more damage from an electric weapon, or an enemy with no defense would take even more damage from an incendiary weapon. This can be awkward if you don't have those weapons. As I mentioned before, this game is amazing if you have friends playing it with you. The more people in a game with you, the harder the enemies, but also the better the loot. Go through an epic journey exploring the wilds, completing side quests and complain about who gets what weapon. Then there's the dlcs....\n\nStory\nNote that I'm not going to spoil the story at all in this. Only the basis of it.\nOne of the best stories I've ever seen in a video game. It has exciting, dramatic parts, to emotional and sad parts. Borderlands 2 always keeps you on your toes. The story is set on a planet called Pandora, which has an uninvited guest, a company called Hyperion. The leader, Handsome Jack, wants to mine a mysterious alien element called eridium, to open a ruin on Pandora called, The Vault. You, and/or your friends are tasked with saving the planet, and defeating Handsome Jack. As well as a main story, there are also side quests, which contain their own stories within them. There are hundreds of side quests in the game for you to explore, and if need be, build XP on to level up.\n\n\nDesign & Graphics\nBorderlands 2, as you can see by the screenshots, is a very cartoonish game, but not in the way you might imagine it. Although cartoonish, It's actually beautiful. Some environments leave you stunned. Graphics can be adjusted in the settings to make the game look even more pretty. If you don't have a perfect PC, this game can lag quite a lot, and the FPS can go down really low. Again, for the design, It's sublime. Almost everything is detailed. Open wildernesses are detailed quite well. The only negative thing I'll mention is mushy backdrops in some places.\n\nUI [User Interface]\nThe Ui is rather basic to be quite honest. You have a basic hud in-game which shows your health, your shield, your ammo, your ability and a minimap. When you press the tab button, you open up a new menu which manages your inventory, your skill tree, your quests, your map and your challenges. You shouldn't have any problem navigating where to go. The game gives you basic tutorials on where everything is anyway. The main menu is also rather basic. Settings are easy to navigate. Had no problems here, neither should anyone else.\n\nPros - An amazing story\n- Hilarious characters\n- Beautiful environments\n- Great soundtrack\n- Worth plenty of hours of playtime\n- Entertaining co-op\n- Great replay value\n- So many guns!!!!\n- Epic DLCs\n\nCons - Inventory space can be a pain.\n- Sometimes relying on co-op too much.\n- Sometimes bland backdrops.\n- Some PCs may struggle when it comes to FPS.\n\nFinal Recommendation\nBorderlands 2 is an almost perfect game, which is worth hundreds of hours of playtime. Whether it be alone or with friends, this game is addicting as hell. I'm still not bored of it and I doubt I will be for a long time. Finishing the game may seem like you've done a lot, but then you hae the dlcs to finish, which will give you even more guns, and even more fun!!! A must play for anyone, even if it's not on sale!\n\nFinal Verdict - 10/10.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKVf5feSMEg\n\nIf you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

At times, the utterly hectic action can be fantastic fun and, without reservation, it's a game you should buy.\nBut there are problems! There isn't a difficulty setting and people find the game too easy or too hard. The entire game is carefully balanced, and that balance is easily upset, leading to unrewarding play. Also, despite being coop, it's almost impossible to play with friends, because the levelling system makes a huge difference even if you are only a few levels different to each other.\nThe DLC is highly variable. It wasn’t developed by Gearbox, and it show’s. The maps are generally very well designed, but the gameplay and rewards are lacking. In particular, Hamerlock’s is one you just want to get through as quickly as possible. The UVHM is essential though, and probably justifies the price of the Season Pass all by itself.  The bosses do start to get ridiculously tough in the DLC’s, pretty much demanding four players.\nIt’s an incredibly detailed and fun game to play. Yes it has plenty of faults, but it still remains one of the best games ever produced. Now that it's starting to drop in price, you have no excuse not to buy it.\n","July 26, 2013","true","062.6"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","4"

Borderlands 2 is near perfect.\n\nThe level design is inspired. The story is great, and the voice work is great. You have to listen to the various things the bandits say when you are fighting them. They often die with a funny one-liner.\n\nIt's a run and gun with LOTS of guns, much like the first Borderlands, only MORE polished and with deeper levels of writing. I can't see where the dreary "I'm so serious" 4 and 5 review scores are coming from. We are talking about VIDEO games. This one has a fine balance between instant fun and long term 'purpose'.\n\nThere are a few minor mechanics that could be improved. The player character could certainly benefit from a jet pack or another way to get around faster! Bigger levels and easier access to the structures through a climbing mechanic would be nice. Otherwise great work Gearbox.\n\nI like it so much I just went and bought ALL the DLC at full price, to be sure the developers get a taste of my money!

It'll run you right now about $15-$18 and you'll have all the DLC's worth having without rebuying or spending a bunch of money. It gets asked constantly in the forums.\n\nClassic FPS that can have a high entertaintement/hour value with replayable storylines, scaleable enemies, with better and better loot as you go. There are three main types of BL2 players I've seen. You have the diehard, the casual, and the barely interested. The diehards love doing the playthroughs, they love farming bosses and loot, they love the skills; they are great players and they have above 1k hours in the game, they can talk shop about this game all day but they're a dying breed because the game does have a half life for how interesting it is; the diehards will buy the game when it comes out, they don't need a steam sale, they'll buy all the DLCs and they bought TPS (the pre-sequel) for $60 the day it came out and already have 50 hours on it. The barely interested will wait for the steam sale, they'll wait for a few friends and they'll play up to level 30, maybe 60, they'll buy only the GOTY version, and theyll have 40 hours and be done with it. The hard part is figuring out if you're a casual player since you've never played the game.\n\nThe best way for a casual player to play is to select the most interesting character to you (first time favorites: commando, siren, assassin) and you play them through until you finish all the storylines, challenges, achievements, sidemission and do level 1 to 72 to op8, that will take about 200-300 hours. Then you normally don't want to do another complete playtrhough of a couple hundred hours so you get powerleveled through to op8 on the other characters and you can go through the storylines easier, you can play with the skills and see how the skills work and even more fun see how the skills work with all the loot, most likely duped loot. Most of your playtime then will be helping others get there missions done, doing raid bosses, a little farming and the game will reach its half life, that will take another few hundred hours and you'll be finished with the game.","January 28, 2015","true","353.0"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dat-silly-goose/recommended/49520/","dat-silly-goose","silly'Goose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dat-silly-goose/","222 products in account","This is a game that completely shocked me. I knew nothing about Borderlands during it's release. Being honest, I thought, "oh great, another shooter... I bet it's some cliche post apocalyptic first preson shooter where the player is the game's only last hope. Just another Call of Duty. GUNS?! Ughh. Boringgggggg!"\n\nHOWEVER, I ended up recieving it as a gift thanks to a good friend, and I was completely wrong.\n\nBorderlands 2 is meant to be played CO-OP with friends. Everything is well done. The game provides a large variety of guns with different abilities and elements.  You have to plan and think which gun is good for what situation and some are just straight out flashy and worth keeping just for personal preference. There is also a detailed skill tree system that allows the player to create the most BADASS character where the player can focus on what they want the most on. Best of all, there no pressure because everything is straight out obvious and there no PVP, so you never feel overwhelmed by tryign to make a perfect character to compete with others. I choose the cheap way and just max out my Turrent on the Commendo class. While the good character creation and a variety of guns are great, the gameplay can vary. At times, it can get really intense, ostentatious, BADASS! Hordes of enemies left to right, explosions everywhere, your PC probably screaming and explosing inside by the amount of particles  and graphical effects happenning in your screen. But, if you aren't a fan of shooters, you may at times find it repetitive as there are certain moments that feel the same. Some can argue it's just player heads to objective and kill a horde of enemies every time. I can't blame you if you feel like that, but...\n\nBorderlands 2 is the epitone for story games that prove that a fantastic story makes a game better even if it feels like a fetch and grind MMO style game. It took a game that barely had a story and  used all the characters and story plot to create this  shockly interesting story. It's like if you took coal and turn it into gold, but this is gold writing!  In addition, Handsome Jack, a new character, is pretty much the main star of the game as he guides the player throughout the game and introduces the history of Paradora. The humor in some way is very immature, childish, and goofy that you'd think it would have been written by a 12 year old. However, in my opinion everything is soo balance and even immature cussing jokes are actually funny and never feel overuesd. Being a child I am, I always get a laugh when I hear the word "Badass". (However, I know some people would disagree, so read about it with caution when buying). Reguardless, it's soo well done that you end up wanting to know more about the game, so you end up doing every single side quest just to know what exactly happen. Almost no quest feels like a chore because the story is what motivates you to keep playing. During your progression, he does so many bad thing in such a sarcastic and sinster way that you can't wait to have the opporunity to punch him right in his freaken handsome face. but at the same time, you begin to hate him in a way that you're actually interested in knowing more about him if that makes sense. Who exactly is he, how did he take over Hyperion corporation, why does he hate you and the vault hunters so much, why is he so freaken handsome?!?!!\n\nBuy the GOTY during a sale! Some of the season pass and level packs expansion are essential for the true experience! Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep expansion DLC is the minimum you need if you are just interested in the story because it is the conclusion of the story of Borderlands 2. This is no Mass Effect 3, I promise you that! The ending on Borderlands 2 is satisfying, but Tiny Tina concludes the game in a surpising way. Not to mention, who doesn't love dungeons and dragons?\n\nOverall, I absolutely recommend this game to anyone as long as you have friends to play with. It can be played alone. If you do, I recommend Commando or Mechromancer class because they have the ability to spawn a turrent or mech-robot that aids the player in tough situations.","July 26, 2015","true","87.8"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","4"

Borderlands 2 is an improvement (for the better) in nearly every aspect of the original game.  Borderlands 2 comes with a much better story, much more varied environments and enemies, better user interface and more variety in the way the gear behaves.\n\nThe cooperative system is also very much improved in Borderlands 2.  The game moved away from using Gamespy for an online lobby and now uses full Steam integration with drop-in and out cooperative play.\n\nThe game features 4 new classes (Soldier, Siren, Gunzerker and Assassin) with 2 others available for purchase via DLC (Mechromancer and Psycho).  Each class features all-new skill trees that have been mostly well designed and appear to work well for both solo and team play.\n\nMost of the original cast of NPC characters have returned along with a few new ones.  The story is very well written this time with an extremely interesting villain in Handsom Jack.  The story for Borderlands 2 does attempt to be a continuation of the original game and miraculously improves the previously lackluster story to a point where it now actually makes some sense.  The game also includes a TON of sidequests and activities so you can expect to have about 30 hours of gameplay with the main questline and roughly 50+ hours if you include most of the side activities.  There are 4 large campaign DLC and a variety of smaller DLC packs which will add significantly to an already huge amount of content.\n\nThe only few negative things that I have found in the game include:\n1)  Less storage space than you had in the original game.\n2)  Inability to replay echo logs like you could in the original.\n3)  There is much more dialog (good) but too easy to interrupt (bad) with no way to replay as mentioned in my second point above.\n\nOverall I feel that Borderlands 2 is a huge improvement over the original in most aspects and the many improvements definitely outweigh the few negatives.  I have newer games in my library but this one always keeps drawing me back.","June 28, 2013","true","454.0"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","1"

This is my most played game (unless you count hours I spent on Super Smash Bros on the Wii, and the F2P games of League of Legends and TF2)\n\nThe game itself is great. Improved upon the original. With new characters and new abilities. I am glad I bought this game pre-release, and all the dlc content (not the skins).\n\nPeople may complain that they do not get everything with the GOTY edition. But here's the thing everything thats not in the GOTY is just skins. The headhunters are just a skin pack basically. You get 1 new one with each character instead of buying 1 per character at a set amount. Yea maybe there is a mission, but the mission has nothing to do with the main game and is just so you can earn that character skin.\n\nThe main DLC itself. I would rate Tiny Tina's DLC as one of the best side stories I have ever played - you have knights, monsters, warlocks, dragons, magic missiles, SWORDSPLOSIONS!!!. It also delves into the mind of a child dealing with grief.\nThe other DLC, Pirates and Torque are also very good. Mister Torque is one of my favorite new characters (after Tiny Tina of course). EXPLOSIONS!!!\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game hands down one of my all time favorite games. Hopefully, you will find it enjoyable as well.","December 21, 2013","true","385.0"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

I thought it was a slow paced and quite boring game. This all changed as I pushed myself to continue playing. The quests are entertaining and suprisingly replayable, the variety of characters beckoned me to try out their very different play styles and powers, and the feeling of getting a better item than your current one never gets old. The DLC is worth the money and gives you new environments that are different to the vanilla games offerings. It is also a very good game with friends, especially with 4 different classes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dashima/recommended/49520/","dashima","dashi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dashima/","105 products in account","Wow... I think I'm in love with the Borderlands universe.\n\nThere's just something really special about this game: the way the characters grow on you, the explosive atmosphere, the compelling story, the weird but incredible way they weave heavy moments and introspection in a game filled to the brim with humor, gore and internet memes. I feel like this game is the best it can get, or at least until Gearbox or some other developer comes up with something even better. With such a diverse cast of characters, I find it hard to imagine NOT being able to relate to at least one of them despite how extreme their personalities can be. It's not all haphazard extremeness either and each is endearing in their own way. The game is very inclusive of queer characters and neurodivergent characters. They follow stereotypes, they break stereotypes, and their differences are natural and introduced as such. Handsome Jack is on par with Pagan Min as my favorite antagonist. Every character feels alive and has defining dialogue and the areas you can explore are often beautiful. Pandora is a harsh yet vibrant world that you will blast through over and over until you finally come out on top. The FPS genre generally isn't very memorable but here's a game that smashes the rules and brings out its own style.\n\nGunplay is the heart of Borderlands and there is a huge number of quests you can complete to gain better guns, loot and experience. I found levelling and looting enjoyable and the skill trees are decent but slightly underwhelming as a lot of them become useless if you grind to endgame difficulty modes. It goes without saying... there's a lot of grinding in this game and a couple "fetch" sidequests. Especially early on when you're stuck with some really low level equipment. But once you get past that initial slow start, the game really picks up and you'll find yourself shooting electricity out of shotguns and facing more challenging opponents with better rewards. I think the only gripe I might have with the gameplay is that some bosses felt poorly designed-- sort of same-y with almost all of them having unavoidable area-of-effect attacks. Until recently the drop rates for legendaries was notoriously difficult but has been fixed. Minor bugs exist but with the rest of the game being completely incredible I found them more funny than annoying.\n\nThere are four playable characters (plus two more in GOTY edition) that each have their own perks and quotes. No matter who you choose you'll have a good time while they rattle off at enemies or make it to second wind just in time. There's Axton, Pandora's most handsome (next to Jack!) but smart-mouthed bisexual man, who makes a great tank and support. Maya, an ace siren, is my personal favorite with her phaselock ability and makes for a nicely balanced offense and support unit as well. Her background ties her in somewhat with the going-ons of the game and playing her can involve you more in the story. Zer0, my other favorite, is your key "outsider" nameless, mysterious type. He recites haiku and displays emotes on his face.... which is honestly more adorable than it should be. You just can't quite put your finger on him but that's probably part of his charm. It should be noted that although he's an assassin class, there's no stealth (this is not a subtle game!) but over time he can become a very specialized, powerful character. Sal is the only one I haven't tried out yet but from what I've heard his skill tree makes him one of the most OP tanks in the game. Sadly there isn't a lot of backstory on the protagonists but there's plenty on all the other NPCs you'll be dealing with.\n\nUPDATE: I've finished playing all the characters to OP8 and Sal is the pure definition of this game. EXPLOSIOOOONS! Gaige and Krieg, the other two characters included in GOTY/season pass as dlc, are fun, fast-paced power tanks. Highly recommended.\n\nThis is an attractive game full of creativity and it's clear upon playing that the people who made this game really put in a lot of effort and attention (and also memes) into it. Aside from the characters, small details like occasional ECHO logs and the differences in gun part brands add depth. The landscapes and cartoony art are great and perfectly suit the game's action-savvy theme which creates a unique combination of lightheartedness and gore. I loved the day-night transitions and many areas make for some beautiful, detailed scenery that are nice to look at while you're in or out of a fight. The world is literally blowing up with fun! And despite some really tough mobs you'll crawl through, you might find yourself coming back for more because there's nothing quite like it. For a game that makes a million jokes, I copped lots of feels and it somehow really touched me.\n\nIf you have the time and energy to spare, I strongly recommend the GOTY edition. Tiny Tina and Captain Scarlett's DLC that are included with it are some of the biggest, best DLC I've seen to date. There are many ways to play the game and trying out new characters or difficulty modes lends itself to some high replayability. On days you just want to sit back, kick some butt and feel like a badass, this is the perfect solution for everyone and anyone. Now excuse me while I write a love letter to gearbox.","March 21, 2015","true","919.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","17","17","3","1"

The controlls are simple how they should be in every game. Theres alot of quests and side quests. Guns are also very much in this videogame. I can't even count them all.

You level from 1-72 with the dlc, without i think the max level is 50. You get XP from killing enemies and completing quests, whatever level you are the enemies will be similar so its never easy!! there are so many guns and items it would be impossible to count!!! seriously there's no other game with more guns than borderlands 2, After you complete the game on normal you unlock true vault hunter mode which is harder, new enemies and new weapons and better loot, after you complete that you unlock ultimate vault hunter mode which is the same again, new weapons, enemies and better loot you also can get pearlescent weapons then too which you cant in the others, there's sooooo many sidequests it would take you so so long to complete all of them, the characters in this game are amazing and hilarious, also the characters you get to play as (choose from 4 or 6 if you have the dlc) are all unique, they have different skills and powers so you could find yourself completing the game countless times over different characters and builds, there's also character custamization with new skins and heads and there's tons of them and they're so cool!! you can loot these or unlock by doing challenges, this is my favourite game by far i've currently completed the story twice and i'm now playing on ultimate vault hunter mode, 48 hours in and the game has only just started.. i rushed the second playthrough and are saving the sidequests and all the dlc for this last one, there's just so much to do and it never gets boring ever!\n\neverything you want in a game is right here\n\nCharacter Customization\nLoot (Endless amounts)\nLeveling up XP\nOpen World\nMASSIVE GAME I will be putting atleast 300 hours into this game, All DLC Included\nCO-OP\n\nJust buy it, dude.","July 1, 2014","true","110.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Check.\n\nDon't like looting and just want to proceed with the quest? Check, but do some sidequests to make sure you level up pretty evenly.\n\nDo you like an interesting story?   I can't say it's very complex, but it makes you feel with the characters (both lmao and "muh feels")\n\nDo you like interesting characters?   It's Borderlands, were you expecting something NOT interesting about them?\n\nDo you like content?   Even without GOTY, this game has at least 40~ hours before you beat the main campaign; nevermind the pretty cool sidequests you get.   With GOTY, you can expect well over 120-150 hours before you beat everything (again, with proper side-quest balancing)\n\nPersonally, I rate this a 9.5/10, since the only drawback I saw was that sidequests WERE a requirement, or else you'll get creamed in the main campaign.    They're not boring though (maybe in contrast to the main campaign), so that's always a plus.","September 25, 2015","true","53.5"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatterwaltz/recommended/49520/","Shatterwaltz","Ibitsu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatterwaltz/","257 products in account","If I were to describe video games in an extremely complicated metaphor that tied in mammals, reptiles, ethnic food, and figures from mythology, Borderlands 2 would be something like a Platypus-Snake-JapaneseSesameChicken-Surma.\n\nPlatypus: Why a platypus? Because Platypuses/Platypeese/Platypii are unique. They're a weird hybrid thing that is actually pretty cool. Borderlands is practically a second cousin of the platypus, with all that uniquity. The best way I can think to explain it would be to draw up the image of an MMO. MMOs let you run around, level up, dump skill points everywhere, find loot to kill things to find more loot of varying rarity, and some of them let you enter instanced dungeon areas to kill monsters with your friends (Where applicable).\nBorderlands is pretty similar to that, but it's a first person shooter. You pick a class, get killed first thing off, and then start your adventure as the semi-official minion of the incessantly talking Wheatley/Gir mashup named Claptrap(More like shut-your-trap, amirite?). Your adventure will have you killing enemies for random loot, levelling up to get different perks that let you build your own style of character, and taking side quests from NPCs. the whole game is like one of those aforementioned instanced dungeons, where you can drag up to three friends (Or, should you lack those, random people online that probably hate you just because they are the internet) and go monster slaying. I've heard that if your friend takes your loot, you can stop being friends and then challenge him to a now-unfriendly duel to kill him and take what's rightfully yours. I wouldn't know, because I don't really..... have... friends. And I hate the internet people.\nIn summary: Borderlands 2 is an FPSMMO but not MMO because instead of being massive multiplayer it's like 4 multiplayer, but still retains all the typical trimmigns of one of the nicer MMOs. It's like halo with quests.\nAfter your head finishes exploding at how fun that sounds, carry on reading.\n\nSnake: Snakes look pretty cool, and they make neat sounds.\nYou know what else looks cool?\nI do! I have awesome curly hobbit hair like Frodo.\nBut I'm not the only cool-looking thing around. Cel-shaded graphics are pretty neat as well. Borderlands 2 has a really cool art style that makes it super obvious you're playing Borderlands and not something else. For the easily confused, it may be nice to be able to tell what game you're playing at a glance.\nSound-wise, it's wunderbar (German for wonderful. Also useful: "Der Mann isst das Kind" means "I like children", which is good to know because people trust you more if you like children). Everyone's voiced, and they voiced real nice. Guns sound like guns. Bad guys sound like bad guys and say things like "I will kill you" before making guns noises come out of their guns.\n\nJapanese Sesame Chicken: HOLY CHILDREN OF GOD SESAME CHICKEN IS GOOD. I order it every time I go to a Japanese restaurant, much in the same way I ordered Borderlands 2. fun is good, and Borderlands 2 is fun. Everyone is funny, and you can't spell funny without fun. You can't spell gun without un, and you can't spell fun without un. You also can't spell undertaker without un, but that's not applicable here.\nDialogue is full of funny things, a couple of which made me pause the game so I could laugh for a while (Claptrap talking about his own voice is my favorite line so far).\n\nSurma: Surma is the Finnish god of violent death, if wikipedia tells the truth. Science has been performed to prove that wikipedia is true. So scientifically speaking, (Is that what scientology is?) Surma is real, and Surma is in this game a lot because you will death-initely be violently death-ing a whole death-ing lot of things with all your fancy guns you pick up (Which feel great by the way. Some shooters feel horrible, and other just "feel right" or something). Lots of fun stat comparing to be had, so you can put that statistics* class to use for once. It seems like Surma might be the only god in here though, besides maybe the god of fun if that's a thing (Sheogorath?).\nAll your quests will boil down to "walk here" followed by "shoot the bad things" (Don't worry, they are bad things like enemies, so it's fine to shoot them. Claptrap addresses this as well, if you are suffering any moral twinges about this.) and then "pick up the things" and then finally "take the thing to the guy" to get a profitable return. So not much variety. the story behind each will be different, ranging from r/interesting to "You srsly ask me do this."\n\n\nThe complete Platypus-Snake-JapaneseSesameChicken-Surma package:\nI like this game. I only have a couple hours as of this review, but it seems like I'll be grabbing plenty more, even though none of me jolly mates have it. I'll get them eventually. It may eventually wear itself out, but if that unholy grindfest Warframe held my attention for an extreme 172 hours, I don't think I'll get sick of Borderlands 2 anytime soon. ESPECIALLY if my imaginary friends get imaginary computers and play with me.\n\nOverall score: Great out of ten. I told steam to give it the blue thumb and not the red one. Hail Surma.\n\n\n\n*After talking to a dormmate, I have come to realize that statistics is not about how to compare weapon stats in video games. I will try to petition and have that made a thing though.\n","February 9, 2014","true","12.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I've been longing for a sequel ever since I played the original game back in 2009.Every sequel should be improved upon its prequel. Borderland 2 does what Borderland didn't do back at that time,and it does it better.\n\nEverything in the game is just an improved version of the original Borderland. I was so skeptical at first. I was so excited about the game when it first came out. I wanted to try it on my new custom-built PC. The results for me, were just amazing and satisfying\n\nBorderlands 2 story didn't make sense and had no actual plot, but if you played the original game and knew what the hell was going on. The four previous characters awakened a big-a$$ monster "final boss of Borderland 1" and caused a disruption. A material called an Eridium scatters all over Pandora and becomes the currency for black market and the new big thing for research.\n\nThey finally ditched outdated GameSpy for online co-op games and integrated Steam, which is more than warm welcome. Despite the changes, some players still have issues with online gaming, mostly caused by their router configuration.\n\nOverall: Borderlands 2 is one of the best games of this year. If you've played the original then you'll instantaneously be familiar with everything and u will like this sequel better. Although I miss my Lilith/old characters but i forgot to say that im still playing borderlands 1 and it is still my favorite BL till this moment come join me BL1 honeys.\n\nNow go buy/play Borderlands 2!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/49520/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","I have never played the original Borderlands. I decided to play Borderlands 2 to see what this franchise is like. I first noticed the cel-shaded graphics and a diverse number of characters to choose from. After I chose my protagonist (Gunzerker) I had to get used to the skill trees, the wacky characters, the large number of side missions in addition to the main story missions. One of the wackiest characters is Claptrap, a robot with something to say all the time and is quite delusional.\n\nThe story is set in Pandora, a planet filled with vicious creatures of all kinds. The planet is control by Handsome Jack, the main antagonist of the game. As you progress through the game you will regularly hear Handsome Jack’s speak sarcastically about your goal to bring him down. There are many Echo recorders that will help flesh out the story and who Handsome Jack really is.\n\nThe script and voice acting in Borderlands 2 is nothing short of superb. The voice actors and script writers should be highly commended for making the characters such as Scooter, Moxxi, Claptrap and others very entertaining. The only problem I found with the voices was that some conversations can be interrupted by other conversations before you can hear them completely. However, it’s not such a bad thing for the game overall.\n\nThere is plenty to explore and if you’re into exploring as much as possible, Borderlands 2 will entertain you for 100+ hours. Each sector of the map has its own environmental feel and its own creatures. The DLCs add even more content for you to explore, but you are best advised to advance your character to at least level 20 because the enemies are much tougher than those enemies in the main story. The DLCs are divided into chapters and side missions while the battles with tougher creatures will reward you with lots of experience points. The side missions in the main game are definitely worth pursuing, as they include puzzle elements and some very simple goals such as simply shooting someone in the face in the side mission titled “Shoot This Guy in the Face.” Other side missions require you to find certain items to receive a unique weapon such as the side mission titled “The Lost Treasure”, a mission that requires you to find different parts of a treasure map. The parts can be anywhere in a region, but the payoff is huge in the form of a very powerful pistol.\n\nPart of what makes Borderlands 2 great in gameplay is the diverse availability of weapons, shields, grenade mods, class mods, and relics. Class mods and relics have ways of enhancing your character’s combat abilities. The inventory feels a little clunky, but once you get used to it you can navigate it pretty quickly. The inventory is important for using in the various vending machines for buying ammo, selling ammo and streamlining.\n\nRespawning is an integral part of this game, as enemies will respawn when you return to the same sector. It may feel tedious after a while, but it can be rewarding because these are opportunities to gain more experience as you try to reach the level of 50. To max out your character you will have to complete the normal mode in order to open up the True Vault Hunter Mode. It is important to know the strengths and weaknesses of enemies so that you know which weapons and ammo work best against them. For example, the loaders (mechanical bots) are vulnerable to corrosive ammo. Therefore, it is best to use a corrosive weapon to kill them faster. The crystallisks are hulking creatures with shins that are made of brittle crystals. Shooting their brittle shins is the only way to bring them down.\n\nThis game encourages cooperative play, so it can be fun playing with friends. However, it is better to play with friends who are at a level close to yours, although the game automatically balances the difficulty according to the levels of the players. It is a great feeling trying to heal fellow players in dire times. The unusual feature of death is interesting because there is a chance to achieve a second wind if you get a kill while you’re dying and the red meter is going down to zero.\n\nI found the save system awkward since it saves everything that happens. If you leave the game while in the middle of a mission, you will have to pick up where you left off and the enemies you killed will respawn. In essence, the save system consists simply of save and quit.\n\nBorderlands 2 is one of the most entertaining role-playing games with so much to explore. The gameworld is thriving with loot and opportunities to reap the rewards of doing favors for other townsfolks. I highly recommend this game to anyone as it will take many, many hours of your time and those hours will feel worth it.","September 8, 2014","true","146.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","8"

Considering I'm not much of an FPS fan (I haven't played BL1, note that), the number of hours I've put into this game is actually something I didn't plan out or expect.\n\nFirst to run through was pretty fun, and somewhere halfway around the second one (if not for the DLCs), the game start to drag a little bit on solo. I particularly liked how skills can be conveniently reset anytime along side with the large variety of weapons (gun porn~!). Trying out different builds made the game really interesting to play. I also like how some quests have quirky and funny storylines.\n\nIf you're playing with friends, it's a great game to play! At this point in time, I don't think I'll be picking up BL2 again if I weren't playing with someone else. At higher levels, raid bosses get to be more frustrating than challenging, and the cycle of running through the same thing - griding and trying to score good loot just wears me out.\n\nI picked this game up on sale and bought it with friends, so the experience of laughing at Claptrap cursing stairs was really awesome. I would definitely say it's at least worth the money and worth playing.","December 19, 2014","true","152.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psndarksaw/recommended/49520/","psndarksaw","Gin Alcohoilia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psndarksaw/","116 products in account","Borderlands 2\n\nBorderlands 2 is a fun game about Vault Haunters that seek for a treasure worth lots of money. That's the whole plot of this game and the rest is pure fun and comedy, now the game. The game is different from other shooters, it mixes RPG elements with first person shooters, it's preety much funny and has ridicoulous weapons. The game itself is a fun and somehow challenging way to spend time. The enemies get harder each time you progress through the game and you have to level up when you want to go on. However it isn't the perfect shooter game... This game has some flaws that could of been solved (Maybe not all of them but most of them). Some things I didn't like about the game was the fact that it can get repetitive and that at times if you want to continue and enemies are a higher level than you, you might have to grind... Which of course isn't a good thing, specially on a game with so many RPG elements. This game has a skill tree too which lets you use abilities to affect the way you battle, this feature was implemented in the first game and hasn't changed in any way. You can first level up only 3 abilities on the 3 skill trees that you have, each skill tree can give you different skills and of course like in any RPG you need skill points, you earn these by leveling up. You can also earn badass coins that will randomly level up one stat of your character. This can come in handy later on but the game doesn't show you about this feature and I discovered it while messing around in the menus. This game has alot of DLC too, each of them is fun and preety cheap compared to the ones from other games... Like most EA games but that's another topic. The season pass can get you most story DLC but still doesn't give you all of it, the way the developers still support this game via DLC is very good and I like it, if you are against DLC and you think it'll never be close to the full game expirience you are wrong. The DLC takes time to make and isn't just a golden skin weapon pack or something similar. Now let's talk about the Co-Op feature. This feature has been implemented since the first game and you can play it with 2-4 people. This is a huge help but if you aren't playing the same quest it can be tough, since each player that joins will make every enemy tougher. I recommend playing it from the start to finish with a buddy. You can try out a new character if you want but that's your choice. Something useful about Co-Op is the revive feature that can save you and your buddies alot, specially when you are going on a location with enemies that have a higher level or are just harder than usual. This game has lots of potential and I can't wait for the PS Vita version I give it a 4.5/5.","February 10, 2014","true","7.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","4"

Вскрытие героями Хранилища спровоцировало выход эридиума — сверхценного ресурса, на добычу которого направлена деятельность корпорации «Гиперион». Красавчик Джек, возглавивший «Гиперион», объявил политику очищения планеты от бандитской заразы колонистов, которые для совместного противостояния корпорации сплотились в местечке под названием Убежище. Таким образом, сюжетным фоном выступает классическая борьба могущественных, многочисленных, но «злых» эксплуататоров и слабых, но нравственно более одаренных повстанцев. В сюжетной завязке Borderlands 2 не блещет оригинальностью, повторяя каноническую схему многих антиутопических произведений. Тем не менее по ходу игры сюжет увлекает, нас ждут приятные и не очень неожиданности, которые проливают свет на события первой части.Система развития персонажа в Borderlands 2 не сильно отличается от оригинала. Уничтожая различную живность, а также выполняя задания, игрок получает опыт. Каждый новый уровень автоматически увеличивает максимальное здоровье и урон, а также дает одно очко умения, которое можно вложить в развитие того или иного навыка. У каждого из персонажей есть три специализации, представляющие собой набор тех или иных умений. Например, у убийцы Зеро это снайперское мастерство, хитрость, резня.Чтобы улучшить следующую ступень специализации, нужно вложить 5 очков в предыдущую. А таких ступеней у каждого персонажа шесть. Таким образом, чтобы дойти до вершины специализации, нужно иметь как минимум тридцатый уровень. А это значит, что можно стать или выдающимся снайпером, или крутым рубакой в ближнем бою, или всем понемногу.Что же касается боевой составляющей, то и с этой стороны игра похорошела.\n\nПлюсы: потрясающий стиль; фирменный юмор; колоритные герои; многообразие оружия.\nМинусы: система развития персонажа могла быть интересней.","November 8, 2013","true","549.4"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/49520/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nBorderlands2 is a First Person action adventure shooter game developed by Gearbox and released 2012. Borderlands2's story takes place on the planet Pandora... Pandora is a very violent war-torn planet where no one in their right mind would visit, except for the insane... being bandits, local inhabitants who can't get off world, and vault hunters.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You're a vault hunter, you've been lured onto Pandora in attempts to find the mystical place known as “the vault”, in the vault you gain unimaginable treasure... should you succeed in finding the vault; there's no telling what wonders you will encounter.\nBut wait, before you run off and try to open the vault yourself, there are many enemies who wish to claim the vault as their own prize! Not to mention monstrous beasts that protect the vault. You don't even know where to go! To find the vault you will need friends, cue “Handsome Jack”...\n\n...okay, okay, by now most people actually know how this story goes, the Story telling in Borderlands2 is excellent, a nice blend of cinematic, voiced dialogue.\n\nGame Play: Borderlands2 is played in the first person view, initially there are only four playable characters/classes (with mods you gain 2 more), you have different types of weapons, elements, many different types of NPC's to fight, 3 skill tree's for each class.\n\nThe playable characters/classes are: Axton (Commando), Maya (Siren), Salvador (Gunzerker), Zero (Assassin), and with purchasing the appropriate DLC you gain access to Gaige (Mechromancer), and Krieg (Psycho). If you want to know more about a specific character/class I would recommend checking out online guides.\n\nIt's important to note that there are about 6 different classifications of weapons (Assault rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, shot guns, 'ya know – the normal gun you expect) it's even more important to note that each character/class can use any weapon... however some characters are better at certain weapons because of skill builds. (meaning, Zer0 (the sniper/assassin) is better with sniper rifles, but you can pick one up with Salvador (gunzerker) and use it, but you probably won't be as accurate as Zer0 is.\n\nIn addition to various weapons, are there many different special perks a gun can randomly roll, including different elements (Incendiary, Corrosive, Shock, and Explosive) which are more effective against different types of enemies. The point is, that the same gun can drop twice and have completely different stats.\n\nAchievements: Borderlands2 has 69 achievements in total, 50 achievements are available on the core game, the 19 other achievements are spread out across 4 DLC items you'll need to purchase to get 100%. All of the achievements are very obtainable, however, some require some grinding and luck (like, Challenge Accepted, Tribute to a vault hunter, and a number of other circumstantial achievements) Lastly, there is at least one achievement per class, the rest can be obtained with one character.\n\n\nPrice: Borderlands2 is priced at $19.99 The game of the Year edition is priced at $39.99. I personally suggest purchasing the game of the year edition so you can get the DLC for the whole game. With the release of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel the chances of picking up a copy of Borderlands2 on sale is dramatically increased, so it's worth noting that you could wait for a 75% off sale.\n\nConclusion: Borderlands2 is hilarious, fun, has morbid-humor, insane people, guns, guns and more guns! I have little to nothing negative that I can say about the game. The graphics for the game itself are more cartoon-styled in nature, increasing the life of the game (It won't take back seat to high end graphic games as fast, because they're trying to replicate realism, they're implementing their own style and art).\nAll in all, I loved playing Borderlands2, I played the heck out of the game, it's more fun to play it with a friend, but it's one of those games you can spend a lot of time playing just to blow up bandits. I recommend this game for FPS gamers, and people who enjoy Adventure/Action games.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update June 09, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for Borderlands\nHere's the URL to see my review for Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is DLC\n\nEdit/Update June 09, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage","June 9, 2015","true","202.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

Oh, sure, it's got a better (more emotional!) story, more diverse maps, more vehicles, a cool head and skin system, more gun types and effects, and is just all around a bigger, more varied experience, but it's not... well, okay. The first game wasn't a great shooter. Borderlands 2 isn't either. It mostly relies on simply pointing and clicking. The stats all ultimately determine how quickly an enemy's health bar diminishes in size. It's not as if we're playing Half-Life or Halo or FEAR or Bulletstorm or something, because we're not. We're playing a game that's about loot.\n\nToo bad the loot drop ratios are so bad. I don't know why they're worse than they were in the original game, but I do know that in my hundred-some hours of play, I only managed to pick up four or five orange items. That seems wrong. Borderlands 2 is the first game that made me seriously consider using CheatEngine. Me, I don't like cheats unless they're humorous, but Borderlands 2's drop ratios are so frustrating, requiring needless, endless grinding from players, that I found myself kinda going "yeah... let's make things more like they were in the first game."\n\nThe story is great. I've mentioned that. I should mention it again. It's great. Best of all is Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, which is apparently the only DLC developed entirely in-house at Gearbox (the others were apparently outsourced, which might suggest why they're all kind of terrible in terms of level design, pacing, and the like and only worth playing for the humor--Hammerlock's Hunt is easily the worst one), which actually kinda makes me feel emotions and stuff that I don't normally like feeling in video games.\n\nBorderlands 2 isn't a great loot game. It isn't a great shooter. It's a good-looking game, a glorious co-op experience, and is really funny to boot. Mister Torgue is a stand-out character; easily one of my favorites of all time. The new weapons and effects--if you're lucky enough to pick them up, are pretty cool. The game expands a lot of the elements of the first game, or tosses in a bunch of new things to make it more diverse. It's a fun game that's worth playing, but not because of its core gameplay mechanics, which are a bit of a letdown, or most of the DLC, which... honestly kinda sucks due to boring level design.","November 26, 2013","true","109.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","1"

More than a new title, it feels like a reskinning of the original.  For the most part, it excels in all the same ways the first does, but minor flaws place it a couple places behind its predecessor.  The biggest complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the menus are harder to navigate/stats of weapons are harder to discern.

Campaign is very good you get involved with the chracters and what happens to them also it has Handsome Jack one of the best villians I have ever had in a game he is such a ♥♥♥ you love to hate him. The DLCs add extra content where the main story ends with new areas and loot + more dialogue from the characters you begin to love like Torgue, Tina, Hammerlock, etc. Also did I mention there are 3 times you can replay the game as the same character but each time the enemies become harder and start to regen hp + higher chance of loot and all around a fun time if you and a couple of friends want to blow crap up. Out of 10 I would rate this game 9.5 and I recommend anyone that loves RPG elements and the quirky nature of the first Borderlands but done better to pick this up even if you are not familiar with the first I highly recommend all around good game.","November 27, 2013","true","188.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","2"

If you don't get the GOTY edition, at least get the Tiny Tina DLC.\n\nThe game is very cartoony and injects a lot of humor (sometimes dark) into the gameplay and dialogs. This game is a bit different from other FPSs in the sense that there are a lot of upgrades and level ups, and once you finish the main game, you can enter True Vault Hunter Mode, a harder version of the game where enemies are leveled up, and then again as Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, where enemies are even more scaled up. My only gripe with this game is that only legendary class weapons (the highest tier) become relevant later in the game, and you will pretty much sell/ignore all other drops, and there is no real money sink for you to spemd all your excess cash. Farming the legendaries can be brutal sometimes, where you can fight the same boss 100 times and still not receive a legendary drop. Still, I would rate this game as one of the top 3 games I've ever played.","April 19, 2015","true","103.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/49520/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","(Just humour me for a moment and pretend like you've somehow never heard of this game before) Hey, JacquesLeSauve, what's this Borderlands 2 game I keep hearing about?! Well, mister and/or miss random person gamer, since you ask!...\n\nBorderlands 2 is a first-person, co-op, loot-hunting shooter with RPG elements, and, it might surprise you to know, the sequel to Borderlands 1! (and technically the Pre-squeal, but that's kind of a grey area) Play through a lengthy campaign as one of four characters, each with their own unique abilities and upgradable skill trees to compliment those abilities. Complete quests, fight badasses, earn money, level up and explore the strange and wonderful world of Pandora, all the while searching for that hot new gun that's gonna seriously f*ck sh*t up and ruin everyone else's day. Sweet.\n\nThe perfect antidote to an endless array of grey and brown shooters, this vibrant, cel-shaded style game refuses to take any part of itself seriously, save for the gameplay. Brimming with personality, it never misses a chance to hit the player with an off-colour joke or make fun of either itself or gaming in general, with a large portion of that magic being owed to the brilliant writing. The vast majority of characters fit into their roles perfectly and are expertly voiced as well, which is a huge breath of fresh air given how lacklustre the writing and acting can be in so many other games that have yet to learn how to feel natural or not completely chew up the scenery. OK, maybe the main villain is guilty of that heavy-handedness as he's so manifestly evil he goes beyond caricature or archetype and smacks of the creators trying way too hard to rile the player up and make them hate him. But even then he rarely outstays his welcome for too long.\n\nGunplay is pretty much rock solid as everything feels like it behaves exactly the way it's supposed to, whether it's firing something big and heavy and primitive that makes a big boom, or something more elegant and finely balanced for those scalpel-like precision kills. Even reloading a weapon can feel immensely satisfying, between the reload animation itself or the nice, big clunking sounds of a clip being jammed into place... a sentence I never thought I'd hear myself say. Now I feel weird, like a freaky gun fetishist. Eurgh. But yeah, for a game all about shooting, this nails it for sure... even though I'm the type of player that likes to bring a knife to a gun fight. But either way, whatever you're into, this game has you covered.\n\nSpeaking of having you covered, I really have to mention the online community. I'm not much one for online play typically, be it co-operatively or competitively, so not being massively familiar with it, I was a little apprehensive going into this, especially hearing horror stories about a few other communities, so I was expecting the worst. But I was really pleasantly surprised at just how nice and friendly and (mostly) competent the majority of other players seem to be. Sure, you'll occasionally get the odd palindromic loot tool come along and grab all the best gear for themselves, ignore other players in need, then talk cr*p about everyone else when no-one comes to their rescue. But in my experience most players here are incredibly nice and considerate and generous (I especially love the "loot fairies", players that randomly dropped into my game, threw a load of gear at my feet, then disappeared, never to be seen again) and many will happily chat with you if that's what you're into. I've even added some good people to my friends list off the back of this game. So if anybody's worried about that aspect of the game, they really needn't.\n\nIf I had to make one major complaint about this it would be the opening. The bleak tundra setting of the first few hours really isn't very inviting or stimulating to the player and feels more like it should have been a mid to late game location rather than your introduction to the world, even for seasoned veterans of the first game. And, unfortunately, this is probably pretty unavoidable, given the nature of games where you have to level up, but you won't get any interesting gear for a while, either, and everything might initially feel really mundane for some players. But if you can push through it, then once you acquire newer, more interesting abilities and perks and expand your arsenal to include more exotic and outrageous gear, than that's when the game really starts to shine.\n\nSo, with tons of replay value, between the multiple characters, two new game + modes and tons of additional DLC to purchase, whether you play this alone or with others, this is a game that should keep you busy and happy for a long, long time. So good is it, in fact, that after over 300 hours of play I'm still not tired of it and can't wait to see what they'll do for the third outing. Come get you one!","September 11, 2015","true","336.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","2"

Missions and environments are more varied and interesting; classes, skill trees and weapons are more fun; PC-specific improvements including adjustable FOV, better gamepad compatibility etc. Vanilla vs vanilla it decimates the original Borderlands.\n\nThere isn't as much enemy variety as I would've liked and, while the environments are more varied, they're still mostly limited to inherently barren environments (ice, desert, wastelands).  I would've liked to see more lush environments but perhaps this is being/will be addressed in the DLC.  There are minor bugs like your loot falling through the earth along with real problems such as inventory space being extremely limited, considering it's a loot game.  In spite of this, the game is polished and solid all the way through.\n\nOne of the top quality games of the year; got the nasty taste of Diablo 3 out of my mouth.

I though it looked stupid. I still haven't played the first one to this day (I missed the sale), but I grabbed this mainly because a friend said we could play together (we have not since).\n\nBut hey, part of what makes me LOVE this game so much is because SO many people still actively play it. I swear, every time I've started playing, and sometime during the session, one of my friends asks if they can join my game and/or I can join theirs. Some people don't intend on making me feel like a noob—though they do and I'm okay with it/don't say anything—but it's so fun! The game has the most unique online systems I've ever seen IN a video game, and everyone just has a ton of fun~\n\nThe game itself is very similar to Bioshock (thanks 2K) in the means of shooting, crazy-♥♥♥ weapons (MUCH more so here) and looting. A LOT of looting. You could spend hours in the game literally making little progress, but looting EVERY container you can find, and there are plenty of secrets to find, too! I'm sure those secrets go with a few achievments, but again, if you don't want to spend hours...they're just achievemnts, dude; I know it's hard to resist, but it really can get tiring looting everything.\n\nThe game's got a LOT of humor, and a LOT of unique storyteling/characters that help with that. It's an experience EVERYONE deserves to enjoy.

Also, it's a sequel to a badass game.\nWhat I must do at first is to compare what they did to the game. It was improved in some ways and there were bad decisions as well.\n\nMost notably, the new minimap is awful compared to the old HUD, also, the ingame menu and inventory is awful as well. Well, I'm highly critical, but that's all, everything else remained the same or was improved, maybe changed in a way which is not better or worse either.\n\nWell, one thing I don't like is that Gearbox still have no clue about difficulty levels, like the first Borderlands, some minibosses are invincible, while some huge act bosses are pathetic weaklings. Mad Mike you son of a...\nAlso, it's still nearly impossible - without golden keys - to get any decent weapon under lvl20 or so, but this is called "character progression", so I'll accept that.\n\nOtherwise, the game improved a lot. Even moar guns, with moar special abilities and even moar ammo consumption. Wait, what? Ammo regeneration was nearly completely removed from the game, that's something I can accept for the sake of game balance, but I don't like that decision.\nOn the other hand, the new guns and game mechanics are fun, there are a lot of ways to build gamebreaking characters too.\n\nMost importantly, the game's story is epic and the recurring characters are funny and the jokes never get old. Claptrap is more annoying and funny than ever!\n\nAbout DLC content, well, having a D&D themed DLC tells more than any word, especially that I do play paper&pen RPGs, the geeky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dungeon master is a nice catch on the feeling of D&D, especially that I am a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dungeon master myself. Maybe I'm not that bad, but I do like making my players sweat after a long fight.\n\nWhile I didn't play much of the game, I can tell that what I saw is exceptional in every way like it's predecessor is.","December 27, 2013","true","495.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The sprawling cooperative shooter has arrived, delivering long hours of shooting, looting, and butt jokes. Well, almost intact. Game design changes, like changing the enemy death animations, do a good job of cutting corners while preserving the core action. Technical shortcomings, however, leave little doubt that this is the lesser version of Gearbox's great sequel. Dialogue and sound effects frequently sound flat and occasionally disappear, while the frame rate often slows down in combat and makes the chaotic action feel unwieldy.\n\nCombat in Borderlands 2 is naturally a bit floaty and loose, largely due to way player movement and enemy behavior are paced. As a result, it can accommodate the small degree of control imprecision added by the touchscreens and be none the worse for it. Likewise, the smaller range of motion of the analog sticks may cause some making the PC/console transition to balk a bit, and indeed, aiming can initially feel ungainly if you're used to the game on other platforms. After you adjust the aim sensitivity and spend some time wandering the wastelands, however, the mercenary satisfactions of long-range headshots and up-close bullet barrages are well within reach.\n\nPros:\nIts a good game +\nLong story +\nwide variety of guns +\nLarge World +\n\nCons:\nYou have to be on the same level to play together (in some cases only) (Multiplayer)\nCharacter skills menu is broken (Skills menu)\nIn skills menu Main Protagonist is invisible, sometimes loads after some mins (Skills menu)\n\nMy ratings,\n8.5/10 :)","January 24","true","27.8"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","16","23","3","10"

The main DLC are worth it and so it the mech and (if you enjoy the game) the Phyco classes. Very sad to see the hundreds of Micro DLC that are not only ♥♥♥♥ but a total rip off. Get the season pass and save some money on the main DLC campaigns and get the Mech and Phyco seperatly. Mech is my favorate class and some cheats/ modded GS give you generally all the skins worth having. The Head hunter DLC are short and really only add 30 minutes of quests each and some ok looking skins / heads. The campaign seamed a little "We ran out of things to add in so lets drag out certain quests" at some points, dont get me wrong AWESOME GAME, but I can't stand it when they purposly make the story slow just to make it (seem) longer. Side quests are generally fun and kill some time. I would probibly say this game is best with a friend but don't think you NEED one, I had alot more fun with my friend on Xbox playing this game together then on my own though. Also sad to see level cap increases cost money, like WTF? You litterally get nothing worth while in them othe than +11 levels per pack (there are 2) so it raises the Lv cap from 50 to 61 then 61 to 72 which is pretty much if you enjoy the game you can continue leveling later or after the min campaign. Overall its a great game and really if you played the first and liked it this will be good too.

I love games that have a leveling system and love the tree sets they have. It is nice that you can practically build your player in any way you want. I like that it also has escalating difficulty depending on how many people you have in your party.

All the weapons have such a wide variablity that you can always find the best weapons that suit you fo the time being.\nThe only thing I have bad against this game, is the time it can take to level, sometimes I would play for a long time and not get a level (this is like after level 40) and it can just get tedious with the amount of time.

Fight scenes become a cacophonous rainbow of silliness that leave you craving more every time.\n\nThey really missed a trick when it comes to weapons though. There are countless weapons in the game but they can't really be customised with scopes, suppressors or elemental effects. If you find a weapon, you can either take it or leave it. Here's hoping Borderlands 3 will address that issue and allow players to piece together the perfect loadout for their play style.\n\nIf you are looking for realism in your shooters, try elsewhere, but if all you want is NGHGHHYEAHHH then Borderlands 2 is for you.","February 14, 2014","true","65.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Not even sure when my steam counter jumped to over 100 hours in less then 1 month :). I really love it, Pandora is amazing place to explore. everywhere you go there's something completely new to discover. Scenery really changes between zones, they put lots of work into them. I only wish zones would level with me, some quests were simply too easy as i came back to them after a while. other then that, perfect game","February 13, 2014","true","134.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

It is very hilarious, with an amazing cast of people voicing the different characters throughout the game, and is LOADED with easter eggs. Even though this is a comedy-style game with somewhat of a dark humor aspect to it, the story still managed to bring a few tears to my eyes, being surprisingly emotional.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/49520/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","Borderlands 2: Probably the best game I've ever gotten from a friend. (Thanks [A.C.E] ACEALEC︻デ═一 for getting me this game) It combines the good parts of shooters, with an impressive, dark story, and also some amazing characters. I usually keep this stuff towards the end, but I'm gonna be honest with you: This is probably one of the finest games of last generation. To the review!\n\nGraphics\nThe visuals were annoying at first and still are, but I began to grow into the comic styled visuals and then thought it looked great. However, some enemies had poor textures along with lots of the environment. The characters look great, the buildings look awesome, but the environments, many of the enemies (Not all, though. Some look great) have odd textures or look poorly done. When it comes to comic graphics, it's either a hit or a miss. I say Borderlands 2 was successful, but I can't say that it was out of the park good. Overall though, I like it.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay, which is tied for first as Borderlands 2's (BL2 for short) strong point, takes the "good parts of shooters" and along with countless loot, class combinations, several RPG elements, etc, and makes some strong gameplay. The gunplay is heated along with the special ability each class has, the fights are even more intense. All of the characters are pretty balanced, heck, even Axton (The Commando) is pretty balanced for a guy who has a sentry who does the work. However, since I used to play quite a bit of Salvador (The Gunzerker) seems a bit weak, His ability is good, but it isn't as useful as the Siren's, the Assassin's, and the others. He could use a small buff. Ironic, too. He actually did lots of steroids. Must be karma or something. Don't do drugs, kids! Oh wait, I'm getting off topic. Excuse me for that. Anyway, the vehicles in BL2 are good enough, but maybe a few more different vehicles would've been better. Either way, going around and running over Psychos is good fun. The world is large and there's lots to explore, too. I love this game's gameplay.\n\nStory\nThe story was done right and makes most shooters look bad. It isn't top notch like Spec Ops: The Line (Which was also released in 2012) or Mass Effect (When a game has a better story than Mass Effect, you KNOW it's good) but it's able to satisfy me. The writing has a dark tone to it, but at the same time, there is some funny moments that try to cheer you up in the hostile world of Pandora. I'm not going to spoil it, but if you've played Borderlands 1, there will be a moment towards the end of the game where your heart will just break. There are some strong plot twists that greatly affect the story greatly and make the huge 90 degree turns worth it. The humor is a bit rushed, but I still laughed out loud many times. Claptrap and Handsome Jack are the two guys who basically lead the whole story. Claptrap is always funny, and even Handsome Jack is humorous a lot. However, Handsome Jack starts to show that this "loving to hate him" thing is really starting to kick in at a certain point in the game. He goes flat-out revenge and really makes him a strong character and also one of the best villains I've ever encountered in a video game, rivaling GLaDOS and others. The four main characters (and DLC characters, making it six) are all good, but again, Salvador is a bit one dimensional. Either way, don't underrestimate this game's story.\n\nAudio\nThe audio is great, and the voice actors did an outstanding job. Handsome Jack is definitely the strong point and is able to prove that he is a terrifying (yet awesome) villain. The music is great and fits in with the atmosphere perfectly. Not much to say other than Handsome Jack played his role well.\n\nReplayability\nThe replayability, if it isn't obvious enough, is tied with the gameplay for the #1 strong point of the game. I'll try not to make this part too long, so yeah. Here we go: There are TONS of DLCs to buy, you can try to beat the game with another class, try another playstyle, help a few friends, get some new customizable skins, get the legendary weapons, find all the easter eggs, and lots, lots, lots, lots more. Should I say anything else to back up the fact this game has some pretty strong replayability? No? Good.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, Borderlands 2 proves that it is one of the best shooters of last generation and is one of my personal favorite shooters now. It does something few shooters actually do, which is have a strong story. The great gameplay, amazing replayability, detailed characters, and funny writing all make this game a true masterpiece any shooter fan should have in their library.\n\nSo, newbie Vault Hunters. Are you ready to go shoot, loot, and loot some more?\n\nGraphics- 7/10\nGameplay- 9.5/10\nStory- 9.5/10\nAudio- 8/10\nReplayability- 10/10\n\n.:8.8/10:.\n\n+Amazing story\n+Outstanding gameplay\n+Unforgettable villain\n+Detailed characters\n+High replayability\n+Easily one of the best co-op games out there\n\n-Textures poorly done on occasion\n-More vehicle choices\n-Some rushed humor moments","July 17, 2014","true","70.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I Can't stop playing it. I already had this game on PS3 with around 200 hours on there, and when it came on sale on steam i couldn't resist. An FPS/RPG/Co-op game, you can play with your friends, play single player, or play online, and i can guarantee you won't get bored. Thousands of weapons leaves choices open to how you want to play, and with 6 utterly different classes to choose from, there are a number of awesome, fun ways to play.\n\nI had bought Borderlands 1 a few months after it came out and played it for many hours, completeing the game on 2 characters, and i enjoyed it so much, when i saw that they were releasing Borderlands 2 i honestly thought that it couldn't get any better. Well they made it better all right. If you have have played number 1 or if you havn't then i still highly recommend this game.\n\nThe storyline is brilliant, funny, and a lot of fun. Some of the characters are hilarious and brilliantly thought out, and the story will keep you laughing all the way. The graphics and excellent, with a mix of cartoony and realism all mixed in, much like Borderlands 1. The gameplay is also fantastic, with so many different ways to kill enemys and different playstyles. One of the best games i have ever played.\n\n10/10 from me, highly recommend!","February 14, 2014","true","74.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pbablue/recommended/49520/","pbablue","serendipity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pbablue/","1430 products in account","Borderlands 2 like its predecessor is a role playing shooter. You begin your adventure as the victim of train sabotage by Handsome Jack. And awaken from catastrophe relatively unscathed at the feet of Claptrap. Claptrap eventually leads you to resistance against Handsome Jack, led by the original four characters from Borderlands. The story has seen improvement over the original. The quality writing as a whole has drastically increased from first insulation, but it’s made not for story structure but in the dialog as well. From the dialog alone, I predict that Handsome Jack will start appearing top 10 favorite villain list over the internet sometimes soon. He has a great personality, his funny human and ultimately very very evil.\n\n\nThe journey will rack you-in over 30 hours to complete the main quest line. That’s if you don’t do any side missions, go off exploring, team up with friends and their games. Borderlands 2 is a time enthralling but I mean the most enduring way possible. No matter if you catch the game on sale or if you pay full price, you will get your money’s worth. It’s jam packed with quality content from start to finish. If I use the term “finish” likely because once you complete the main quest, you can play thru the entirely game again against harder and more diverse enemies that drop more elaborate guns and gear pushing you seemingly temporary cap of level fifty.\n\n\nIn that regard, Borderlands 2 is like an MMO but one you only experience with friends and strangers if you want to. Teaming up with your friends and strangers is as easy as flickering on light switch. Cooperative gameplay not only exponentially increases the fun factor with your friends, but it also causes the game to spawn tougher enemies and better loot. There are plenty of bad-♥♥♥ awards, permanent perks for performing various in-game task that can only be achieve with help from your friends.\n\n\nGraphically, Borderlands 2 has seen a significant facelift over the original but still uses the same art style. I ran on several different graphics but somehow hard time pushing few of the games more fantastic effects when there was tons of actions on the screen. But all in all, I am very pleased that way the game performed. I experienced very few crashes and my connectivity issues were hammered out by the third day of gameplay. The varied locations grade from deserts, to rocky mountain ranges, to green steps, to snowy wastelands, to urban environments and industrial complexes located in the world’s harshest terrain. You’ll be fighting classic enemies like skag, rakk and pyscho but there is also nice variety of new beast, malcontents and machines.\n\n\nGetting from point A to Z in Borderlands 2, can be done either by foot, car or fast travel stations. Considering the massive size of the entire world, you’ll be happy for any type of transportation after a particularly grew some firefight session. It is important to note that driving cars on PC, takes some getting used to. But most of all, I am slightly disappointed to see that enemies clearly have air superiority over you with transforming robots and buzzard drop ships. This isn’t necessarily negative mark against Borderlands 2 or a side note. I really really want to fly those buzzards around in the available areas within Pandora.\n\n\nDespite everything I love about Borderlands 2, it definitely has an ugly side to it. Unfortunately, it comes from the multiplayer. Joining cooperative games which I haul hardly recommend on doing. It can have some massively negative repercussions to your single player experience. You can miss entire chunks of the storyline and game important unlocks by hopping on with players who are only few levels ahead of you depending where you are in the game. Even though Borderlands 2 offers a system to counter this possibility, it’s not 100% effective. And sadly, there is no Replay Mission option available which could potentially resolve this issue entirely.\n\n\nI love Borderlands 2 and truly love it. Certainly, there are few dense in the hall but all in all its exemplary experience from start to finish whether you play along or with friends. I can easily say one of the best cooperative games I’ve played this generation and easily one of my favorite first person shooter as well.\n","April 7, 2015","true","24.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

But guess what, when something goes on sale it gets more attractive so yeah, i bought it for a ridiculously low price and gave it a chance.\n\nThe game is quite repetitive, the "million weapons" exist only in stats (really unsatisfying) but the game is still not boring for some reason. The "story" was something I did not care about (which is surprising because mostly the story is the reason why I pick up a game), many people say it's awesome but for only few character was interesting so this game was a "shooter" for me. The voice acting, sounds and music is great in this game alongside the world. Also, the UI is pretty great as well but most people don't give a thought on this one.\n\nOhh, and this game does the ugliest thing in the FPS history: spawning enemies in the back. That was so so so o frustrating, I was like "not again..." for almost the whole game.\n\nAfter almost 70 hours I left the game with the feeling of incompletion (even though I finished every main and side mission) and frustration. I played through because I thought I'll feel that good feeling when you complete a game, but there was nothing, just emptiness.\n\nI have mixed feelings about recommending this game but it definately worth a try, it can be interesting for a while and it's pretty fun with friends.","July 5, 2014","true","85.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The first game was a game that I sunk a large number of hours into (steam lies) because of how much fun it offered, Borderlands 2 takes everything that the first game has to the next level and adds even more.\n\nThe characters in the game have amusing dialogue that is rather funny and interesting, each has a different style and a unique personality, whether it's Cl4P-TP, Scooter, Handsome Jack or any of the many other character you'll encounter throughout the many adventures on Pandora.\n\nWhile missions are usually to kill other creatures there's still a large diversity and I never felt that I was doing the same thing except for maybe some of the missions in the Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt DLC.\n\nThe game offers a number of DLCs and while that could be bad practice I have to give them credit for at least 2 of the main DLCs: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty, and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep for being excellent (I can even go as far as saying that Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is beyond excellent and because of it Borderlands 2 is now my favorite game). Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage DLC is good fun, and Sir Hammerlock’s Big Game Hunt has its strong points but has some bad ones as well.\n\nThe game provides an interesting story line as opposed to its predecessor in addtion to connecting it to what little of story the first one did. There are moments of pure nostalgia for Borderlands fans, as well as plenty of easter eggs and references to all kind of different games, movies, and TV shows that kept me smiling throughout the game.\n\nThe game has very high replayability value, aside from 6 unique classes each class can be played in many different styles thanks to the massive number of different weapons and skills combinations, and the addition of the badass rank and badass tokens with the large collection of challenges, it also helps that the scenery and lighting ingame are impressive and beautiful to look at. Exploring everything and taking my time to finish most challenges I already have over 100 hours on a single character and I'm not yet done with all the DLCs on the Normal Mode, I still have many more hours before I even start True Vault Hunter Mode and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode on that character alone.","April 12, 2014","true","083.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Temrane/recommended/49520/","Temrane","psyche","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Temrane/","206 products in account","Let me set my small backstory of this game for you guys. Back in 2012 I had my 14th birthday and I'd asked my friends "what should I buy for us to play together?" This was back when I didn't have a PC and played on a Xbox 360, their answer? Borderlands. I bought this interesting little title for around £8 in a CEX. Let me just say, best £8 I'd ever spent, one of the few games I actually bought ALL the DLC for too (GOTY edition was impossible to find, believe me). So of course, I heard rumours of Borderlands 2 and got pretty hype. I saw the release date "September 12th 2012". Pre-Ordered the ♥♥♥♥ outta it. I got home from school that day more excited than a child recieving a lollipop and popped in the disc and played Borderlands 2 for the first time.\n\nI'd played atleast 200 hours, perhaps more on it, but never the DLC. So lets say I got 200 hours out of just the MAIN GAME.\n\nLater on in life I got a good PC, first thing on my buy list was Borderlands 2. This time, with all the DLC I could get. After completing this game for a 10th time in my life I feel like I should review it.\n\nSo this is the meat of the review, the game itself. Whilst not going into spoilers I'll give a quick synopsis. You're a Vault Hunter, Handsome Jack wants this Vault, you want to stop him. A generic plot I suppose but very very well written. I've played through this so many times (I say completed 10, but I've had multiple characters I've just started and never finished with) and the dialouge still makes me giggle at times. I find it all just so silly and wacky that it gets to me every time.\n\nThe main story itself is quite long, you'll need to do side quests to keep leveled alongside the main story, but don't worry, each sidequest is entertaining in itself, varying from robbing a bank, shooting a guy in the face (but not the arm, or body, or leg) to simply jumping off a cliff. The main story is also pretty great, you get emotionally invested in characters, you learn to hate the snark of Handsome Jack, you learn to love the Vault Hunters of the past game, you learn to despise Claptrap and his annoying voice lines.  jk claptrap i love you really\n\nThe gameplay? Oh my it is so addicting. Looting new guns, out of what the game boasts to be a gazillion, each one with a different possible outcome. Maybe this one will have a scope, or a knife, or BOTH. Grenade Mods offer an interesting use too, altering what your grenades do. My favourite is a singularity grenade, pulls the enemies in and then blows up with them all together. The gunplay itself, while sometimes you feel like you're pretty much throwing a wet paper towel at a wall in the hopes of breaking it down, is also satisfying. Snipers are nice to aim, shotguns have a nice little kick and assault rifles kick ♥♥♥ (I recommend Jakobs). The best part? This game is Co-Op. 1-4 players and A LOT better when experienced in a group than solo, in my opinion. Each person taking a different character from the cast of 6 to vary up gameplay and make a very gorey battlefield.\n\nLevel design is also great, my favourite map being Lynchwood. Every place has some form of parkour and a lovely look to it, from sweeping vistas in the Highlands, to the metropolis of Opportunity, to the... well... dust of "The Dust". Every place jumps out with life and is memorable in its own way.\n\nThe game also looks A-MAZ-ING. Cel-Shaded art style is perhaps my favourite when it comes to games and this game just looks so nice with it. A cartoony feel to an over the top game, whilst still managing to maintain beauty of landscapes. The only thing I recommend is not using PhysX, it's known to tank FPS (my friend gets around 40 with it on high and he uses a GTX Titan, just set it to low).\n\nThe characters you can play as are all pretty damn cool too, I'll just list them:\n\nMaya\nMy current character I'm playing with, was never a fan of the Siren til I played Maya, an absoloute pleasure to play as you control the battlefield, you take key targets out, you revive team mates with Res, you heal, you corrode, you do everything within your power to destroy and reign supreme over the hordes of bandits that Pandora has to throw at you. Also you can shoot your friends to heal them. She has two play styles, a "medic" of sorts, supporting the team, or a absoloute destructive force, murdering hordes of bandits with a quick tap of the ability key.\n\nGaige\nMy favourite character to play as, she has a giant death robot. That in itself is amazing to me. She has 3 very different trees, the left tree, "Best Friends Forever" focuses on helping newer players out by giving abilities that help things like aim, with an ability that lets bullets riochet off of surfaces and find their way cozily inside that nearby enemies cranium. "Little Big Trouble" focuses on using elemental weapons, mainly shock, to your advantage. The final tree, "Anarchy" is an interesting one, it lets Gaige do more damage at the cost of accuracy, allowing for even the worst gun to become a power house. The best part about this tree is combining this tree with the bullet reflects from the BFF tree,\n\nZer0\nAn interesting fellow, not much is known about this illusive figure, other than he's a badass mofo. He's an assassin, who's specialties are in melee and backstabs, or if you decide to go for it, sniping and pistols. Zer0 has the potential to be one of the best pick of Vault Hunters in the game, able to do ridiculous damage to single targets in a single shot. His ability, Decepti0n, lets Zer0 go into stealth mode and send a decoy that enemies will attack. This is also pretty good for reviving people, but its main use is to pick off a high priority target before a fight starts, or to escape from a fight you can't win. I haven't played as much Zer0 as I have Gaige, but from what I have played I love the guy, and is always a pleasure to have one guy playing the haiku speaking assassin with ya. Also when he revives you he gets a "<3" on his face, what could be better?\n\nAxton\nAxton was my original guy, after playing Roland in BL1 I felt like going for something similar, Axton was just that. His ability, a turret, can murder enemies pretty efficently. You can chose to level up your turrets or your own ability, the turrets were perhaps my favourite to level up though. You can get a variety of upgrades, a shield on your turret? Rockets? Two turrets? Sure thing, Axton got it all. My main fault with him however is that he's a pretty cover based character, prefering to let his turret to do the dirty work, but a nice character nevertheless.\n\nSalvador\nSalvador is my least favourite character to play, which is pretty funny considering I like playing them all. His ability, whilst somewhat tame compared to the rest, can be a whole load of fun. Salvador can go "Gunzerk", wielding two weapons at once. Any two, you aren't limited? Two snipers? Go ahead. Two rockets? Sure thing. I can't remember much of my time as gunzerker, I just remember that he was a little guy with a pretty big appetite for destroying everything.\n\nKrieg\nOkay I'll be completly honest with you, I've not got the DLC for Krieg but I can tell you one thing. He solos raid bosses for a living. If you choose him, have fun with that.\n\nClosing Note for this reivew. It helps to play Borderlands 1 before this, it will give you a closer bond to some of the characters. But other than that, the main game is absoloutely amazing. I would recommend this game to anyone with an addiction to picking up things with stats and comparing it with other things with stats. Also to any shooter fan. And to anyone. Even your dog.\n\nAlso before I close this off for good, two things. One, I ran out of space to do DLC reviews and two this may be slightly bias due to my franchise nerdboner, but it is still an amazing game despite that.\n\n10/10, would shoot in the face again.","January 24, 2015","true","119.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquidTheSid/recommended/49520/","SquidTheSid","Ellen Baker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquidTheSid/","980 products in account","Borderlands 2 is a very mixed bag. At times, it can be incredibly fun, as you unload shotgun pellets into Psycho Midget faces and throw buzz axes at a Goliath's head. At other times, it can be an incredibly tedious game as you backtrack from place to place and are forced to perform some infurating timed quests. The same can be said for its juvenile sense of humor. At times, it can be a very funny game, but at plentyof other times, you'll groan at how dumb a joke was or how awful a reference was.\n\nLet's get the biggest issue out of the way first. This game is terribly boring in the first couple of hours. You barely have any variety in combat, you have very few and very weak weapons, and you don't really have any interesting quests. It's a slog through the campaign until you get enough skill points in your character to make the game fun. For example, in my playthrough as Krieg the Psycho, it was a boring experience until I got enough points in cooldown reductino to let me spam my active ability freely.\n\nAnd on that note, we look at another big flaw of Borderlands 2: the skill tree. Every character gets only one active skill, such as being able to dual wield guns, turn invisible, or summon a giant mech of death. While this improves the variety of combat greatly at first, you don't get any of the more interesting or game changing abilities until your character is at a very high level (31 or more). Until then, you're stuck with (mostly) boring percentage stat boosts that barely affect your playstyle. To the game's credit, there are a hanful of interesting skills that do change how you play significantly, but there aren't enough of them. If there was more than one active skill, then the skill tree would be a little more tolerable, but as it stands, it's a grind to get the skills that you actually want.\n\nNext on the chopping block is the music and gun sounds. The guns, more often than not, sounds incredibly weak. You often feel like you're firing a peashooter, not a quad barreled shotgun. It's all incredibly underwhelming, to be honest. The music is fine, but it does a very poor job of pumping your adrenaline. That is, the music never helps you feel like the badass that the game wants you to be.\n\nMy next major complaint is the loot system, in that it's not very good. There are some interesting weapons and drops, but more often than not, you'll get crappy guns that you'll just throw away because they're too weak or underleveled. This wouldn't be so bad if guns scaled to your current level, but since they don't, you'll be getting a lot of trash in proportion to useful equipment.\n\nAlso, the performance of this game is not very consistent. At times, I can get 120 FPS no problem, but when I turn 180 degrees, it become a quarter of what it was a second ago. After trying numerous engien tweaks and reducing graphical fidelity, not much improves the performance of this game (I run a 780 Ti, so it's a very capable rig). It's not a dealbreaking, but it is very annoying.\n\nFinally, the story is very threadbare, despite Gearbox's efforts to improve it this time around. The entire story can be summed up to: Handsome Jack is a ♥♥♥♥, go kill Jack. I mean, the story does its job in getting you from place to place and ferrying you to a wide variety of locales, but it really isn't anything memorable.\n\nSo, now onto the good.\n\nThe combat can be really fun late game when your character is properly specced out. Having a maxed out Mania tree in Krieg is a blast as you one shot enemies with your melee weapon or snipe them from afar with your thrown buzz axes. You'll eventually get some interesting guns that have some very powerful effects that mesh with your playstyle or change it up.\n\nCo-op is pretty seamlessand allows you to drop into and out of a friend's game quickly. Enemies will become tougher, and loot will become better, so it's definitely the way to play if you have a couple of good buddies.\n\nThe voice acting, in general, is very well done. Solid deliveries by the cast all around, and there are some very well delivered lines (pretty much anything by Handsome Jack is well voiced, for example). There really aren't any characters that get get on your nerves, unless you find Ashley Burch's voice grating.\n\nFinally, the game can be incredibly funny in its own stupid way. If you embrace the cheese of the game and accept stupid jokes like "bonerfarts", then you're going to have a good time. However, it should be known that this game relies entirely on crass humor, so if you don't like that sort of thing, you will not enjoy the humor whatsoever.\n\n\nSo, in conclusion, Borderlands 2 is a very slow burner because of its poor skill tree and loot system, but it picks up later on in the game as you get more interesting loot and skills. It's definitely great as a co-op game, but it's a fun experience too if you play solo.","August 3, 2014","true","56.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","11"

Combining the fast paced action of a first person shooter with the addictive nature of leveling and loot finding from an rpg, Borderlands 2 is a new beast altogether.  Add in a competent story and this game will suck you in for dozens of hours.  Even if you're not a big shooter fan I would say give this a try, as it relies less on twitch gaming and more on planning and strategy.  With multiple classes that play differently, this is a game that you could easily play through more than once.  Solid controls and soundtrack only add to the experience.

Take the old Doom games, update the graphics with a cartoony look and then throw in a great story and some RPG elements and you have Borderlands 2.  The loot in the game is maybe the most addictive feature, the items you acquire can be great but they loose their luster (and power) as you level up so you are constantly searching for better gear and items... this leads to playing the game in search of legendary items (loot midgets anyone?) at higher and higher levels.  Each character can play through the game three times (more really, since you can reset your progress in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, if you get that far) and with all the DLC available for this game, that means hundreds of hours of gameplay.  If you're an addict of the game like me, get all the DLC for it including the headhunter stuff because it all contributes to the greatness of Borderlands 2.  I've mainly played as Gaige but I've also tried out the Gunzerker too.  I've sunk over 200+ hours into the game as of the writing of this review and I'm still looking forward to playing as the Siren and the Psycho.  Be warned... if you get into the this game, I mean really get into it, you'll have a long stay on Pandora and the real world will become a serious nuisance because it will limit your ability to play Borderlands 2.","February 22, 2014","true","400.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

While the experience is much better if you can round up a couple of friends, this game is still very much enjoyable as a single player experience.  I have easily logged over 100+ hours on this game on console, both as single player and as multiplayer.  Combining the fast paced action of a first person shooter with the addictive nature of leveling and loot finding from an rpg, Borderlands 2 is a new beast altogether.  Add in a competent story and this game will suck you in for dozens of hours.  Even if you're not a big shooter fan I would say give this a try, as it relies less on twitch gaming and more on planning and strategy.  With multiple classes that play differently, this is a game that you could easily play through more than once.  Solid controls and soundtrack only add to the experience.  Overall, this is one of the best gaming experiences you can have this generation.  I give this game a 9/10.","July 22, 2014","true","7.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are 3 playthrough modes, 6 characters to play on, and thousands of different variants of weapons to choose from. And then there are unique weapons, which signifies that these weapons will act in a unique way upon being fired, rather than just having its bullets fired in a straight line. Normal Mode was relaxing and enjoyable, TVHM was more intense, and UVHM (including the Overpower levels) is tougher and is recommended for hardcore gamers.

Otherwise you just get sick of it relatively quickly like I did. Even still, you may think you love Borderlands a lot after playing the first one, and think you'll really love this one too, and then realize that maybe you don't like it as much as you thought.\n\nObjectively speaking, everything about BL2 is better than the first. It's incredibly polished, loaded with content, easier to play with friends (or strangers), highly replayable (that is, if you reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally love Borderlands). So much improvement, but just not as addicting. Exploring is pointless because there's nothing to find, and the only good weapons come from grinding bosses. I just couldn't get hooked like I did on the first one.\n\nMostly fun while it lasted, but I'm so bored of it all, and it's feeling like a chore just forcing myself to finish the last (and apparently best) DLC. The humor is enjoyable too, I suppose, but it quickly becomes predictable.\n\nAll in all, I'm in a strange place with this recommendation. If I could go back in time and tell myself not to get it and that I wouldn't enjoy it as much, past-me wouldn't believe future-me and would still buy this game and it's DLC anyway. I can't say I regret the 107 hours spent playing this game, but I can't say it was time well spent either.\n\nCuriosity satisfied, Borderlands hunger satiated, that's it for me.

With a good group and someone with a good internet connection hosting, you can play for hours without even realizing it.\nBorderlands 2 is among many things. It isn't just a FPS, it has a storyline that wraps a small bit with the previous game, Borderlands. Borderlands 2 puts you into the perspective of 1 of 4 (or 6 depending on whether you have the 2 downloadable characters) "Vault-Hunters" as you head to Pandora to find a great treasure. However, if you have played Borderlands 1, you know what will most likely happen.\nThe main villian is Handsome Jack, a devious man who dreams about the perfect world and plans to do it with the Vault, which is a massive stone dragon that swims in lava. Handsome Jack insists that you are the bandit(s) destroying Pandora and making it a horrible place. And of course since you are the protagonist, you have to stop him.\n\nNow let's talk about gameplay. Borderlands 2 is fun ... for the first couple of playthroughs. Yes, the only way to advance is to constantly replay the game. The playthroughs go in this order: Normal, Vault Hunter, Ultimate Vaul Hunter.\nIn Normal and Vault Hunter, the host dictates what level all of the enemies are. If you are a level 30 with level 60 friends helping you, the enemies will revolve around you, the level 30. However, in Ultimate Vault Hunter, if you are hosting as a level 30 and you your friends join as level 60, the enemies will be level 60. This adds a sense of urgency to hit their level so you can stay alive for more than 15 seconds.\nBorderlands 2 may seem repetitive but it can be very fun. If you and a couple of friends are all together playing through the storyline, it doesn't seem very redundant because of the ever-changing combat (this means different weapons as you edit your playstyle) and improvement of the AI of enemies.  Borderlands 2 is, in all, a very great game. I do recommend this because it intrigued me as much as it did. If you see, it kept me captivated for 170 hours.","March 26, 2014","true","423.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game is amazing and hilarious and brilliant and...pew-pew-pew!\n\nMeh f*ck it, reviews are boring and usually have too many syllables.You don't wanna read an another review, Vault Hunter! You wanna read about LOOT! AND PECS! AND EXPLOSIONS! Besides, did you know that ninety-seven percent of all living things on Pandora aren't exploding right now? That's b*llshit!  You can’t let this happen, can you? So here is what you need to do: Buy the game, bring friends, collect shiny loot, strip the flesh, salt the wound, enjoy the mayhem, blow sh*t up, and obliterate all kind of nasty ultimate badass enemies whom you can find across the planet.\n\nAre you still reading this crap? Alright then. Let me share with you an actual quote from Handsome Jack who is, without question, the real hero of this story:\n\nArgh this is so frustrating! You see, this is what I don’t get about you bad guys.You know the hero’s gonna win, but you just don’t die quickly! Example: This one guy in New Haven, right? City’s burning, people are dying left and right yada yada yada...This jackhole rushes me with a spoon. A frickin’ spoon! And I’m dying laughing, right? So I scoop out his stupid little eyeballs with it and his kids are all “whaaaahh”, and he can’t see where he’s going, he’s bumping into stuff and... [*laughing*] Ah, I don’t know, maybe you had to be there. The moral is: YOU’RE A TOTAL B*TCH!\n\nYeah. This sums it up. Borderlands 2 for ya. And remember: Real badasses eat chocolate chip cookies.","December 31, 2015","true","469.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostGamerE/recommended/49520/","GhostGamerE","Gh☢sT Gamer E","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostGamerE/","76 products in account","Genre: Action, RPG.\nDeveloper: Gearbox Software.\nPublisher: 2K Games.\nRelease Date: 21 Sep, 2012\n\n\nSTORY It has exciting, dramatic parts, to emotional and sad parts. Borderlands 2 always keeps you on your toes. The story is set on a planet called Pandora, which has an uninvited guest, a company called Hyperion. The leader, Handsome Jack, wants to mine a mysterious alien element called eridium, to open a ruin on Pandora called, The Vault. You, and/or your friends are tasked with saving the planet, and defeating Handsome Jack. As well as a main story, there are also side quests, which contain their own stories within them. There are hundreds of side quests in the game for you to explore, and if need be, build XP on to level up.\n\nMULTIPLAYER Borderlands 2 multiplayer gameplay is much the same as the single player, but the difficulty ramps up heavily when you get more friends involved in co-op. The difficulty level adapts to the level of your characters so if you’ve got four fairly well levelled friends in a game, be prepared for some serious battles.\n\nGameplay\nIt's a first-person shooter, gameplay is going to be the main part in it. This game is filled with action almost all the time. There are dozens of types of enemies which can harm you in different ways. The game may make you rely on different types of weapons. For example, an armoured enemy will take more damage from a corrosive weapon, an enemy with a shield will take more damage from an electric weapon, or an enemy with no defense would take even more damage from an incendiary weapon. This can be awkward if you don't have those weapons. As I mentioned before, this game is amazing if you have friends playing it with you. The more people in a game with you, the harder the enemies, but also the better the loot. Go through an epic journey exploring the wilds, completing side quests and complain about who gets what weapon.\n\nDesign & Graphics\nBorderlands 2, as you can see by the screenshots, is a very cartoonish game, but not in the way you might imagine it. Although cartoonish, It's actually beautiful. Some environments leave you stunned. Graphics can be adjusted in the settings to make the game look even more pretty. If you don't have a perfect PC, this game can lag quite a lot, and the FPS can go down really low. Again, for the design, It's sublime. Almost everything is detailed. Open wildernesses are detailed quite well. The only negative thing I'll mention is mushy backdrops in some places.\n\nAudioThe soundtrack of this game were composed by Jesper Kyd, a well-known composer for video games and movies. There are 23 songs in all featured on the official Borderlands 2 Soundtrack with well over an hour of great tunes to tantalize your ear buds. Many of the songs are featured heavily or in key moments of Borderlands 2, but it is a little saddening to know that not all of the songs featured in the game made the cut for the soundtrack. The official Borderlands 2 Soundtrack is a great listen and even features an adequate amount of wub wub for those of you that are into that sort of thing.\n\n\n---- PROS ----\n\nGreat storyline.\nCo-op doesn't feel like everything is too easy.\nFun gameplay.\nEaster eggs.\nHilarious characters.\nGreat soundtrack.\nEpic DLCs.\nUnlimited guns.\n\n\n---- CONS ----\nInventory space is a bit too small.\nShared loot drops.\nLocation in a map is not saved when exiting the game.\n\n\nBorderlands 2 is a perfect game, which is worth hundreds of hours of playtime. Whether it be alone or with friends.\n\nScore Rating: 8.7/10","February 15","true","3.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

With exciting AND addictive game-play that stays fresh even past the 2nd play-through I am never board with this game.  Especially considering how easy it really is to play with friends.  I do wish it was more possible for people of different level ranges to play together but we cant have it all.\nIn stark contrast to the first Borderlands, the story is actually compelling and the superb voice acting makes it hard not to be drawn in.  The humor plays a big part as well and never feels out of place in the abstract Borderlands universe.\nThe graphics look great on both high AND mid range systems, offering highly stylized graphics that still have a touch of realism.\nIn closing I must commend Gearbox Software for their love-letter to the PC community.  Literally every gripe I had with the shoddy console-port that was BL1 is gone.  This game truly deserved Game of the Year.","June 11, 2013","true","251.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

While replaying the main storyline campaign can get repetitive after a few times, the amount and variety of DLC content keeps the game feeling fresh.  The game comes stock with 4 distinct classes and has two additional ones available through paid DLC.  Each class plays differently and with the talent tree choices even playing the same class over can feel slightly different.  The length of the main story campaign feels decently long but can be rushed through relatively quickly.  That's why I highly suggest playing through all of the available side quests and EXPLORE.  That is one of the bigger selling points of this game for me.  While the story itself can feel linear and pushing you from zone to zone.  The amount of extra quests and areas to discover is great.  I highly recommend this game to fans of the borderlands franchise and newcomers alike.","November 26, 2013","true","593.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Every character has a pretty stereotyped personality, and thanks to the awesome voice acting, you will be amazed with the way it's dialogues will always surprise you in some or other way.\n\nThe mechanics are very interesting, this game combines FPS with RPG in a way that I haven't seen so far. The game is very difficult though, mainly when you are on "ultimate vault hunter mode", but it compensates it with rare loot.\n\nThe  variety of guns and skills is also noticeable.\n\nBut don't forget that this game is on it's deadline, there won't be any more DLCs for it has it's already been annouced by the devs, and also the online rooms feels very lonely once you reach a higher level, but you will usually have options when you are low/mid level.","April 1, 2014","true","110.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Honestly I have no idea why I didn't get into the Borderlands franchise sooner. This game took everything that was amazing with the first Borderlands and made it 100x MORE BADASS! The characters are well developed and the game just in general is one of the best experiences I've had with a shooter. The guns really are on a whole different level this time around especially with the new element introduced known as slag. I won't go too much into slag but let me just say its a great addition to anyone's arsenal. There's a trading system that is very useful to players and if you want to fight for your guns just start a trade and enter a duel for a winner takes all situation. The enemies are very diverse and some can even evolve mid combat such as the goliath and varkids, which offers plenty of challenge if you let them power up. The game also rewards returning players of the first borderlands as you can interact with the original vault hunters as well as a return of some familiar guns (hellfire, volcano, bone shredder, etc.).

I only manage to do one playthrough (3 if you count that I beat it with the same character in the three different difficulties to reach max lvl) and have experience almost the enterity (not all) of the game and its dlcs, took me +150hr. Many people like to make fun of the story because you can play this game without caring much for it but I found it quite entertaining and charismatic. One of the strongest features of this game its the strange sense of humour, sometimes ridiculous and extreme and other times completely dark but that I particularly enjoyed. It's characters are yet another important point. I'll remember Handsome Jack as one of the most emblematic villains as it is a lunatic you get to love and hate at the same time.","May 22","true","183.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I have never ever had so much fun as when playing this game. Beautiful graphics, entertaining storyline, probably the best voice acting in all of video game industry, some of the greatest character designs ever made (Claptrap, Tiny Tina and especially Handsome Jack), immense amounts of loots (there are literally millions of guns you can choose from) and excellent replayability. The game has about 200 hours of gameplay if you wish to level a character entirely, which is a lot, but I guarantee you, they will be some of the best moments of your gaming life.\n\nA lot can be said about maturity of the content of the game as well. A lot of harsh language, sexual innuendos and things that would be disgusting in other games (cannibalism, torture and so on) is present, but the game is incredibly mature and deals with all of these themes in a very respectable way, which is further supplemented by the perfect graphics. Not only that, but the game also packs striking thoughts and supports LGBT rights, goes against domestic violence (I will never forget Mr. Torgue saying his best quote ever: "YOU BETTER TREAT MOXXI NICE! NOTHING IS MORE BADASS THAN TREATING A WOMAN WITH RESPECT!"), regards personal insecurity and many many other important topics in our current society. It does all of this with grace. There is even an NPC created specifically for a now-deceased Borderlands fan - and that is just one of many examples of how great the developers are. Honestly, Gearbox Software staff are some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure to meet.\n\nThe humour in the game is also something that cannot be possibly overglorified. Not only you will find references to just about every game and pop culture theme ever to be made here, but the dialogues are incredibly funny even when discussing important things. The way the game makes fun of itself is something that absolutely captured me. ("Torgue weapons ALWAYS fire EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS. They are also LOUD and require EXCESSIVE use of CAPITAL LETTERS") The fourth wall is broken all the time, but it is done in a so incredibly funny way that it feels so, so right. ("Hey guys, remember the old Crawmerax the Invincible?" "Sure, we exploited his glitches for HOURS! Oh, Pearlescents!")\n\nThe DLCs are all worth is as well, as they add a lot to the story and offer a lot additional content. Tiny Tina's Assault on the Dragon Keep is probably the greatest DLC ever created for any game ever. The amount of references, fun and interesting enemies present here are incredible. If I had to choose a single game out of all of them and spend the rest of my life playing it, it would be Borderlands 2.\n\nWould I recommend this game? No. No, I do not recommend you to buy this game. I recommend you to head to the Store and buy the Borderlands GOTY Edition, Borderlands 2 GOTY Edition, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and it's Season Pass and The Tales of Borderlands as well. Buy the entire franchise. Just. Do. It. Also, write a love letter to Gearbox Software and thank them for creating the best game franchise currently to exist.","April 11, 2015","true","537.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GottaBeGreg/recommended/49520/","GottaBeGreg","BeGregIfYouWant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GottaBeGreg/","53 products in account","To anyone considering buying this game, ask yourself two simple questions.\nDo I have friends that would play this with me?\nDo I like shooters and/or RPGs?\nIf you answered yes to either of these questions, then you will enjoy this game. Playing with friends in this game is a great time, even if you dont want to get involved with the story, you will find that shooting your way around the world with up to three other friends is massivley enjoyable. However, boasting an incredibly solid campaign as this, delivering quirky characters and interesting dialogue, this games gives you pleanty of reason to actually get involved in the story. All in all, the campaign scores a 8.7/10 from me, as the multiple runthroughs that I went through did not have me pull my eyes out of my sockets from tedium. *cough* Borderlands 1 arid badlands*cough*\nThe area that really makes this game shine is the DLCs. The dlcs from this game are, with the community in almost unanimous agreement, better than the actual campaign, which as I said before, is really great.\nFinish the game for the first time, then I wholeheartedly recommend you smack those dlcs. With actual raid bosses *cough* Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and your single "Raid" boss which was just a rehash of the last boss(Which dont get me wrong, wasnt a bad boss, and the idea of doing on what is basically a higher risk for a higher reward  difficulty is nice, but thats what true and ultimate vault hunter mode are for, not the only raid boss slot in the game.)*cough* (Wow that was a really long cough...) left right and center (Which are basically titanic bosses that will test all of you and three friends abilites), these dlcs offer the game longevity to last you through your post game completion hours. If you are not planning on getting all of the dlc for monetary reasons or others, then I recomment that you buy the dlc's in this order as far as you want to go;\nTiny Tina Assault on Dragon Keep.\nDO NOT PLAY THIS GAME AND THEN SKIP THIS DLC. This, in my opinion, is the SINGLE BEST DLC I HAVE EVER PLAYED FOR ANY GAME EVER. This dlc is great. It retells the deals with Tiny Tinas grief and eventual acceptance of (spoilers I shall not say) and it does so in a fashion that runs you through a fantasy world filled with orcs and Dragons and sorcerers and loot, oh boy the loot... This DLC is the Borderlands 2 experience. Do not miss it. 10/10. Please find me a fault in this Dlc, for I can not find any off the top of my head.\nTorgues Campaign of Carnage.\nThis add on campaign, the same as Tiny Tinas Campaign, adds on an additional plot that introduces you to one of the best Npcs in the history of gaming. You will never look at a torgue weapon the same again. 9.8/10.\nCaptain Scarletts Pirate Booty.\nYeh, I dont know, its alright, but it just doesnt quite have the same awesome feel to it as the other campaigns. I think I might be the desert backdrop and the lack of a really interesting and constantly recurring funny character, but it doesnt hold you as well as the previous two, despite still being enjoyable and quite lengthy. I would give it a 8.7/10\nHammerlocks Hunt.\nSkip it. you are not missing out on anything. I know I sound very dismissove here, but the last boss is a ♥♥♥♥♥, as in the bullet reflecting, cowardly, annoying as hell ♥♥♥♥♥. Not to mention the raid boss, who is a collosal a-hole. Unavoidable novas and basically a giant Rabid Stalker, yeh...no, I think Ill pass, or maybe come back as a pimp when I level up my gunzerker... :resmile:\nHammerlock does his best to be funny, and the pathetic attempt at being a main villain does come out more humourous than intimidating as intended, so if you enjoy Borderlands humour and want another chunk of gameplay you wont be dissapointed, but you also wont come out going, Wow, that was awesome!  7.2/10\nFinally, for all of you who made it to hear, well done, clearly you have a large attention span, you might actually get yourself a legit Norfleet one day. The character packs. Mechromancer and Psycho. This depends on what you intend to do with each of these chars. Up to level 72 WITHOUT OP levels, I would recommend the Psycho. He is probably the most satisfying of all the chars in game, you find yourself looking out for that satisfying crunch sound beneath your buzzaxe... However, if you intend on taking only one of these chars into OP 8, take the Mechromancer. This is because the Psycho is balanced through leveling, and as he stops leveling inside the OP levels, his melee damage starts to drop off, making him far less viable, especially compared to the Mechromancers anarchy stacks, making you an inaccurate but oneshotting machine, when I say one shttting, I mean one shotting minibosses one shotting.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking at the game and thinking, "Hey, this looks pretty alright..." then do yourself a favor and buy it. And if you enjoy your first playthrough of the original campaign, do yourself a massive solid and get Tiny Tinas Dlc. You will not regret it. And if you are really loving the game, buy the Psycho, go Psycho and enjoy yourself while you do it. This is the best installment to the Borderlands franchise up until now, with the greatest campaign and longevity of them all. So do it.","September 8, 2015","true","721.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","2"

I kept playing more and more over time realizing that i was in love with this game.\n\n+ Fantastic story in my opinion.\n+ Great villain (essential for a good story IMO)\n+ Gun Porn\n+ When you finish the main storyline you still have plenty of things to do (loads of content)\n+ Good replayability\n+ Beautiful art style\n+Likeable characters.\n+ Fun co op with friends\n+ Great customization ( Also DLC's for that)\n+ Many DLC's story and cosmetic DLC's\n+Many classes to choose from\n+ Nice easter eggs\n+ Game has personality\n\n- Friendship ruining loot system\n- Some story parts are told through voice coms while you are fighting mobs, might end up not hearing what was going on due to explosions.\n- Time to time connection problems\n\nAll though these are just minor setbacks the game is still fantastic.

Which by the way is a beautifully place.\nThe environment ranges from glaciers, valleys, deserts, roaming hills, caverns, towns & with the expansions even more including a vast landscape produced by a 13year old explosives genius mind, Tiny Tina. A character I hope you will come to love as most of us have.\n\nThe main story is brilliant and take you all over Pandora. You can play solo or with up to 3 others, from 1 of 4-6 (DLC dependant) Vault hunters. All with unique abilities, and skill trees that can be changed throughout the game to suite your play style & equipment.\n\nThe vast number of optional side missions can provide some very nice loot, insights into the life & history of Pandora or just a good laugh.\n\nThe main DLC's (Psycho, Mechromancer, Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrades 1 & 2, Mr. Torgue's, Sir Hammerlock's, Captain Scarlett & best of all Tiny Tina's) are all worth the coin, the head hunter packs are ok, and the skins are all superficial. But to be fair now the GOTY Edition is out id just get that, then you have the lot, it's so worth it.

I currently have a level 18 Commando. Never did I touch the original Borderlands, and I always wanted to get into it. The commercials on TV always patronized me, and then one day, bam! Someone gifted it to me on Steam. I couldn't believe my eyes.\n\nIt is now maybe 3 years later, that I have gotten myself into Borderlands 2 (which, guess what - was gifted to me!) with two other friends. I am absolutely in love.\n\nIf you have ever played an MMORPG - the concept is sort of the same. You have to complete quests, and you unlock experience, currencies (Cash, Eridium [usable on black market]), weapons, class mods and whatnot. Of course, there is also DLC you can purchase to further customize your character -- but you do not even have to. You can also unlock OTHER character customizations just by playing.\n\nLoads of fun. Quests can sometimes be confusing on figuring out exactly just where to go, and controlling your first vehicle before you get the Bandit by mouse is EXTREMELY awkward for me.. the wheels don't move by A and S, it moves by the mouse. I know there's a term for that.. but I don't know what it is, and it is 2am in the morning.\n\nPlease - get this game. I promise you you will thank me later. And if it's gifted to you - thank that person. I have my own thanks to give. :)","February 13, 2014","true","23.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As such, I have explored all 6 classes, almost all of the skill sets, tried most of the weapons, etc. How they can make a game fun for as long as I have enjoyed this is beyond me. I played and really liked the first Borderlands, but this one is better yet and I have the pre-sequel already pre-ordered.\nWhile it is not a true sandbox as we have come to know, it gives enough general freedom to explore. It awards those who like to be thorough with up to 69 achievements and a lot of challenges which gives you B@d@$$ points you can spend within the game to make all your characters stronger.\nMy negatives are relatively minor. The game limits players from leveling above 72, but then introduces over-powered enemies through Raid On Digistruct Peak that then goes up to overpowered 8 (OP8). I understand the logic to this as they don't want everyone to have every skillset. However, there is no way that I know of to look at a level 72 player to know if they are playing as 72 or OP8. There is a big difference in the strength of the items and if an OP8 person joins your standard level 72 game they one-shot-kill everything.\nOverall, great game. I love the cooperative aspect. Without it, I wouldn't probably have ever played online. I hope as hardware gets stronger, they can make the graphics better and/or add more players to the mix. I don't think it probably is possible, but being able to game with someone on a console, PC, and MAC would be awesome.

The map areas have very nice visual detail to them and make for good eye candy.\n\nWeapons\nJust like In Borderlands 1 you have rifles,shotguns,smgs,pistols, & grenades  to play with.They have different status effects with the introduction of a new one called "Slag".As far as the vanilla(no dlc) game goes the variety seems not as random as Borderlands 1 though sadly.Not that this detracts from the game even slightly but it might annoy some.\n\nGameplay & Gamelength\nQuests are the usual standard fetch,blow this up,kill this person,deliever these items,escort,and protect/guard target types. You are free to do them in any order you like.The stories are just as you would expect in a borderlands game,creepy,sad,funny,cheerful, and insane.Events during the quests are pretty much the same s well. Length wise, Borderlands 2 Vanilla seems to contain at least more if not the same amount of content BL1 GOTY had. I am pretty sure BL2 has more than BL1 goty but not certain.\n\nA.I.,MP, and DLC thoughts\nThe A.I. is improved a bit from BL1 but the fun of Borderlands was never about the intelligence of the A.I. anyway.Graphics are lovely, system requirements are modest and you get a game that you do not need to buy any of the dlc if you do not wish without losing any enjoyment.Multiplayer is very nice and is drop in and out friendly as you can get.If someone is hosting the quest they are on becomes the quest others who join are on as well.The difficulty scales up with more ppl in a game.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nDo yourself a favor if you're a sandbox fan and like some non serious shooters and pick this up. The beauty of Borderlands 2 is, you won't feel left out because of not owning any dlc.Vanilla is worth it alone  don't  let the large amount of dlc put you off. You will get 60+ hours out of the vanilla game and not miss a beat.","July 11, 2014","true","89.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

I do wish it was more possible for people of different Level ranges to play together but we cant have it all.\nIn stark contrast to the first Borderlands, the story is actually compelling and the superb voice acting makes it hard not to be drawn in. The Humor plays a big part as well and never feels out of place in the abstract Borderlands Universe.\nThe Graphics look great on both high and mid range Systems, offering highly stylized Graphics that still have a touch of Realism.

Which by the way is a beautifully place.\nThe environment ranges from glaciers, valleys, deserts, roaming hills, caverns, towns & with the expansions even more including a vast landscape produced by a 13year old explosives genius mind, Tiny Tina. A character I hope you will come to love as most of us have.\n\nThe main story is brilliant and take you all over Pandora. You can play solo or with up to 3 others, from 1 of 4-6 (DLC dependant) Vault hunters. All with unique abilities, and skill trees that can be changed throughout the game to suite your play style & equipment.\n\nThe vast number of optional side missions can provide some very nice loot, insights into the life & history of Pandora or just a good laugh.\n\nThe main DLC's (Psycho, Mechromancer, Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrades 1 & 2, Mr. Torgue's, Sir Hammerlock's, Captain Scarlett & best of all Tiny Tina's) are all worth the coin, the head hunter packs are ok, and the skins are all superficial. But to be fair now the GOTY Edition is out id just get that, then you have the lot, it's so worth it.

Guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, class mods -- there’s always something just a bit better, something you so desperately didn’t even know you needed until you found it in Borderlands 2. Just like other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or recetly slain enemy. Guns are a bulk of the loot, and that’s great because you’re going to spend most of your time in Borderlands 2 staring down a gun sight.You simply have to decide the best -- or most entertaining -- way to kill everyone.

We are carried through planet Pandora once again to show us what changed in meantime, then we get to know more and more of Handsome Jack, one of best developed villains of all times (next to Vaas from Far Cry 3).

Guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, class mods -- there’s always something just a bit better, something you so desperately didn’t even know you needed until you found it in Borderlands 2. Just like other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or recetly slain enemy. Guns are a bulk of the loot, and that’s great because you’re going to spend most of your time in Borderlands 2 staring down a gun sight.You simply have to decide the best -- or most entertaining -- way to kill everyone. Borderlands 2 is a much needed improvements to areas like narrative and class skill design to Borderlands.

Then I killed alot of Bad Guys, but they just gave me Gun. Then I decided to buy all DLC, but then there was no limit of Gun. I never seen so much Gun in my life. Then I got hungry but i had only Gun to eat. Gun doesnt taste so bad, if you dont mind the taste of Gun. Dont try to drink Gun, that doesnt work. After i had Gun meal, i got bored of so much Gun. Maybe I could have fun with more Gun. It was great to play with Gun. Then one of my Friends asked me if this Game is worth buying it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/49520/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Borderlands 2 (BL2) is the only game I’ve ever preordered, and I definitely understand why people say Game of the Year editions punish loyal customers and early buyers. The game is amazing but if I want to get the DLC, I’ll have to spend more than the actual game costs! I guess I’ll have to wait until the GOTY edition is really cheap and upgrade my game.\n\nBL2 is a first person shooter where you play as one of 4 (6 if you have the DLC) Vault Hunters on the planet Pandora. The story takes place sometime after the events of Borderlands 1 (maybe a few years) and quite a few characters from the first game show up in BL2. The game is world is very large and exploring everything is an exhausting but worthwhile job. You can learn a lot about the game by listening to hidden audio recordings or talking with NPCs. There’s quite a lot of humor in the game so it’s never dull. The boss especially, Handsome Jack, has tons of insults and stories to throw your way.\n\nAs for gameplay, BL2 has a level system so I guess you could call it an RPG. Each level you get a skill point to put into 1 of about 45 different skills depending on your character. You can re-spec your skills at any time so you really only need 1 of each class to experience all the play styles. There are a few vehicles that you can drive depending on what area you’re in (travel can take forever if you’re on foot). BL2 has built in multiplayer so your friends can drop in or out at any time. Just like in the first game, if you’re “killed” you have about 5 seconds to Fight For Your Life. Kill any enemy during these 5 seconds and you’re revived. If you fail Fight For Your Life, you respawn at the nearest New-U kiosk (you don’t save or load the game manually). If you have a friend in the game, he can revive you during Fight For Your Life and you won’t have to respawn.\n\nLike the Diablo games, when you beat the game on normal mode, you can choose to replay on an increased difficulty level where both you and the enemies are higher level. Better gear will drop and almost all the enemies will gain resistances to various weapon types. This “True Vault Hunter Mode” gets insanely hard by the end of the game and you pretty much have to have a friend or 2 backing you up. BL2 is one of the few games that I’ve played through completely on coop with a friend and it definitely improves the experience.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend Borderlands 2 to anyone who enjoys First Person Shooters or Action RPGs (I’ve got over 200 hours in this game). The story and combat are amazingly well done as is the humor and variety. However, definitely look for a “complete edition” since the Game of the Year edition actually doesn’t include all the DLC. I think Greenmangaming had a complete edition a week or so ago which included not only the Season Pass, but also both new characters and the Ultimate Vault Hunter upgrades (increasing the level cap and introducing new weapon types).\n","August 19, 2014","true","258.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Their role and abilities are different, so you pick each one based on what you like. You can now customised your appearance like your head and the costume. I am not going to talk through the details about their each character's abilities, so let's talk about the story, characters, graphics and the features they added. The atmosphere has been improved from its predecessors, including different locations with variety of biomes (snow, desert, etc.), compared to previous instalment where every locations are just only desert terrain. The graphics are amazingly beautiful and colourful with cel-shading, running with Unreal Engine 3. The story is hilariously well done, especially the characters are the funniest like Tiny Tina, Handsome Jack and CL4PTR4P. You'll love them straight away, even I am now a fan of Tiny Tina because of her sense of humor. They also provided some side-quests as you progress the story. The NPCs from previous instalment is back as well, with personality finally. Combat system is still the same formula from the previous game but even better. New feature added, Badass Rank which benefits your stats, depending on how you chose the stats, you can enable it or disable it. To earn it, you need to complete the challenge to earn Badass points. They added a currency feature, like Eridium to increase your inventory, storage capacity and ammo capacity. The enemy A.I. is just tough and punishing but sometimes, A.I. can be dumb or glitchy at times. You can play with your friends up to 4 players on server, but the biggest downside is the looting system because you cannot share the loot, instead they added a trade feature, so if one of your players cannot use it due to its class requirements, benefits of the item and level requirements. On technical flaws, I found some of the most annoying encounters, like walking over the small step of terrain with invisible wall, I mean it's 21st century ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it. Almost linear design choices with free roam is fine but invisible wall on small rocks you can step over or just nearly everything except out of bounds area because you will get killed by automated turrets.\n\n+ Pros+ Atmosphere with variety of biomes\n+ LOOT, LOOT, LOOT MORE (I'm crazy about the dropped legendary loots from the fallen bosses)\n+ Hilarious story\n+ Replayability available (True Vault Hunter Mode / New Game Plus)\n+ Well executed character development and introducing characters throughout the story\n+ Combat System tweak and new features\n\n- Cons- Questionable invisible walls on terrains (small stairs, rocks)\n- Not shared loot system during Co-Op session\n\nIn this honest review, I highly recommend this game. It's an improved version of Borderlands. For your curiosity, play this game with friends than playing individually. Trust me, it's boring for some people who play this game alone. But for me, I love playing this game alone because of the grind. The story, atmosphere, well character development NPCs, looting system are the biggest improvement from the predecessor but those invisible walls on some terrain and not shared loot system is the weakest link. You will enjoy this game for every second if you play with friends.","June 4","true","60.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

So many different kinds of enemies, from the large variety of bandits that say all manner of things when fighting you and the strange alien animal enemies such as skags, bullymongs and many others.\n\nNo matter how many times I play this game I never get sick of it. Iam playing my third character and levelling her to max lvl and am still enjoying myself.\n\nThe game also has RPG elements such as you have various skill trees to put points in as well as can customise the look of your character by skins and heads, though most of the more interesting ones you have to pay for.\n\nAnd you can try and do all the challenges if you do get bored which increases your badass rank, giving you tokens to put into increasing things like health, shield recharge rate etc. by a small .% of each token used, so it adds up and makes your character even stonger as you'll need it if you want to face terramorphous a very challenging lvl 52 super  boss.\n\nThere is not really any major downsides I can think of with this game, had no bugs or problems, the controls are good.\n\nThe only negatives I can think of is that I tend to out level quests, I end up lvl 19 and have a lvl 15 quest. And if you want the best loot you have to do a lot of boss farming.\n\nThis game I'd class as almost perfect in my top 5 of all time favourite games. This is a must play game 9/10.\n","October 10, 2015","true","621.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/recommended/49520/","Thomas-","Chargeback Thomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/","748 products in account","Memela Borderlands 2 is a FPS/RPG hybrid.\n\nYou begin the game by choosing 1 of 4 (6, if you own the DLC) characters. Each with their own unique skills and abilities. You can customise the colour of their clothes with skins, and choose between a couple of different heads. You can unlock more skins later on, or buy one of the 50 odd DLC.\n\nYou are a vault hunter who has been left for dead. Without much context, you all of a sudden become the good guy and must take out Handsome Jack, the antagonist of the game. The game tries to be funny, and succeeds at points, but most of the humour relies on overused memes, so a lot of it is just annoying. Overall the story is nothing special, and instead the game is gameplay focused.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty fun. Borderlands 2 is a co-op game at heart, so I wouldn't recommend playing the game solo. It bored me very quickly. But with a few friends the game is great. There's a big variety of weapons, and plenty of loot to collect. There's also plenty of side quests to keep you busy. If you are looking for a good story-based game, you won't find it here, but what you will get instead is a great shooter which is a ton of fun with friends.\n\nThe DLC in the game isn't nothing special. The 2 characters and level upgrade packs are nice for those who want to have multiple playthroughs, but if you are only going to play through the game once, and not bother with new game+, you could give them a miss. The story DLC is good for those who have beat the game and want new locations to play in. But just like the base game, the stories in them aren't too interesting either.\n\nOverall, the game is a fun co-op shooter but the story is nothing special. It can be funny at times, but relies too much on overused memes to try and be funny. But I still recommend it.","March 20, 2014","true","133.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshsosin/recommended/49520/","joshsosin","Josh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshsosin/","218 products in account","Borderlands 2 is spot-on in every way.\nFrom the hilarious characters with brilliantly written dialogue to the enticing loot to the zany, phrenetic combat, every aspect of the game is perfectly executed. Gearbox took a risk in casting four (six) new vault hunters to replace those from the original Borderlands, but the new characters fill in their positions excellently. In addition, Lilith, Mordecai, Brick and Roland all play major parts in the game as NPCs, and their presence is welcome. Claptrap returns as well, as humorously moronic as before.\n\nThe four new vault hunters, Axton (Commando), Zer0 (Assassin), Salvador (Gunzerker), and Maya (Siren), are racing against Handsome Jack, president of the Hyperion Corporation, to reach and open a new vault. In addition to the main four vault hunters, there are two DLC characters, Gaige the Mechromancer and KRIEG the Psycho, who are definitely worth purchasing if you are into the game. They are included in the Game of the Year Edition.\n\nThe story is entertaining throughout, with plenty of fun side missions to complete if and when you finish the main game. There are also three DLC bonus campaigns which are all extremely fun.\n\nIn conclusion, Borderlands 2 is a rare 10/10 in my book. It's one of those games that is just plain old fun, without sacrificing a clever, well thought-out story and excellent character design.","January 13, 2015","true","139.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Borderlands 2, however, re-invents the FPS genre in a new, exciting and comical way.\n\nFirst off, Borderlands 2's world and map design is like no other. The mysteriously beautiful planet of Pandora looks even more stunning than Borderlands 1, and everything from the way enemies behave, to the performance of the vehicles, makes the presentation of Borderlands 2 one of the most original shooters to date. The strory has you play as one of four Vault Hunters: Axton, the Commando; Maya, the Siren; Salvador, the dual-wielding Gunzerker; or Zer0, the Assassin. As a Vault Hunter, you must compete with Handsome Jack, president of Hyperion, for the alluring ore Eridium.\n\nBorderlands 2 is all about loot. There are containers in every corner, filled with all sorts of goodies like weapons and ammunition. Also, there are a TON of guns in Borderlands 2. Guns are found everywhere. You'll often find them after killing an enemy, opening chests or in huge crates. I have spent so long comparing the stats of these against others, and finding that perfect SMG really scratches that itch.\n\nAlthough Borderlands 2's gameplay is entertaining, addictive and insane, I do feel that the objectives were often repetitive. Being requested by people to "Go here, kill this bad guy, come back, earn a reward." just gets boring after a while, and was inevitably my biggest problem with the game. What I found enjoyable just seemed to get monotonous.\n\nOverall, there are so many things that are amazing in Borderlands 2. From the hilarious and creative story, to wonderfully presented graphics and game mechanics, it's hard to find imperfections in the game. But, here and there, missions can feel more like a chore than having fun.\n\n8.4/10","October 7, 2014","true","21.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Graphics\nYes those visual friends of ours that tickle our eyes in jolly old delight.\nThey are here in plenty tho a little dated the comic style in the way the game is presented is very\nnice. The lines colors and shades work well in this style and allow you "oooh and ahhh" at the screen as you\nfire away with one of your boom sticks.\nThe next great thing in this game is loot and I mean LOOT every where. Its what its all about. after getting killed a few times and getting very frustrated with the game it pays of when you find some badd *** gun and take down the next few waves with an ear to ear grin plastered on your face.. AMAZING!\nNext is  co-op\nSeamless Co-Op. join a buddy's game and play on. Leaving body parts and gore in the tracks of your team. This is how co-op should be.\nSplitting money and a trade system between your groups allows no one to be left out of the loot bonanza!\nNext...mmmm what is next? Well the over all game play is fast paced and very addictive the game at times can seem a bit of a grind. Constant enemy waves put your poor trigger finger to the test and push the meaning of ammo conservation to the test. But then you find the loot bin and the grind had paid off, nicely too. The mission system shows how hard the next mission will be and if you need to roam around to level prior to your attempt is a great option.\nA level 4 taking on a level 6 mission will be very tough but levelling is easy in the beginning. After level five you get a skill point to spend in one of 3 trees to make your toon yours and yours alone.\nIn my opinion this game sets a fast paced shooting callery of bandits, monsters, robots and other evil doing creatures. My advise is to lock load pre-pair your fingers and dive face first in the sea of bullets ahead and enjoy the visuals, game play and the company of a stark-raving mad friend to accompany you on this blissful murder feast.\nEnjoy!\nGraphics 8/10 Gameplay 8/10 Co-op 10/10 Controls 9/10 Content 9/10 Replay 7/10\nOverall 8.5 on the ~n00bz~ scale","August 24, 2014","true","55.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neptonic/recommended/49520/","Neptonic","[HOH]Neptonic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neptonic/","204 products in account","Let me lay it down for you guys, Borderlands 2 is one of my new favorite games in my library.\n\nBorderlands 2 is a hybrid FPS RPG 4 player Co-Op game. Now, when I say RPG, I don't mean something like Final Fantasy, Skyrim, or Dragon Age. Those games need you to be fully invested in the RPG elements of the game, and while I do like that sometimes, other times it gets boring for me. Borderlands 2's system feels very unobtrusive and can produce some good results even if you are randomly picking things in the skill tree. But if you do put some thought into your character's skills and how you play the game, you could be rewarded with a character that is perfect just for you. A good thing to mention is that there is only 4 (now 6 with DLC) classes to choose. While that doesn't seem like many to some people, each charcter is unique in skillset and apperance.\n\nI must say, even though it didn't feel like then, the first 1 to 2 hours are slow. You don't even unlock skills untill lvl 5. That goes away once you hit the "hub" city of Sanctuary. This is where the story picks up and the one of my favorite parts of the game shines, the side quests. These missions never take themselves too seriously and sometimes are quite inventive, more than the standard fetch quests other games make you do. And everyonce in a while you start a quest that turns into a large chain of quests, building this little mini story (A good example of this is Ellie's Clan War quest). The main story is okay, much better than the orignial's, but it isn't close to the amount of depth some other shooters have. However the writing is great and is very funny. All of the NPCs have their own personality and some you can really begin to love after a while. Except Claptrap. I can love him in short bursts.\n\nFor the FPS element, it comes down to the guns. Remember when I said the RPG system was unobtrusive? I kinda lied, as I have spent lots of time just sitting and comparing the stats of guns, shields, class mods, relics, and grenades to each other. Guns can be pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, snipers, SMGs, and rocket launchers. All equipment has a manufacturer which decides for guns what it's strenght has. So Jacobs guns are usually high damage, low capcity, semi-auto guns, but the fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. Hyperion guns actually get more accurate the more shots the fire. And there are more brands with more effects. Then there is elemental types that do more damage to certain types of enemies, like fire doing more damge to biological enemies, corriosive doing more to armored enemies, ect. So when ever you pick up a gun you have a lot of things to consider.\n\nSpeaking of guns and loot there is a serious issue when it come to Co-Op. When an enemy drops a gun, it only drops one. Not a problem in single player. But with 4 people that causes issues, especially on bosses who drop really valuable loot. For me that is my only serious issue with the game, and I play by myself mostly anyway.\n\nI've had lot's of fun playing this game, and if you don't own it, I suggest you do. I also suggest you get the Game of the Year edition which is a great value. And remember in the words of Markus the gunsalesman, "No Refunds!"","July 17, 2014","true","185.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although Borderlands 2 recycles the basic plot of the first game, the twists, characters, and dialogue are extraordinary.  From the reflections of the environment in gun scopes to the smoldering volcanic ash falling from the sky, the graphics are superb.  From Miss Moxxi's sultry voice to the delicious splat of a midget psycho's head, the quality of the voice acting and sounds is perfect.  Controls are amazing: a joy to play with both a keyboard/mouse or a controller.  Millions upon millions of guns, a variety of different enemies, six unique classes, and up to three friends make one of the best games ever.\n\nNo game is without its flaws however.

Full of very interesting and funny characters. A great thing about this game is that even after you beat each level cap, each playthrough dificulty with each character and buy all the DLC the game still isn't over. You still have side missions you can go back and do if you missed them. You have game acheivements via steam you can go back and unlock as well as work towards your badass ranks that increases your stats through all characters. With borderlands there's always SOMETHING you can do even if you've 'done it all'.\n\nHaven't played the original borderlands yet? No worries! Players who were suckered in by friends who begged you to play borderlands2 with them (like me) can easily jump right in and play! It doesn't take long to learn all the ropes and soon you'll know Pandora like the back of your hand! A hillarious game full if jokes and references only a person who spends their time emersed in the internet would get.\n\nSkeptical on FPS? No worries, there's no 'cover me! I'm realoading' in this game! Nor is their spawn camping 6 year olds who make 'yo momma' jokes. Just you, your trusted companions and the enemies of pandora who are out to give you a REAL beatdown.","January 23, 2014","true","070.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has a solid theme throughout with witty, refreshing characters and dialogue. If you enjoy RPG's and FPS I would highly reccommend this game to you. An absolute classic which will remain as one of my favourite games. It has its glitches though like gun merging and infinite ammo however this is only possible on singleplayer so it doesn't ruin the game too much. I feel this game gives a better experience if you play this in Multiplayer with friends however the loot isn't shared among everyone (only the xp and money) so the guns have to be literally nabbed by everyone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nbk_whtvr/recommended/49520/","nbk_whtvr","Ho Lee Fuk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nbk_whtvr/","50 products in account","Trust me when I say that trying to rate a favourite game and remain open for the contras of the game is really hard.\n\nShort review: Loot’n’Shoot, Shoot’n’Loot.\n\nLong review:\nI bought this game for one reason only – my play friends bought it and I would have been bored to play anything else on my own. Prior to playing it, I didn’t like the typical cartoonish style and wasn’t really excited about the option to remove the thick border lines either.\nSo I bought it, installed it and started playing with my friends – I still wasn’t very excited about the game – but maybe because the first few missions aren’t very captivating. But a bit further in the playthrough and a few level-ups later…. BOOM! I fell in love! I obsessed with the characters, storyline and loved the dialogues. All I wanted to do in my spare time was playing BL2! At a certain amount of characters and playthroughs, I stopped playing. And when I decided to play a bit again, I remembered the love…\n\nDLCs:\nI have all the playable DLCs and enjoyed them all. If you liked it and don’t have a budget to buy all the DLCs, then I believe you should definitely get ‘Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep’ and ‘Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue’s Campaign of Carnage’.\nThe mini DLCs are really really short (Headhunter 1: Bloody Harvest; Headhunter 2: Wattle Gobbler; Headhunter 3: Mercenary Day; Headhunter 4: Wedding Day Massacre; Headhunter 5: Son of Crawmerax;). On the other hand you get to do fun stuff like *SPOILERS!*  drinking whiskey, making babies cry, kill happy loving couples, kill drunk enemies and chase loot leprechauns…\n\nContras:\nThe only thing I can point out here is what happened to me when me and my friends. What happened to me is that me and my friends started new characters to play together, but of them didn’t play as much as the others. This lead to a huge difference in levels and the low level character being useless and unable to enjoy the game. Of course, there are ways to work around this and this is isn’t a flaw in the game itself. Nevertheless, I do believe this still should be said, as BL2 is not like Dead Island, where all characters can be different levels and can still play together (due to level compensation).\nDeathtrap is quite buggy when you’re in the menu: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=153789460\nIt’s not much of a big deal IMO, but you might get to see a few of these when loading a new location - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=170330455\n\nPros:\nI like the graphics, even though I can’t play on the maxed out settings or with PhysX on high quality. Having the graphics settings on max looks awesome though (as per my knowledge there are a few bugs showing on the highest settings).\nFinding and joining someone else’s game is easy and straight forward and the community is awesome – if you ask, you’ll be helped by complete strangers. As I prefer coop games, this made my gaming experience really enjoyable. It should be noted that, as BL2 is a coop game, there shouldn’t be any reason for players not to be nice, but still… Nice people become more an exception in real life and on the internet, so I have to point this out.\nWhat I love is the dialogues, the NPCs response when you engage in talking with them (check screens in the bottom, but beware –  SPOILERS!), the characters’ story and custom dialogues depending on the character you play (in the mini DLC’s).\nFor me, the biggest ‘pro’ for BL2 is the fact that it made me laugh so hard, so many times. If anything can make you laugh and cry at the same time, then it’s worth spending the time. Of course, humour varies, so it can’t be a guaranteed fun time for everyone.\n\nWill you like the game or not? I don’t know… It really depends on what you expect and like, so make your choice.\n\nScreenshots = Spoilers!\nNPC dialogue lines:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234047759\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234047391\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=165472838\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234047552\n\nTypical BL2 humour:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=155631698\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=180275753\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231877045\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=205405674","September 12, 2014","true","612.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

With exciting AND addictive game-play that stays fresh even past the 5th play-through I am never bored with this game.\nThe story is actually great and the superb voice acting makes it hard to not like the characters from the bandits to handsome Jack himself, on that the characters are well made and written and each is unique from the main cast (Zero, Maya, Axton and Salvador) to all the bosses, even to npc's such a Moxxi and Crazy Earl, each has a nice backstory from obtainable audio logs and also them talking to you through missions and just seeing them in general\nThe humor plays a big part as well and is one of the main attractions of the Borderlands franchise but another is the graphics, the graphics look great overall and the PhysX makes it even better, the iconic graphics though not like Battlefield or Metro in quality are still amazing if you have a close look at the world in Borderlands 2, a change from Borderlands 1's post-apocalyptic landscape.\nThe DLC are a must have, maybe not the skin packs so much but they are nice non-the-less, the real gems are the actual main DLC's, some are serious and to the campaign and some are crazy, each DLC is made around a character like Mr Torgue, the owner of the explosive guns but my favorite was the second to final boss, Professor Nakayama, (SPOILERS) He looks like he will mutate or something from the eridium markings but me and my friends were too busy laughing when he fell down the stairs and on each step he hit, his lifebar went down a chunk, easily one of the funniest moments in Borderlands (In my opinion)\nI had this on console and clocked litterally 1000's of hours on it, soon to be building a beast of a computer and will be returning to the Borderlands to have some fun and shoot some bandits in closing this game truly deserved Game of the Year and remains my favorite game of all time, it truely deserves this place and if anyone doesnt have this game you are missing out, it isnt everyones 'cup of tea' but for less that £5/$10 it is well worth it even if you arent a big fan and only play it once.\n\nNOTE: THIS IS QUITE BIASED AS I AM A HUGE FAN OF THE SERIES AND HAVE GOT A LOT MORE HOURS ON CONSOLE\n\nGraphics - 8/10\nHumour - 9/10\nPlot - 7/10\nLifetime - 9/10\nGameplay - 10/10","January 3, 2014","true","144.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Дизайн каждого объекта, каждого населенного пункта – изумителен; уникальный, рисованный графический стиль; тщательная проработка каждой детали. В игре многообразие оружия. Игра автоматически генерирует характеристики находимых или «выпадающих» из монстров экземпляров, создавая огромнейший арсенал: начиная от обычных пистолетов и заканчивая снайперками с разрывными патронами и кислотными гранатометами. В игре много юмора и побочных и сюжетных миссий.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liampower/recommended/49520/","liampower","Dr Strangelove","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liampower/","142 products in account","Gameplay: The shooting mechanics are very competent, although there is not as much differentiation between weapons as there was in the original Borderlands, the weapon variety is still much more impressive than most other games on the market (as of this review). The gunplay is designed to be fast paced, with each character having an equally high jump height and no fall damage. Unfortunately many of the available skills add little to the gameplay, only making minor changes to stats such as damage and reload speed (although there are a few instances in which a particular skill can radically change the way you play). Overall the shooting is fun, but can get repetitive over time. This is remedied by playing with friends, which spices up the general gameplay; but unfortunately repitition and lack of incentivising loot made the game a chore to play for me towards the end.\n\nStory: The plot is sullied by an annoying dichotomy between the game's attempts at creating forced emotion and a cheap laugh, moments of particular emotional weight are negated entirely when a sudden line or action from a character attempts to provide comic relief or simply emphasise the game's ludicrous nature; because of this it is hard to take the plot seriously and moments that would otherwise be genuinely funny are simply annoying or distracting. The game has moments which did make me laugh, but often resorts to borderline juvenile jokes, which compared to the few witty lines feel out of place and hamper the overall comedic experience.\n\nGraphics: The cell-shaded art style is certainly unique and works in tandem with the semi-realistic world of Pandora to create an environment that is both grounded in reality but also clearly fictional. This is to the game's benefit, immersing the player into the intruiging world without the need for particularly detailed models or textures (not to say that these are lacking, many of the weapons and locations are imbued with a unique style of their own, but as years go by the art style will not age as badly as those games which attempt to portray a pseudo-realistic world, but are limited by current technology).\n\nSound: The soundtrack consists primarily of electronic music, which works in synonym with the fast-paced gameplay. The voice acting is well done as well, with many characters having well voiced dialogues. Sound design throughout the game is well done.\n\nRe-playability: There are four different classes, each with a unique special ability (being able to dual-weild weapons, deploy a turret, etc.), but the skills available to each of these classes are not particularly unique, so replaying the game is not especially worthwhile. There are a large amount of challenges, but many can be simply accomplished through normal gameplay, or are very grindy.\n\ntl;dr: Great game, but can get repetitive. More fun with friends.","January 9, 2015","true","62.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Basically nothing other than a few minor tweaks for my preferences, but I won't get into them. The gameplay and story are stellar. My favorite part is the character dialogue. I never get tired of Brick's voice complimenting me on how much of a badass I am or Roland's approving "Good job soldier". With more DLC than could be asked including (but not limited to) 4 campaigns, arena and slaughter challenges, and 4 mini holiday themed campaigns, you won't run out of content anytime soon. 99/100 is my score, and definitely worth the money, especially since it is always going on sale for holidays and steam sales.

Pandora is a huge open world to explore and it has some of the most diverse creatures and enemies I have ever seen in a game. the guns are all randomly generated and they all have there own name, stats, levels and abilities making each and every gun you find unique and different from one another, so you will never get the same gun twice and you will be more proud when you find that one badass gun you really wanted. this game also has an amazing 4 player co-op that you can do all the main missions and side quest together and trade your guns and loot with each other. this game is just infinitely times better when you're playing it with one or more of your friends. onces you get into it you just want to play this game again and again. my recommendation... just buy this game xD you won't regret it ;)\n\nFinal Score: (10/10) Absolutely Incredible ;)","February 12, 2014","true","163.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eqofromtwia/recommended/49520/","eqofromtwia","Eqo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eqofromtwia/","125 products in account","Very fun game! Imagine what would happen if Unreal Tournament had a night of passion with Firefly and Invader Zim. Co-op FPS+RPG featuring hilarious jokes, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, hilarious jokes, robots, lasers, hilarious jokes, spaceships, mutants, hilarious jokes, dragons, pirates, hilarious jokes... You get the picture.\n\nThe base game alone offers a lot. It took 40 hours to get through the story campaign, after which I was only level 33. The original side missions go up to level 50. Each of the DLC campaigns adds a full new story, new maps, new side missions, new items, and new skins. One DLC increases the level cap to 61 and another to 72, allowing you to unlock more skills for your characters. The "Badass Rank" system is unlimited, so in theory you can get infinite stat boosts to make your characters infinitely powerful.\n\nThe two DLC characters are very fun to play. They feel very different from the original four characters by bringing unique playstyles. Gaige has a giant pet robot of doom, and a stackable Anarchy mechanic which encourages you to sacrifice accuracy and clip size in favor of chaos and explosions. She also has the most adorable catchphrases. Krieg is a psycho (one of the enemies you commonly face) and is actually more effective without shields and when he's lit on fire. He regains his health by decapitating foes with a buzzsaw axe and bathing in their blood. His catchphrases are very disturbing, and you will either hate him or love him. There is no middle ground with Krieg.\n\nI played the first 40 hours solo, and after experiencing the story I started playing through the DLC campaigns co-op with my friends. I'm a completionist and there are a ton of achievements, so I'll be playing the side missions and exploring the world to unlock everything. Co-op is definitely a fun experience, but the game offers a lot for solo players as well. I've played so much and still have not experienced most of the content. This game is definitely worth the money.","January 4, 2014","true","130.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don't be fooled with the gameplay videos on youtube and the trailer ones which does not at all reflect the actual gameplay, because it's the atmosphere with YOU inside the game that makes the game truly amazing. The story is incredibly great that you'd love playing the game over and over again with different characters.\n\nI have only bought the game just today and I am completely amazed with how you play the game - the story has a repetitive gameplay (I haven't even progessed much but I already want to replay.) with different characters, with your friends and all, and along with that you will want your dear Clap-trap to shut up as he talks non-sense.\n\nOh also, there are vehicles that reminds me of Far Cry and it's really hilarious to try to ride the car as your friend tries to shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monsters. I ended up crashing the car into mountain which ended up getting stuck. (DAMNIT MONSTERS.) Maybe you'll have a better luck.\n\nIt is worth noting that the class skills are easy to use and learn, and I usually find games like this incredibly confusing (Skyrim, for example). It's a nice starter game for people who want to get used to class-type games.\n\nAll in all, I must admit that this game is truly one of the best games I've ever played, and was definitely worth buying the whole game and it's DLC's while it's on sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirrizky/recommended/49520/","sirrizky","SirRizky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirrizky/","85 products in account","There’s nothing quite as subjective as comedy and the characters of Borderlands 2 will either irritate or please, sometimes even both in equal measure. From the weird rap nonsense of Tiny Tina to the cackling, evil tones of Handsome Jack, Borderlands 2 is built on a bizarre world that relies on how much you enjoy its colourful cast of characters. And for us, we definitely loved our time with these crazy people.\nWhile a continuation of the story seen in Borderlands, it’s not imperative that you have played it in order to understand the story. The sequel being most welcoming for newcomers giving the player four new characters to control, the commando Axton, the siren Maya, the gunzerker Salvador and the assassin Zer0. All four of these being Vault Hunters, new to the planet of Pandora who have found themselves in a trap set by the games villain Handsome Jack. Once escaping said trap they team up with Claptrap in order to help bring down Jack and stop him from using the vault for his own nefarious means. There are also the returning characters, including the original Vault Hunters from the first game, and the more secondary characters like Dr Zed and cosplay favourite Moxxxi. Each coming with their own selection of missions and comedic moments. A smile was definitely raised when invitations to Claptrap’s party had to be handed out, none of who chose to attend, cue awkward dancing and hanging around for a couple of minutes while bad music plays.\nThe framework of Borderlands 2 is close to the original, with loot being grabbed, missions being collected and a whole host of creatures and soldiers standing between you and Handsome Jack. It’s neither an update nor a revolution of the mechanics, more an evolution. The FPS gameplay still remains largely unchanged. Shooting feels great with the amount of guns at your disposal staggering. From sniper rifles to shotguns, each weapon has a specific manufacture that comes with their own strengths. With some giving specific damage types, such as corrosive and fire, with some guns even exploding when they’ve ran dry.   This also carrying into the grenade types and shields. The way you approach each combat situation largely depending on what weapons you have equipped, making each battle somewhat tactical, especially when certain enemy types are weaker to certain elements. Coming up against a robot? Then give corrosive weaponry a try. It’s one of the most satisfying shooters in some time.\nThen there’s the added ability each character comes equipped with. The commando Axton for instance is able to drop a turret once the skill is fully charged. This then can be levelled up once you gain experience points, as well as the usual shields, health and weapon damage. With plenty of side missions available there’s plenty of opportunity to raise your characters level, with each mission handily letting you know whether this is a too tough for you at your current ability or merely a walk in the park.\nOf course, much like the original the game really comes alive in multiplayer. Joining your friends for missions is a delight and works really well. But that’s not to say it lives and dies on its online multiplayer. Even in single player the game is a blast with an absolute ton of content, the world of Pandora being a massive place with variety far outweighing that of its predecessor. From large desert lands that can be traversed by vehicle, ice covered mountains, all the way to luscious green fields and towering structures, there’s plenty to see and do. Made even more impressive with the vibrant Borderlands art style. A cartoony world, with a visceral edge, as limbs fly and heads explode. The only issue with the graphics being the texture pop-in. An issue that plagues far too many games, as it takes a number of seconds before all the textures finally appear.\nWhat the original Borderlands did so well has been grabbed and near perfected with this sequel. The comedy may be hit and miss, but it thrives on its shooting and loot grabbing. Many hours of fun will await you in Pandora. 10/10","February 27, 2014","true","463.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

(Two of them are DLC) All with their own playstyles and personalities. The six Include: Axton The Commando (He's like Roland in the first game with his turrets and stuff), Maya The Siren, Salvador The Gunzerker, Zer0 The Assassin, Gaige The Mechromancer (DLC), and Krieg the Psycho (DLC).\n\nWith 3 skilltrees with each character, your playstyles for the characters can be limitless (Probably not).\n\nThere is a looting system where you have to fight a boss for a unique weapon/item or legendary weapon/item. They will have a 1/30 chance of dropping the items. (They did make drops more frequent so I don't really know what the chance of an item dropping is now)\n\nThe weapons and items all do different things, with different stats, so you would like to get the best one to become a true Badass.\n\nThe leveling system: In The third playthrough (Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode) will have all items and enemies scale to your level, There are two DLCs that increase the level cap: Those 2 Vault Hunter upgrade packs (I don't remember what they're called, so sorry), The first one will increas your level cap from 50 to 61, and the second one (You need the first one for this) Increases it to 61 to 72.\n\nThere is also something called Overpowered Levels: After you reach level 72, you can go into a place called "Digistruct Peak" in which you can increase your level even further, as the enemies are tougher, and you can level up to Overpowered Level 8 (Level 80).\n\nI really do reccomend this game.","June 18, 2014","true","105.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's been nothing short of amazing and definitely ranks amongst the Top 5 this generation. The gameplay, story, drop system and dialogue are MASSIVE (and I'm not exaggerating) improvements over the first game. The main quest doesn't feel as tedious, bland and empty as BL1, in which some will give you the chance to earn slight bonuses, consisting of stronger weapons, shields or even character skins.\n\nOne of the major overhauls I love the most is the Badass Rank. Completing levels of challenges will increase your BA Rank and give you a token whi you can apply to stat increase for better accuracy, longer duration of DoT effects (shock, fire, corrosive) or overall damage. And your BA Rank is applied to all characters that you create (my BA Rank is around 31,000 or so) so you can start off a new character and be extremely overpowered but in the long run it will pay off as True Vault Hunter Mode will greatly amp up the difficulty. More so with Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (not recommended until Lv61 because of level scaling). You can also earn skins from these challenges as well.\n\n\nOf the core classes available you have Axton the commando, whose Sabre Turret shreds up everything when deployed. Going down specific trees allows the turret to fire rockets, set of a radial nuke or even grant the ability to deploy 2 at once. Maya is a Siren, much like Lilith but instead of Phase Shifting for an advantage, she can use Phase Lock. Phase Lock surrounds the target in a orb when invested into skills like Elated, Sweet Release, Helios and Chain Reaction, you'll set the enemy on fire, drain health (and restore it to your friends) and transfer that orb to the next target. Gaige the Mechomancer (who was available as a preorder bonus before the game launched) has Deathtrap. Deathtrap is basically your scout who'll rip apart anything in sight and his abilities are further amplified when going down the Best Friends Forever tree. I've invested a few points into BFF myself but I'm more partial to Little Big Trouble. LBT primarily focuses on Shock damage, in which some weapons (and shields) can make Gaige literally invincible.\n\nThere's much more I can say here but I'll wrap this up with: If you see it on sale, better yet the GOTY Edition which includes all of the DLC (not the paid skins) you are definitely getting a huge bang for your buck. 10/10.","December 17, 2013","true","491.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don't be fooled with the gameplay videos on youtube and the trailer ones which does not at all reflect the actual gameplay, because it's the atmosphere with YOU inside the game that makes the game truly amazing. The story is incredibly great that you'd love playing the game over and over again with different characters.\n\nI have only bought the game just today and I am completely amazed with how you play the game - the story has a repetitive gameplay (I haven't even progessed much but I already want to replay.) with different characters, with your friends and all, and along with that you will want your dear Clap-trap to shut up as he talks non-sense.\n\nOh also, there are vehicles that reminds me of Far Cry and it's really hilarious to try to ride the car as your friend tries to shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monsters. I ended up crashing the car into mountain which ended up getting stuck. (DAMNIT MONSTERS.) Maybe you'll have a better luck.\n\nIt is worth noting that the class skills are easy to use and learn, and I usually find games like this incredibly confusing (Skyrim, for example). It's a nice starter game for people who want to get used to class-type games.\n\nAll in all, I must admit that this game is truly one of the best games I've ever played, and was definitely worth buying the whole game and it's DLC's while it's on sale. You should definitely not miss the chance to try this game.","August 24, 2014","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You will like this game if the following appeals to you.\n\n-Looting\n\n-Character Builds, Rotations\n\n-Co-op\n\n-Fast and fluid combat\n\nSome often complain about Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode being to hard, if you have any experience with shooters then challenge will be lacking a bit until higher levels, I will warn you this game is a grind if you don't use Save Editor's. If you come from POE or WoW this is not as grindy as those games. Though the games life cycle is over, if you have any friends to play with it will be a great experience, stick with this game and become good, you will have a chance to compete with other players via time trials for certain levels. It adds a competitive aspect to the game if your looking for that, I enjoy it.\n\n\nThere is nothing really like it, this is the ultimate looter shooter right here.

Want to play a co-op game with friends? This is the game. I really don't recommend playing alone, as you can still have fun, but it's double the experience. Also, ememy's are harder the more players, so it's not a game you are just going to dominate with friends.\n\nThe game overall is amazing and I think you guys should give it a shot. It's not an easy game either. Don't do side missions, and you will be punished. It's not you have to do side missions all the time, but if you just play the main story, you will be lagging one level or 2 behind.","February 15","true","55.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In Co op play, this game simply rocks, I have never experienced any problems connecting with my mates.\nThe DLC's then, I can higly recommend Tina's DLC and the vault hunters pack, I also enjoyed Mr Torcques quite a bit but the others are like, nahhhh.\n\nIf u see this game dropping in price in winter sale, u cant go wrong bying it.","August 3, 2013","true","649.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

Enormous amount of content.\n2. Challenging and engaging.\n3. Once tweaked, the graphics aren't half bad, especially the PhysX.\n4. It doesn't seem to be Pay-to-Win, with all the DLC, like some might fear.\n5. Amazing in co-op with your friends, or a random, legitimate player.\n6. With the greatest reservation: cheating is possible, for those that care for it.\n7. Plenty of ways to tweak the game, both in-game, but especially the ini files.\n8. Hours upon hours of gameplay! Brilliant longevity.\n9. Level up many important stats, infinitely, with the Badass Tokens and its Rank.\n10. Up to 6 playable characters, each with a different special, skill-set, voice-set, and look.\n11. Fully supports the wired XBOX 360 controller, of which my brother and I frequently use.\n12. Plenty of Steam achievements, if you like that sorta thing.\n\nCons:\n\n1. I've had to cap BL2 to 30fps, because the game's engine seems terrible at maintaing 60fps.\n2. It seems impossible to easily disable PhysX - the lowest in-game option is "low".\n3. The game can be very difficult, at times, but there are guides.\n4. BL2 features "keys", which are used to acquire a lot of arguably OP gear.\n5. BL2 runs on the Unreal Engine 3, which is despised by many, and not without justification.\n6. Apparently there are issues with the multiplayer lobby, but I don't use it, ...\n7. There are sadly a lot of cheaters, so choose wisely with whom you play.\n\nI do recommend this game, because even with all its flaws, it's still absolutely amazing!

Well if not too bad, I'm telling you anyway.\n\nThere is a LOT of content in Borderlands 2 alone, but get the DLC and there is way too much content. Except for Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt, forget that DLC.\n\nNow, to start, there are 8 weapon companies in the Game and 6 weapon types:\n\nPistols\nSniper Rifles\nAssault Rifles\nRocket Launchers\nShotguns\nSMG's\n\nBandit: Yep, bandits are making weapons. They make weapons with MASSIVE magazines, low accuracy, acceptable recoil and average damage, slow reloads.\nJakobs: These guys make weapons that fire as fast as you can pull the trigger cowboy! Also, small clips and large recoil. No elemental weapons.\nTediore: Fire 1 bullet, throw grenade gun when reloading and do loads of damage, but that can chew through ammo.\nVladof: Fire faster as you keep the trigger held, but less accurate.\nTorgue: These guys specialise in EXPLOSIVE WEAPONS. They are LOUD and require EXCESS use of CAPITAL LETTERS, with slow bullet speed.\nDahl: Burst fire when zoomed weapons, and really low recoil, good in a lot of cases.\nHyperion: Inaccurate- accurate weapons in a few shots, quiet useful in a lot of situations.\nMaliwan: These guys ONLY make elemental weapons. They're weaker than the others, but the elemental DoT (damage over time) and elemental chance make up for it.\nE-Tech: all weapon brands that are REALLY AWESOME!\n\nYou can play as 4 characters:\nAxton the Commando: Sabre Turret Action Skill, reliable damage output\nMaya the Siren: Phaselock Action Skill, good for crowd control\nSalvador the Gunzerker: Gunzerking Action Skill, ever wanted to dual wield AND regenerate ammo? Now, you can.\nZero the Assassin: Deception Action Skill, no regen options, but can lifesteal and deal LOADS of damage when exiting Deception.\n\nThe main antagonist of the game is Handsome Jack, via the ECHO technology in game, he is always with you (technically) and a very well thought out villain.\n\nOverall, 11/10 would kick butt again.","May 22, 2015","true","81.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesovietsanta/recommended/49520/","thesovietsanta","Moe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesovietsanta/","202 products in account","I started up Borderlands 2 thinking this game would be an average shooter with a crappy story. I had played only a small portion of the original Borderlands. A warning before you buy, the introduction to this game can be boring, but once you start leveling up, spending skill points and gaining unique loot, the game truely starts. As I followed my new 'friend' Claptrap, throughout the world of Pandora I started to realize what a marvel this game truely was. I met new characters. laughed my ♥♥♥ off and starting gaining allies. Handsome Jack, the antagonist, seemed to make me laugh more than anyone else. I thought this game was only goofy and comedic, especially when I met Tiny Tina. As I got to know characters I started to get atttached, although that was a mistake. Epic battles and heart wrenching experiences ensued. This game is definetly an emotional rollercoaster. Besides the story missions there is tons of side missions, but unlike most side missions in other games. Instead of an average side mission, like 'Collect 25 Flowers' or 'Kill 25 Enemies' each side mission contains its own story. Whether it be competely humorous or extremely depressing and sad, every side mission was unique in its own way. Another fantastic thing this game is the amount of loot and different weapons. According to Gearbox software (the game developer) there are over 17 million different guns in this game. If you finish all of the side missions and story missions, the game is constantly being given new DLCs (Downloadable Content) containing tons of missions and hilarious campaigns. If you are looking for tons of fun either by yourself or with friends, Borderlands 2 is for you.","December 27, 2013","true","68.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/totallynotzetta/recommended/49520/","totallynotzetta","ZettaX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/totallynotzetta/","337 products in account","Best modern shooter I've ever played.\nI seriously can't find anything wrong with the game; the humor, the guns, the characters, the guns, the atmosphere, the guns, the enemies, the guns, the replay value, guns, robots with mohawks, guns, searching piles of feces to find more loot, guns, badasses... Did I mention guns? A LOT OF DIFFERENT GUNS. Are you a pistol guy (like me)? PISTOLS DON'T SUCK IN THIS GAME, on the contrary! Are you a sniper? Awesome! Like shotguns? Great!! Assault Rifles? Not my thing, but sure! SMGs? RPGs? It's got'em all.\nThe only problem with the game; it's addictive.\n\n[Ignore as they have fixed this issue]\nNow, seriously. The only thing that I didn't like about this game: The SHiFT system. It's a reward system (completely optional) where you write a code and you get Keys, Skins, Guns, etc.\nWhy didn't I like it? Because it connects succesfully about 50% of the time.\n[/ignore]\n\nAnyway, back to the game. The characters are cool, I love the antagonist. They make you love him at the start, then slowly turn that love into hate (in a good sense), BRILLIANT.\nI've yet to meet an important, non-likeable character in Borderlands 2.\nTHE LOOT! I love the loot! I love opening boxes, piles of cr*p, potties, etc. to find a freaking weapon of mass destruction there.\n\nAlso, you've got 4 classes + 2 DLC classes.\n\nMain:\n1.- Axton (Commando): IMO the best for the people who just want a normal shooter experience. Oh, and Turrets. Those are awesome.\n\n2.- Maya (Siren): She's more of a supporter class, but she's got a great bonus on elemental damage (Fire, Electricity, Slag, Acid, Explosion).\n\n3.- Zer0 (Assassin): Sniper/Melee class. With a good build, his melee can be lethal, which is awesome.\n\n4.- Salvador (Gunzerker): Latino + DOUBLE GUNS + FREE AMMO, nuff said. Or not? This is a really fun class to use, kinda (really) OP, but most classes get the OP treatment after a certain level.\n\nDLC:\n\n1.- Gaige (Mechromancer): Do you hate aiming? This one's for you! Her shots just bounce everywhere to reach the bad guys! That and a giant robot who kills everything in sight with its death beam. Really fun to use!\n\n2.- Krieg (Psycho): Ah, the psycho. Want to burn everything to the ground? Or do you perhaps rather EXPLODING EVERYTHING IN SIGHT? Or just turn into a giant badass mutated psycho that destroys everything in his path? Whichever you choose, it's equally awesome.\n\nI've played with almost every class, but only finished the game with the Assassin and (in the near future) with the Psycho.\nAlso, the co-op is awesome, making enemies all around stronger with each extra Vault Hunter in the game!\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n\n- Humor\n- Guns\n- More guns\n- Loot!\n- SKINS!\n- Badassery\n- GOOD DLCs! (Totally worth it)\n- Balanced classes\n- UNLIMITED CO OP FUN\n\n\nCons:\n\n- [Fixed]SHiFT system (should've made it different)[/fixed]\n- [Worth it]To see Moxxi's panties you gotta fall down the map and die.\n- You can't just "play 15 minutes"\n- Not every robot has a mohawk\n- You can't turn into a badass irl by playing this game (unless you play for 60 hours straight).\n^---- Actually you can (after the 500-ish hour), so now it's more of a Pro.","July 15, 2014","true","532.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
