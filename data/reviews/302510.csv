"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/302510/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Ryse: Son of Rome is a third person hack and slash adventure game. It was initially released in November of 2013 as an Xbox One exclusive launch title, but was later ported onto PC in October 2014.  The game is set in an alternative version of Rome history. You play as a centurion named Marius Titus as you battle through the game as you seek revenge for the killing of your family.\n\nThe main gameplay element in Ryse: Son of Rome is the hack and slash combat. This feels very similar to other action games such as the Batman series, a very simple but fluid action system means you have no problems taking on hordes of enemies, as you weaken your foes, you get the option to perform an execution on them - this prompts for a small quick time event as you have to press the corresponding mouse button with the colours on the screen, carrying out an execution every time you can tends to make the gameplay feel very repetitive though; it's nice for the first few times but it soon becomes the same over and over again.  You are able to learn different variations of executions through the upgrade menu, allowing you to purchase upgrades using the experience points you have earned, ironically though performing executions. On top of being able to upgrade the executions, you can also add the points into more passive talents such as straight health upgrades, or adding a multiplier to the amount of experience points you earn. If you are like me and you don't really like learning combos and such, the passives tend to be more the attractive options here.\n\nThere is a hint of strategy involved in Ryse: Son of Rome too; a couple of battle scenes allow you to command orders to squads of men, such as ordering archers to cover a flank, or ordering the catapults to aim on different targets - these are few and far between however so don't go into this game expecting a really in depth strategy element.  The larger scale fights are really impressive though, one scene which stands out the most to me would be where you have to defend a castle against an oncoming barbarian army, whilst it is completely reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings scene in Helms Deep but has some really action packed gameplay as you avoid incoming fire bombs, preventing enemies from scaling the walls by kicking off their ladders and tackling any enemies which make it through.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome has some excellent graphics - this is one of the first "next gen" games released, and it really does look next gen; it looks almost photo realistic, the characters look real and the environments which the game is set in look absolutely stunning. There are a couple low quality textures but nothing you will really notice unless you go out of your way to find them. All of the animations are perfect too; the fluid combat system allows for some exciting fight scenes as you string together plenty of combos. It is safe to say that the PC version of Ryse looks so much better than the console given the amount of options you can change to ramp it up to full glory.\n\nThe game is also voice acted to an almost perfect level as well, and the ambient battle sounds draw you further into the immersion of this game. I cannot fault the game one single bit on the audio performance.\n\nOne of the disappointing aspects of Ryse: Son of Rome is that it is an extremely easy game; since the combat system is so simple, hordes of enemies pose no threat once you master the controls; allowing you to cleave your way through armies of barbarians with ease. The boss fights do offer a little bit more of a challenge but I still did not manage to die once on them. Come to think of it; I can count the amount of times I died in this game on one hand. The only saving grace is that once you finish the game you unlock a legendary mode which will test your skills at the highest level; the three previous difficulties are all very much the same and any veteran gamer will not find this game to be a challenge to complete.\n\nThe game is split into eight chapters, each chapter has a couple of different areas in which you will find yourself in and each chapter is split into further sections with cut scenes aiding transitions between them all. Throughout each of the chapters you will find your self-hunting for various collectables which whilst they offer no gameplay benefit, they will grant you little unlockables which is always nice. The game is very linear though; there is only one route through each of the levels allowing you very little room to roam off the single path, you are very much funnelled throughout the whole game.\n\nThe second disappointing issue with Ryse: Son of Rome is that it is unbelievably short; I finished the game in just over five hours and due to the completely linear single player you can uninstall the game as soon as you complete it as there is no reason at all to play again. There is a multiplayer element which may interest some; a sort of two player co-op mode in that you are pitted against waves of enemies in a challenge modem each wave has increasingly difficult enemies to encounter - sadly you can also find yourself some annoying microtransactions in this mode too; allowing you to use your real life money for items in game.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome will require you to have a pretty beefy rig if you want to play it on full graphical settings; I was playing on a 4k resolution and sometimes struggled to keep up with the 60 fps. I also had to configure a different profile for the game in my nVidia settings for it to work with my SLI setup properly (using nVidia inspector). I tested out 1080p settings and this allows the game to play on almost 120 fps with v-sync turned off - leaving this option on locks the gameplay at 30 fps too. Given that this game was initially released on Xbox, the Xbox controller works perfectly, however I had much more success playing with the keyboard and mouse, and I would recommend you try that option out first before opting for the controller.\n\nMy final thoughts on Ryse: Son of Rome is that it a finished product which will give you an evening’s worth of entertainment - I finished it in one sit through and was satisfied with the end results, however I picked up this game when it was on sale in the summer for less than £9. I cannot recommend Ryse: Son of Rome when it is priced anything more than the £10 mark, simply because it has a short single player story mode and no levels of replay ability. If you find it on sale for £10, you should seriously consider picking this game up as it is the entry point for the next generations of games we are going to be seeing in the next few years, the graphics and story alone make this game a worthwhile play through.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

They are the colours of an Xbox pad, whatever you use, Mouse / Keyboard, Dualshock or Steam Controller.\nThere are no prompts over the characters head, even though there were on the E3 videos.\nSteam did not reply to my email, neither did Crytek, actually adding a case closed too my request.\n\nNow lets not forgot the poor launch, were the saves were corrupted, the game would loop, and awful FPS.\nThen there are no custom controls, and it turns out that the framerate is capped.\nThe graphics are a major improvement over the xbones however, but what little of it i did play (I idled it for cards) the combat was no where near on par with ♥♥♥ Creed, Batman, or Mordor.\n\n\n\nNow heres the old stuff i wrote:\n\n\nOkay hopefully this makes it to the top, and gets added to the requirements somehow.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this game, especially coming from the brilliant sucess of Shadow of Mordor, but i cannot play this, why well im colourblind and this game uses a new type of streamline mode for button presses for combos and QTE's.\n\nThe enemy will glow a colour to represent the button to press, the colours of an xbox pad, red,yellow, blue and green.\n\nThis however is near impossible to tell, that imposssible i havent beaten the tutorial on the bridge.\n\nThis forum post was initiated on release day 10th October, a ticket sent to Crytek, and 6 weeks later i am still yet to recieve any information!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/302510/discussions/0/619568192722058040/\n\nPlease help spread the word, my friend gifted me this and he has literally wasted his money on me! So until then i cannot recommend this....\n\n*Crytek put a "Case closed" on my ticket, so it seems its pretty much dead in the water.\n\n**Left the game idling for the trading card drop, so my playtime has incresed.\n\n***Thanks for all the positive comments, from geniunely concerned users/players out there.\n\n****And a further big shout out, to all the people that have sent abusive messages, posted hate on my profile, and mocked people with disabilities, you guys are great, and what make the human race so special!\n\nedit* Wow such suppport from you guys, the game went on sale 29th Jan 2015 and have had 100+ notifications on my account, see people can be awesome!\n\nStill see the "Why negative..." comments, but Valve seems to only have love for "Funny" to make that a part of the review system, not in between/uncertain lol, as Ive not played it, so to say, I can only give a review based on MY findings, therefore its Negative!\n\nEither way its great that I have managed to save people money, educate people, and not have your Brain and your eyes fight.!\n\nPeople even initiated forum posts like this for the xbone's release and they was overlooked too, such a shame because I do love me a good "Button Basher" and this I imagine is just a simple line of code, surely if the "Code" is active during tutorial, there would be a "cutoff" to say "Tutorial over" so shouldnt there be a way to "Enable" this code still?\n\nAnd people asking "Whats it like?" well its difficult to explain. it all balls down to Hues, unless they are at the Brightest/Darkest end of the spectrum, they look the same. I know my mouse and keyboard are Red, (because it said on the box) but they look Orange to me, reds/browns, blues/greens, they just seem to merge.\n\nedit** Okay another edit, as its a weekend sale, and not the daily like i thought, this has generated 300+ notifications, and well over 2500+ votes, which IMHO is a lot.\nNow on to the bit that im grasping with, although colour blindness is a form of disability, its not what we "associate" as disabled, my eldest son is autusic but you cannot SEE that so its overlooked so to say.\nBut what i see is people missing limbs, saying "Well i cant play, and i dont moan" well, you can play!\nVoice control, head tracking, mouth controller, stinkyboards, footpedals, gamepads, and MMO mice with 10+ buttons. Even youtube has some amazing people like Ben Heck modding controllers and consoles for players, recently doing the Dualshock 4 the possibilities are out there, so please dont feel like your missing out, it can be done, its been made to tailor your needs so people have that equal oppurtunity.\nThis review started out as a nod to people like myself who find it difficult to play, watch a video, or play a demo, just incase and save yourself some pennies. However its escaleted into some sort of war only Cartman could iniate as it was initially something trivial.\n\nSo heres a breakdown for you:\n#E3 footage had button prompts.\n\n#After exiting the tutorial the prompts go away.\n\n#The character model glows colours of an xbox pad.\n\n#This release is on Steam which is a PC Platform, Dualshock 4's, Steam Controllers, and others controllers can work on this system, each having different colours.\n\n#My xbox pad has Grey buttons.\n\n#My keyboard has letters, and the character still doesnt flash a "letter" it flashes the colour.\n\n#I simply cant tell the difference.\n\n#Ive read the controls, and have been told by several users, it even completes the QTE's itself I believe, I still just want to play it without guessing, and staring at my pad when something pops up.\n\n#Its not Steams fault, but they sell it, ive told their support and left this review so they could add it to the games requirements, and nothing.\n\n#The ticket i oppened with Crytek was simply "Case closed".\n\n#These issues persisted with the xbone and was highlighted by several people on forums, again, crytek did nothing.\n\n#THERE IS NO BIASED/IN BETWEEN BUTTON so that is why my review is negative of this game, please go and hate on the reviews that state how there are no custom controls, save game issues, lag, stutter and all that jazz us PC gamers get shafted with.\n\nSo there you have it, its a no show, i just wanted a simple option added, which would have been simple in code, or a warning to CB people out there. I dont want race wars, disability wars, eyesight wars, gaybashing, World War 5 or to even know the percentage of people that have slept with my mother besides my father, I just want to get my point across.

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Ryse: Son of Rome is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Crytek (known for games such as Crysis) and, surprisingly enough, not published by EA games. It was originally an Xbox One exclusive title but was later ported to the PC. The PC release has since been praised as a superior version to its console counter part boasting better framerates, better graphical fidelity, free bundled dlcs and no micro-transactions.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):The player takes on the role of Marius Titus, a Roman Legionary who's on a mission to avenge the death of his family (Gladiator movie 2000). Son of a legendary Roman General, he quickly rises through the Legion ranks searching for the people behind his family's murder while, at the same time, fighting for Rome, a superpower, against an inferior rebel group. (Call of Duty: Roman Warfare).\n\nPROS:+ Graphically and Visually MAGNIFICENT\n+ Great Animation\n+ Quality sounds and voice acting\n+ Refreshing new setting (Ancient Rome)\n+ Intense action packed combat\n+ Fun and entertaining execution moves (though a bit repetitive)\n+ No Microtransactions\n+ Surprisingly good Port (my aging GTX 670 with 2gb of vram was able to play this at max setting, albeit with a few acceptable frame rate drops)\n+ Story is acceptable at least, its easy to understand and ties up the plot nicely\n+ Has potential (if they develop the plot and combat mechanics more)\n\nCONS:- Very Short (I personally completed it within 7-8 hours on Hard 'Centurion' difficulty)\n- Too many (and some unnecessary) turret sections\n- Camera can sometimes be dodgy\n- Repetitive combat with little variation in attack moves\n- Quick Time Event (QTE) based execution moves\n- A bit to easy even in Hard difficulty (But challenging in LEGENDARY Mode)\n- Wish the game could have added a desert setting or a snowy terrain\n- Too restrictive map with no room to explore\n- Could have done better with a few more RPG elements\n- Co-op maps sometimes glitch out and event triggers does not activate\n\nNEUTRAL:- Linear storytelling. I personally have no problems with linear games because not all games need to be open world or sandbox.\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD GAME but NOT FOR EVERYONE. Ryse: Son of Rome is for people who likes the setting (Ancient Rome), extreme and entertaining violence and visual eye candy. Best experienced if you have a Medium or High End gaming system since the selling point of this game is its visuals.\n\nWORTH IT?:Full price? May be not, but if it goes on SALE for 50% off, then give it a chance. Its also a good way to test your computer's power (Benchmark).\n\nFINAL NOTES:Graphics wise, its epic in scale. The combat, though repetitive, is fun and the execution moves are brutally entertaining. the legion segments are also intense, albeit also repetitive. Story is nice and easy to understand but its way to short and I feel it could have done better with additional locations. All in all I liked my time with Ryse and I personally find it a fun game.\n\nRyse is a GOOD experience, it promised a cinematic action experience and it delivered. Just like an action movie, we're not in it for the plot, were in it for the brutal action, violence and visuals.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

With Rome’s attempt to tame the uncouth and wild lands of Britannia (with its various warring barbarian factions) through the use of subjugation, humiliation and bloody force, if necessary, it’s a poignant moment that Marius Titus shares with the captured daughter of one of the barbarian tribal leaders - Boudica, a feisty, fiery young woman who moments before her capture was ready to gut Marius to pieces and who has just witnessed the death of her father at the hands of one of Emperor Nero’s sons. This gesture doesn't automatically make amends of these two very different characters differences and suddenly pair them up as new best friends ready to defeat a corrupt system nor thankfully does the narrative decide to shift gears and marry the two story arcs together. It is in this very moment that both characters realize they are victims of a power play and although you could deem them kindred souls, they are still two individuals representing two very different sides of a coin.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=400713518\nIt’s these kinds of complexities in the narrative driving Ryse: Son of Rome forward that I thoroughly enjoyed. Impeccably scripted and voice acted with some of the finest motion capture yet seen in a computer game gives rise (see what I did there) to a storytelling arc that had me enthralled in its grip from the moment it started until it reached its final bloody conclusion which was roughly about 10 hours of playtime (something I was very thankful for due the very nature of most AAA titles being overblown to the point of tedium). With a full orchestral score to rival the soundtrack to any movie epic Ryse: Son of Rome has a strong deck off which to base some positive popularity. So it strikes me as incredibly odd that the game was received tepidly by critics and original XBox One owners upon release.\n\nI garner a lot of that had to do with the fact that the terrible games media journalists we have today (I actually hesitate to call them "journalists") made a whole song and dance routine about the quick-time events that were supposedly to litter Ryse: Son of Rome. I read a lot of those initial previews and to be honest most made it out to sound like the game was one big quick-time festival of a game. Since we know the herd-like mentality out there before you knew it you had thousands of people dissing the game (thousands I might add who never bothered to actually play it for themselves and make up their own minds) poisoning the minds of potential others. But a dog will eventually have its day and judging by the immense popularity the game holds currently on Steam (over 2500 positive user reviews with a 85% popularity rating) - the whole quick-time ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is a load of crock!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=394477503\nYes - I am not going to lie - they are there but they are so subtly integrated into the gameplay that one hardly even notices that they are there and they are mainly used for executing finishing moves on the enemies you encounter. The Batman Arkham series had a similar style of quick time event integrated into its fight sequences yet I don't see the media calling out that franchise for essentially doing exactly the same as what Ryse: Son of Rome does. Consistency much? Nope not in this day and age I am afraid. Now before you haul out the pitchforks and say the combat in Ryse: Son of Rome is nothing like the fluid-flowing combat on display in the Arkham games - I have to agree to disagree. While the combat may seem simpler and more refined than what is on display in Rocksteady's magnum opuses it is no less fluid-flowing and moves at a cracking pace. It is very easy to be swarmed by enemies and taken out within seconds if you don't use your combat abilities correctly and at the precisely the right time. Ryse: Son of Rome offers the standard heavy and light attack with the ability to block incoming attacks and while I agree the games combat mechanics don't really evolve that much over the course of the 10 hours it takes to complete the game they are perfectly suited to the games length.\n\nSo while Ryse: Son of Rome shines brightly from a storytelling perspective and gets by adequately with its combat mechanics where the game truly evolves into a thing of beauty is in the graphical department. Ryse: Son of Rome, simply put, is one of the most breathtaking games I have yet experienced visually. This is really and truly a next gen title and it shows. What is even more appealing is that considering that the game looks as good as it does - it runs relatively smoothly even on the most modest of hardware. Ryse: Son of Rome is beautifully optimized and is such a visual treat to experience. With a reasonable price tag of $39.99 at full price (cheaper if you wait it out for a sale) owning Ryse: Son of Rome is a no-brainer in my books - especially for those die-hard enthusiasts who like to do nothing more than show off their hardware and what it can do. Ryse: Son of Rome on PC is also 4K ready and I am sure for those that have the equipment to push the game out at such a resolution it must be an absolute braggers delight. Ryse: Son of Rome also includes all the dlc originally released for the game on XBox One (most of it is confined to co-op and multiplayer sessions) but its great to have it included in the price and not have to still drop cash on collecting dlc for the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=400336324\nRyse: Son of Rome was, for this gamer, a spectacular delight. With a strong narrative that twists and turns and doubles back on itself keeping the player totally invested in the story it tells to the gorgeous world created using some of the most impressive 3D graphics I have personally ever seen, the line between a game and a Pixar-like movie seems to be narrowing quite nicely this generation. Ryse: Son of Rome is a wonderful addition to my library and one I relish going back to play in a year or two's time when the memory of it has faded a little. More high praise than that I can not give the game since very few games ever make me want to return to them once I am done completing them. If Crytek ever announce a sequel I know for a fact I will be first in line to play it.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","March 23, 2015","true","10.5"," 380 of 481 people (79%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","79","380","481","24","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/302510/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2492 products in account","This is one of the first reviews I've written where I've chosen to not recommend. I wish Steam had a "depends" option as this game would easily qualify for that, however, it doesn't so as it stands I cannot recommend it. I only recommend this game when it is greatly discounted. At full price, it's just not worth it. I also highly suggest a controller to play this game.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome is an interesting game that takes place in Ancient Rome (duh!). You control Marius, a Roman centurion whose primary motivation is made clear within the first half hour of the game. I was looking forward to playing this game as I typically enjoy third-person combat games and Ancient Rome is a location that not many games have mined for material yet. Obviously, there are some good Rome-based games already in existence, but the cinematic action genre has not been done in this specific time period. I liked this game on some levels, disliked on others, and overall it's the absolute definition of a mixed bag.\n\nHere's some basic stats followed by a tl;dr selection of Pros/Cons.\n\nI have played only the story mode. I played at "normal" difficulty and I have not touched any mode but the story. Steam has my playtime clocked at 6.3 hours, a very short experience needless to say. I may consider returning to it and playing the "Legendary" difficulty in the future, but I have no interest in the multiplayer.\n\nPros\n+ It looks absolutely outstanding.\n+ Has some of the best facial animations ever.\n+ Voice acting is solid. Supporting characters are memorable due to this.\n+ There are some very cool set pieces/big action sequences that are done really well.\n+ Soundtrack is fitting.\n\nCons\n- Extremely short single player game.\n- Story is predictable, full of cliches, with some very laughable lines.\n- Gameplay is very monotonous.\n- There is an extreme amount of quick-time events (QTE).\n- The attempts to vary the gameplay are few and when there are variations, they're done weakly.\n- Historical accuracy was not something the developers took seriously.\n\nI really wanted to like this game more than I do sitting here after completing it. Crytek did an absolutely outstanding job in the graphics department. There are variations in setting that help the story plow along and again, look great.  That said, I can find fault in just about every single one of my "Pros" bar the looks department. There are numerous cutscenes and for the most part they look great so I enjoyed them in this respect. I also liked the way the game goes from cutscene to play almost seamlessly in some areas. Facial animations are great both during play and throughout.\n\nCombat is of a very run of the mill design. Heavy attack, quick attack, shield attack, and block. The game is designed for consoles, so playing with a controller is HIGHLY recommended. There is little variation in enemies. At first glance, one of the cooler gameplay elements is in respect to executions. Virtually every enemy you fight (aside from bosses) will allow you at some point in the fight to pull off an execution. This involves the game entering a QTE and then you hit the corresponding button. If you hit the right button, you get more "Valor" points, which is the in-game currency to upgrade Marius' health, focus, and combat. This mechanic gets extremely old rather quickly. Unfortunately, its wise to enter executions regularly because it allows you to fill up your focus bar to enter what is essentially a powered up mode where you're super powerful and super fast. I also find fault with the executions because there are only so many variations. Early on, you will see them all and then the QTEs start becoming a chore. Another aspect of combat is that actions are signaled to you using color, rather than the typical A, B, X, etc. If you're not using an Xbox branded controller, this may become awkward for you. I do not believe there is a way to change this, but as I have an Xbox controller, I didnt bother to look. I imagine playing with a keyboard and mouse would be very cumbersome. To put it simply, the combat gets boring. Its not like the Arkham games where you're looking for a fight.\n\nThere are portions of the gameplay where it is varied, but they are few and not many. There are attempts at a mini-strategy game which eerily reminded me of the portions of Assassins Creed Revelations' tower defense mode. Basically you're made to position certain elements of your army to defend a position. Its not executed very well and one wrong placement could mean your doom. One change in gameplay I did like was when you're in formation marching on an enemy position. It looks cool and gives you the feeling of power. However, the execution of this is one dimensional and also very easy.\n\nThe story is not the worst I've ever experienced by any stretch, but it just wasn't that strong or enough to make me want to play again anytime soon. The predictability hurt it a lot, along with some really hokey "supernatural" elements that are of no help to its quality. Marius is your standard Russell Crowe/Gerard Butler-esque hybrid cliche, but the voice acting is well done in virtually every respect, so it at least goes down smoothly. The score is decent and fitting, but not very memorable.  Historical accuracy is not completely non-existant, but there are some aspects that stand out (an auto-loading crossbow that acts as a mounted machine gun weapon) as being stupid and impossible for the time period.\n\nAll in all, I really wanted to like this game more. I cannot stress enough how good it looks and I experienced no problems technically whatsoever bar getting stuck in an area once. There are some excellent sequences that are VERY memorable (the Colosseum sequence is AWESOME), but on whole its such a short experience and doesn't do much to seperate itself from the crowded action game pack outside of its fantastic looks. The gameplay itself is a real letdown and gets old quickly.\n\nAll of this said, I cannot recommend this game at it's $39.99 price point. At 50% or more off, I think it would be easier to recommend, but save your $40. Ryse can wait.\n\n6/10","October 15, 2014","false","6.3"," 570 of 752 people (76%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","76","570","752","11","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/302510/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Crytek has a long and storied history on the PC. After developing an Xbox One launch title, they are back on the PC with the port of the same game, Ryse: Son of Rome. Crytek is known for making games on the technological cutting edge, and they pretty darn fun to play too. With Ryse, they have deviated from their FPS comfort zone and moved into the beat-em-up/button masher genre. Crytek fans looking for the highly ambitious, emergent gameplay of Crysis may feel that this title comes up short, but there is still a lot to enjoy. Ryse doesn’t offer the same technological “wow” factor of their previous games, but it does provide a highly entertaining, blood-soaked romp. It doesn’t have a lot to offer in terms of depth or length, but its well-paced campaign is more than enough to justify the price tag on the PC.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome isn’t a bad game by a long stretch. As a fan of Crytek’s past works, however, it is hard to shake the disappointment that it isn’t nearly as mind blowing and ambitious as Far Cry and Crysis, games known for their visuals and huge, wide open environments. Ryse delivers in the graphics department, but is a step backwards in level size and in-game physics. The levels in Ryse are tightly linear, other than the occasional, very small side paths that lead to collectibles. In a huge missed opportunity, combat arenas are completely devoid of destructible objects. You can’t smash windows, walls, tables, weapon racks, or food carts. This mechanic would have made the game more impressive, and add opportunities for emergent gameplay and environmental combat. Ryse sets its sights lower than previous Crytek games, although the high level of polish almost makes up for that.\n\nWith Ryse, Crytek elected to make a character driven button masher/beat-em-up. You play as the hero Marius, who is both a legendary warrior and an admired leader. During your revenge quest, both qualities will be used frequently. Most of the game is spent in melee combat against small groups of enemies. For most enemies, a simple one-two combo of slash and shield-bash weakens enough to perform an execution move. Executions are horribly brutal, gory quick time events where you tap the buttons as needed to slice off arms, open necks, bash heads, impale enemies on your sword and yank it back out to use on somebody else. The melee and execution routine is the bread-and-butter of the game. It isn’t very deep or complex, but there is enough substance to these mechanics to sustain a quality game. Suffice it to say, this game gets a lot of mileage out of its “M” rating.\n\nYou won’t find any power-ups lying around. Instead, you have to earn them by performing executions. Execution bonuses can be applied to health, XP, damage, or focus. With XP, you can upgrade your character and add more executions to your list of moves. These mechanics provide some basic resource management that helps gives the game much needed depth. There is a little bit of variety to the enemies, but it could have used more. The overwhelming majority of the game’s enemies are simple grunts or barbarians with shields, who don’t fight much differently than the grunts. The difficulty picks up a little bit in the final chapters, as the game requires you to perform more blocking and parrying and sets you up against heavy enemies whose attacks cannot be blocked. That variety is welcome, but the game still could have used more.\n\nMelee combat sections are broken up by other short-lived activities, such as turret shooter sequences that find you manning a ballista to mow down enemies by the dozen. The game also has one interesting innovation – the phalanx march. You occasionally form up with fellow troops and march across open areas while being pelted with arrows. You have to do it carefully, marching slowly and then raising your shields at the last second to keep your guys from turning into pin cushions. There are about a half dozen of these events in the game, which are a perfect fit for the ancient Roman setting. Changeups in the action are frequent, keeping the game moving along nicely.\n\nRyse isn’t going to be long remembered for its story, but it is a surprisingly entertaining affair. The game is clearly inspired by movies like Gladiator and HBO’s Rome, and it pays great homage to the subject matter. Big, beefy soldiers in colorful armor with gravelly voices and British accents battle barbarians while being backstabbed by corrupt Roman officials. References to the Gods and the afterlife make frequent appearances. Marius and his adversaries exchange lots of testosterone-fueled dialog. The story actually had potential to be a very good one, but it seems as if some important material was left on the cutting room floor. As a result, not everything in the story makes sense. The apparitions that appear occasionally are a bit confusing – the game never establishes that the supernatural is real, but these apparitions appear to have a real effect in the game. It is too bad that the script wasn’t given one more rewrite, because the game is genuinely trying to provide a quality story.\n\nNo review for this game would be complete without effusive praise for its visuals. The game’s primary role is to act as a showcase for the next generation of hardware, and it does so perfectly. The Roman soldiers’ banners and uniforms are bright, highly detailed, and colorful. The character models look beautiful and incredibly realistic, brought to life with an impressive library of motion-captured animations.  he animations are especially impressive when it comes to the executions, of which there are dozens.Suffice it to say, if you have a beefy PC and you are in the market for some outstanding eye candy, you can’t go wrong with Ryse: Son of Rome.\n\nThe game’s beautiful visuals have gotten a lot of attention, but it isn’t all that the game has going for it. Its production values are outstanding across the board. The audio is a cacophony of grunts, metal clashing against metal, swords slicing through flesh, arrows thumping against shields, commands being barked, and screams of pain. The voice acting is top notch, with Marius and his pal Vitalion faring particularly well in their stereotypical roles. All of this comes with a great booming orchestral score playing in the background. The game sounds as amazing as it looks.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome can be criticized for not offering enough variety as a game, but with a reduced price tag on Steam this criticism isn’t as damning. The game deserves credit for accepting its short length instead of trying to pad itself out with lots of copying and pasting. Ryse is a fun game pretty much from the beginning, and it ends right before it wears out its welcome. If you are in the mood to spend a weekend enjoying some graphic ultra-violence with your brain turned off, then Ryse: Son of Rome should make a nice addition to your library, especially if you can find it on a Steam sale.","December 27, 2015","true","186.6"," 163 of 211 people (77%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","77","163","211","14","7"

Spent an hour and a half there, and had a good time. My biggest complaint after that experience was that it would've been a lot more enjoyable if the various game modes had a little more variation to them. They all felt pretty similar to me, and generally lasted the same amount of time. I'd go back to play those modes if a friend asked me to; I enjoyed the co-op executions, and the more free-feeling combat.\n\nThen I went to the game's campaign mode (single-player only). The story had no real buildup or anything to draw me in in the first couple of hours (the game took me about 6.5 hours to complete). But the first couple of hours were more enjoyable to me than the rest, I'd later find out. As I reached the game's mid-point, the theme started reminding me a lot of the TV series Spartacus, which I loved watching. So that's alright, even though I feel like a lot of those story ideas have been run into the ground. The game lacks its own unique personality to back that plot up, though. Everything was extremely predictable, the characters were forgettable, and I was not satisfied with the game's ending sequence, to say the least.\n\nThe reason I say the first half was more enjoyable for me than the second half is mostly due to the heavier inclusion of "boss battles" later on. What separates boss battles from normal combat is one very simple thing: scripting. When entering a boss battle, you simply lose the ability to take advantage of the game's combat systems and the creativity involved in the variation. Rather than coming up with your own way of tackling a boss, you're guided to enter a back and forth strategy of dodging attack 1, 2, and 3, then getting one slice in with your own gladius. Repeat 10 times, enter a cutscene, and then for some battles, return to a boss with a once again full health bar to do the exact same thing. This method of combat became extremely tedious. I tried a handful of times to alter my strategy outside of what the game was instructing me to do during boss encounters (by way of different colored QTE highlight prompts), but every time I tried, my attacks were all blocked regardless of whether or not I managed to get my opponent's back towards me, or if I had bashed them first with my shield, or if I had blocked one of their attacks. It made no difference.\n\nAnd then the ending of the game. Oh, the ending. I streamed the game, and a friend who was watching summed it up pretty nicely with the comment "At least the gods are having fun."\n\nIf the game is on sale and you can snag it for less than $10, the 2-player game modes can be fun with a friend for a while. Outside of that, I do not recommend the game.","December 7, 2015","false","8.5"," 167 of 237 people (70%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","70","167","237","16","0"

This game contains fictional history galore and it is an arcadey game so please forgive me my very positive rating despite that.\n\nIn Ryse you take command of a soldier called Marius. His father was a famous roman commander and now is a senator of the SPQR. The game FICTIONALLY plays in the late roman era, when Nero was emperor. There are several things that are completely untrue, like you will fight Boadicea and she will invade Rome with elephants. Truely as a fan of roman history this is so completely off that we need to set the storyline to world of Hollywood fables or even worse.\n\nBut apart from that this game is really a must have for any fan of Roman history.\n\n\nGREAT THINGS\nThe storyline was actually very interesting - though being fictional - and it conceals unexpected changes, that I do not want to spoil in detail. At the end many things start to become clear.\n\nThis games offers extreme stunning graphics I have never seen before in this quality. The extensive use of high res textures and pixel shader based objects is just amazing. Also the details of certain objects are really fotorealistic.\n\nImho, there is even no quality difference between prerendered video sequences and maxed out settings when you play this game.\nThe enviroment is extremely detailed and quite historically accurate. The Colosseum, parts of Roman temples, wax tables, and many many other things that you MAY see, if you turn off motion blur and also care to watch for when playing.\n\nThe music of this game is really 1st class and never gets really boring! I could even recommend it to listen to the Youtube Ryse OST while playing games like Total War Rome (2) or other roman themed games.\nThere is nothing negative to mention in this regard. It makes you feel like you are playing Gladiator and Hans Zimmer has composed the score for this game, seriously.\nIn the options you can even pick single tracks that you will hear in the game, which I found to be a quite remarkable detail. This way you can listen to a track again if it rocked your ears. But not only the music is rocksolid but also the voice actors. I can only put my hand into the fire for the german localisation. The soundtrack and character / storyteller voices of Ryse are definitely an ear-gasm.\n\nTHE FLIPSIDE OF THE DENARI\nThe combat mechanics are very strange, even though it is a ported XBox game. Many things are unclear, despite a short introduction. The many various combat animations are again stunning.\n\nThe con side is that no one really explains why soldiers are flashing blue or yellow (or sometime fail to do so in max settings, especially at the final scene - Avenge your family.)\n\nIf an enemy flashes blue this means you need to left click your mouse once as soon as possible, yellow means right click the mouse the same way.\n\nThis game is all about fluidness of combat and perfect timing. I really treated my mouse and keyboard for this game.\nThe better your combat the better your bonuses that vary from health regeneration, XP to unlock more moves and other things, a slowmotion (capsule / focus) and other things you can choose whenever you want.\n\nOnce you understood the control they are very easy even on PC. But I think it is more intuitive on Xbox.\n\nThe only major issue I had with the game is, that you will face boss fights that are just annoying. You need to kill bosses even several times like Boadicea or Commodus etc. And the major problem is that you simply cannot skip the prerendered scenes of have to do some things over and over again before the actual starts fight. This was so exhausting.\n\nIf you actually look closer to the environment as I did, you will notice the classic lack of all console games also in the details and object. While the beauty may conceal it many many things / objects become repetitive in this game and also the foes you need to slay down over and over and over again.\n\nTo be honest after 5 hours of gameplay it was only the combination of graphics, music and the story that made me to play this to the end because this repetitiveness.\n\nAs for your hero you play and other things in the game, as said it is very arcadey. Often it felt like I am Tomb Raider 2013, but just as a roman. Nothing can really hurt you :)\n\nSummary of pro and cons:+ extremely amazing graphics and lovely details, that are historical accurate\n+ quite good physics\n+ outstanding and tremendous music that contributes much to the game\n+ interesting storyline with some unexpected things\n+ just WOW fluid animations, kill animations etc\n+ gore galore!\no Storyline is completely fantasy, misusing the historical context\no very high system requirements on maxed out settings (970 GTX, 1080p around 20-60 fps)\n- repetitive fights\n- unskipable and thus repetitive scenes (before boss fights)\n- repetitive enviromental items\n- endless slaughtering / battles get boring after a time\n- repetitive scenes (like forming testudo / pila archers)\n- linear and narrow levels, less open world feeling as in Tomb Raider 2013\n\nAfter all I can give this game a clear recommendation, but it is actually hard to give it a overall positive one, if one calms down about the graphics and other candy stuff and forcing a more objective view.\n\nIn summary of all aspects I would like to give this game a fair 75 of 100 score.

I don‘t like consoles, but i must admit they have some quality games. When Ryse the son of Rome came out for the consoles i heard many negative comments about this game. After finally buying it on PC i can say it is really a decent game.\n\nProbably the most exciting thing about Ryse the son of Rome was graphics. The game looks really good. It‘s not the best looking game, at some parts it looks...well...like a console game, but most of the time it‘s a treat for the eyes. Of course such graphics can be easily achieved, because the game consists from narrow corridors and closed spaces. If it would be developed as a PC game first it could look much better.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty basic. You run through narrow spaces and then fight some enemies. What i love in this game is not those amazing looking character models and not those gorgeos diverse locations, but combat. It‘s really fun and requires some skill unlike some other games where you can mash the same button and kill everyone. Here you must attack, block and evade, some attacks will test your reflexes and you will want to throw the controller at the wall. The legendary difficulty is really challenging. Sadly not all the parts of the combat is good. Well, the close combat is great, but spear throwing can be annoying and broken, it could use some work. It will not give any problems unless your playing on the hardest difficulty. Besides good combat system it has some good looking executions. When you damage the enemies enough you can execute them in some brutal ways. Slitting throats and cutting arms never gets old.\n\nThe game has some performance issues. It is not optimized very well. On some levels it stutters really bad no matter what your settings are and it could be really annoying.\n\nSome people may not like that the game is pretty short but for action game the length is perfect. It will take you 8-10 hours to complete the game. And with the sale price of ~7€ every moth or so it is worth the price.\n\nBesides single player campaign the game has a multiplayer mode. I didn‘t play it much, but from that one hour it looked fun to me. It‘s like a coop arena mode where you and the other player fight against hordes of enemies.\n\nI strongly recommend this game for action game fans. Maybe it‘s not the best game in it‘s genre and is not worth the full price if you‘re not interested in multiplayer, but you still will have a good time playing it.\n\nEDIT: after playing some more i have found this game has a serious bug which is not fixed yet and will never be. The saves get corrupted and all your progres gone in a second. Even the online progress. So turn off cloud saving before playing! Otherwise you will lose everything.\n\nPros:\n\nGraphics\nCombat\nStory\n\nCons:\n\nPerformance\nBug causing save corruption","February 26","true","49.9"," 74 of 105 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","74","105","7","6"

The game has a very cinematic camera  feel to it with sequences and superb acting throughout the game. The game itself,  This game is a port from the original Xboxone version but the PC version includes graphic option settings, super sampling. showing that work has been put into  PC platform.\n\nThe story of the game starts off during an attack from the Celts with the Roman general Marius defending the city against them. He proceeds to secure the city and escort the Roman Emperor Nero to a safe room where he fires up some braziers and begins to tell the tale of how his adventure set off leading to where he is now with the emperor. Then the game starts with a flashback sequence when Marius was peacefully visiting his family when suddenly the barbarians attacked and thus begin the epic journey of vengeance with Marius realizing that there are other forces at work than just an attack from barbarians.\nThe story of the game is well-written and full of action and surprises. The actors honestly bring  beauty into of this game with some  top-notch acting, voice lip synch, and facial expressions. You can feel the emotions from the characters as you play the game and see who is likeable and detestable just through these details. Along with the acting the music score goes great with the theme of the game.\n\nThe graphics and background to this game are beautiful, and it  shows the developers have put work in the environment of the maps such as the small details when one takes a scenery glance from building's plants growth, rain dripping off the side, caves, and wilderness, which are some example that really brings immersion into the game the aeshtetics are beautiful. Along with the details, there are some nice backdrops to the game but there were certain times such as the war sequence of the game when the Celts invade that the backdrop was a bit muddy. The game will have players navigate through from the streets of Rome, York, the wilderness and the haunted swamps.\nThe map themselves, however, beautiful was very linear and straightforward without many large open areas and physics except for a few breakable pots here and there and some inteaction. Most of the time, players will navigate straight forward to accomplish the tasks of killing enemies or completing certain events to progress. There are hidden scrolls and vista throughout the game that can be found.\n\nThe game play itself is a hack and slash third-person style that has some great ideas that needs more work. As Marius, players are able to melee, perform execution moves, go into focus mode,  break enemy's defense, use ranged pila, roll,  and defend against attacks. With this in mind, attacks can vary in light or heavy and chain up in combos, which add up to the system of points and ratings. Marius can perform shield hits and precise perfect parries to stun enemies that are blocking or dodging in order to land juggle them with hits before a cursor appears on top of them to perform an execution if chooses to do so and only up to two enemies at a time may be executed at one time, which is quite flashy. Focus mode is an eagle like vision mode that slows down enemies for a limited time where Maris can land as many hits on enemies with disregard to enemies blocking. During the combat, players are also able to see certain colors flash on enemies, Blue for attack; Gold for shield attack are mostly seen during executions while enemies at times perform red attacks, which require precise blocking. These are the three colors flashing seen during the combat.\n\nExecution flash button sequence do not punish the player much if one performs the wrong combination during these flash. Pressing any buttons during the flashes will continue the execution and doesn't cause a backlash in health or block from enemies of any sort but more of a point deduction and rating label. The interface that shows this appears on the top left side spamming constantly and sometimes ruin the immersion of the game making it feel very arcadey with no way to turn off. The only time players are punished is on the accurate blocking during combat's red flashes in which case enemies will deal much more damage to players. The tedious game play is because of the way the game is presented as one goes through the linear map repeating all these same combos in rythmatical,  The bosses were a bit lackluster because they adhere to this system, it's mostly the same combos being performed to fight them with some precise blocks thrown in and didn't present much challenge even in the harder difficulties. The enemy Ai is also a lacking as what they do is surround the player and throw in sneak hits now and then, but no problem since with perk you are literally overpowered and constantly healing easily. Perks can be switch around during attack, they are health regeneration perks, Damage amplification, focus recovery, and xp multiplication.\n\nThe varieties of enemies are mostly those that either carry a single weapon without a shield, shielded enemies that require more hits from  Marius own shield attack to stun, larger enemy varieties, which are harder to stun, and twin weapon enemies. Most of the time they all look the same or wear different skins and lack variety in  attack style because the pattern was very predictable. The stats system in the game is also lacking and bare; the system lets player use points called valor gained from  the combo system to invest little more stats on their health, focus, damage, and executions. Gold is alternative earned through the online play of the game for the upgrades. The upgrades go through truly quick and don't offer much variety so in the end its seriously easy to max everything out. There is no variety of weapons, armor, moves, or combo list in the singleplayer of the game. During certain times in the game other gameplay mechanics will have Marius call on the legion to have them go through enemy range attacks,  make some decision of defense with them. Other times the game has Marius use range attacks or sit back on the Ballista shooting enemies.\n\nThere is a multiplayer system for the game in place which offers a variety of plays against enemies in arena style. Players can attempt these events solo or with a partner and use certain boosters, aesthetic look, and assorted armors leveling up through the online tier system. The multiplayer is fun for a bit and then over time loses its replay value. Overall, this is the only replay the game offers or one can go back and replay the game on legendary hard mode, which opens up after completing the game once and earn the highest multiply scores to rank up on the leader boards. The game can be completed in approx 6-7 hours and thus is a very short game.\n\nThe control default layout to the game is playable with a keyboard and mouse or with a game pad. Although the configuration itself really lacks key bindings, and the only options are pre layouts that are in place. The graphics settings, however, have a variety of options players can take advantage to find the best performance from their rig. The game needs a bit more optimization since I notice some of the fps are not always  constant at some locations and took a dip here and there\n\nPros\n+ Beautiful game\n+ Epic music\n+ Great acting\n+ Execution\n+ Intense actions scenes\n\nCons\n- Lack of variety in combat gameplay mechanics, Ai lacks variety\n- Linear map\n- Short game 6-7 hours long\n- Not much options in multiplayer\n- Keybindings\n- Bosses were disappointing.\n- Stats system  and combo system lacks customization\n- not much phyics in the game and the environment is static to the player save for a few object physics\n\nStreaming Group Curator\nFollow!","October 11, 2014","true","9.3"," 231 of 366 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","231","366","6","20"

It's got some relatively entertaining animations, it's gory enough.\nIt's also gorgeous and has a superb soundtrack.\n\nIt's also got a hilariously stupid and breathtakingly predictable plotline that you will see right through within the first fifteen minutes, some of the dumbest enemy shoutouts I've ever heard in a AAA title (seriously, the germanic barbarians scream things like LETS SEE HOW THE SON OF A GENERAL FIGHTS and YOUR FATHER WILL SOON BE DEAD at you in perfect english with english accents and there's me going HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS, I'M JUST SOME DUDE WHO NEVER TAKES HIS ARMOR OFF), workable controls that you nevertheless cannot edit without rewriting the config files and, let's face it, one-note gameplay that's honestly been done better elsewhere.\n\nAnd that's really the big issue, here.  The gameplay - which is nothing but combat - is just too simple and too repetitive.\n\nThe Executions system adds some variety, but it also ends up making things entirely too easy and while there are thankfully a large number of them, some of them just feel like padding, they go on for too long.\nWhat's much, much worse is that while the executions each include PUSH X TO KILL BARBARIAN quicktime events, there's no real downside for hitting the wrong button.  No matter what you hit, the barbarian still dies and the animation proceeds exactly - exactly - the same.  You get more bonuses for hitting the buttons correctly, but in the long run that barely matters.\n\nAlso using projectiles is unnecesarily awkward and really clunky.\n\nAlso also, while the VO itself is for the most part okay, it's also very very often hyperdramatic in a manner that had me laughing out loud at moments that the game clearly wanted me to be feeling sorrow or anguish.  Our Hero's reaction to his dead father (this is not a spoiler, if you are not able to determine the exact plot progression within the first fifteen minutes you should probably get back to the maternity ward before any of the nurses notice you've gone) in particular is outright hilarious.  YEWBASTARRDDS.  YEWMURDRINGBASSTARDDS.\n\nSpeaking of which, our hero has no personality and actually kicks off the meat of the story with an honest-to-god complete and total nonsequitor - you've just gotten an uncharacteristically cowardly Nero (who never, mind you, had to deal with germanic invasion ever in his life) into an ancient Roman panic room and for whatever reason decide this is a great time to suddenly say to his emperor, out of the blue and with the plantary gravitas, MY STORY BEGINS LONG AGO\n\nIt's brilliant in its absurdity, honestly it is.","November 18, 2014","false","1.6"," 195 of 307 people (64%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","64","195","307","18","0"

It’s repetitive, overpriced, too short, and a poor imitation of the popular Arkham free flow combat system. I can’t agree with any of those opinions.\n\nThe combat in this third person hack and slash is solid. There are so many different kill moves (executed through QTE button prompts), and I find myself consistently entertained by them. This is mostly due to the sharp graphics and fluid animations, but also the inventive swordplay ideas.\n\nThe graphics are top notch. The game is very linear, but the environments are really brought to life through the use of the CryEngine 3. A lot of detail can be seen on your character’s armour and the facial expressions of enemies as they get killed. It’s impressive to see this in games, and I personally haven’t seen this level of detail before.\n\nThe story is where Ryse ultimately falls short. There is a lot of assumed information as the story progresses and I never really understood everything that was going on. The ending probably confused me the most. However, the characters and voice acting are top notch. I just wish the story was longer and we got to know the characters better.\n\nOverall, Ryse is certainly a game worth playing. I had a lot of fun with the core gameplay, and enjoyed my bloody rampage through the 8 detailed chapters. I’ve yet to play the co-op, but I am definitely looking forward to it.\n","October 15, 2014","true","12.2"," 153 of 240 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","153","240","4","3"

The .7 was prob me getting up and a multiplayer match that sucked lol...\n\nSo the story is very cliche and highly predictable. Yes the hero was awesome, he really rallied the troops with the speeches etc. but the combat was beyond annoying. Once you figure it out it's quite simple, basic rock paper scisors for counter system. ie. guy goes heavy block or doge, guy starts doging you go with bash. It was no fun at all. I jumped on this to teak a break from stalker aliens in vents, and uruk slaying. (beat MESOM as well)\n\nI will say I am not a completionist and I am prety much done with the game. Not worth full price at all. I was runing a steady 40 fps, still upset no SLI profile but doesn't matter now as I am done with the game. I might try the multiplayer again but after a few matches players disconected quite often.\n\nIt was fun for a button masher, so so story, I'd say wait for a 19.99 sale.\n\nI actually did not run into any bugs, it went a full straight 8 hours and only thing that happened to me was I got stuck on a rock. But that was my fault. I rolled out of it easily after about 10 tries or so.\n\nHope this helps you decide.\n\n\nupdate 12/20/14. hah look its 19.99 thats a more reasonable price for this game.","October 10, 2014","false","8.7"," 221 of 368 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","221","368","3","0"

It is kinda cliché, but does it's job pretty good. Though, i didn't liked the mythical part of the story, but maybe thats just me.\n\nAtmosphere and graphics are really great.

Also, the animations are done very well.\n\nThe hack and slash part plays pretty good, with simple controls. Yet, it is always a challenge to get the best combos possible.\nYou will also gain experience, when killing enemies, which you can invest in some skills, like more health, more focus, being able to execute in different ways etc.\nWhen you bring down the health of an enemy enough, then you'll be able to execute him (did i mention it is quite brutal and visual? yeah, it is, especially in these scenes). Time will slow down and you will have sort of an Quick Time Event. If you press the buttons rightly timed, you will receive more xp, or get back health etc.\nYou can choose between 4 of these special abilities.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer coop part, where you can fight in an arena together with a partner. For me it was quite fun. You can earn XP and gold to buy so called "Boosterpacks" where you will get a handful of random items, which will grant you different boni. By leveling up, you can buy more expensive boosterpacks with better gear.\n\nSo, if you're interested in these hack and slash games and you like great graphics, this game should be definitely on your radar :)","October 19, 2014","true","18.7"," 64 of 102 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","64","102","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/302510/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Ryse: Son of RomeDeveloper: Crytek\nPublisher: Crytek\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nFirst released as an Xbox One exclusive launch title, Ryse: Son of Rome is a third-person action-adventure hack 'n slash game. It went through a few changes during development, originally being slated for the Xbox360 as a Kinect-only title. After a few different proto-types, however, the game was redesigned into a third-person hack 'n slash with no Kinect features.\n\nSet in an alternate version of Rome, Ryse follows the life of the Roman centurion Marius Titus as he becomes one of the leaders in the Roman Legion. He is on a quest to murder Nero, the Roman Emperor, whose followers murdered his family. Gameplay revolves around Marius using his sword to strike enemies and shield to deflect attacks. Execution sequences are also featured in the game, which are quick-time events that serve as an extension to combat. These QTE are, however, so rampant in the game that it makes gameplay tediously repetitive.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nWith only a sword and shield (and the occasional turret), Marius must fight his way through literal hordes and hordes of barbarians on his journey. You have quick normal attacks, performed with a quick tap, and the slower heavy attacks, performed by holding the button down. You can also do a quick shield bash, slamming your shield into your foe to stagger them and break their guard. Using a combination of these attacks, its your goal to kill every single enemy that stands in your way. And there are a LOT of them.\n\nAs you hack away at them, when they are near death a skull icon pops up over their head. Hitting the correct button at this time triggers a QTE where (if you play with a controller, like I do) you must match the color the enemy briefly flashes to the proper colored button, like yellow to the Y button, to perform a gruesome execution. This can be done for every single enemy in the game if you wish, but it isn't required. The game encourages you to do this though, to earn more points. Proper button presses and timing rewards you with more points. Points are later spent to unlock more health, upgrades, or more gruesome executions.\n\nOne other thing about executions is that there are 4 possible rewards you receive in addition to points that you get to choose before each battle (by pressing the appropriate key/button). As you complete the execution, you either get a short buff that increases your damage for a short period of time, restored health, restored Focus, or an increase of points gained from the execution.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nIn terms of graphics, Ryse is an absolutely stunning game. The executions are by far one of the highlights of the game graphically. Kicking a barbarian in the chest, slamming your shield into his face, and then plunging your sword down his spine...That's the good stuff! The other big deals are the environments. When you start each segment I encourage you to just take in your surroundings for a moment before pressing on to slaughter barbarians. You'll be glad you did once you notice all the little details in the world around you.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe soundtrack is one of the best parts of this game. As a huge fan of VGM, this game was a big surprise. It literally puts you into the streets of Rome, and I absolutely love it when a game's soundtrack manages to make you feel like you are there in the game. Here's one of my favorite tracks:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga42jDnq3js\n\nApart from the music, the dings and clashing of swords/shields are all over the place during big battles, but those get just as repetative as the executions. They sound nice though, and that's what counts. It feels authentic.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nMy rig (specs on my profile) was able to run this game at medium-ish settings at 60 FPS regularly, with occasional dips to the low 30's when there was too much happening on-screen. This didn't bother me much though. I played with a controller, an old Logitech F310, and didn't have any issues with it. Being a console port, it makes sense to play with some sort of controller.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nRyse: Son of Rome is a stunning game that suffers from repetitiveness and lack of variety in its gameplay. It's fun for awhile, but that changes about about 30 minutes of play. This is another game I wish I could give a neutral review rating. It's not great, but it's not terrible either. I recommend playing in it occasional short bursts until you complete it, possibly 1 stage per session. That won't take long however, as the game's story mode is very short. If you really like the game there is a co-op multiplayer where you can team-up with other players to battle the barbarian hordes on dynamic maps.\n\nI'd only recommend picking up this game on a sale. Even with it's recent permanent price drop from $39.99 to $19.99, paying full price is too much for what it offers.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otpIOqf94-A\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","April 4","true","5.7"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","5"

I am a sucker for anything based in roman mythology and Ryse: Son of Rome is filled to the brim with it. Along with the great lore/backstory of the game the main story that you follow throughout the game is also great. The gameplay is very fun and seems to be perfectly balanced between combat, QT events, and story filled cutscenes. The multi-player co-op seems to be done well and is tons of fun. The game is an obvious port from the xbone, but it is done well. I didn’t have any major performance issue with my pc set-up. (This can be found on my profile) The keyboard controls work great, but I would suggest using a controller to get the recommended experience. (It was made originally just for xbone) The combat does get a bit repetitive about halfway through the games story, but the story kept me involved. The only other thing to keep in mind is that there is microtransactions, but these are not very intrusive.\nPros\nIncludes Tons of Cool Roman Mythology\nGreat Controller and Keyboard/Mouse Support\nAction Packed Combat\nAmazing Cinematic Cutscenes\nFun Co-op\nWell Done Port\nCons\nMicrotransactions\nMay Get Repetitive to Somepeople\nDifficulty Scales Very Fast\nPredictable Story\nConclusion\nRyse: Son of Rome is an interesting 3rd person action game with brutal combat and amazing cinematic scenes. It’s not without it quirks, it has a short and predictable story, but I still enjoyed all the same. If you enjoy roman mythology and fun combat, you need to check this out. If you are purely into amazingly polish and complicated fighting games you may want to look in another place.

I DO like Ryse: Son of Rome and here's why and the reason to me not recommending this game:\n\nRyse: Son of Rome is a really beautiful and graphically stunning game! It runs pretty smooth and controls are pretty good, though some small improvement could be made.\nThe storyline in the campaign seems intriguing from first glance and you get to kill lots and lots of barbarians with blood all over the place!\n\nThough, I quickly lost interest as it feels like you just have to slaughter endless hordes of barbarians of increasing difficulty, you get new moves to execute them with and it looks great.\nAnd now for the multiplayer part...\nTeam up with a buddy or a random person in arena mode. You can choose between a few game modes depending if you want a small coop mission or battle against time, to see how far you will get. There are quite a lot of awesome looking arenas to choose from with each their own mission and tasks you have to handle to get through the course.\n\nBut thats it.\n\nYou unlock either a sword or a shield by fighting for one of four goods and then you earn credit to buy packs with gear and when you grind your way up to a higher level, you'll get access to a new tier of item sets.\nBy the time you get to tier III, you've memorized every single arena, as you've been tediously grinding through all of them and now you're less than halfway to the best item tier.\n\n6.5 hours was enough for me, so I moved on to another game..\nBefore you say "6.5 hours is nothing, you haven't even finished the storyline!"\n... No.. I haven't.. I didn't find it entertaining anymore after that time, but I'd really wish it would be entertaining after that point, as I simply love the graphics and the way you fight the enemies. Got several hundreds of hours in several different games and I find it heartbreaking that a decently polished game like Ryse: Son of Rome won't ever be able to give me that level and amount of entertainment.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nIf you want an arena game you can play with a friend and just mindlessly slaughter barabarians, this is for you.\nIf you like a more diverse game with more options, strategy and possibilities, have a look at other games.\n","April 21, 2015","false","6.5"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","28","41","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/302510/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","Hack. Slash. Shield bash. Repeat. That's Ryse: Son of Rome in a nutshell. The more I tried to objectively assemble a list of positives and negatives, the more I realized that Ryse has little unique to offer (those graphics, though!). However, there is real promise in several areas, and I had fun in an arcade-y way (hence the recommendation). Ryse is worth a purchase at 75% off or more, but certainly not at full price.\nYou can view the game's opening here.\n\nWhat's to like:\n+  The graphics for sure. If you have a killer rig and want an awesome-looking game to showcase your hardware, this is your game. The developers didn't phone in the backdrops, either: the vistas are huge, the backdrops extensive. The undergrowth in Britain is deep, detailed and lush. The water looks like real water, not shiny, shifting, reflective plastic. 	 	    Character detail is superb, though facial animations still look just a bit stiff.\n+  The voice acting is great, and carries the game at many points. Everyone delivers a superb performance (player-character Marius and npc Vitallion are both stand-outs).\n+  The story has emotional impact, though if you're at all a fan of the time-period, the careless mixing of old and new legends will probably annoy instead of satisfy. Still, it's enough to keep you moving forward.\n+  The soundtrack is a decent emulation of Zimmer's Gladiator score (not surprising).\n+  The combat is slick and swift, and easy for newcomers.\n+  A lot of effort clearly went into designing the two-player co-operative multiplayer; there are at least a dozen maps and four game modes. It's a lot of fun to team up with someone and slay enemies in the arena, but matchmaking is not that good at the moment, if a match can be found at all.\n+  Well-optimized (for Radeon, anyway). In an era of increasingly shoddy PC ports, Ryse ran great on my moderate hardware (A10 6800k + 2GB R7 260X); I averaged around 50fps @1080p Medium settings.\n\nAnd now, the not-so-awesome stuff.\n-  Linear as hell. Rome may look awesome in the distance, but you can't go there.\n-  While the story works, even the slightest bit of historical research will reveal there is nothing even approaching “accuracy”. If you were hoping for a cool Roman-era hack'n slash, you'll get it. Historically accurate? Nope. Just a mix of the cool stuff.\n-  No real large-scale payoff to the story. Marius has closure, no question. But the larger implications – including that he was somehow an instrument of the gods – are never addressed. We just get these god-figures who appear at the end (and are glimpsed throughout) with some decent speeches about purpose, rules, and Rome, and that's it.\n-  Combat is limited and repetitive. Hack, slash, shield-bash, repeat. Maybe dodge here and there. It definitely bored me by the sixth chapter (out of eight). A missed opportunity to maybe dual-wield swords, or have a spear and shield, but nope. A sword and shield the entire game.\n-  Staying with combat for a minute, finishing moves are a QTE-fest. I don't mean every few minutes; every other second you're performing some kind of QTE. I suppose this was easier than programming more complicated forms of combat.\n-  I loved some of the contextual battle choices – where to deploy your archers, advancing on a line of archers in the testudo formation. But these are under-used, and offer little variation.\n-  Upgrade skills are ridiculously cheap. I've played enough of the Batman Arkham games to be able to string together a 35-hit combo without much trouble. A big enough combo and correctly-completed QTEs grants tons of “honor” points that are used to level up. If the game were harder, upgrading would have meant more...\n-  ...perhaps. Aside from new execution animations, the upgrades didn't seem to have much effect.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome is a linear hack'n slash that will satisfy in short bursts, but anyone looking for deep gameplay and any customization will be disappointed. The potential is there to be something truly great, but sadly that potential remains unrealized.","April 24","true","24.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/302510/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Ryse: Son of Rome is a Hack and Slash set in a fictional universe in where a giant horde of barbarians have fought their ways into Rome itself. You play as Marius Titus who is a centurion defending Rome and guides his emperor into a safe place then Marius decides to tell him his life's story for some reason. We are transported back in time when Marius has just become a Roman solider and is visiting his father in his villa. After a quick sparring match with your father, things quickly go wrong and events unfold that kick off the barbarian uprising. You will be searching for vengeance from then on and will spend most of this game fighting hordes of enemies. Which is where the game falls flat on it's face and is made unenjoyable due to a bad combat system. You have a button for shield bashing through their guard and one to attack with a sword. Switching between the two makes it harder for them to dodge, allowing you to get bigger combos. Combos are broken when you are hit, though enemies start moving in slow-mo when they are about to attack so it is insanely easy to press the block button on time. You can also roll but it is made useless due to you being able to block even heavy attacks if timed right.\n\nDamaging an enemy enough will allow you to preform a QTE execution in where they glow in the color of the button you are supposed to press and are violently killed in slow-mo. While awesome the first few times, it quickly gets old since there are few animations and it interrupts fights due to being invulnerable all throughout while the other enemies just stand by and watch their friend meet a violent death. You will be able to switch from one of four perks that grant you different benefits like dealing more damage or healing yourself after each execution. Even if you press the wrong button during the execution, it will continue the animation regardless and the only downside will be that you get a bit less points. It is like an incredibly boring game of 'Simon Says' where you can't lose. While you don't have to do executions that would result in having to hit the damage spongey enemies some more, instead of quickly killing them off. Sounds like a minor complaint but after so much non-stop “action” I just wanted the fights to end as quickly as possible due to the boredom they bring. I never felt even slightly threatened in a game with a ton of savage barbarians wiping the floor with your once great Empire. That is mostly caused by how over powered  you are, enough that it makes you think why does Rome even have an army when they can send Marius to murder all their enemies while not even breaking a sweat.\n\nThat may as well be the case since all your fellow Roman allies are useless in battle. They will not help you in any way, shape or form and will more likely than not get dominated by a tribesman with neither armor or training. At times you will be able to “command” them to form a defensive formation and make your way through a volley of arrows. Sounds a lot cooler than it actually is, you will pretty much be slowly walking in a straight line and blocking when arrows approach. Another form of “commanding” your units pops up sometimes where you can pick one of two options like telling your archers to shoot an approaching siege tower or to shoot the catapults that are pelting you with stone instead. The only way I can see someone losing this game is by not defending their legion well enough and their health bar depletes. For ranged attacks you can carry a few pilums that will kill most enemies in a single hit. You can take your time and aim it or you can quickly throw it mid-fight which is far more likely to miss your target. The game randomly takes away your pilums after story sections and it frequently results in you having to collect more just in case you ever want to use them. No real need to since Marius is so overpowered but it is the only other weapon in the game so you may as well break up the monotony of your normal sword & shield. Turret sections are also present in this game and they come in the form of a ballista that automatically reloads itself somehow.\n\nGetting combos and performing executions will net you points which can be used to buy more execution animations, carry more pilums or to increase your health. Strangely enough you will be able to afford every single one of them by the second level and the very last upgrades well take you the rest of the game to unlock simply due to not being level 7 or you can easily afford those to. I'm guessing it has something to do with the included dlc that comes bundled with the PC version. Bosses are pretty much the same as regular enemies but with a new skin and much more health. You deal with them by blocking their attacks at the right moment to break their guard and slowly chipping off their health. They are no fun to fight though the set pieces in where you fight them are impressive to say the least. One boss in particular took way to long to finish off. Every time you deplete his health bar he would get back up in a “haha not dead yet!” manner, time and time again.\n\nStory is forgettable and uninteresting for the most part. There is a few cool parts when they show things from the barbarian's point of view but never amounts to anything. The story feels a bit jumbled since you are playing through what is a tale of Marius's life and are traveled from one location to another instantly. It's not a bad story and it does it's job but don't go into this game expecting a engrossing tale.  Or a decent ending for that matter, I can't state the reasons why it is awful but it comes off as totally unnecessary and dumb. It is really best to turn off your brain and treat it like an action film all throughout. Characters themselves are memorable and excellently voice acted. Where Ryse really shines is in the graphics. Everything looks stunning, from the slums of Rome to the carefully animated jiggle of a fat barbarian's man boob. I mainly purchased this game as a benchmark test of sorts and in that regard it did not disappoint. Every level is filled with cool set-pieces to awe at and you can't help but just stare at everything for a while even if someone currently wants to rip your face off. Enemy variety is really low and since each character is so detailed and different from one another it is very noticeable you are fighting the same batch of enemies over and over again. Unfortunately the levels are all extremely linear and inconsistent. At times Marius can leap very high into the air and at others he can't vault over a waist high fence. That leads to feeling a bit of confusion as to where the game wants you to go next though they do put a giant cursor to point the way if you take long enough.\n\nIn addition to the campaign there is a gladiator mode where you and another player can fight side by side against enemies. What is rather cool is that you start off with simple loin cloth and a helmet but as you win matches and money you can purchase more and more items to customize your gladiator. Before the start of each match you can pick which of four gods is your patron for different benefits like extra damage or better aim. During matches the crowd will either grow bored or hyped depending on how well you do and it is in your best interest to keep them entertained as you get a nice cash bonus for your troubles. Sadly this mode felt boring as soon as I tried it since it is still the same combat mechanics from the base game with executions animations and all. After 6 hours of a campaign where you spent the huge majority of the time fighting I've had enough of this game's terrible combat by that point. When all is said an done Ryse: Son of Rome feels like a heartless game with amazing graphics, animations and music but fails to have either an interesting story or fun gameplay. Unless you want a tech demo this is a game you can safely pass on.","December 1, 2015","false","6.2"," 58 of 97 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","58","97","7","0"

I thought it would be a bad console port so I thought about skipping this. I didn't and here is my opinion\n\nThe good:\n- awesome graphics. This one is one of the most beatifull games available currently. That's no surprise since Crytek are known for great graphic engines.\n- the soundtrack is very good. It matches perfectly the setting. While trying to preserve the byzantine touch with the guitar it still is very modern and supports the overall orientalic touch of the setting.\n- Tight story. Storytelling seemed not to be one of Cryteks strength in the past but this story is not only very good, it's also perfectly told through the game.\n\nThe bad:\n- The game is kinda short. While Crytek tried to stretch the length with the cutscenes (which isn't a bad thing in this game) it feels very short. When you start playing this game and the deeper you dive into the story you feel like taking part in a movie and therefore expect to be taken completely into the world of it. While Ryse: SoR succeeds to take you into its world the game ends exactly where it could take you just a bit further to stay in your memory for a long time.\n\nThe ugly:\n- The game is VERY, VERY repetitive. The executions and finishing moves are fun the 1st, 2nd and 3rd time. In fact they are really awesome for about half an hour. After that they are simply boring. The fights are always the same. Only the setting changes. While the fights are the most important part in an action game this breaks the whole game down. After one hour I stopped playing on normal difficulty to start the whole game over on Centurion difficulty and finished the game easily. It's just about timing. You could stand on the same place in every fight as long as you time your dodge and block attack.\n\nWith that beeing said, I would definitely recommend this game as soon as it is on sale. It's one of the most beatifull games due to the awesome graphics, the perfect atmosphere and setting and the great soundtrack. On the other hand great visuals don't make a good game. It has a very linear level design and repetitive fighting mode.\nDon't be misleaded by the recommendation button. I could also press the "don't recommended" button. I thing this game is one of those who deserve a third option between positive and negative review like a 50%-50% button.","October 29, 2014","true","13.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Sweet!\n\nRyse: Son of Rome follows Marius Titus' life from early childhood to becoming a leader in the Roman Legion. To be honest, Marius kinda slighty reminds me of Maximus Decimus from the Gladiator film, I mean, look at this:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=364262864\n\nThe resemblance is uncanny, right?\n\nAnyway, Ryse: Son of Rome is all about choosing and fulfilling your "fate."

The controls are good even for keyboard and mouse , the graphics are amazing and the story , personally , really drew me in . Of course you have the classic historical inaccuracies but these things annoy only people like me (annoy very little of course) . The voice acting is superb and the motion capture of the faces is a work of art . This game is NOT a QTE fest as the "haters" keep suggesting , if anything it offers classic , enjoyable hack and slash gameplay and tops it off with gory and awe inspiring executions . What more could anyone want ? Also , it is worth noting that the game itself is very well optimized , letting me play in smooth fps whilst I had a GeForce GT 635M graphic card and a 4Gb RAM . So despite its amazing graphics which lead to fear for performance etc , even older builds can handle it . Of course I am not suggesting ALL older builds can and research has to be made before the purchase .

I have been a gamer for many years but I believe this is possibly the most gorgeous game, in terms of visuals, I have ever played.  Sure it has some flaws, even my favorite game reviewers (Angry Joe and Total Biscuit) hated its repetitive combat and linear gameplay.  I don't care I still bought the game. When I am playing this game I feel like I an action hero (e.g. Russel Crowe in Gladiator or Kevin McKidd in Rome TV Series) playing a lead role and part of a movie.  The cinematic cut scenes are well placed.  The voice acting and the character designs, specially the women (e.g. Spirit of Summer) are top notch.  My only complain really is how short the campaign was.  I really wish this game had a lot more to offer in terms of length of gameplay.  I got this on a discount, so I won't complain that much.  The game adds multiplayer and co op mode that adds extra play time with your friends which is quite neat.  Finally, this game demands a lot on your GPU (in order to appreciate its beauty) and if you are color blind (can't tell which is yellow and blue) you will not get combo points.

In this review I will begin with the negatives and then look at the positives, so if the negatives don't throw you off, please go on to the positives and you can take it as a recommendation to buy. As it stands, to cut it short, I do not recommend it at full price. I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes, as English is not my native language and I am not sure if I will not be too lazy to run this through LibreOffice to get the spell-check done.\n\nStory - averageThe story has some twists, but not really something to marvel at. In fact the here was my first gripe with it. Quite early on you meet a character that you realize is some sort of god entity (I was kind of thrown off by the opening scene as well, but decided to suspend my suspicion of godly intervention). Truly I was hoping for something more of a historic game but this mythical nonsense has pulled me out a bit and as such the otherwise good, although shallow, story suffers as if it is not enough that it is barely 6 hours long. There is no deep meaning or secret twists here, the way the story is presented is also a bit odd. The events of the game are told by the main character which seems no real purpose.\n\nLength - poorAnd as mentioned this is one of the biggest problems I have currently with the game - the lent. Even on the Hard setting it only took me 6 hours to go through. It is very linear with the exception of a few small areas that let you go a few different paths that quickly meet up while the pace is sometimes slowed down by testudo formation movements and such. While at first interesting, you quickly see that the testudo formation is merely a mini-game that slows down the pace of the game. The turret sections are also something that seems to just delay the action. The game also has a multiplayer option. Sadly it is a simple 2 player co-op survival. Though it does seem like you can customize your gladiator with a separate progression system (unlock weapons, armor), though did not dive into that too much yet.\n\nGameplay - Fighting - averageMoving on to the gameplay mechanics. The game is more of an interactive movie really. The fighting mechanics are not really all that great. It has similarities with the Arkham free flow, however it really is just a combination of pressing the push attack, normal attack twice, repeat until you can execute - execute. Heavy attacks can be executed to do more damage but are really not necessary most of the time. Enemy variety can be summed up as follows: basic fighter, shield fighter, elite soldier, heavy soldier. Majority of enemies are your basic fighters and shield fighters. Once in a while you get a heavy soldier that only does heavy attacks (which you can only dodge or perfect block) but you can otherwise attack at your own discretion until he blocks one. The elite soldiers usually dual wield and can be attacked if you block all 3 subsequent attacks or if you use your heavy push attack.\nThe game includes perfect attacks (clicking next attack as your first one lands) which increase the speed of your perfect attack and perfect blocks (blocking at the last second) which stumble your opponents. Both are interesting, however sadly they are both completely unnecessary as I did not hit most of the perfect attacks and the perfect blocks are really necessary against some stronger fighters and bosses (as you can only attack them after perfect blocks).\nYou also get a power move, which slams your shield into the ground slowing down time for your enemies, letting you unleash a flurry of blows against any enemy (except bosses of course).\nThese are all good ways to kill enemies, but let's be honest you are not going to be doing that unless you miss the skull icon above an enemy. That means he can be executed which is a QTE to pull off an awesome finishing move.\n\nTo sum up the combat it is really a counter/attack enemy until you get skull and then QTE. About 90% of the game is QTE and each fight is basically an attempt to get to the QTE which is rather easy and quick to do.\nYou get 4 perks to use, which are awards for pulling of executions. You can  1) regain health (no other way to heal up), 2) gain focus (to use your focus move and slow down time), 3) gain short timed damage buff or 4) gain extra EXP. Swapping them can be necessary, though you'd be fine just swapping between 1 and 2.\n\nGameplay - Progression - abysmalYou gain levels and points to unlock upgrades. No no, not weapon or damage upgrades. Your upgrades are limited to 5 areas. You can upgrade your health bar, your focus bar, your points and exp gain and your combat skills. And by combat skills I mean the amount of ammo (for ranged attack you barely ever use) and the other is the needed amount of perfect hits in succession to enter burning eagle mode (basically a damage buff) which you can never achieve in the game and still do absolutely fine. The health and focus bars are done in shards. You can upgrade the amount of shards and increase the size of the shards.\nLast area where you can improve things are the perks. Each of the mentioned perks can be upgraded for a single or dual enemy execution. All executions seem to be unlocked by default so it is odd that they are shown in the upgrades area though you can do nothing with them.\n\nAll in all the progression feels meaningless and you will feel absolutely no difference in upgrading anything (though might as well spend the points on HP and focus)\n\nIntermissionWell seems like I’ve let out all of the things that made me feel like this game was a waste of money. If you are still with me, let's go on with the rest of it that made me feel like I got some of the cost worth it\n\nVisuals - amazingThe visuals are absolutely amazing. The cut-scenes and scenery are great. Most of the game you will be rushing from one arena to the next to fight the enemies, but if you stick around to look at the actual areas you will see great detail put into most of them. The cut-scenes seem great and well put together. Sure you will see clipping here and there, but to be honest that can not be avoided and if you do not pay too much attention to detail (like I do) you will probably miss them. The executions while from a gameplay standpoint are repetitive QTEs are actually bloody and gruesome and you will try to do them every single time just to see Marius in action, cutting off arms, skewering enemies, slitting throats and bashing their heads in with the shield. Every time you finish off an enemy without the execution you feel like you lost that fight in some way.\nYou have to keep in mind that this will require quite a bit from your machine. I am running a single GTX 760 card which while not high end, is still powerful. I myself cannot enable such options as super sampling, but otherwise seems to run fine on max with an occasional mini-freeze here and there (but might just be some problems as these are all in areas where you do not control the character).\n\nSound - goodVoice acting is great here. I have no gripes there and actually liked the way the characters were acted out. Cannot give much comments on the soundtrack, because honestly I did not notice if it even had any (was too busy watching enemies getting impaled on spike walls and legs left standing where cut off).\n\nMovement/Controls - above averageThe movement of the character seems to feel heavy and realistic enough to see that he is wearing armor and is carrying a heavy shield with rare exceptions. Problem here is that the controls are not rebindable and you have 3 schemes to choose from.\n\nCould probably go on but reaching max char limit. The good areas of the game are really good but the bad do raise the question whether it is worth 40EUR. I say it is not worth that much, although visuals and cut-scenes are amazing.","October 15, 2014","false","9.0"," 44 of 73 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","44","73","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/302510/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Ryse: Son of Rome is a third person action-adventure hack and slash game developed by Crytek. The game was initially released in November, 2013 on the Xbox One, but was ported to PC in October, 2014. The game tells an alternate story of Rome. The game is set around 50-60AD in the Roman Empire era. This is the time period that Emperor Nero led Rome into surprising territorial defeats including one of the failed invasions of Briton. You play as the lead protagonist and centurion Marius Titus. Titus' mission is to lead his troops into battle, though his ultimate goal is to find and kill the person that killed his family.\n\nThe campaign of Ryse has variety, twists and turns, accompanied by a very strong story. The story begun with a barbarian attack on Rome. You are centurion Titus who helps lead the defence on his city as Nero yells to his troops to defend him. As you can tell, Nero is a self-centered, populist-driven, egomaniac that drives Rome into oblivion while only really caring about himself. Meanwhile, Titus is a loyalist who will defend Rome at any cause even if that means hunting people that hold power. The story continues and progresses into a flashback, which the entire game is set upon. I will note that the present-to-flashback is a very popular avenue for developers in campaigns. This avenue is present in Ryse. As a whole though, the campaign is linear. The story starts with a pretty basic tone in terms of objectives and getting use to the combat, but as the story progresses it becomes intense and captures the essence of fighting to survive. In other words, the story is a highlight of the game. The length varies as I played on normal difficulty and completed it in about seven or so hours. In saying that, there are many things to collect like collecting scrolls that garner achievements once all are completed. These things, for the lack of a better term are nothing of importance unless you strive for achievements.\n\nThe gameplay is hack and slash and fairly fast-paced. The gameplay or should I say combat because that’s what we are really talking about here, is average. In an era where Roman soldiers carry heavy armour and Barbarians have no armour, you would assume there is a great variety in combat. For example, Roman's hit slower because of their equipment but can sustain more attacks whereas Barbarians die more quickly but have faster attacks. Though in this game that is completely thrown out the window. Barbarians and Romans have no difference in combat features, which is unfortunate because it would have made the game more realistic. Also, the combat like I said is fast-paced whereas I was hoping for a more slow pace to really grasp the environment and the atmosphere. The combat is basic as well. There are very few animations with attacking, blocking, etc. meaning the combat does get repetitive. But, the combat is fluid. Lastly, there is strategic elements to the game. You can command your men to defend a certain position or signal them to fire their bows. This element only occurs when the game allows you to do so, meaning you cannot always command them. So overall, the combat is hit and miss. It captures the nature of being a Roman soldier and being outnumbered, but the lack of animations and those 'little things' make the combat mild.\n\nThe graphics are just incredible. They are very lifelike and gorgeous. The attention to detail really makes the graphical side of this game excellent. The only issues that stem with graphics and the technical aspect is the optimisation of the game. I feel there was a lack of it as I had certain FPS issues in some areas. I played this game on low settings and I could achieve a solid 30 FPS in most missions, however, some environments I would manage around 8 fps. While it did make the game unstable at times and annoying, it fixed once the mission was completed.\n\nThe sound in the game is very good and is on par on what you would expect. For example, your sword hitting stone.\n\nThe voice acting is brilliant. I adore the son of Emperor Nero, who I had forgotten his name, as his voice acting was just perfect. He used a variety of voice tones that hit the nail on the head of the arrogance of a man of power.\n\nThe UI is nice and slick. The artwork in the menu is cool and feels fresh. However, there is an upgrade system in the menu that allows you to upgrade your character. I am not overly fond of it as there was not enough description to describe what the point of upgrading was other than executions. So to summarise my thoughts on the upgrade system I would call it a miss, but the UI a hit.\n\nMy final negative on the game was replayability. There is virtually none in this game. If you are not a completionist, you would complete the campaign and then maybe play a few rounds of coop multiplayer, which is you and another person killing barbarians for hours, and then the game is pretty much finished. Due to that, you would only get about 10-15 hours out of the game. So for value, there isn't much.\n\nOverall, the game is good. The campaign was very strong, the graphics were gorgeous, the combat is average, and there is no replayability. Therefore, if you are an avid Roman Empire fan and would like to play an alternative version of Rome, buy this game at full price of $20. Otherwise, I recommend purchasing the game on sale because despite the campaign and graphics, there is not much value to keep playing it. You will enjoy the game immensely though in my opinion. 6.5/10\n\nThanks for reading my review!

Rome and Breton forests are surely looks grand. The faces in the prolonged cutscenes are so natural, that feels like alive actors. The movement of all characters, both in cutscenes and gameplay, is fluid to the point I believe I see where Crytek have spended money from their "secret benefactor" (M-soft).\n\n+/- the battle system is generally not bad, despite all things you might have heard about notorious QTE. I kinda liked the thing with blocking without prompts - far cry from that I've usually see in games like Assassin's Creed - there you'll be actually taking alot of hits on your back unless you'll learn the curve with dodging and blocking. The thing I must urge you to there, if you are just going to start the game - don't go with cheesy "easy" and "normal" difficulty levels, as there enemies won't be fair with you. Go right for the hard level, to feel at least Some challenge on your way.\n\n+/- the story is... tolerable. It is not even close to the historical reality, but the fact that Nero was quite the SOB. I'd preferred something less stocked with cheap poignancy, we're all so full of with games of Call of Duty series. And I'd preferred something more prolonged and more close to reality I'm familiar with. So far, the Crytek's Rome is purely whimsical. Ubisoft, for instance, made much better work with implementing their assassins into medieval era...\n\n- the optimisation of the PC version is awful, though. Even loathsome sometimes. Like the boss fight with the giant horny-headed man, heavily based on the QTE moments - the stage of the game, where my framerate dropped that badly that the game was not registering the inputs I was performing during that QTE. That reminded me of the Tomb Raider'13, which I played right after release - and was killed by the AlphaWolf 50+ times, even knowing exactly what to do... controls were simple not responding correctly because of the drop in the framerate. Well, Tomb Raider was fixed after some time, and framerate become much more stable... unlike Ryse. No, it's not that bad, as with the latest Batman game, but surely the port to the PC could have been performed much better.\n\nOverall, my mark will be 6/10. I see the worthy stuff in the Ryse, but it's simple not enough to make the really good playtime - unless you're one of the Call-of-Duty-type-of-game admirers, of course. As for me, I don't really like the latest Crytek agenda, which goes as "people will buy anything crappy, if they'll see good graphics". I admire Crytek engine, but engine alone not doing the game great. Speaking of Ryse, it's the console project, which played its part with the start of XBox One, and which might look cool into VR goggles... As of its PC port, it's bad.\nSo far, if I want a modern slasher, I'd better go with the Shadow of Mordor, as it gives me much more diverse gameplay than Ryse - with various enemy behaviors (and skins), better challenges and level designs. And less of that "protect the Civilization" limped imperialistic ethos, I'm so full of already.","April 21","false","22.4"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","28","46","0","17"

I am not making any of this up. Any one who plays/Played this game will agree. The people who thumb down is disregarding the problems that is wrong with this game and is sticking by Crytec (FanBoys) no matter what quality of the game and I dont have any Bias or hate torwards the game and or the developers. ONLY READ IF YOU WANT A REAL REVIEW OF THE GAME;\n\n\n\nPROS:\nI recommend the game because it has a great story from beginning to the end, has a small twist which was a great addition to the plot. It looks marvolous, one of the best looking games I have played and that the next gen graphics has to offer.\n\nCONS:\nI do not recommend the game because:\n\n1. Combat is pretty good. BUT, Extremly repetative. Being as Literal as possible....You will be doing the exact same finisher hundreds of times, with the EXACT same animation, The first 5-10 kills is glorious and wonderful, but going into the 20th and 60th to 100th times doing the exact attack and seeing the exact same animation does get frustrating and will leave you saying "REALLY... AGAIN..." in your head. The same slash, slash, shield bash, slash, it does not change with the animations. I was expecting some pretty cool manuvers and a wide range of animations for different variation of attacks, but Nope. I was wrong. My Opinion:The combat system is extremely time consuming and lengthy only because you are extremly limited to your attacks you will finish off 1 out of 2 enemies the exact same way.\n\n2. The classes of enemies all look alike. In the beginning, you are in battle with the barbarians for at least 30 to 60 mins of gameplay. Again, you are fighting the exact same 3 character barbarians for the entire time, again NOT EXAGGERATING.  I even found myself fighting the 3 of the heavier type barbarians all identical. This happens throughout the entire game. Its like this they created say 10 different enemies for the entire game and used them throughout the game. My Opinion: The character design was very lazy, for a next gen game, no effort was put into making diverse enemies, Not diverse at all, no variation\n\n3. The focus mode only allows you to slow down time and you are allowed to slash really quick in an X formation, and you can do the Sparta kick which will send the enemy flying somewhere. My Opinion: As suppose to be a "special finisher" using focus mode is a huge let down. The first few times is awesome, especiallly kicking your opponent out of screen view, but it becomes annoying and even Unescessary since that is the only thing the focus mode allows you to do.\n\n\n\nSo, after beating the game, my review stays the same. The gameplay overall is bad, the only reason why I played is strictly because of the story. Which was decent. Is it worth the money to play a good story but everything else suck? If you want to get the game because you think its just kick ♥♥♥, Dont. In All honesty, This game is lacking way more than it is giving. The story along with the visuals makes up for alot, but DOES NOT, make the game recommendable. Wait for the sale you feel you must play this game. It is not worth the retail price. If you know the gameplay sucks, but really want to follow the story then please go right on.\n\nHopefully the Devs will use this game and build other games adding more content that this game fails to provide.","October 24, 2014","false","8.3"," 62 of 110 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","62","110","0","5"

The story is reasonable, taking you on an enjoyable adventure as your character, Marius, becomes a leader of a Roman Legion seeking retribution against the barbarians who threaten Rome. There isn't all that much to the game mechanics; you have standard attack, block, break guard moves and once you get used to the controls it is fairly straightforward. There are some nice death moves however, where you slice off arms and so on, but these do get a bit repetitive. The multiplayer modes work well in a gladiatorial arena setting, so that's fun for a while with friends. All in all, a game certainly worth picking up in sale for at least a few hours of enjoyment.","January 29, 2015","true","10.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

The first time you do some of the execution moves will bring a smile to your face.  After about an hour of combat you would had seen pretty much all the moves there is to offer.  The combat is extremely brutal, but not too gory.  You will cut off arms, stab your sword through someones head and bash your opponant with your shield countless times and while it did get very repetitive I never got tired of seeing it.\n\nThe graphics in this game are top notch!  Most of the time it looks like you're watching a movie.  The voice acting was good and had the feel of the movie Gladiator.  "Are you not entertained!"  I really enjoyed the setting and the overall performance of the story and after it was done I was left wanting more.  The game took the developers 7 years to make, but it took me 7 hours to beat it.  The production value is quite high.\n\nThe frame rates in this game is atrocious.  While I did play this game on the highest settings possible I've also got a powerful rig.  The game is locked for me at 60fps and played fantastically, but once QTE's start up it immediately dropped and locked to 30fps.  I'm not sure if this was a bad port problem from the Xbox One or the QTE's just take that much out of the performance.  Other than that the game ran very well with minor other fps hits here and there and the game did crash on me 1 time after a very long 10 min cut scene.  I had to replay that whole scene all over!  :'(\n\nThe upgrade system for your character is simple.  Mostly upgrading your health, focus (special move), more extensive moves and XP you gain from killing off your opponants.  There are a lot of collectables to find during your quest and I did not find all of them.  I took my time and tried, but I could had missed them during scenes where you are constantly being attacked from afar with arrows and you don't have time to explore.\n\nThose who like the Rome themes, God of War brutality gameplay and realistic graphics are in for a treat and I couldn't recommend this more.  While the game is semi-short it is extremely fun and worth your time.  The Crytek engine really shines for this game and you do need to have a powerful PC to run it optimally.

You go through 95% of this game pressing shield bash, slash, slash and repeat on everything you fight, with an occasional need to dodge an incoming enemy attack. An hour into this game and I was already bored with the combat mechanics and it didn't really improve from there.\n\nThere was to much forgivness (even on the harder difficulties) in combat executions..if you press the wrong button, you still end up carving the enemy up in a very stylish way. It would have been far better to have the enemy be able to counter your attack(s) should you have pressed the wrong button or pressed a button too late.  If you start an execution, and even not press anything, you still automatically end up killing said enemy... making the whole need for a button sequence pointless.\n\nEvery enemy in the game seems to be recycled over and over again, sometimes you are even fighting numerous enemies simultaneously that are just clones. It is extremely linear as well, so there is really no exploration to this game at all, you're just kind of funneled through, completing tasks the way the creators want you to.\n\n\nThis was on top of numerous bugs and glitches, mainly at the beginning of the game when having to break through doors, the character would end up spinning on the spot making the game un-playable untill it was closed and reloaded.\n\n\nThis game would be best experienced as a rental, as you will most likely do, and see everything it has to offer in 1 or 2 days.

Had a couple of moments where I feel the camera should have been looking at someone who was talking to me but instead it was gazing into the sky.\nIn combat, there are times where it's zoomed in too close and you get barely any warning that someone's about to hit you from behind. Other times it zooms out behind walls and other scenery objects and you can't see what's going on at all.\n\nAnother negative, one particularly felt by PC players; ranged weapons have an annoying auto-aim which regularly locks on to the wrong target for you and it can be pretty stubborn about it.\n\nCombat feels pretty clunky, it's not smooth and flowing. The game encourages you to build up your combos by mixing what buttons you hit, which is fine but not done in a very believable way. Mash the same button too many times and the enemies suddenly go from stumbling backwards and getting their backside kicked to instantly being fine and countering your attack.\nOccasionally there are parts of the game where squad elements are used to progress, which are a nice touch. The game has a nice balance between fighting on your own and fighting shoulder to shoulder with your Roman comrades. The number of enemies seems nicely balanced between not too many and not too few.\n\nExecutions of weakened enemies can gain you a number of things such as health regens, bonus XP, focus regens etc. Picking which perk you want from your executions is done on the fly with your mouse wheel, the game doesn't pause or slow down while you're doing this, so picking which perk you want while in the middle of combat can be a frantic affair.\nThe execution itself contains a match button element to keep your combo count going and improve the result of the execution. Which button you need to hit depends on which colour the enemy flashes. The brief tutorial at the beginning tells you once which colour means which button and if you forget then tough luck. The game wont remind you.\nIt's also possible to execute more than 1 enemy simultaneously, which is a nice feature.\n\nThe graphics are very pretty. The scenes are quite realistic and the voice acting is brilliant, though the storyline is a bit odd. The idea of a barbarian attack on Rome being blamed on a British rebellion seems a little implausible to me.\nThe game does feel that it has potential to be one of the greats, however the awkward controls reminicent to a lazy console port combined with the terrible camera work which just seems unfinished really drags the game down. It's for these reasons, especially the camera, that I can't really recommend this game unless you don't mind occasionally fighting blind. If they fixed it in a patch though, this game would definately be one to have.","December 22, 2014","false","0.4"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

The cinematic quality (voice acting, music, cutscenes) is some of the best i've seen in gaming. It takes maybe 6-7 hours to finish the story. I would recommend playing on centurion first, than legendary to get more time out of it.\n\nThe graphics are great, and it runs well on my system (gtx 760, fx 6350, 8gb ram), on high. I'm not using supersampling, only taa, but i don't think i've seen aliasing in this game. It's impressive. The lighting, shadows, vegetation look great.The character models are also very detailed.\n\nThe mouse and keyboard work fine.\n\nCombat is kind of like Assasins creed but a bit harder i think.  You have to dodge, block. Some enemies require you to break their guard before you can damage them, or dodge and strike after. I like it when i get to execute 2 enemies at once. After getting an enemy to low health you can execute him, you will have to press the right or left mouse button depending on the prompt.  You can also choose different buffs for succesful executions (health restoration, focus restoration, extra xp or damage). This is what you will be doing for most of the game. It can get repetitive, but i like the execution animations.\n\nThere is an upgrade system. You get xp from performing succesful executions, and can spend it to increase attributes like health.\n\nBesides the combat there are also a couple of things to the gameplay:\n\n- Turret sections with mounted crossbows\n- Testudo formations. You have to hold the shields when the enemy archers shoot arrows, and can also throw pila to kill them.\n\nThe game is mostly linear, but you can look around a bit to find collectibles.\n\nAlso got to try the multiplayer, it's pretty fun and can be challenging. You are as a gladiator in arenas, fighting combinations of enemies also found in the story mode. You can also use turrets sometimes. If you liked the combat in the campaign, you'll also like the multiplayer. You can also level up and get better items.","October 10, 2014","true","32.1"," 45 of 80 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","45","80","0","0"

The is a gorgeous game with flaws. The story is just barely interesting enough to want to keep playing, but it lacks depth and certainly won't win any awards.  The combat is repetitive and frustrating at times, but not to the point of wanting to quit.  I had fun, but at the end of the game, I felt like there was an opporunity lost.  With just a little more effort beyond visuals, voice acting, and soundtrack, it could have been really great.  As far as the game itself, outside of these areas, it was very mediocre to me.\n\nFor example, battles start out really exciting and get your blood pumping, and then shortly afterwards, become a bit of a letdown.  They are so tightly scripted, that the immersion is just not there. And soldiers under your command can't go to the bathroom without your supervision.  They will also sit back and watch as you get beaten like a pinata by a dozen barbarians.  I am running around in circles wondering why they are just standing still right next to the enemy.  Unless they are on drugs, it's wierd.  Speaking of immersion, this is a game that tries to be realistic looking with brutal combat sequences and all the blood and gore.  But, shortly after you dispatch a couple of badass gigantic barbarian fighters with ease, you'll get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by a small girl, wearing no armor, and weighing about 90 pounds soak and wet.  And that is when I remember to shut my brain off and keep mashing the buttons until the fight is over with.\n\nAs long as you look at this game as a mindless action-style game, it is a great, short ride.  It really is a beautiful game, my hat goes off to the artists and graphic developers.  The environment is very detailed and there are some great opportunities to capture some nice screenshots.  It is just too bad there are so few opportunities to explore it. On sale, I would say the game is totally worth it, but don't expect a masterpiece.  The reason I am recommending it is because I thought it was fun, and that is all that matters in the end.  The campaign took me about 6 hours, and for this game, the length is just right in my opinion.","September 27, 2015","true","7.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The campaign is rather short and the story is cheesy. I really wish they made the story more grounded and realistic without any supernatural elements.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is boring except for the survival mode. The survival mode really shines, it makes ranking up a fun and addictive things to do because you can't just hack n slash your way through. You actually need good strategy, good co-op partner, and better gears to survive longer. Sadly there is no survival time leaderboard to show how well you do it.\nYou unlock higher tier of gears every time you reach certain rank, once that tier unlocked, you hunt for better gears by buying a pack. Each pack only give you few random gears and you can complete your collection by... wait for it... keep playing to earn more golds and ranking up to unlock new tiers.\n\nCONCLUSION :\nRecommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.","April 2","true","61.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I finally played it through in 2015 and it was one of best experiences of that year. I suspect the original judgement came from bona fide reviewers who thought it was in good tone to cringe at terms "linear" and "QTE".\n\nGames are not (quite) algebra so I don't get the linear thing. There's nothing wrong with games being "linear", or more precisely, games of progression; it's simply another genre. There are lot of different half-forgotten genres outside of the sandbox, you know... Ryse is such an action game with great system of emergent combat which no, isn't technically based on quick-time events by any means. Perhaps a good exercise is to try the game on highest difficulty setting to see all mechanics fall nicely into place. The game has also a number of interesting staged situations, is generally well-directed, and has multiple types of interesting collectibles of lore.\n\nMuch good have been said about Ryse's graphics. I would say that story isn't half bad either. Actually it's very good. It has heights and lows, as every roller-coaster has. The controlling idea is how history and our individual lives are gods' playground... which makes a metacommentary to the interplay between fixed character of the narrative and the expectations of the game's audience, doesn't it? :]\n\nGiven its Hollywood epic scope it's fun to summarize how twisted the game's story is compared to history:\n+ Nero did indeed crush a revolt of Boudica in Britannia!\n− but the fighting was in Anglia, not in Northumbria or, God forbid, Pictland! (still, the northern excursion is one of the best game's moments...)\n− The name of York comes from Old Norse and as such is much younger (but the defense of York is top too...)\n− Boudica's father is unknown, but his name was definitely not Oswald, which is Germanic.\n+ XVI legio did indeed fight in Britannia!\n− Boudica never ever targeted Rome of course...\n− had she done so, she would not have brought war elephants! :) for God's sake.\n− The anectode of Damocles is of Greek origin and does not involve centurions...\n+ but it does involve daggers, and the general message is very much the same. Hurray!\n− The Colloseum was a very fancy arena but how it is portrayed in the game is waay over the top :)\n+Nero did throw himself on his sword, you know... according to some records. But more likely his secretary had to kill him.\nYet these are all minor ones. The greatest lie is subtle and might get you tricked:\n− Nero didn't have or adopt sons; had he had any, he would more likely plot to kill them rather than protect them etc.","January 4","true","9.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The dichotomy of gods and mortals and the politics between factions.\n\nSome exposition\nI had previously written a negative review of this game at about 3 hours into the campaign. I had mentioned a number of technical issues I was having that I later diagnosed as user error. I have now fixed those issues and continued with the rest of the game until completion. The issue at hand was a rapidly fluctuating frame rate between 20-64 fps that was altogether too jarring to constantly have to deal with whilst trying to play. The reason for this was that I had altered a .ini config file and forgotten I'd done so when trying to optimize my settings. Leaving the V-sync and Lock Screen options useless.\n\nMain Crux\nYou are a Roman Gladiator. The combat in the game is very simple. You have quick attacks, counters, and shield bashes. You can also roll. The main goal is to get your enemies health down until they have a skull appear on their head which means its time for an execution move. Doing execution moves will grant you 1 of 4 things at your choosing once unlocked. Either a bonus to XP, focus (this is a sort of rage meter), health or damage. The executions are rather slow paced and take some time to complete allowing for easy switching if something comes in need. You'll have plenty of time to make a decision. You are also invincible to other enemies during these animations. So if you fail to counter or dodge an attack you can easily grab an enemy to execute for a quick breather.\n\nThe narrative is a very summer blockbuster affair. From just a few interactions its pretty easy to see what turn the main character will take. Its not the best story in the world but the cut-scenes are well produced and well acted. To the games credit I sincerely wanted to kill (without spoilers) the characters the game set up as being the douches. As for the main character, he seems like a dud. I didn't care for him at all. Easily replaced by anyone.\n\nCaveats and grievances\nThis game is VERY easy. I played on Normal so I cannot speak to the higher difficulty levels. When doing an execution the enemies light up blue or yellow. Presumably because this a port of a Xbox One launch title and they correspond to the X and Y buttons for designation between quick attacks and shield bashes. The thing is, it doesn't matter nearly at all which button you press. It will not kill your combo it will simply continue the animation and give a lower ranking of the hit such as recruit hit, instead of legendary hit. (There are various other ones in between) There is no fail animations. This is likely due to the incredibly over produced look of the game, it simply either costs too much to implement or they ran out of time. The ranged combat is also very stilted, seemingly thrown in and there are too many sequences of pressing forward while holding shields up defending your men all '300' style “our arrows will blot of the sun”, “Then we will fight in the shade” moments. Which takes away from the intensity of the first time its done. Its very quickly becomes a fatigued technique.\n\nDespite the games relatively short campaign you will be seeing the same executions over and over to the point you may very well be able to predict what color the enemy will turn before its ready to show you.\n\nThere are very few types of enemies:\n\n- You have the standard no shield 1 handed weapon (fodder for executions)\n- You have the shield bearer, break guard first\n- You have Dual wielding 'chaos' dudes, set standard 3 hit combo and occasional power hit\n- You have the big tower fighter, big two handed weapon, every attack is a power attack\n\nAnd these enemies have about 2 types of character models that they literally just repeat the entire game. They attempt to fool you about half way by switching up their garb and textures but aside from the occasional boss fight these tactics are all there is.\n\nYou also have your standard turret and forced walk down a hallway sequence that every triple A title is not nearly complete without.\n\nTHE GIST\nNo new ground was broken here. Its your standard big budget fancy looking market this here for new box excite. I don't like to bring price into my reviews as even a flat price has different value to different people so I'll say whatever it is you consider cheap, that is what you should pay for this if it interests you. I found myself getting into a rhythm while fighting that I found very satisfying and despite all my complaints I did not hate most of what I played except for the dumb turret crap and  shield walking to block arrows. Those sequences seemed overused and unjustified filler material.\n\n3 dead wildlings; oops, wrong thing, out of 5\n","December 31, 2015","true","6.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","1"

(gameplay, story, multiplayer, graphics)\nThanks alot Crytek for developing my personal game of all time.\n\nlong version\n\n"Ryse: Son of Rome is a stunning action-adventure that follows Marius Titus on a heroic quest to avenge the death of his family, and preserve the honor of Rome, at all costs."\nThe story is brilliant and greatly staged, because it is thrilling, motivating and because it fits perfect for the revenge plot. It is also convincing because the cutscene and the ingame game graphics quality coalesce into each other and because the characters act and look realistic through the whole game which is filled with action packed moments and jaw dropping scenery in a graphic quality close to realism.\nThe brutal combat system contains executions achieved by quick time events (qte´s), which is a matter of taste if set bad but they fit and feel rewarding while adding more challenge to the combat system itself. Blocking, targeting, avoiding damage, attacking and timing your attacks at the same time in fast paced battles while executing enemy´s with stunning animations never felt so great, especially at higher difficulty´s. It also draws attention to the cinematic look and feeling the game has in every situation.\nThere is a great amount of variety set by the intense scenery Ryse has to offer, leant on the story of babarians trying to conquer rome. it´s an experience like any other and absolute worth seeing. Every chapter by itself is designed so great that it´s worth it by it´s own.\nThe Multiplayer is the best gladiator experience ive ever seen so far. When the stage and setting gets  build out of the ground while the whole arena is moving looks awesome. The feeling you have, standing inside the colloseum surrounded by applauding audience while fighting for victory is outstanding.\nThe whole game is very well accompanied by a great soundtrack which adds tension and the right feeling for every envirement for an immersive, unique experience.\nFinal verdict - the game gets sold for 20-40€ on steam at release day with all avaiable dlc´s. Yes the story is short, but the overall game quality and content with multiplayer and the experience it has to offer compensate it more then expected. (Since i played with controller and didn´t noticed that it isn´t possible to change the keysetting on keyboard -0.5) 9.5/10 brilliant\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7glAsWaiZzM","October 14, 2014","true","119.1"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

Its well optimized and very nice especially when you crank up the Supersampling and turn off the in-game temporal AA which blurs the game too much for me. My only complaint is why using Pre-rendered cutscenes while rendering using the engine on realtime looks better since cutscenes does have compression although the videos are quite high quality and almost unnoticable when playing on a television, but on a monitor its actually noticable.\n\nGameplay is the usual attack, block and break defense. You could just keep spamming the attack button and shield bash when they start dodging your attacks. I do understand why people would think the combat is repetitive, but for me the sound design and the numerous execution animations look superb. Voice acting is top notch. I only hope that the combat is a bit more challenging since I think that is the reason why it gets repetitive.\n\nAlthough there are bugs when it was released pre patch the game wouldn't save, but now its fixed. Not sure about the other bugs that I haven't tested yet.\n\nGame is ran on a single Sapphire R9 290 Tri-X clocked to 1100 core/1300 mem, Intel i7-4770k and 8GB 1600MHz Corsair Dominator RAM.","October 11, 2014","true","9.3"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

Everything in this game is beautiful; its scenery, the foliage, the smoke, and when I am chopping barbarian hands off. But after awhile, you will notice that this game will start to get boring. The combat system keeps on repeating itself, as in there are very little variety of combat variation. Execution animations are very repetitive and the sword play is even more repetitive (basically you just slash enemies with your sword, deflect enemies' incoming attacks, slash em again, rinse and repeat). The campaign only lasts about 6 hours or so which is kind of short for an AAA game.\n\nThe campaign duration may not be so bad if only the co-op matchmaking works. Since this game only supports 2 player for multiplayer, it is very and i mean VERY hard to find partners with the matchmaking system. You have to scour the steam community for players and add them individually and hope they are free to play with you. The last time I've checked, theres only about 300 players in game (http://steamcharts.com/app/302510) which may be why the matchmaking does not work. Well thats not so bad, of course you can play the multiplayer maps by yourself or bots am I right. Well, no you are wrong. There are only a limited amount of maps that you can play by yourself which will get rather boring after awhile. There are also no bots capability so you have to find co-op partners to play those maps available in multiplayer only.\n\nIf it is so bad, why do you give this game a thumbs up?. Well its because I got this game on sale (about 50% off). At that price, I feel that this game is really worth my money due to its stunning graphics, and the enjoyment that I get when I first started this game. However, if I were to have bought this game with the full price of about $50, it will be definitely a different story.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nPros:\n- Stunning graphics\n- Good game physics\n- Amazing soundtrack\n- Simple combat\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer matchmaking does not work\n- Repetitive combat\n- Unclear upgrade system\n- Short campaign\n\nand btw, feel free to add me if you wanna play multiplayer together.

Don't be misled by my ingame-time. This is yet another game I played with a friend of mine on his Steam-account a while ago. We actually finished the game, taking turns playing it, and when this game recently was on sale, I decided to pick it up.\n2. I picked this up during a sale for 4,99. My rating will be mainly based on that price\n\nIt is kinda hard for me to rate this game, because there are a few things wrong about it, while at the same time, it has quite a few strengths.\nFIrst of all, the game looks really really good. Some of the scenes actually look almost like movie-scenes, and the tutorial (a big battle) looks really impressive. You will need a decent system to run the game. I don't have a dedicated gaming-PC, but on my system (i4790, 3.6 GHz, 16 gigs of ram, GTX 960 with 4 gigs), it worked great.\nIt has vibrant colors, tons of details and some great animations, so graphically, it deserves a high rating.\n\nGameplay-wise, if you have played games like Mad Max, Shadow Of Mordor,  recent AC-games or one of the Arkham-guys, you will feel right at home. The fights are about blocking, combos, hit streaks etc, and if you play with a controller, the game gives you directions (coloring your opponent in a certain color, telling you what button to hit). Finishing an enemy is pretty much a QTE... initiate the takedown, then watch the colors and hit the right buttons to kill the guy and regenerate some health.\nWith a tiny bit of practice, you can easily take on big groups of mobs.\n\nBy the way - someone said in his review that the game has no controller-support... I don't understand that, because I was able to play the game with an Xbox controller for Windows without any problems. The game detected the controller, no additional setup required.\n\nThere are quite a few cutscenes (which you cannot skip if you would like to do that), which are very well done.\n\nNow, for the weaknesses:\nThe story is pretty cliché and rather predictable. It's ok, but nothing to write home about really.\nThe game is really REALLY short...I don't quite recall just how many hours it took us to complete the game, but it must have been something like 5 hrs or so.\nThe fighting is pretty easy. So if you care mainly about the story and play the easiest difficulty, it gets pretty dull early on, but even the harder difficulties aren't THAT challenging.\n\nThis is highly subjective, but IMO, the game tries a bit too hard to get into the vibe of the 300 movies. There are some cutscenes, for example the story of Damocles, which feel VERY inspired by 300, and for me personally, it was a bit too obvious and too cliché. Sure, the movies were fun, but this game tries a bit too hard sometimes to cash in on that with those cutscenes and the amount of gore and executions.\n\nSo basically, the game looks really really good, has a decent combat-system, and is well optimized, but also is way too short, can get repetitive very quickly, and doesn't have that much of an interesting story.\nSo my thumbs up ONLY counts if you can get this game on sale. For 4.99, it's quite a steal, and I don't regret picking it up at that price, even though I finished it before. However, at a higher price (I think it's 20 EUR when not on sale), I am not sure I could give this a thumbs up due to the lack of depth and the short campaign.\n\nVerdict:\n7/10 at 5 bucks, 5-6 at standard price. Great graphics and sound, nice flowing combat system with some QTE-elements, nice animations, but too short and with too much of a "here is 300 as a game"-type vibe. Pick it up while on sale.","April 1","true","0.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Story is run of the mill "your family is killed, you seek revenge in rivers of blood abroad, you discover the real enemy is at home" sort of deal. Draws upon history but isn't too worried about playing fast and loose with it. Campaign isn't overly long and you can skip some of the cutscenes (helpful in the 2nd PT).\nIt is the combat and visuals where the game shines. I played on low graphics with a venerable GTX 570 and occasionally the game froze after many hours of play. That shouldn't keep you from getting the game as it handled very nicely just about all the time. It still looked great, with no lag, and very smooth combat. I can't wait to upgrade my computer with a 780 to see how far I can push the game's graphics. Gotta love Crytek putting all the other publishers to shame.\nCombat takes a little to get used to and patience is the order of the day, though your adrenaline may start pumping in the heat of battle. Stay calm and carefully time your attacks and counters as you aren't a superhuman athlete like Batman is in the Arkham games. I finished the game on Legendary (the top difficulty mode) and it was challenging but still fun. There was one section in Chapter 3 vs some archers I had to look up a solution to because it was exceptionally difficult but that's about the only complaint I have.\nCo-Op/Solo Gladiator mode looks fun and I'd like to try it out with friends once they get the game!\nIt would have been cool if Boudica looked more like Olga Kurylenko's character in the film Centurion.

Even more than the "Gladiator".\nYou can't pinpoint any dates in the game. All we know, is that the action takes place between AD 60 (when the Iceni rebellion took place) and AD 90s ( Nero, who looks in this game as an old man in his sixties, in fact died in 68 at the age of thirty).\n\nBut this is just the tip of the iceberg. Nothing in this game makes any bloody sense. Eboracum is called York, despite the modern name wasn't in use until well into Norman Period.. but that's fine, because the fortifications of York look very medieval - but don't worry, barbarians are fully equipped with advanced siege engines - so the odds are even!\n\nI could go on with countless examples of historical faux pas, but let me just say one thing:\nWhen you see Boudica riding a war elephant.. you know you reached the bottom of fanficition bucket and below there are only My Little Pony ships and HBO's Game of Thrones.\n\nNow, that said - the game is fun for what it is. It's a simplistic button-masher with QTEs (I normally don't like them, but in this game, they work fine). Combat is simple, but performing executions is very satisfying - especially if you do your QTEs right. If you won't - that's fine too, but you'll get lower bonus. There are only few, if any, moments in the game when failing a single QTEs will kill you. Fighting system lacks depth and even ability to level up your skills doesn't improve that.\n\nYou can master the combat system within one afternoon... and that is pretty much how much it will take you to finish the game, sadly.\n\nThat is a big, massive let down. The game is surprinsgly short. Chance to build up the character relations and thicken the plot is squished within experience lasting but few hours. You get bare-bones of what seems to be an interesting story arc of gods playing their games using mortals as pawns. That's pretty much the only interesting thing in this whole storyline, everything else seems to be glued together by someone who had barely any clue about writing scripts.\n\nWhile the game follows, to the letter, the Three Act Structure, it falls short on each of them - exposition leaves you clueless about what is really going on, second act fails at creating compelling character development and the climax feels artificial because you have barely any emotions towards main antagonist... whoever he might be (I'm still not sure...).\n\nAt the beginning Marius sees the Barbrians as the threat, towards mid-game you're introduced to Boudica and Oswald (... seriously? Saxon names in 1st century AD. How about Caratacus? Yeah, he wasn't Boudica's father, but we already established nobody cares about historical facts here...). And then the perspective changes - Roman leaders, sons of Nero, turn out to be half-crazy butchers and Britons start to look like people who just defend themselves from injustice. Marius goes on a rampage killing both sons of Nero and eventually goes after Nero himself..  (but not before killing Boudica leading attack on Rome) just to be introduced in the last scene to the true villain who was behind all the events  from the very start - Aquilon, god of north wind who wants to destroy "civilization" (WHAAAT?). You can see why building up emotions towards antagonists is so difficult - there are too many of them and they have too little screen time.\n\nI blame mostly the lenght of the game for all of this - given more time for Acts I and II you could have much more compelling build up to the climax - which actually feels like the most expanded part of the game, as you deal one by one with all antagonists you barely care about.\n\nRyse shines however, when it comes to voice acting - which somewhat midigates medicore (at best) plot. Game has very distinct, pleasant artstyle and atmosphere - something between Lord of the Rings and 300. Put together with great care for details, the game can make you stop and look at the world around. Graphics are very good, with superb motion capture. End result is more than just sum of it's parts - as you get extremely well executed scenes where every detail is taken care of. You can watch cut-scenes with finger over F12, making screenshots of some of the most outstanding scenes and locations.\nIt can almost make you forget the story is laughable... almost.\n\nAll in all, Ryse is a title that you should approach with low expectations towards historical fidelity and depth. It's good piece of mindless enterteiment for few hours. And that's all it really is.\n\nYou can get few more extra hours out of the game with the multiplayer and skirmishes, but all in all, the game doesn't change much - you just fight same enemies in different places with arena mechanics.\n\n\nI give the game cautious recommendation - but buy it only if it's on sale. Don't pay more than 10 dollars/euro - the game isn't worth more.\nI don't recommend it to people who are historical puritans, who loves realism and/or deep combat.","May 3","true","11.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It ran, but the fluidity of the game varied on levels and I spent periods of time looking at various options and settings. My machine should have had no problem spec wise and yet the framerate dropped when there was no clear explanation.  For the £5 I got it for, it was a bargain and if you want to try out something new then, this is it! just don't expect it to break any barriers regarding the gameplay.","February 15","false","6.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I expected the usual type of fighting game with somewhat cumbersome controls and repeating gameplay. But it turned out to be much more than this.\n\nFirst of all I would say that Ryse has the very best graphics I've seen in a video game yet. The look and realism are mindblowing all the way through. The story, although linear, is epic and exciting. The levels have predefined paths to take (so it's not open world), but are beautifully designed with lots of detail.\n\nThe combat system is easy at first, but gets more challenging as stronger enemies appear. The player won't be successful if he just keeps hitting the attack buttons like in any arbitrary ARPG. Instead, one needs to make use of blocking and perform the required actions in the right moment. Timing is essential here. In return, successful "executions" will yield a reward for the player, which depends on what he selected previously. It may be health, focus points (used for special attacks), increased damage or increased experience. The choice can be made anytime in a fight and lasts until another choice is made. This way, fighting becomes somewhat tactical too, which is a nice addition to the usual click-and-kill.\n\nAdditionally, there's not just sword fighting, but also ranged fights using a pilum (a javelin-like throwing weapon), fights to defend hordes of enemies using a ballista or even fights where the player commands a whole group of Romans to get through an enemy rain of arrows.\n\nI found the game very enjoyable, albeit a bit short (I finished it in about 8.5 hours). However, besides the single player campaign, there's also a multiplayer mode. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm sure it provides even more fun.\n\nHere's a word a warning though: The game probably isn't for you if you're highly sensitive towards violence. There's a lot of violence in this game and it's quite explicit too. Nevertheless, although a bit exaggerated, it really fits the story.\n\nAll in all, if you don't mind a linear story and maps with predefined paths to go (and if you can deal with the violence), I highly recommend this game for you. For me, it was well worth the money and I'll most likely give it a replay some day.","May 22","true","8.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

If you like quick time events, this is the game for you!\n\nI didn't even get to the technical issues. The game stutters so freaking much and just freezes for minutes at a time before it finally recovers. Even when the game is running perfectly fine, the music tends to stutter and freeze. It's just a nightmare trying to play through the game under these conditions. It’s one thing if I was using an underpowered rig, but that is nowhere near the case.

Preferably in high res!\nIn Ryse Son of Rome you play as Marius Titus. A roman soldier who fights a war against barbarians, and corruption to save Rome! OK, something like that, don't want to spoil the plot as that is one the games best features. The story is engaging, and well written, the voice acting is also great. It's rare for me to consider playing through a games campaign twice these days, but Ryse was just that good. The only fault in the story mode is that it's short, clocking in just over seven hours. The game is one of the most beautiful games I've played on PC. The level of detail to the environments is fantastic. The trees, water, and backgrounds look amazing. The music design consists of your standard background battle music. The sounds during combat are on point with swords slashing, the thud of a shield blocking, to Marius yelling battle commands. The gameplay is a blast, largely borrowed from the Arkham series's formula. But Batman never "off'd" anybody like this. During the action, you'll get a prompt where you can execute the opponent your fighting. These never got old to me. What did get old was the guys you are fighting. There was about four types of enemies, with about four different sets of costumes. This felt a little lazy due to the amount of work put into other visuals in the game. There is a leveling system where you boost skills, and acquire new executions, but this seemed a little generic. You'll have everything by the time you beat the game. There are also collectables, but again generic. The games features a multiplayer mode where you fight as Gladiator in the Coliseum. The game mode is a lot fun, but unless you have a buddy ready to play finding a match is going to be slow at best.\n\nDespite its flaws Ryse is a fantastic play through. If you enjoy ancient Rome stories, and Gladiator movies you'll like the game. However when it ends you'll be left wanting more. Worth a buy on the Steam sale.\n\nOLDER GAMER APPROVED\nVisit our Currator Page","February 8","true","9.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","3"

It had some issues on launch, but the devs worked hard to fix all of them. The keyboard and mouse bindings are good, and the FPS is consistent.\n\n- The graphics are HUGE! So much detail on the armor and the background, you will get amazed.\n\n- The gameplay is fluid. The combat is similar to Batman Arkham games, but it's still good on its own way. The executions are bloody, and very rewarding. Be aware that it can get repetitive sometimes, but if you can pass that, you will LOVE the combat system.\n\n- Good soundtrack. It is not one of the best of the gaming industry, but it reminded me of Gladiator, so sure as hell it's awesome!\n\n- The multiplayer is fun. If you have one buddy to play with you, the co-op missions are a great add-on into the game. Play on various map types, and fight your way through the BARBARIAN HORDE!!!!!! You can level up, purchase new gear and try to become the most powerful gladiator the has ever stepped on the Colosseum.\n\n\nLong story short, the game is not perfect, but if you like the Rome theme, if you enjoy bloody and fluid combat, good storytelling and awesome soundtrack, get this game now!    9/10\n\n\n","October 11, 2014","true","34.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Man! I felt like I was a roman warrior myself. The combat is really nice and cool looking.

With it getting 4's and 6's  around I just thought it was a flop, but a friend of mine played it and he rather enjoyed it.\n\nSo a couple weeks back steam had it on sale for 6 bucks, so I figured why not and purchased it, as a impulse buy.  I played it through to the end and was shocked how much I enjoyed it. The combat was ok, I agree with some it was a little to cinimatic to me at times, but just wrecking the enimies face through out the game was great. I also liked the parts where you formed a line to break through the enimies defence made me feel like I was a roman soilder. The story itself was good and I enjoyed it through the game.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with it, was the length, I beat it in about 6 and a half hours or so. I didn't go look for all the collectibles or anything I just played the main story, so it may add some more time to it but not much.\n\nSo over all I'd give it a 8/10 and was worth the playthrough, it was nice to be a roman for awhile and wreck face. I guess it goes to show that just cause a game gets bad reviews doesn't mean you won't like it.","March 3","true","7.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Then it slaps you in the face with it's cash shop system to add insult to injury.\n\nPROS\n-Fast paced action combat\n-Stylish Executions\n\nCONS\n-Combat is repetitive\n-Executions are repetitive\n-Camera is god awful\n-Auto Targeting System sucks\n-Combat is imbalanced\n-Poor upgrade system\n-Spikes in Difficulty\n-Game has pay2win mechanics\n-Performance Issues\n\nSTORY\n\nWhat story?  The story is so generic & poorly written it might as well not even exist.  You're a soldier & you kill barbarians in the name of Rome & yada yada yada nobody cares that your family was killed by invading barbarians that somehow broke into the biggest & most heavily guarded city in the world.  Also you get stalked by some glowing ghost lady who probably wants your seed.  Moving on.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay consists of timed button presses during combat. X attacks with your sword, Y attacks with your shield (for some reason you can't block with it) & A parries incoming attacks.  First thing you'll notice when playing is you can't block with your shield during combat.  You can only parry attacks.  You can roll dodge with B which is needed to avoid heavy attacks. The parry system doesn't seem like an issue except they made the combat system mostly for 1v1 but enemies will attack you in groups & you can't really parry more than one attack at a time even if they're coming from the same general direction. You can but it rarely seems to work.  So, if you got multiple incoming attacks you're pretty much forced to dodge because if you try anything else you'll take damage.  It's like they designed the combat with the Batman games as a reference except they completely neglected what made those games combat so good in the first place.\n\nAlso, no button mashing.  If you do you'll quickly realize how much fun an axe to the back can be and there will be plenty of axes to your back because the auto targeting system is god awful.  Rarely will I ever be able to target the enemy I want to attack & when I finally manage that two more enemies get behind me forcing me to roll & then the target will auto swap to something else & it just... Can't you just trust the player to target the enemies on their own?  When you manage to get the hang of this games combat it is pretty fun at first.  Later on though it just gets tiresome as the game just throws more & more enemies at you.  They get bigger & deal more damage but you for some reason don't.  And the upgrades you get don't really increase your damage by a large enough amount to help.\n\nThat's when I noticed this big difficulty spike during an escort mission.  It's one where you need to save soldiers from burning alive in cages but you can only save them when you kill torch wielders.  Why can't I just save them right away?  Because the game won't let you.  This wouldn't be a big deal if the torchers didn't sprint away from you every chance they have while every other enemy in the dozen you're fighting is keeping you off of him.  The auto targeting system is the worst part about this particular mission as it will never target the torch guys first & the camera will never show where they're hiding.  It's like playing hide & seek in a burning house & that house is also full of bandits attacking you.  This mission alone changed my view of the game from mediocre to down right negative.  It's almost like they designed this mission to be bothersome on purpose to get you to spend money on buying upgrades because no other mission thus far was designed this way.\n\nThe absolute worst part about this game is the camera.  Half the screen is always taken up by your back.  I wish I was joking.  The camera does zoom out during combat but even still I always manage to end up being attacked by someone off screen in almost every fight.  It's god dam disgraceful really.  Fricking N64 games have better cameras than this game does.\n\nThe only thing this game has going for it is executions.  These are activated when an enemy has a skull above his head.  When you activate it goes into a QTE animation filled with gory goodness.  That's really the only thing I can find in the game that I enjoy.  Everything else is abysmal or worse.\n\nThere are segments in the game where you command soldiers in a formation but it's really just a Block or Throw Spear sequence.  You block incoming arrows & throw spears when there's an opening.  That's pretty much it.\n\nCASH SHOP\n\nThen even worse, the game employs a cash shop system.  Sure, you can buy upgrades for points but later down the line it requires a huge chunk of points for a single upgrade.  One upgrade I bought was only 10k but the next one after that was frigging 30k.  Another jumped from 20k to 60k & I'm not even halfway up the upgrade path yet.  They obviously want you to buy this crap with real currency or something & that's just a giant middle finger to anyone who buys the game at full price.  Even the multiplayer is full of these cash shop upgrades.  This was a $60 game when it first came out on Xbone so why in the hell are you monetizing the ♥♥♥♥ out of it like this?  If I didn't buy this game on a sale I'd refund the dam thing right now.\n\nPerformance Issues\n\nCryengine isn't really a PC friendly game engine.  I had constant FPS drops on normal/low settings & it's unplayable on my older machine.  Don't even bother buying this if you have an old PC or a budget rig.\n\nOVERALL\n\nThe game is just a slap in the face.  It has a repetitive combat system that is generally unfair due to it's design.  It's like playing a Batman game if that game was unresponsive & you were unable to parry multiple enemies properly.  Doesn't help that enemy attacks seem to track you accross the screen either.  Then the camera issues just make the combat even worse & the auto aim system is terrible.  Then there's the middle finger to anyone who paid full price in the cash shop & how the game is designed to make you either grind hours at end game for an upgrade or pay some more real money for it.  Just... No.  Then the worst part is the game runs on Cryengine so it runs like utter garbage. Don't even bother buying this if it's not on a good sale.  I sure didn't.","March 31","false","3.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It has a great story, and decent voice acting to go with it. The combat is a little repetitive, and I'll admit that it seems a little short, plus it crashed on me several times (I also had to play it in windowed mode, running an ATI card) but damn, I'll admit that by the end, I certainly left the game feeling like I had got my money's worth, and was totally blown away with the environments, and animation.\n\nPut it this way: Ryse is a revenge movie/game, set in Rome. It's a like a big summer pop-corn blockbuser: bigger than life, in your face, and full of spectacle. Do you like Rome? Do you like special effects? Do you like action stories? Do you want to feel like the hero of an amazing action story? If you do, you'll probably be more than happy with what Ryse has to offer.\n\nI didn't even attempt to bother with the multiplayer, so I can't say anything about that side of it.","December 28, 2014","true","7.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It combines fluid fighting of Batman "Arkham" style games with viceral gore of being a gladiator/centurion of Roman empire. Executions that performed on every enemy once certain amount of damage is done to them are numerous and varied, from single to double executions to environment executions, counting probably around 50 different kinds, although some will get repetetive after a while.\n\nAdditional challenge can be found in solo and 2 player arenas, however, once enough levels and equipment is gathered through random in-game currency purchases (earn gold in arena -> purchase a booster that contains guarantied 3 items of certain quality -< repeat), the arena becomes a bit too east. Without scalable challenge, interest will wane quickly.\n\nHowever, survival mode (2 player only) pits you against unlimited enemies in 7 different arenas (most of them are ill suited for the purpose, but still very challenging) with a task to survive as long as possible while your health drains. At first, surviving past 10 minutes is a challenge, but with good equipment, 27+ minutes are possible and more skilled people will go far beyond that.\n\nGame is extremely easy to learn but relatively hard to master. Visual rollercoster, great andrenaline rush.\n\nIf you ever wanted to be a Gladiator, this is it.","August 2, 2015","true","50.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Immediately caught my eye because of the beautifull graphics and the setting. (I'm a big 'swords & sandals' fan) So therefor will this review not be 100% objectively, my apologies.\n\nFirst thing I do before buying a game is reading it's current reviews, as I did with this game. Most of them were positive with a few rotten apples ofcourse. The thing that bothered me the most at the time was the lenght of the game. Roughly 6 - 8 hours to complete the campaign on Centurion Difficulty.\n\nPeople suggested to buy the game only when it was on sale meanly for that reason. Thanks to our Savior Gabe we have big sales. So I descided to buy the game.\n\nMy conclusion:\n\nYes, it's a short game. But the best way to describe it is, a hell of a rollorcoaster ride! Beautifull cutscenes, evoirements, smooth combat executions. Very enjoyable online options (arena, lvling up, gearing up). I've had a great time playing this game even though it was short. But I rather have a short good exciting game, than a long dull boring game that I can't seem to finish.\n\nSo if you are looking for a good time for let's say a stormy day. This is your game ! Fast cool action, cool story, and Romans!\n\nI hope you will like this game as much as I did, see you in the arena Gladiator !","December 29, 2015","true","6.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It was released on November 22, 2013 as a launch title for the Xbox One and was probably one of the reasons why I wanted an Xbox One badly, but after the reviews came in my hype went down and was released on October 10, 2014 for Microsoft Windows and I picked it up later on.\n\nPlot\n\nRyse: Son of Rome is set in an an alternate version of Rome. The game begins with a tutorial section in the middle of the story, with Roman general Marius Titus leading the defense of Rome against oncoming Celtic barbarians led by Boudica. Marius hands a small, nondescript sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display it from an elevated position, then helps secure the Roman emperor, Nero, in a private safe room. At the emperor's behest he begins to tell his story; the rest of the game is an extended flashback depicting Marius' adventures up to this point.\n\nGameplay\n\nRyse: Son of Rome is an action-adventure hack and slash game played in a third-person perspective. Players assume control of Marius Titus, a Roman general who is on a quest to take revenge for his murdered family. Throughout the game, players gain access to weapons that can be used to assault enemies or defend themselves. For instance, players are equipped with a sword that can be used to strike and kill enemies, and a shield that can be used to deflect enemies' attack and break their defense. The strength of each attack can be decided by players (though there are two levels of it). In addition to melee-based combat, the game features spears and javalins, which serve as ranged weapons, but are completely boring to use.\n\nIs this game worth a purchase?\n\nWell, honestly, I don't know what to say. This game is repetitive, short, unoptimized, but with beautiful graphics. Do the graphics justify the purchase? Nope, they don't. With all being said, I really enjoyed the game. There were a couple of sessions where I played it for 3 hours straight (Which is a rare thing for such a linear game). Well, to conclude my review, I'll say this - you should get this game if you meet these requirments- you have a PC that is above the recommend specifications for this game and this gave costs no more than 10 dollars/euros - then it's a good adventure for it's buck.\n6/10","January 4","true","8.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Combat is incredibly repetitive, verging on frustrating and tedious. There are a small variety of enemies, which is fine, but one thing that niggles at me is the lack of variety of player models. You can be in combat with 4 enemies at the same time who all look exactly the same.\n\nThe ranged combat is frustrating, having to scrabble around the area to try and find spears to throw at the enemy archers before your Romans get the crap kicked out of them. Which is another point; you are some form of high ranking Roman officer yet seem to be in a one man army. You'll get rid of five enemies to turn around and see that your soldiers are still limp-wristedly slapping the same barbarians with their swords that they were at the beginning of the fight.\n\nExecuting an enemy is pretty fun, but the way it has been done involves you clicking either the left or the right mouse button in accordance with whatever colour the enemy is glowing. But the game doesn't punish you if you press the wrong button, simply lowering the amount of XP you get from the kill. You could smash your face on the keyboard and still flawlessly cut down the barbarian chieftain in a series of sword strokes.\n\nI only want to play the game now to complete it and see the end. The story is vaguely compelling, but nowhere near captivating.\n\nThe cutscenes are breathtaking though, and are the only reason I'm recommending the game.","December 3, 2014","true","7.1"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","0"

It is a beautiful game that has its flaws as many games generally do. The pros outweigh the cons. I was engaged to the story to a certain extent and the combat was enjoyable only in the beginning then it became ridiculously repetitive. Enemy models were the same throughout the campaign but regardless, the story kept me going and the visuals were fantastic. The soundtrack is nothing fantastic and I doubt it is memorable. I can't recommend Ryse at full price but I would definitely recommend it at half the price. Multiplayer was also great, although I havent played enough of it to know if it gets as boring as the combat in the campaign. There are way too many rome stories nowadays so if you recently saw a movie or read a book or whatever, take a break from it so as not to be turned off by what this game offers. It certainly is not groundbreaking in terms of writing but you can't miss it.\n\n6/10 best benchmark for your PC","January 25, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With that aside, the enviroment was crafted with so much effort and care that the attention to detail truly shines. The campaign features Rome as a struggling but bustling civilization, and the lush, eerie, and hostile forested outskirts of Britannia, the land of the Barbarians. In Multiplayer you won't see campaign settings being recycled, which is refreshing, instead you are given completely new settings, such as maps based in Egypt, those maps featuring sharpingly-detailed obelisks and heiroglyphics and even into the burning realm of Hades. The story wasn't as lacking as it was made out to be, and even hyped me up at one point near the end - fueling on the rampage that is Marius Titus.\n\nMultiplayer Co-op is fun, too, which includes survival mode, campaigns, ranking up, a nice set of achievements, and unlocking armors and weapons while championing different Roman Gods such as Jupiter, Mars, Diana, and Apollo. The downsides to the multiplayer is how it's design could've been approached. There are only four gods available to fill the role of champion for, and you can change your deity every match. What's negative about that is you can only unlock one unique item per deity, and there isn't more of either, which Roman mythology is bustling with dozens of gods and goddesses and have no lack of mythical weapons and armor. There could've been much more there, but it's still fun to Co-op play it with a buddy. There also isn't a way to communicate with whoever you're playing with.\n\nAdditions they could've added to Multiplayer for more playability and overall better experience:\n- Daily Tasks(Contracts, Missions, you choose) in the Colosseum, rewarding the Hero gold for 'x' executions done, parries made, focus gained, campaigns done, survival time achieved, etc.\n- Additional Deities, with tiered weapon and armor unlocks for each.\n- Legendary Items from Roman mythology, which can be acquired from high level Booster Packs.\n- More stat bonuses, possibly granting abilites from special Items; A shield that automatically deflects arrows, a sword that never fails to parry a power attack, a chestpiece that keeps you alive once from a death blow, a helmet that highlights an enemy who is getting ready to make an attack towards you, a pair of greaves that extend your sprint time, a pair of handguards that extend your combo-to-combo downtime, etc. Come on CryTek, let's make the player value their character a bit more.\n\n7.5/10","February 1, 2015","true","29.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Storyline was not special, boring, not realistic. When i was buing this game i was thinking it gona be a real rome battles like history says. It was some moment when you are mowing in cohort, but almost all game you was fighting alone. Figthing with Britons on elephnants? Not realistic. I coud say more about that but i dont wanna spoilers here. It was of course some positive aspects like a beatiful graphics, music and some cool missions. Game have very big potencial and i got some fun when i was playing, but it was nothing special. 6/10\n\nMultiplayer: This is a good masterpiece. Playing a gladiator in coloseum, gatering money, experience. It is alot of diffrent arenas, much kind of games like a survival, round to round, solo. Exelent system of executions. After getting big level and much money you can buy for yourself a difrent armors to each body parts and being more powerful and look badass. I was spending much time playing solo and with my friends on survival. 10/10\n\nI think it was some thinks (like a executions system) looks beter in multiplayer then in sigleplayer.\nMy final rating for this game is 8/10 and i recomend to buy this game because multiplayer is worth it.","February 13, 2015","true","35.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although even if some of the settings that I've pull down the graphics still stands out. The controls are good too its a hack and slash game with a little bit of a QTE in the middle. The story in the campaign is also good if you love the history of the Roman Empire and put yourself in the shoe's of an elite Roman Soldier as a protector of the Emperor then this I would recommend you to play it.

Gladiator arenas surprised me, I didn't know it had that. It can compare to PS2 Colloseum Road to Freedom, just with much better graphics. I am also a big fan of ancient Rome, so there is a bias there. Game does get repetitive, but graphics and challenge (high combos) can make up for it.

Levels go quicker once you learn how the dynamic works, and is always exciting to open your newly aquired equipment!\n- Acheivements are attainable and don't require any grinding\n- Can unlock attributes that allow you to play the game your way as you go\n\nCons:\n- I really can't think of any "con" for this game, *especially on sale*.  What I will say is the campaign is not very long - 6 hours maybe?  But I enjoyed it immensely.  The game only crashed once for me after a very long session.  The multiplayer is not very populated, but there are always lots of people in the discussion boards to play with - or buy it with a friend and play! Sidenote - you can also do the multiplayer stuff as a solo session to get yourself some upgrades while you find a teammate - I also recommend starting the campaign first to learn how to Ryse before going straight to MP.\n\nNone of these are really cons for me, so I say go for it and enjoy!","March 3","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics detail is superb enjoying it on my i5 4670K, GTX 970 and a 1440p everything is maxed out but I needed to pull down some settings just to achieve smooth graphics in the long run. Although even if some of the settings that I've pull down the graphics still stands out. The controls are good too its a hack and slash game with a little bit of a QTE in the middle. The story in the campaign is also good if you love the history of the Roman Empire and put yourself in the shoe's of an elite Roman Soldier as a protector of the Emperor then this I would recommend you to play it.

While this sounds really negative and might convince you not to buy this game is understandable, but hear me out for a sec.\n\nI definitly don't recommend this game for the full price. Buy it in a sale when it's really cheap, because most people won't make it past 10 hours of playtime (this includes the whole singleplayer storyline).\n\nHowever for some achievementhunters like myself, the game (and definitly the multiplayer stuff) might stay fun for a longer time. In my opinion the multiplayer arenas were fun for a while, but the challenges stay the same so they can get boring fast. The only part of this game I really enjoyed was the survival co-op gamemode, it's quite challenging and can really test your skill. It's only unfortunate that it's the least popular gamemode or it takes the longest to pair me at least.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game however is how it bugs out all the time and it doesn't do what you want or the camera gets stuck in weird angles or the animations take longer than they seem to (but maybe that's some lagg from my computer). And these problems only get worse if you play on legendary mode. Normally you can play the game at an easy pace, but on legendary mode (when you're threatened a lot of the time and your moves are more critical) it bugged me a lot how it seemed the game was screwing me.\n\nSo yeah, to end this review I'll say that overal I enjoyed playing this game and will play some more co-op in the future. Most of my problems were with the singleplayer and legendary mode, although the story itself is pretty decent (only really short). Another problem could be that the gameplay is a bit repetitive, but this will depend from person to person. So I DO recommend this game, only not at full price!\n\nThank you for reading.","February 19","true","54.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It took me about 7 hours to complete and I usually take my time so it's not very long. The best thing about the gameplay is that the fights didn't last long enough for me to get frustrated with the reptition (I don't take too kindly to long battles with repetitive play just to have a long battle).\n\nThe sound is good and the graphics are nice but it seems a bit demanding. I ran it at 1440p with a mix of high/normal settings, AA and super sampling disabled, on a GTX 970 and it was fine but it did have some stutters. I typically run games in full-screen mode with no issues, but for Ryse I had to run it in borderless windowed mode to keep from having performance issues. That was really the only problem, otherwise the game worked fine.\n\nI'd say that the best part of the game was the story, it is put together well and has good foreshadowing that you recognize later in the game. There are some bits I don't completely understand but at the end I drew my own real conclusion.\n\nRyse kinda reminds me of how games were back in the days before gigantic stories and 40+ hour play times were common; it is short and to the point.","January 25","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The finishing moves are nice and you can unlock more as you go along.\n\nThe main campaign only lasted about 6 hours but i am happy with that, all these recent games boasting 100s of hours of game play get boring really fast because its basically the same thing over and over.

The sound and voice acting in game is also top notch.\n\nMy only really gripe about the game is the people you fight against are all basically clones, they could haev done a bit more work there and made a ton of variations.. different hiars styles, tattoos and so on.\n\nAnyway this is well worth picking up if you are looking for a short but enjoyable game.\n\n\nI knid of hope the devs do something based on Vikings next and expans the combat system a bit more :)","January 31, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The themes and gameplay are rather harsh for anyone not somewhat used to violent media.\n\nRyse tells the tragic story of a roman soldier named Marius who loses his family to barbarians, and then proceeds to kill a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of barbarians.\n\nI don't like sad stories, and it almost made me uncomfortable how gruesome the executions are. The entire game is masked with a true sense of dread.\n\nThe combat is repetitive but I feel powerful while playing. The executions and heavy amounts of blood make for a savage experience.\n\nThe game's Focus Mode (slo-mo combat) is freakin sweet, although I've seen it in a few other games.\n\nRyse just feels one-tone and generic. The voice acting and graphics are stellar, but playing the game makes me feel bad and I don't enjoy games that do this.\n\nI feel like when they killed my dude's family that it happened far to early to mean anything. The story should have been drawn out and had some positive elements, as it is currently a generic Roman tragedy.\n\nI've heard the story is 6-11 hours long, and I honestly don't want to sit through a game this depressing. It was fun for a while though! Pick it up on sale if it looks appealing to you.\n\n\nTL;DR: I am uncomfortable playing Ryse: Son of Rome. The violence seems unnecessarily brutal, and there was no clear motivation for me to be slaughtering barbarians by the hundreds. I loved the graphical fidelity and the voice acting, however one-note the story may be. Pick up the game on sale sometime if you like revenge stories or gladiator fights.

This game is not bad, but it's not great either. I'd recommend it if it's on sale. Graphics are nice, the story is fairly standard, nothing original or extremely creative. It's a story about vengeance and betrayal. Combat is basically a series of QTE. If you like that sort of thing, like in the Batman Arkham series games, then this will feel pretty similar, but without all the stealth and non-lethal take downs. Here you rush into combat, stab, slash, dismember, and behead your enemies. You're a brutal killing machine. There's an awful lot of Deus ex machina here too. You don't get to really die until the gods are satisfied that you've fulfilled your destiny. But really, that's the case with any non-rogue-hard-core game. Unless you have perma death, you've got an effectiv d-e-m. So anyway, hack and slash your way to vengeance and look at the pretty scenery then see it all turn red as the defeated enemies ruin the sight seeing. I enjoyed my time playing this but was not compelled to play again or go through and really grind out any extra achievments.","May 27","true","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There were a few things that bothered me, but, overall it was done very well. The ending also left me satisfied. It should be said this game isn't based on real life events or history. There are characters that appear that also appear in our history, but they are not accurate to our history. Nero for example wasn't an old man. He died young in real life. Boudica as another example never left the Britain isles let alone invade Rome. If you can look past the historical inaccuracies it is pretty satisfying.\n\nGAMEPLAY: (3/5) Here is where I start to have some problems with the game. I'm not really a fan of QTE's and this game has a lot of them jam packed pretty much everywhere. If you have an extreme hatred of QTEs then you might want to consider giving this game a hard pass because you won't enjoy yourself. However, with all of that said the combat IS satisfying. Pulling off complex combos to large groups of enemies is a lot of fun. The caveat is that by the end of the game it becomes a bit stale. Another thing I didn't like is the multiplayer... or should I say lack thereof. It's dead. AS. A. DOORNAIL. I spent 5 - 10 minutes searching for a match and never was paired with anyone so I gave up and played a few solo matches in the arena. If multiplayer is your thing and you are considering buying this game for multiplayer DON'T. You will be completely disappointed.\n\nSOUND: (4/5) Good atmospheric sounds and music accompanied all the stages. I'm not a super big audiophile so I won't get into a large amount of detail, but it sounded great to me. I didn't really see any problems.\n\nGRAPHICS: (5/5) The graphics for this game are simply amazing. The lighting affects and the atmosphere of the different stages were top notch. I experienced no tearing or framerate issues, though I have seen some people post about them in the Steam discussions. I can only give you my experiences and my experience was pretty near flawless in the graphical department.\n\nREPLAY VALUE: (2/5) Not really much replay value in this game in my opinion once you beat the game. You can redo it Legendary Difficulty if you want or try and do some multiplayer if you can find anyone to play with. That's it. I'm finding myself getting bored after beating the game and I cannot find any multiplayer matches so i'm pretty much done after this review is finished.\n\nDO I RECOMMEND?: Yes, but conditionally. I wouldn't recommend this at full price. Wait for a sale of at least 50%. I got my copy for $5 and I consider it money well spent. If you can do the same I recommend buying it for the 5 - 10 hours of gameplay you will squeeze from it before moving onto something else.","April 6","true","8.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Surely, all the fighting you do in this game will consist out of quicktime events, yet in my opinion that is not a bad aspect at all. Playing through all these quicktimes, which end in pretty sweet combat finishers, creates a deep immersion into the combat. You nearly feel like you are there, like you are truely fighting rather than pointless clicking.\n\nBesides that, the storyline is quite well written. It might be a cliché, vengeance, but it calls forth lots of sympathy for the main-character. There is also the strong bond with your fellow legionaries, and the epic speeches that make the hairs in your neck stand up. Mix a rather splendid plottwist into that, and your tale is complete. And of cource, there are all kinds of bonusobjects to find withing the game, which require some wandering off the obvious path.\n\nGreat game, whether you are into the Roman theme or not.","May 3","true","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story is well written and i loved the atmosphere and general environment of the world along with the simple yet enjoyable combat mechanics.\nMany gamers rubbished this game as it was too simple in combat and too repetitive with regards to enemies and fight strategy but if you like the old school type games where timing and speed where used instead of long combos or magic keybound spells and you were then rewarded with great cut scenes, then you will love the playthrough of this game.\nIf bought for 20$ or under it is a great deal and will give you value for money with an eye popping 8 hours of gameplay which is very entertaining.\nStrengths are the 4K RES - I have a high end PC rig like all real gamers so it looked very polished, not sure how it looks and runs on the New Gen consoles PS4 etc.\nOnly weak point is the shortness of the game at about 8 hours in length but as the game is not complex or hard to pick up the length is pretty well suited unless like me you could have happily played another 8 hours of new content.","October 20, 2014","true","8.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Ryse can be a simple hack and slay game if you play it on low difficulty. But if you play the game on legendary you find yourself in a whole different situation. You have to know your enemies and use perfect timing to survive and the experience will be intense. However you choose to play Ryse is fun!\n\nFrom a historic point of view the story is nonsense. British barbarians never raided Rome on elephants - nope, just never happened. But that's probably just because they simply could not catch those island elephants. They are so good at hiding in the fog. If you take the story as a fantasy and do not mind that the Colosseum was build after Nero's lifetime the story is very enjoyable. I did not expect this from crytec because in my opinion the story in crysis sucked. But nowadays more and more game studios turn to the help of comic writers for the stories. Comics become scripts for games - which is great - and the fact that Ryse does include a comic lets me assume crytec did the same thing.\n\nThe biggest surprise in this game is the multi-player. While it looks as gorgeous as the rest of the game it gives you the chance to fight hordes of enemies in co-op mode. It's amazing. You can earn gold in the arenas and improve your characters abilities and gear.\n\nRyse, Son of Rome is probably not for everyone. You need to like the ancient Roman setting and fighting games.

THIS is how "next gen" needs to look.\n\n*Apologies for this short rant, but...* Personally, I'm sick of reviewers bashing this game's unique (and honestly pretty good) combat, while singing high praises to every other hack and slash game out there that simply rips off Batman's system - and we wonder why there's less and less innovation in games?

The game is very much move from A to B and kill a lot of guys in between with a few "on rails" segments thrown in that follow a very predictable pattern. As you can see by my play time it is a short game and even on the highest difficulty from the start it is very easy and never really becomes challenging throughout the rest of the game. The story is kinda meh and the weapons are not varied enough for the combat. You always use a sword and shield and throw a spear as your extra weapon(I get that it is Rome and you are a Commander, but it still would have been nice to lose your shield or something and have to fight with a sword or with your fists at some point).\n\nThe MP is co-op and pretty cool as it is basically you and a friend or random in the Coliseum and you survive as long as you can with some varied objectives or you beat it, level up and then do it all over again, but it does not have enough "meat" to hold your attention for long.\n\nObviously this is a Crytek game because they graphics are top notch and like any Crytek game, the story and gameplay is subpar so go in with little expectations and you will have fun.","January 29, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first time I played it was on Centurian, then on Legendary. The story is a little short but it is great and has some pretty eipc moments. One of the biggest mistakes people say about the storyline is that it is bad because it is predictable. I guess you might guess some parts of it. however, this is not because it is just a predictable game, it does a little foreshadowing. The reason why this is different is because foreshadowing gives the plot some spice to it, where a predictable game usually is just cliched stuff and basically cliche ending. The fighting might feel a bit repetitive, so to counter this I would suggest buying new finishers. Graphics are great, and do not need too powerful of a system to play. Gladiator mode is good, however would get boring unless playing with friends.

Blood is not so realistic, but it gets the job done.\n\nAll that said, there are a few down sides.\n\nFor starters, the storyline is a bit short and predictable.

Well Ryse gave me what i wanted, to some extend.\n\nWell, lets start with the story.\nAfter seeing what drove your character Marius to become the best damn soldier of the roman empire was kinda ... boring. Even cliché. The vengeance sorta story. It was OK, but not really moving.\nAfter playing through 3/4 of the game, the story really picked up. It still wasn't really a story written by Bioware, but especially the end had some interesting twists and scenes.\n\nThe graphics look really good. One of the best i ever saw. In the end the game was made by Crytek. I never expected anything less from them.\nThe animations are well made. They are mostly fluent when fighting. Although some are too fast. Still, the fighting animations are one of the best i saw. Every hit you receive or deal has this "impact" to it. Never lived to that time (thank god ;D) but the sword fights feel authentic. If you don't count some finishers after you are in that beast mode.\n\nThe overall mechanics are well made. The pilum (throwing spear) mechanics have an autolock to it. So if you are playing with a gamepad, it gets much easier. The fighting itself is very easy to learn, but still ahrd to master. You actually use like 5 keys. One to block, one to attack, one to use or pick up weapons, one to dodge and one to activate your finisher. Those few buttons are perfect to use a gamepad. I highly recommend using one. Nonetheless the fighting gets way to repetitive. There is nothing else. You rund and fight.\n\nI have to say that i didn't really expected a lot of the game. but after i heard that Marius would be a Centurion, i thought i could really command my men, but the game hardly lets you. Yes, you hear here and there Marius throwing out some commands or you are in a Testudo (Roman formaton). While being in a Testudo is great, it is way to easy and boring. You only move forward, block arrows and throw pilums. Why not letting me and my men engage some melee? That would have beed cooler. Despite the boring mechancis, i really appreciate that the devs put something like that in at all. It gives you at least a little feeling of the roman era.\n\nThe enemies are boring. You have about 5 different ones. Shielded ones, the easy ones, the dual blade wielders, the beserks and the archers. After fighting ten of each of them they start to bore you out. There aren't really enough skins to give at least some variety. This way you fight in 6 of 8 level the same enemies over and over again.\n\nThe overall gametime. Yea. I just played through the campaign. 6 hours is weak. Why not expanding it a bit, Why not visiting other areas of the roman empire? Would have helped with the enemy variety as well.\n\nI recommend it . I really do. Despite its repetitive gameplay and overall QTE events, it is still a decent game.\n","March 13, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Granted this was from the console version, and of late most console ports have been less then promising.  Needless to say I am pleasant suprised, and found the game a very entertaining distratction.  The combat system is very similar to the Batman Arkham games, and is suprisingly easy to get into.  My only complaint is there are some issues with the keyboard and mouse controls which does lead into some embarssing situations during combat.\n\nGraphically it is well detailed and a very good looking game, with some animation issues being the only complaint here, now one serious side note is that it uses colour halo to highlight your targets and to inform you which button you need to use.  While this does make it more immersive then other games that rely on QTEs, this can be an issue for those with any degree of colour blindess.  Please bare this in mind before purchasing this game, otherwise I do recommend this game.","January 30, 2015","true","30.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the reliance on quick-time events may frustrate some, the game's need for precision to maintain combos and get good scores will keep your fingers flying anyway. The lack of magical counter icons over enemies means that you actually kind of need to pay attention during combat, and it remains brutally satisfying hours into the experience.\n\nIt's not the longest experience, nor is it historically accurate, but it's one hell of a ride if your computer can run it.","October 14, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shotgunteddy/recommended/302510/","shotgunteddy","Shotgun Teddy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shotgunteddy/","121 products in account","This games combat system is amazingly fun. The executions and bloody combat intertwines flawlessly & seamlessly. This game would be 10/10 if it weren't so historically incorrect. I have to give it 8/10 due to that. The graphics and gameplay are 10/10, the story-line on the other hand, makes me shudder, and this is simply because I enjoy Roman-Greco history and study it as a pass-time. If you care nothing for history, then this will make no difference to you, although on a personal note: You should care!\n\nSo much historical inaccuracies and nonsense go on in this game that its difficult to keep count. For example, the fact that barbarian tribes from Britain somehow domesticated and gained control of elephants (?????) is ludicrous. Apart from the fact that elephants don't LIVE in the UK or anywhere in Europe, it is well known that Brittanic armies never invaded Rome with or without elephants, and it is also well known that this feat was accomplished by Hannibal Barca of Carthage, some 150 years before hand (C.218 BC), who crossed the alps with his Carthaginian army and elephants.\n\nBoudica's rebellion was quashed in England by the Roman Governor, at the time Gaius Suetonius Paulinus (who by the way commanded the XIV legion as well as detachments of the XX), in Londinium (London) not Yorke, around while the game makes the rebellion take place in Yorke. This all happened between 60-61AD. After-which Boudica died either from suicide or illness. At the time Nero was indeed the emperor, but his depiction in the game is also nonsense, as there are many statues and busts depicting Nero and he was not a fat old man as depicted (Google it). Nero also had no sons, nor could he have ever witnessed galditorial matches in the colosseum considering that the colosseum was not constructed until the reign of Titus Vespasian around 70-80AD, after Nero's death! Furthermore, the protagonists name is completely incorrect and makes no sense when taking into account real roman names. Every Roman had the name of his gens or tribe (nomen), his personal name (praenomen), and his family name (cognomen). The protagonist's name is "Marius Titus", which is backwards. Titus is a praenomen (first name) and Marius is a cognomen (last name/family name). It would be like saying "Hi, my name is Kennedy John".\n\nREGARDLESS.... this games combat is insanely good and addicting. I only wish it was historically correct, and that they added an extra game-mode where you can simply play in the Colosseum against the computer AI for as long as you want. Sort of like in Arkham City where you can play the extra combat matches. You're only allowed to do the campaign or play Multiplayer matches, which is great, if there were more people who played! There's also no side tutorial where you can hone your skills against dumb AI, you sort of just have to learn as you play. Not to mention the campaign is fairly short, you can beat it in a day probably.\n\n8/10 (just due to the historical inaccuracies).","January 18, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Follows the whole, nobody to very important somebody, storyline. Also, the story didn't seem to leave an impression. Other then vengance, you don't really create a bond with any of the characters.

Well Ryse gave me what i wanted, to some extend.\n\nWell, lets start with the story.\nAfter seeing what drove your character Marius to become the best damn soldier of the roman empire was kinda ... boring. Even cliché. The vengeance sorta story. It was OK, but not really moving.\nAfter playing through 3/4 of the game, the story really picked up. It still wasn't really a story written by Bioware, but especially the end had some interesting twists and scenes.\n\nThe graphics look really good. One of the best i ever saw. In the end the game was made by Crytek. I never expected anything less from them.\nThe animations are well made. They are mostly fluent when fighting. Although some are too fast. Still, the fighting animations are one of the best i saw. Every hit you receive or deal has this "impact" to it. Never lived to that time (thank god ;D) but the sword fights feel authentic. If you don't count some finishers after you are in that beast mode.\n\nThe overall mechanics are well made. The pilum (throwing spear) mechanics have an autolock to it. So if you are playing with a gamepad, it gets much easier. The fighting itself is very easy to learn, but still ahrd to master. You actually use like 5 keys. One to block, one to attack, one to use or pick up weapons, one to dodge and one to activate your finisher. Those few buttons are perfect to use a gamepad. I highly recommend using one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagorak/recommended/302510/","nagorak","Nagorak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagorak/","112 products in account","The game is good for what it is, but realize what it is: a linear, hack and slash title.  It's also not that long, but that's not necessarily a negative, given the nature of the game.  My overall rating for the game is 7/10.  It was definitely worth the $10 I paid for it, and I think it wouldn't be a terrible buy for even $20, but I wouldn't pay any more than that.\n\nOn paper it seems like I'd hate the game since it's a pretty repetitive hack and slasher, but somehow it ends up being more than the sum of its parts.  I thought the combat did a good job of capturing the brutal and visceral nature of close combat.  It was fun enough to play, even if it was pretty repetitive.  The story was also solid, and I think that helped the game a lot.  It held your attention and kept you motivated to fight through each part.  Had the story been bad, I'm not sure how enjoyable the overall game would have been.\n\nThe graphics were also pretty good, and felt like they captured the feeling of ancient Rome, although at some points the architecture was pretty clearly exaggerated compared to reality.  The environments are definitely not 100% historically accurate, but I could accept the areas where creative license was taken.  The Arena section, in particular, was pretty cool.  The levels were all totally linear, but that seemed to work alright for this game.\n\nThe upgrade system to me seemed like it served very little purpose.  In my opinion, you might as well have automatically leveled up.  I bought upgrades throughout the game, and they probably helped, but nothing I purchased had an obvious impact on the game play.  I didn't even spend all my exp toward the end of the game, as I simply forgot to do so, and it really didn't seem to make much difference (granted at that point I was already pretty upgraded).  It just seemed odd to me that they went to such effort to add an XP system, but then didn't really do much with it.\n\nLengthwise the game was pretty short.  I estimate that it only took me about 6 - 6.5 hours to play through.  Steam says 7 hours, but I know there was some AFK time in there.  That being said, I think the length was actually a positive, because the game play could not have held my interest for more than another hour or two.  If the game was 8 hours instead of 6, I doubt I'd have gone away with such a positive impression.\n\nOverall, my biggest complaint is I feel the game could have been so much more than what it was.  I think they had a solid core idea with the combat, and the story/setting, but they should have expanded on it somehow.  I'm not sure exactly what direction I think they should have taken things, just that they missed the boat somehow -- the story and setting had a lot more potential than what the game ultimately delivered.","October 28, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh really, a game about ancient Rome? Sounds awesome and... wait... You are copying the Batman games yet you are mixing up the controls? Crytek, why do you insist on having good ideas but mucking them up with a handful of terrible ones?"\n\nMy statement above can pretty much some up the entire game. This game isn't bad, but it isn't great. The combat is ripped out of any one of the Arkham games, but for some reason, the gamepad controls are backward. I had to use a mouse and keyboard because my muscle memory could not adjust to using A as deflect/counter and B to dodge attacks. Pro tip to developers: DO NOT DEVIATE FROM COMMONLY USED CONTROL SCHEMES!  Oh, and you can't rebind controls for EITHER gamepad or mouse/keyboard. Crytek, you made Crysis 1/warhead/2/3, and those games would let you rebind EVERYTHING!\n\nAnyway, let's get on to the game's presentation: It is ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. Everything from the environments and characters look bloodly brilliant, plus the sound and music are amazing.\n\nNow let's talk about the gameplay... It's... um... really repititive. Don't get me wrong, it is fun if you like this sort of thing, but there's a lot of potential that this game COULD have had. At times, you are supported to form up and replicate the scene from the movie Gladitor where all the soldiers bunch up with their shields. It's fun until you realize it's just hold W to move foward, sometimes press space bar to block arrows, and hold left click to kill. There are also poinds in the game where you are called upon to position archers or troops. Again, the changes are really superficial, like do you get supports from ranged attacks or help for melee.\n\nExecutions in the game are done by weakening an enemy and pressed a button. There are "quick time events" where you either use left right or right click. You can't fail them, but you do want to time it, because you can choose the reward you'll get for executing the execution swiftly. I might have the minority opinion, but this doesn't bother me at all. I choose when to do an execution, they look nice, and whether or not I hit the buttons at the right time only affects the reward outcome, not total failure.\n\nOverall, there are some really good ideas that aren't fleshed out or executed well. For $20 or less, I'd recommend it. The two-player gladitor mode is pretty fun, as well. Anything about $25 is not recommended.\n","December 10, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Moving on as i was saying the cut scences are beautiful especially the waves they are so well done and look so good especially when you just removed 3 random barbians arms and then stuffed it up their arses to the point where there arm is in the back of their throat and just when they start to lose consicousness from the arm you stab them in the throat and watch and 3 more come and try and stand against the glorius roman republic of italy, but like i said this game is wonderfull i really like what the did with the slow mo it feels so rewarding to just MURDER ALL THE ♥♥♥♥ING JEWS OF BRITTANA WITH THE MIGHT OF A STEEL SWORD AS YOU CUT OFF THEIR ♥♥♥♥ AND FEED IT TO THEIR MOTHERS AS THEY WATCH IN HORROR AS THEIR CHILD IS STRUCK DOWN AND STAB TO PEICES FOR THE SPQR AND SOME TRY TO RUN BUT THEY ONLY GET SO FAR AFTER HAVEING A PILA STUFFED IN THE BACK OFF THEIR HEAD AND SOME FIGHT ONLY TO BE MASSACRED BY THE IRON HORDE OF ROMAN SOLDIERS YOU SWEEP THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE BARBARIANS PELBIAINS SLAUGHTING THEM ONE BY ONE SHOVING YOUR SWORD DOWN THE BACK OF THE THROAT AS YOU SLOWY DIP INTO MADNESS SWING AFTER SWING BECAUSE LESS A MURDER AND MORE OF AN ART, this game shows true power 69/whats left of the roman empire","October 1, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagorak/recommended/302510/","nagorak","Nagorak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagorak/","112 products in account","The game is good for what it is, but realize what it is: a linear, hack and slash title.  It's also not that long, but that's not necessarily a negative, given the nature of the game.  My overall rating for the game is 7/10.  It was definitely worth the $10 I paid for it, and I think it wouldn't be a terrible buy for even $20, but I wouldn't pay any more than that.\n\nOn paper it seems like I'd hate the game since it's a pretty repetitive hack and slasher, but somehow it ends up being more than the sum of its parts.  I thought the combat did a good job of capturing the brutal and visceral nature of close combat.  It was fun enough to play, even if it was pretty repetitive.  The story was also solid, and I think that helped the game a lot.  It held your attention and kept you motivated to fight through each part.  Had the story been bad, I'm not sure how enjoyable the overall game would have been.\n\nThe graphics were also pretty good, and felt like they captured the feeling of ancient Rome, although at some points the architecture was pretty clearly exaggerated compared to reality.  The environments are definitely not 100% historically accurate, but I could accept the areas where creative license was taken.  The Arena section, in particular, was pretty cool.  The levels were all totally linear, but that seemed to work alright for this game.\n\nThe upgrade system to me seemed like it served very little purpose.  In my opinion, you might as well have automatically leveled up.  I bought upgrades throughout the game, and they probably helped, but nothing I purchased had an obvious impact on the game play.  I didn't even spend all my exp toward the end of the game, as I simply forgot to do so, and it really didn't seem to make much difference (granted at that point I was already pretty upgraded).  It just seemed odd to me that they went to such effort to add an XP system, but then didn't really do much with it.\n\nLengthwise the game was pretty short.  I estimate that it only took me about 6 - 6.5 hours to play through.  Steam says 7 hours, but I know there was some AFK time in there.  That being said, I think the length was actually a positive, because the game play could not have held my interest for more than another hour or two.  If the game was 8 hours instead of 6, I doubt I'd have gone away with such a positive impression.\n\nOverall, my biggest complaint is I feel the game could have been so much more than what it was.  I think they had a solid core idea with the combat, and the story/setting, but they should have expanded on it somehow.  I'm not sure exactly what direction I think they should have taken things, just that they missed the boat somehow -- the story and setting had a lot more potential than what the game ultimately delivered.","October 28, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The worst part is that im struggling as i wite this to pick out bits and pieces that i liked because it is all so damn good, kinda like eating a really good pie with lots of ingredients, you like the pie, you know what is in the pie but you cant quite tell which part is the part that is making you like it so much. The story is one of the most incredible stories of revenge there is, the kind where you hate the target of the protagonists vengence almost as much as they do. The combat is fairly bog standard but enjoyable and brings a nice little twist with the Quicktime executions wherein the enemy glows with the colour of the button you need to press.\n\nif there was one thing i wish there was more of its the "squad commanding" it was prtty cool to be in command of a Roman Tortoise formation bracing the shields and then returning fire with javelins, or deciding whether your men should guard the left or the right? do you have the archers support them or you? what should the siege equipment target? i feel as though the game could have done more with it but at the same time the ai is a little bit to be desired so having much more might have lead to some frustration.\n\nA few people that told me not to buy this game told me that the reason was because "its an interactive movie" im telliing you right now it is for this reason primarily, that you should buy it. i should note however i bought this game in a 75% off sale but i would still have been happy if i had payed full price\n\n","March 31","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enemies tend to come in waves of identical barbarians divided into a handful of different classes which needs to be countered with specific combos (woe betide you if you don't carry throwing spears at all times).\n\nWhile the action feels sufficiently engaging and rewarding for the most part, you quickly realize that almost every kill leads to an unskippable cinematic cutscene. This part might grate some nerves as it takes away from the otherwise pretty fast-paced atmosphere. There are collectables for those that enjoy such things and the story is by no means bad, if a little cliché and borrowing heavily from the Roman era blockbusters of yesteryear like Gladiator.\n\nWorth getting on sale, can't see anyone regretting the purchase if what they desire from a game is to decapitate Germanics in slow-motion.","March 31","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You should pick up this game whenever its on discount. The gameplay is fun at first and the story is briliant. I was really dissapointed in seeing only 6 enemies in 2 hours of gameplay. Saw barbs and fat barbarians most of my time. Saw some "barbarian princess and king". Then i saw some half beast/half men people and their big boss. That is all. The game has amazing visuals. I use amd radeon hd 7750 and amd athlon x4 750k. I cannot say anything about optimization. Due to the lowest graphical settings the game looks still ♥♥♥♥ing bad ♥♥♥ but ofcourse you will get lower fps. With my setup i never went below 30 and i would not go lower than my setup. IF you have a high end pc you will enjoy the game with great fps + UNBELIEVEABLE visuals.

It is a fun adventure hack & slash with a heavy dose of QTE executions. I knew that going in and still enjoyed Ryse immensely. Graphically the game is stunning and even hold up today years after its original release. Facial animation and physics are beautiful and te voice acting is great as well.\n\nI love games that take place in ancient Rome, last time I had this much fun being in Rome was in the PS2 game Shadow of Rome. The game length is one of the few downside to the game. The game consists of 8 Chapters that on average take less than a hour each. I didn't rush thorugh the game and actually collected scrolls exploring the levels and viewing vistas and still beat the game in 6 hours. For a $60 game that is atrocious, but I got it on a Winter sale for about $7 and that was well worth it.\n\nCrytek has a gorgeous engine and I hope they continue the series or at the very least re-use the engine to make more great games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagorak/recommended/302510/","nagorak","Nagorak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagorak/","112 products in account","The game is good for what it is, but realize what it is: a linear, hack and slash title.  It's also not that long, but that's not necessarily a negative, given the nature of the game.  My overall rating for the game is 7/10.  It was definitely worth the $10 I paid for it, and I think it wouldn't be a terrible buy for even $20, but I wouldn't pay any more than that.\n\nOn paper it seems like I'd hate the game since it's a pretty repetitive hack and slasher, but somehow it ends up being more than the sum of its parts.  I thought the combat did a good job of capturing the brutal and visceral nature of close combat.  It was fun enough to play, even if it was pretty repetitive.  The story was also solid, and I think that helped the game a lot.  It held your attention and kept you motivated to fight through each part.  Had the story been bad, I'm not sure how enjoyable the overall game would have been.\n\nThe graphics were also pretty good, and felt like they captured the feeling of ancient Rome, although at some points the architecture was pretty clearly exaggerated compared to reality.  The environments are definitely not 100% historically accurate, but I could accept the areas where creative license was taken.  The Arena section, in particular, was pretty cool.  The levels were all totally linear, but that seemed to work alright for this game.\n\nThe upgrade system to me seemed like it served very little purpose.  In my opinion, you might as well have automatically leveled up.  I bought upgrades throughout the game, and they probably helped, but nothing I purchased had an obvious impact on the game play.  I didn't even spend all my exp toward the end of the game, as I simply forgot to do so, and it really didn't seem to make much difference (granted at that point I was already pretty upgraded).  It just seemed odd to me that they went to such effort to add an XP system, but then didn't really do much with it.\n\nLengthwise the game was pretty short.  I estimate that it only took me about 6 - 6.5 hours to play through.  Steam says 7 hours, but I know there was some AFK time in there.  That being said, I think the length was actually a positive, because the game play could not have held my interest for more than another hour or two.  If the game was 8 hours instead of 6, I doubt I'd have gone away with such a positive impression.\n\nOverall, my biggest complaint is I feel the game could have been so much more than what it was.  I think they had a solid core idea with the combat, and the story/setting, but they should have expanded on it somehow.  I'm not sure exactly what direction I think they should have taken things, just that they missed the boat somehow -- the story and setting had a lot more potential than what the game ultimately delivered.","October 28, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's not much challenge, the gameplay consists of hack-and-slash fights interspersed with quick-time events, and the environments are dreadfully linear.\n\nBut what little there is happens to be put together really well. The game is beautiful to look at, and not overly taxing on your system - playing on a mid-range PC, I got a steady 40-50 FPS throughout. The animations are fluid, the arena mode offers you a bit more of a challenge. The story is a bunch of familiar set pieces strung together - in one scene, you're storming a beach like an Ancient Roman version of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (and, indeed, the achievement for that level is called "Saving Private Marius"), and then you find yourself rescuing people from being burned in a wickerman (like in that movie, THE WICKER MAN), and then it all ends up with (duhdoy) a giant GLADIATOR reference.\n\nI think a good litmus test of whether you'll like this game is if you can watch movies like I, FRANKENSTEIN and genuinely enjoy yourself. It's dumb fun, but it knows it's dumb, and it never tries to pretend otherwise.\n\nI picked it up for five bucks during a sale, and I felt like it was money well spent.","April 2","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd liken this to a good movie, the kind that you go to see in the theater that you don't want to leave in the middle of even to take a ♥♥♥♥ or refill your drinks/popcorn.  The music is great and the graphics are wonderful, but its the story I think that stands out the most.  Its very catching and movies along at a good pace, not once did I sit and think, alright lets get this area overwith, I'm done with it, it just kept pulling me along.  The Combat isn't to bad either, I particulalry like the way the fights can change from one vs. a few to having your Cohort at your back.   Not only that but the little touch of Command that pops up here and there is good, especially like that they implemented the "Roman Turtle" strategy in the game, nothing like hiding behidn your shield wall then popping up to launch a volley of pilums (spelt something like that) at a mass of barbarians and mowing them down.\n\nAlong with the good story, the characters themselves are well writen, having their own personalities and such that make them seem more real.  If your a fan of games set in the days of the Roman Empire, and like agood combination of Action and Story telling, this is for you.\n\nI've not tried out the MP as of yet, but it seems to have a fair bit of customization for your character, so there's something there for you PvPerse as well.  Check it out, especially this weekend 1-31 till 2-2 while its on sale.\n\nJust a quick little edit because I went through and saw some of the Achiev names.

It features beautiful graphics and a quick-time-event based combat system. The story evolves around a legionaire named Marius Titus and takes aproximately 8 hours to beat (longer if you intend to 100% the game by collecting certain collectibles which are scattered throughout the different levels). It also features a neat co-op-gladiator mode on which one can spend some time playing with friends or strangers...\n\nIt's mentionable that the story isn't as captive as it could be and that the events featured within the game mostly didn't happen in romes real history, so if you're intending to buy the game out of historical intrests or because you want to experience a complexe story you should look somewhere else...\n\nIf you, on the other hand, are looking for a game with awesome graphics and a not-too-difficult combat system and "semi-captivating story" plus lots of gore and a fun to play co-op (all set in roman times), you'll most likely have a good time playing Ryse: Son of Rome!

As usual, I am quite critical when it comes to historical inaccuracies and bad depiction of a historical figure. It blew my mind that I was not as mad at it as I should be. The campaign seems to lead its own story, its fascinating story structures and amazing narratives caught me off guard, there was not much room for me to judge it. Fell in love with the story, can't really put it into words here, but it's very touching. Although, what bothers me pretty much are the mechanics (technological advancement) in some of the things in the game are pretty modern and was not made yet back in the days..you know, a mixture of modern scent and the old Roma was played as a gimmick.\n\nI didn't like how Nero was portrayed, but that was just my opinion, it didn't ruin the game. It would be great if there's more unique units in the game. When you battle with the babarians for too long you will recognize their faces. They should have created more faces and stuff for the NCP, it's not that important, but worth keeping as a side note. The combat is pretty much like a hack slash..but you'll have to think well of your approach before commencing a stupid approach on the boss and high level enemies. Overall?

Once in a while I would get the same problems during executions, but mostly when executing more than one enemy. I DID NOT SET EVERYTHING TO LOW SO I CANNOT SPEAK TO PERFORMANCE WITH THOSE SETTING ON MY HARDWARE.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe mechanics are kinda cool especially if you were a fan of the God of War series (Ryse is similar but DOES NOT compare) in that you have light and heavy attacks and blocking which which you use when indicated by some kind of obvious movement or a colorful glow. I found the perk system kind of useful but the upgrade system rather limited to the point that I only upgraded when prompted by the game to do so. I have always liked QTE but this falls short of satisfactory regarding the mechanics. If you miss a button prompt, there is no consequence other than less perk points ie: damage, health, focus, and XP, which is fine other than the fact that I found myself caring little about hitting the right buttons. What "I" thing should happend is that you get 3 chances to execute your enemy. If you fail, your eemy blocks your strike and knocks you back taking some health along the way. Upon the third failure the execution is reversed and you are in turn slaughtered. just my two cents. If you want things to be challenging, choose the hardest difficulty and it might make it worth hitting the correct buttons in the Quick Time Events.\n\nASSETS\nI am not a big complainer about many look alike characters so ill just say there are not many variatons of enemies.\nThe scenery is absolutely BEAUTIFUL (thank you crytek) and the water is on par with the rest of the game. Moving onto weapons. I know that in roman armies soldiers mostly stuck with one weapon and some times used staffs/pilums, but seeing how the story was so off base I dont think it would have been ad to allow for dual wielding of swords or staffs and such. Instead you are stuck with a sword and shield the whole time...which is fine I guess.\n\nSTORY\nI have always been a big ROME dork, so I like any cheesy story the makes me feel like spartacus and such so I dont have any comlaints on the front other than lenght, though if it were to be longer with everything as is, it would be TOO long. there just isnt much to do other than kill Kill KILL. Basically there is about 4-8 hrs of gameplay depending on your playstyle and diffuculty choice.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nWith all of my bickering I did enjoy the game. I really do love my burtal, murderous, carnage. SOOOoooo. no complaints there. All in all I do reccomend this game on sale(which it is now until Feb 12th for $6.79). Just try to play it in one sitting in order to keep from being too bored. I have nothing against the game, I just think the mechanics and assets needed ALOT more "polishing".

I think one noticable key to how epic it feels is that all of the bosses and characters are very human, and have no special powers beyond being genuine badasses. I'd like to see that concept in more games.\n\nActual combat is interactive and feels a bit like Shadow of Mordor and the Batman games, but the commander style gameplay is unlike anything out there and very fun. Graphics are beautiful, storyline is rich and immersive with solid voice acting. I'd say this game is worth about 30-40 dollars.\n\nCons:\nRegular combat gets slightly monotonous after you get used to being entertained by all the interactive fatalities.\nThe graphics are intensive on computer systems and can overheating on older hardware.","January 14","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sometimes feels a little repetitive when fighting many waves of normal enemies, but I only felt it sometimes. also bought it on sale. Game is somehow similar to God of War with less boss battles, less button smashing, no puzzles, no mythical powers but with new modes where you comman your army/legion and you control a xbows/scorpio. You must also observe enemy patterns to defeat them, specially bosses, similar to how you memorize patterns on megaman games, Graphics is also really great.\n\nFinished the game in about 6 hours, but there is a multiplayer gladiator mode where you will fight other players online. haven't tired it yet. will update my review after.\n\nOverall the game is good","December 15, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The character develpment is fantastic and you should get this game just for the story alone.\nFor the visuals, if you want it running smoothly, you will need a beefy system. I have a Radeon 7850 and ran things on medium and low mixed up and got 20 fps. I somehow found this playable and it didn't bother me one bit because of how gorgious it was. I don't know if it is because of how they ported the game or that I was pushing my gpu too hard, but the game would:\n-freeze for 5 sec with/without sound (varied betweent the two)\n-completley crash (only happend twice)\n-as game played, sound would studder for a while and either go back to normal or completley stop(happend in 1v1 parts of the game)\n-found a few bugs where I clipped through walls\n\nMany people found the combat to be repetative and I can agree with that to an extent. Don't play on the easiest difficulty.

It features beautiful graphics and a quick-time-event based combat system. The story evolves around a legionaire named Marius Titus and takes aproximately 8 hours to beat (longer if you intend to 100% the game by collecting certain collectibles which are scattered throughout the different levels). It also features a neat co-op-gladiator mode on which one can spend some time playing with friends or strangers...\n\nIt's mentionable that the story isn't as captive as it could be and that the events featured within the game mostly didn't happen in romes real history, so if you're intending to buy the game out of historical intrests or because you want to experience a complexe story you should look somewhere else...\n\nIf you, on the other hand, are looking for a game with awesome graphics and a not-too-difficult combat system and "semi-captivating story" plus lots of gore and a fun to play co-op (all set in roman times), you'll most likely have a good time playing Ryse: Son of Rome!

Moving on as i was saying the cut scences are beautiful especially the waves they are so well done and look so good especially when you just removed 3 random barbians arms and then stuffed it up their arses to the point where there arm is in the back of their throat and just when they start to lose consicousness from the arm you stab them in the throat and watch and 3 more come and try and stand against the glorius roman republic of italy, but like i said this game is wonderfull i really like what the did with the slow mo it feels so rewarding to just MURDER ALL THE ♥♥♥♥ING JEWS OF BRITTANA WITH THE MIGHT OF A STEEL SWORD AS YOU CUT OFF THEIR ♥♥♥♥ AND FEED IT TO THEIR MOTHERS AS THEY WATCH IN HORROR AS THEIR CHILD IS STRUCK DOWN AND STAB TO PEICES FOR THE SPQR AND SOME TRY TO RUN BUT THEY ONLY GET SO FAR AFTER HAVEING A PILA STUFFED IN THE BACK OFF THEIR HEAD AND SOME FIGHT ONLY TO BE MASSACRED BY THE IRON HORDE OF ROMAN SOLDIERS YOU SWEEP THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE BARBARIANS PELBIAINS SLAUGHTING THEM ONE BY ONE SHOVING YOUR SWORD DOWN THE BACK OF THE THROAT AS YOU SLOWY DIP INTO MADNESS SWING AFTER SWING BECAUSE LESS A MURDER AND MORE OF AN ART, this game shows true power 69/whats left of the roman empire","October 1, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Summray review at the bottom\n\nRyse: Son of rome is a action game based mainly around QTE(Quick time events) gameplay you play as Marius a Roman solider out to avenge his family's death\n\nGameplay:\nBeing a mainly QTE game Ryse gets repepitive very quickly and the only thing that kept my attention was the exotic executions, but even thoughs got old about 3 hours in\nThere are sectons on the game where you must command Roman soliders, either by placing lines in certain sections to defend a choke point or to advance across a sections while under archer fire, those these are largely exciting they are few and far between, not necessarily a bad thing, having them to often would quickly get old, but I feel like it should be noted that I was always looking forward to the next time I get to march down an army of archers firing on me\n\nGraphics:\nRyse is a very good looking game, I was running it maxed settings with a AMD R9 280 3GB card 16 gigs of ram and a 6 AMD processor I was getting 50-60 FPS and rarely dropped below 40\n\nStory:\nRyse certainly has an interesting story that is mostly told between levels, but being a 6 hour game doens't give a lot of time to build the story in a compelling way\n\nSummary:\nRyse:Son of Rome is a solid game if it's on sale, I got it for 10.19 USD and I'm satisfied with the game for that price\n7/10 Not ground shaking but a solid game","November 27, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Second, adjust the graphical and texture settings for good performance. Third, enjoy the game. P.S Lots of blood, beware.\n\nGood game with lots of depth with simple controls, and good story telling. Although, the skill system is pretty pointless because you get enough points to unlock them all. Would have been better to have a system where you must sacrifice choices.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the game has some performance issues with stuttering in some high graphical areas (this has been experienced with players across all computer spectrums, from low-end to high-end). That can be ignored to some extent, but quite annoying. No fix yet (since 2014).\n\nIf you are a collection or achievement type of person, the game has many collectables. It also rewards players for exploration so you will always get something other than fighting around (beware the game is still going to be combat related, treat this like a side dish rather than the big meal).\n\nThe combat is simple and elegant, unlike other fighter games where combos require multiple button setups, the game focuses on timing and usage of perks. So anyone can get into the game, learn it quickly, but hard to master.\n\nMultiplayer, does not have many players, so do not expect getting CO-OP matches or what not quickly. But still enjoyable for playing with friends (not so much for single players unless you want to be on the leaderboards).\n\nMusic is amazing and probably made the game a lot stronger than it was. Many times the music adds a layer emotion that attaches you to the character or makes connections to yourself. (So play with headphones or a good sound system)\n\nVisuals, I am not much of a visual type of person. But graphical setups and scenes were good and well done. The game brings you through several environments and show off the Crytek Engine like deep green jungles, the english channel, the streets of Rome, and dark dense forests. I really enjoyed the invasion scene with the boats and fighting on the streets of York.\n\nStory, some characters were pointless in the story. The gods are a good example because they did not have any depth other than being plot to forward the story. Most of the antagonists or villains were under developed and just silly with some exceptions in good character design.\n\nFor example, Commodus, Nero and Basillius could have been any spoiled rich kid with a superiority complex. Nothing interesting about them.\n\nCharacters that were good, Boudica, King Oswald and Vitallion. Their character shines out without plot and the player can make judgements about their lives without the game giving it to you.\n(On the fence with the main character, his personality goes all over the place, from loving son to revenge driven solider, to vengeful spirit and to defender of Rome.) There is no core values or spirit in the character, he is pretty empty with goals that drive him. His entire journey to fight was based on revenge from the beginning of the game until the invasion of Rome.\n\nHis character really fleshes out during the end of the game where he defends Rome with Vitallion, but other than that, there are many disconnects in his character from the beginning to the end of the game.\n\nIn other words, his character goes from a naive revenge driven son to an honourable hero of Rome within one day. That is a pretty big personality change that no real human being truly experiences. Bring it down a notch.\n\nOverall, the game gets a 8/10 on my list.","March 31","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's not much challenge, the gameplay consists of hack-and-slash fights interspersed with quick-time events, and the environments are dreadfully linear.\n\nBut what little there is happens to be put together really well. The game is beautiful to look at, and not overly taxing on your system - playing on a mid-range PC, I got a steady 40-50 FPS throughout. The animations are fluid, the arena mode offers you a bit more of a challenge. The story is a bunch of familiar set pieces strung together - in one scene, you're storming a beach like an Ancient Roman version of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (and, indeed, the achievement for that level is called "Saving Private Marius"), and then you find yourself rescuing people from being burned in a wickerman (like in that movie, THE WICKER MAN), and then it all ends up with (duhdoy) a giant GLADIATOR reference.\n\nI think a good litmus test of whether you'll like this game is if you can watch movies like I, FRANKENSTEIN and genuinely enjoy yourself. It's dumb fun, but it knows it's dumb, and it never tries to pretend otherwise.\n\nI picked it up for five bucks during a sale, and I felt like it was money well spent.","April 2","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once in a while I would get the same problems during executions, but mostly when executing more than one enemy. I DID NOT SET EVERYTHING TO LOW SO I CANNOT SPEAK TO PERFORMANCE WITH THOSE SETTING ON MY HARDWARE.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe mechanics are kinda cool especially if you were a fan of the God of War series (Ryse is similar but DOES NOT compare) in that you have light and heavy attacks and blocking which which you use when indicated by some kind of obvious movement or a colorful glow. I found the perk system kind of useful but the upgrade system rather limited to the point that I only upgraded when prompted by the game to do so. I have always liked QTE but this falls short of satisfactory regarding the mechanics. If you miss a button prompt, there is no consequence other than less perk points ie: damage, health, focus, and XP, which is fine other than the fact that I found myself caring little about hitting the right buttons. What "I" thing should happend is that you get 3 chances to execute your enemy. If you fail, your eemy blocks your strike and knocks you back taking some health along the way. Upon the third failure the execution is reversed and you are in turn slaughtered. just my two cents. If you want things to be challenging, choose the hardest difficulty and it might make it worth hitting the correct buttons in the Quick Time Events.\n\nASSETS\nI am not a big complainer about many look alike characters so ill just say there are not many variatons of enemies.\nThe scenery is absolutely BEAUTIFUL (thank you crytek) and the water is on par with the rest of the game. Moving onto weapons. I know that in roman armies soldiers mostly stuck with one weapon and some times used staffs/pilums, but seeing how the story was so off base I dont think it would have been ad to allow for dual wielding of swords or staffs and such. Instead you are stuck with a sword and shield the whole time...which is fine I guess.\n\nSTORY\nI have always been a big ROME dork, so I like any cheesy story the makes me feel like spartacus and such so I dont have any comlaints on the front other than lenght, though if it were to be longer with everything as is, it would be TOO long. there just isnt much to do other than kill Kill KILL. Basically there is about 4-8 hrs of gameplay depending on your playstyle and diffuculty choice.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nWith all of my bickering I did enjoy the game. I really do love my burtal, murderous, carnage. SOOOoooo. no complaints there. All in all I do reccomend this game on sale(which it is now until Feb 12th for $6.79). Just try to play it in one sitting in order to keep from being too bored. I have nothing against the game, I just think the mechanics and assets needed ALOT more "polishing".

I think one noticable key to how epic it feels is that all of the bosses and characters are very human, and have no special powers beyond being genuine badasses. I'd like to see that concept in more games.\n\nActual combat is interactive and feels a bit like Shadow of Mordor and the Batman games, but the commander style gameplay is unlike anything out there and very fun. Graphics are beautiful, storyline is rich and immersive with solid voice acting. I'd say this game is worth about 30-40 dollars.\n\nCons:\nRegular combat gets slightly monotonous after you get used to being entertained by all the interactive fatalities.\nThe graphics are intensive on computer systems and can overheating on older hardware.","January 14","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just wow.\nIf you love story in a game with beautiful visuals, this is a game for you. It is about a 7 hour campaign composed of 8 chapters. The character develpment is fantastic and you should get this game just for the story alone.\nFor the visuals, if you want it running smoothly, you will need a beefy system. I have a Radeon 7850 and ran things on medium and low mixed up and got 20 fps. I somehow found this playable and it didn't bother me one bit because of how gorgious it was. I don't know if it is because of how they ported the game or that I was pushing my gpu too hard, but the game would:\n-freeze for 5 sec with/without sound (varied betweent the two)\n-completley crash (only happend twice)\n-as game played, sound would studder for a while and either go back to normal or completley stop(happend in 1v1 parts of the game)\n-found a few bugs where I clipped through walls\n\nMany people found the combat to be repetative and I can agree with that to an extent. Don't play on the easiest difficulty. Play on second hardest and the combat will keep you on your toes trying to out smart the enemy's moves.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game with driven story and even has multiplayer that I have not delved too far into.","December 25, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can attack, shield bash, parry and roll. That is pretty much it. There are about half a dozen different bad guys to fight (over and over and over) along the way, however it is kind of fun (in a samey kind of way) Don't think that the game is bad by any means, it is not.

When it finally got announced for PC a bit later on, I was excited to play. All I read was bad reviews about the game, how it was boring and a waste of an exclusive blah blah blah. Tried it out for my self and got sucked in immediately.\nVisually the game is amazing, but the gameplay is simple enough that it makes fun to play for hours..well until you beat the game.\nThe QTE events are actually real nice, moving the camera around while in slow mode, watching your character chop opponents up is great. The story actually isn't bad at all either, I've played worse and Ryse does a real nice job by keeping things on point.\nCrytek could've done way more with this game, but in the end, Ryse is a game that you should play at least once to see what the fuss is about. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys these kinds of games, and for that I give it a 9/10.","January 3, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It's the game to play for any history buffs who want to experience the Roman Empire in the shoes of a Legionary.  I'm glad Crytek decided to make this and was saddened by the sequel's cancellation.  Long story short: visuals & production values are fantastic, the narrative is alright, while the combat mechanics are limited to combo button mash & QTE.\n\nThe story borrows heavily from other period movies/games/books about Rome.  Nonetheless, I could hardly step away from the game on my first playthrough.  The campaign only runs about 6-7 hours if you're quick.  It's highly cinematic, cutscene heavy and narrative driven.  The timeless classic of a humble soldier who takes up the sword to fight injustice makes me feel a bit like Maximus Decimus Meridius.  Campaign mode is ultra linear which, like so many high quality single player experiences, is tragically brief but jam packed with thrills & TLC.  Every corner you turn brings a carefully constructed encounter.  The levels are chock full of exquisitely detailed areas.\n\nBesides breathtaking graphics (even on 1920x1080p), the audio is equally satisfying.  The game is in fact an XBOX One port but doesn't suffer for it on PC as far as I can tell.  It is a demanding, high resource game that'll require a decent machine, even now almost a year after PC release.\n\nThe biggest thing to understand about Ryse is combat mechanics, which are entirely combo based & trigger QTE / quick time reaction button mashing for executions.  This might leave people wanting more freedom & complexity after dispatching the thousandth barbarian, but with such a short campaign it remains fun the whole way through & doesn't get old.\n\nCombat features color coded combo signals (blue for sword, yellow for shield, green for deflect, red for dodge).  This system rewards proper timing of blocks, dodges, light or heavy attacks with either sword or shield, prudent use of throwing pilum & environmental opportunities.  No, it's not that complex, but I found it to be very engaging in that 300 movie inspired style of over the top, gory slow-mo melee dramatization!\n\nExperience points (or gold, in the arena mode) purchase  new executions & upgrades but sadly there's no clear method by which to trigger these impressive, higher tier combos except for getting your combo hit counter sky high - outside of the arena, there isn't much opportunity to do that.  A "focus" resource that plays into Roman mythology as a story tie-in grants extra power that should be reserved for critical moments.\n\nI played on the standard difficulty then replayed on Legendary.  Only one or two spots gave me trouble, so I suggest you dive into the harder settings.\n\nThe arena mode is a different kind of fun, offering solo or 2 player cooperative survival versus waves of AI gladiators.  This mode is pretty well fleshed out with a pile of arena maps that reflect the diverse range of environments you'll find in campaign.  There are multiple objectives, different enemies requiring different strategies, an upgrade system with tiered gear to slot onto head, body, feet, sword, shield & potion (x2).  Frankly I don't know that I'd ever bother to level my gladiator up in arena, but my friends & I had a lot of solid fun with it for a couple of weeks.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome absolutely delighted me as a fan of this period of history.  You see a variety of settings and situations in Rome, London & Britannia that strongly evoke the romanticized concept of "Rome."  If that sounds good to you, I highly recommend.","September 9, 2015","true","19.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This system rewards proper timing of blocks, dodges, light or heavy attacks with either sword or shield, prudent use of throwing pilum & environmental opportunities.  No, it's not that complex, but I found it to be very engaging in that 300 movie inspired style of over the top, gory slow-mo melee dramatization!\n\nExperience points (or gold, in the arena mode) purchase  new executions & upgrades but sadly there's no clear method by which to trigger these impressive, higher tier combos except for getting your combo hit counter sky high - outside of the arena, there isn't much opportunity to do that.  A "focus" resource that plays into Roman mythology as a story tie-in grants extra power that should be reserved for critical moments.\n\nI played on the standard difficulty then replayed on Legendary.  Only one or two spots gave me trouble, so I suggest you dive into the harder settings.\n\nThe arena mode is a different kind of fun, offering solo or 2 player cooperative survival versus waves of AI gladiators.  This mode is pretty well fleshed out with a pile of arena maps that reflect the diverse range of environments you'll find in campaign.  There are multiple objectives, different enemies requiring different strategies, an upgrade system with tiered gear to slot onto head, body, feet, sword, shield & potion (x2).  Frankly I don't know that I'd ever bother to level my gladiator up in arena, but my friends & I had a lot of solid fun with it for a couple of weeks.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome absolutely delighted me as a fan of this period of history.  You see a variety of settings and situations in Rome, London & Britannia that strongly evoke the romanticized concept of "Rome."  If that sounds good to you, I highly recommend.","September 9, 2015","true","19.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Walk down a linear hallway, into a room with 3 enemies in it, kill those 3 enemies, 5 more will hop out, kill those 5 enemies, then the invisible wall blocking the next hallway will be unlocked, repeat that process 100 times.  Nearly every kill is a quicktime event on an awkwardly glowing person.  Leveling is worthless.  There are only 4 enemy types, they all look identical, and boss battles are just those enemy types with more HP.  And it ruins an otherwise good story by telling you the end at the beginning.  Also, about 75% of the way through the game, most of my save data was deleted, I kept story progression, but lost my level, collectibles, graphic settings, and everything else.\n\nFor the most part, this game just made me want to play a version of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, remastered in this graphic engine, and/or a mode similar to the old PS2 game Colosseum: Road to Freedom.  Maybe worth the $5 when on sale.","April 3","false","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As a PC player, you feel sort of limited in combats. Once you attack someone, it's very hard to combat against 2 other enemies coming at you. I feel like this is dumbed down for the console pads - on pc, you kind of can do faster movement and react at spesific enemies more easily. Or atleast you should be.\n\nAnyone who has played Witcher 3 knows what i'm talking about when it comes to battling multiple enemies at the same time. You can easily swap a target but in Ryse, that is slower and not always working like the way you wanted it to be. You can't always stop the guys coming behind you, no matter how fast you are trying to move against them from current enemy. It could be worse though, like in "Remember me" game where controls were hideous.\n\nBut, it's still worth the 4,99e i paid for it on the Christmas sale.","May 14","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am not a big fan of multiplayer in general, so I played this game entirely for the campaign. The campaign is short but it is just amazing. I consider it one of my favorite stories that I ever came across in a game.\nThe graphics are obviously amazing and I was also a huge fan of the combat system. I actually really enjoyed it.\n\nSo why the thumbs down?\nWhen I was in the middle of chapter 7 (out of 8) the game decided to delete my character stats for no reason whatsoever. The next time I started the game, I could still continue the campaign from the point where I had stopped, but my character was back to Level 1, which makes it extremely difficult to beat the enemies the game throws at you in chapter 7 and 8.\nObviously I checked the forums and I saw a lot of people complaining about the exact same problem. Some of these posts were over a year old, but there was no solution at all. It seems clear to me that the developers decided to simply ignore this problem, which is something that obviously should've been fixed immediately, since it's basicly a game breaking bug.\n\nI loved the game so much, I actually replayed a bunch of the earlier chapters to level up my character again and then finished the game. The ending is awesome!\nSo yeah, it is a short but fantastic game, but I just have to give the game a thumbs down when the developers don't fix such a severe problem that a lot of people seem to have encountered.","May 29","false","10.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The only mode you need to worry about is the Arena, where you play as Gluteus Exterminatore, and in co-op, with Braccae Videntis, and follow them on their quest for pants. You start with very little clothing, barely more than a towel for your genitals and a mask to cover your face, but after a long time Destroying People in the arena, you slowly rank up and gain the ability to wear shoulder pads and a belt.

When this game was first release people gave it medicore review scores because of it's quote and quote repetitive combat.\n\nAlthough, to an extent that is true. However, aren't all games repetitive? This game has a blend between God of War and the Batman : Arkham series as far as combat. Sounds amazing on paper, right? Let me tell you now, the combat is simply superb. Animations are very fluid, everyhing runs well and looks very crisp.\n\nAnd Don't let me talk about the Graphics. One word I could use to describe them : "Heavenly". Till this day, Ryse is still a technological sight to behold. If you wanted to rank a game on a best "Graphics of all time". Ryse would have to be top 3. Crytek really went all out on the optimization to me it seems. Even though this was originally an Xbox exclusive. This game was made for PC lol.\n\nThe story is, meh at best. But the amazing visuals will keep you sucked in the game and you won't mind playing the campaign multiple times. That's how good the graphics are.\n\nIf you're an action junky, Hack n Slash type of guy. This is the game for you. Think of it like, like a realistic God of War, except you're playing as one of thise random A.I (Spartan) characters and you're getting there perspective of the battle. (Even though this game is set in Rome lol)\n\nIf you're looking to showcase the best of what a PC can do. Get this game as well.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10\n\nPros:\nAmazing Visuals\nFun Multiplayer\nPlayable Single Player Campaign\nHighly Optimized\n\nCons:\nSomewhat repetitive combat\nShort Campaign*\n\nI suggest playing on Centurion and then Legendary to get a challenging "true" expereince.","December 27, 2015","true","32.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Was unsure based on its reception on Xbox One, but i am glad with my purchase. The combat is very fluid, but does get abit repetative after awhile, but this would be my only complaint, although still enjoyable. The story is very compeling and keeps your attention, even though slightly short (finished in 6 hours). The game runs well on my mid level system. All high with Supersampling off, game looks stunning! although I do hate the film grain effect. The game runs well with keyboard and mouse as well as with a controller.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elhadji/recommended/302510/","elhadji","1./ZG1_El Hadji","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elhadji/","110 products in account","INTRO\nI bought Ryse: Son of Rome during the X-mas sale 2015 and I am thrilled about the fact that I didn't pay full price for this! It looks great, it sounds great, the story and voice acting is good but the actual gameplay is... well... boring. Ryse: Son of Rome is actually the first game I have played where I wished there was a button to skip the gameplay sequences instead of the cutscenes.\n\nSTORYLINE/ENVIRONMENT\nThe story is the only reason I can see for ever wanting to play Ryse: Son of Rome. It is pretty good and the voice acting is spot on. The game also looks good, especially when in Rome. Any history buffs will probably be annoyed since the developers have used their creative freedom to cut most corners from a historical standpoint. But since the in-game story holds together, I can live with that.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay is possibly the most dumbed down gaming experience in gaming history. Unless you are colour blind. Just mash the controller button (yes this is a console port at it's worst) matching the colour flickering on your screen and you are home free. The game tells you exactly what do to and when to do it. No room for thinking on your own here.\n\nThere must also have been some serious budget cuts in the department that made the opponents. There are something like four enemy types and every individual within each type look exactly the same. The money saved from these cuts must have been spent on scripting since you can't even turn your head when you want. This is button mashing on rails.\n\nTECHNOBABBLE\nI played Ryse: Son of Rome on my rig built in 2012. It has a Intel Core i5 3570K clocked at 4.2 GHz that is cooled by a Corsair H100. The GPU is a MSI GTX 680 Lightning 2GB VRAM clocked at 1.3 GHz and cooled by TwinFrozr II. I have 16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR3 1600 RAM and the game is installed on a Samsung Evo 850 SSD. I played in 1920x1080 resoultion on a 144Hz monitor and got a frame rate which seemed mostly stable around 60 fps with HIGH settings.\n\nSUMMARY\nI can't recommend Ryse: Son of Rome to anyone. It was supposed to be some sort of graphics showcase for the Xbox One and I guess that goal was achieved. From a gamers perspective it leaves a lot to be desired. Most important here is the lack of interesting gameplay. I feel sorry for the console players who bought this on release. Ryse: Son of Rome is the most boring game in my collection. Great movie. Horrible game.","January 3","false","7.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Story is somewhat predictable, but despite that I liked it. I played it mostly for the cutscenes, which are very well done. Animation, acting, writing - all very well done.\nThe graphics are absolutely amazing and they really did a great job on the enviroments details and lightning (I could almost smell my PC burning in the Sherwood Forest level..), but the gameplay itself really is just boring. The finishers look cool for about 20 minutes, then they start to repeat so you see them over and over. Also they could have put more models in the game. Because being surounded by 5 enemies, which looks EXACTLY the same, just kills the atmosphere righ off.\n\nIts worth getting it from the sale, but only for the story and to see, if you can run it on max. It would really worked much better as an in-engine made movie. I wouldnt say it is a bad game - it just didnt left any impact on me, thus the thumb down.","January 5","false","5.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

A beautiful one at that.\n\nI'm a really big fan of Roman Empire/Greek Mythlogy games such as God of War. Gladiator is one of my all time favorite movies. So I felt right at home with the setting and subject matter.\n\nThe Story was really involved. Easy to follow, not too campy and kept the game moving at a nice pace. The very last cutscene was a really memorable wrap up to a bloody story centered around revenge.\n\nGameplay wise, I love hack 'n slash games so Ryse was really enjoyable. It took a little bit to learn the ins and outs of fighting, blocking and executing. Executions are REALLY gory. The gurgle of your opponents last breath or the sound of a limb being cleaved off really added weight to the fights. I wouldn't say the fight was deep, but it was well rounded enough to keep me invested in the murder of 100's of barbarians.\n\nRyse is a AAA game through and through, if your PC can run it and you have a controller catch it on sale and give it a go. there is multiplayer but I felt like I got my fill after the credits rolled. I would play it again in the future if there is ever a drought of gory hack n' slashes.

But is gameplay THAT bad?\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am writing this review at 2 hours into the game (42%) so take this into account. I will update the review later.\n\nI grabbed this on sale for half off the original price, well aware of the negative press the gameplay has received. However I was not prepared for the sheer beauty of this game. At its best in certain (in engine) cutscenes, the game looks photorealistic and that is no overstatement. If you want something to show off the state of technology, this is the definite game. Even on mid range graphics this runs smoothely on nearly maxed details, a testament to the Cry Engine's power.\n\nAs was reported however, the gameplay falls short of living up to these amazing visuals as we have sadly come to expect from Crytek. The criticisms are valid: The gameplay never moves much beyond the VERY simple combat mechanics and tube levels. In essence: Break guard, slash, slash, execute via a quick time event. I found these repetitive since they come with virtually every enemy, taking away from their impact, however I was pleased to find out that you can acquire a number of new satisfying execution moves. The upgrade system has been criticized but honestly, it serves at least to leave decision up to you. If you are used to Batman/Shadow of Mordor style brawling this will leave you blue balled, however I as a beginner like the simplicity and conservativeness of the fighting mechanic and don't think it holds back the game especially since it is short.\n\nShort it is indeed, but that is not it's problem. I enjoy this very much as a 5 hour interactive movie, the only real problem is that it only has 5 cast members. Yes, this is the most glaring issue: Content variety. You'll fight the same fat bearded guy in literally every second brawl. A couple of randomized armor/hairstyles would have worked WONDERS. Generally the models are indicative of the few enemy types. Whenever someone interesting comes up (flaming sword guy, nice) you'll find out that they are sadly gonna die to the same old combat formula.\n\nThe story is dividing the audience. Yes it is ripe with tropes and not very original, not to mention glaringly historically inaccurate. But the mystical elements and the highlights of the voice acting (by god the introduction of the Emperor's son - unmatched in any other game) plus the charismatic, ultra realistic cutscene actors make up for it.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed it and think I will for the remaining few hours of my playthrough. Don't waste too much money on it and you'll have no regrets. You'll end up hugging your screenshot key with your jaw on the floor anyways, so you probably won't notice the flaws too much if you're no Brawler enthusiast.","December 22, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After the first "mission" i was bored to death. The combat system is easy and gets boring pretty quickly. If you can use WASD and hit the right button when the game tells you to, you will be just fine. There is nothing hard about fighting. The bossfights are terrible, when you think you have killed a boss, it either spawns again or as 10 new bosses. Bad idea of making a game harder or longer. And after you completed the story the game wants you to spend hundreds of hours on some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ingame game, which is connected to alot of achievements. And the achievements aren't easy to achieve either, if you're into that. The aim snaps on pretty easily, making it very easy to aim. But what should you expect from a xbox port?\nThe idea of this game is good, but the execution is poor.\nI didn't enjoy the game very much.\n\nPros\n-Good looking\n\nCons\n-Repetative gameplay\n-Short story\n-Easy fighting\n-Bad idea to "milk" a game\n-Made for consol","December 2, 2014","false","7.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Most common complaints were its repetitive and is only eye candy.  AFter finishing it, I very much enjoyed it.  Its beautiful to look at, sounds great, and the voice acting is superb.  The story is about revenge and the pacing was good.  Entire game took me 7 hrs to finish.\n\nYes it does go into QTE during execution for every enemies but thats only if you choose to.  Theres no rule that says you have to execute every barbarians or romans.  However the lack of enemy model is a big con.  Enemy models only range from maybe 5-6 different look.  So for the 7 hrs or so you be seeing the same enemy getting killed over and over.\n\nBoss battles are fun and are the highlight for me.  Good mix of fun and not too brutually hard.  BUY this game for a nice good action laid back playthrough.  You will definately enjoy it.  Get it on sale, at least 50%.  Not worth at full price.","January 30, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That being said, this game is glitched out!!! Two hotfixes within a couple of days after release date was still not enough to fix the major issues that lie within this full priced game. I have a decent system, however, my computer will lock up and freeze for about 2 minutes every 15 minutes that I'm playing the game... I'm thinking memory leak, or just a really bad port of a game from consoles. I beat the campaign on Lengendary playing through the glitches but I dont' think there are any gamers out there that have the patience that I have playing through the glitches every 15 minutes. I would not pay full price for this game until they resolve the issues, otherwise, when they do (if they do), this game has potential to be something great.\n\n***Update***\nThe game has stopped glitching every 15 minutes for me. Updating my video card to a GTX970 did not fix the glitching, however, when I installed the game onto an SSD it stopped the glitching. IDK if it's the solution, but it's an observation. I DC from a co-op match about 50% of the time though. I still would not recommend.","October 14, 2014","false","28.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I am pretty honest and fair when it comes to game reviews under my own opinion. The game was great. Of course we have the usual plot, combat tactics, and just the type of gameplay. The combat could have been way better, and if only this game was kind of like a open world ♥♥♥♥♥♥me. Now a ♥♥♥♥♥♥me for this title would have been better. As for the story, the story was compelling and made me not want to stop playing. Plots, semi twists, amazing story.\n\nAs to the graphics this game WILL suck ur GPU depending what system you are playing on. The games has amazing graphics, blood and gore shown and just pure awesomeness. I recommend you customizing your graphics setting for this game before going to play and lower the resolution down to 60% at least, thats what i played it on with medium settings.\n\nGame Rating i give RYSE Son of Rome a 7.5/10. Just prepare for REPETITIVE boss fight at the end.

In contains 8 chapters, which are very varied, from Rome to beach landing at Britain to spooky forests, to Arena to a city at siege. You mostly play a single warrior with a shield, which really feels like he has a shield and needs it to parry those attacks and arrows... and then there are a few scenes where you take command of a small squad of men, to make the famous tortouise formation (with shields), slowly advance while arrows go down on you... really cool.\nWhat is also quite unique is the way the executions are diplayed, enemies are colored in either yellow or blue, corresponding to the controller buttons you need to press, very nice! Sure after some time, the animations repeat, and the combat and enemies repeat too, but the force of the battle and attacks is displayed so well, in combination with the great videos to tell the story, that I was never bored! There is an XP system to unlock more skills/executions, and I even tried multiplayer a bit.

Especially the beginning where the main character loses his parents.\n\nSpeaking of the main character, this young fellow Marius is a Roman legionary who magically survives everything and fights several hundreads of Barbarians with his sword that isn't even a Roman sword. He also has a beard, so he might be a Barbarian (Huge plotwist). No, not really but the game is full of such unrealistic facts, objects and actions.

No problems using KB/M instead of a controller. The main character models are superb  and the game's visuals are stunning. I like the setting of the ancient Roman Empire as it is not so overused as other historical periods. The single player campaign is a little bit on the short side. As you can see I played for 8 hrs and suck at swordplay  - nevertheless I'm halfway through the campaign. The levels are linear but that's not a bad thing in itself. As I see it the game tries to narrate a story and succeeds very well at that. Although the combat mechanics are solid a little more variety in moves and opponents would help to keep away the repetitiveness of fighting look-a-like warriors over and over again. The game seems to have some stability issues - it crashed two times in 8 hrs  - but nothing game breaking as there are plenty of checkpoints. All in all it's a pretty good game held back from true greatness due to seemingly rushed development - 8/10.

First, I have to start with the obvious, the visuals.  I'm running this on a Core 2 Quad 3.4, 8GB RAM (DDR2) and a 970GTX (Fantastic Card and great value).  The beginning loads up into a cut scene to begin the story, so I'm sat there watching, drinking my coffee and then realised that I was being slowly hacked to bits by Barbarians, I thought it was still a frickin cutscene!  The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, the attention to detail is immense without a single element of lag, fantastic work by the developers.\nCombat can be slightly frustrating, particularly against some of the later boss characters where you have to combine dodge, with perfect and I mean pin-point precision blocking moves followed up with a quick attack.  Initially, the combat is great and the execution moves are a nice touch but just when it starts to get repetitive, the developers throw a few elements into the mix, like the scorpion artillery piece which really is a rapid fire machine gun (not entirely historically accurate) or commanding troops ducking behind shield wall formations at the click of a button whilst being fired on by archers.  Their are some features of the game which blatantly copies other games such as focus (Think Max Payne and several other games of note) and some features which are don't really have much of an affect like the ability to build up your damage meter.  Character progression is great being able to upgrade your execution moves and so on.  My only gribe about this game is replayability, I finished the game in 2 days and now am looking for the next best thing.  I have yet to try multi-player and will update this review when I do.  Overal though, if you want a decent John Cena turned Roman Soldier meets Gears of War with the ability to chop off a barbarians arm with the swing of a sword, then this is game for you but don't expect to replay the story line because once done, the surprise elements are gone. 8/10","June 23, 2015","true","44.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

At first it is VERY satisfying and entertaining, but it quickly gets repetitive and annoying. You should play this game in bursts. Along with the repetitive swordplay there is this awful spear throwing mechanic. It baffles me that this made it into the final game; it's clunky and annoying as hell. The game could've benefited from some variation, and by that I mean dual wielding, two handed weapons, bow and arrow, etc.\n\nThere is also multiplayer, which you can play by yourself or with a friend. You basically fight hordes of enemies in a changing environment while completing objectives and such. It's fun, but gets repetitive quickly.\n\nThe story was good, not fantastic, but it was entertaining and had its moments.

Well, the fighting is similar to Shadow of Mordor, but you're pretty much limited to light and heavy attacks with your sword and shield, blocking and rolling away... exactly what you'd expect from a Roman soldier. Executions are satisfying and if you pull them off correctly your health gets replenished.

Simply a stunner.\nUnfortunately everything else (gameplay mechanics & story) simply isn't there to captivate the player.\nToo much emphasis on QTEs, one-dimensional combat, awkward camera & move set.

This one offers great (really stunning) graphics and interesting story. However, it is quite straight-forward game, you are basically only able to go through specified "corridors". There are some "dead ends" containing scrolls/collectibles. For me, it took cca 7 hours to play singleplayer part from start to end on normal difficulty. Multiplayer looks very interesting and is based on coop play including few modes (I havent tried out all of them). One flaw I cannot forgive this is that it is so clear that this game was created for Consoles and controllers. Overall, I think the game is worth 40% its price if it comes just to campaign. If you count in also MP, I would go for 70% (currently). I enjoyed every single part of it and will try to find someone for MP.","May 24, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I need a new computer now to play this game in all it's glory.\n\nGameplay and RPG elements are a little shallow but overall it does shallow very well.  Skill trees only go 4 levels deep (only 3 to unlock) and there's probably only a few types of enemies.  The executions and other special abilities are enough variety to make all the simple rock-paper-scissors gameplay varied every time.\n\nI appreciate that there are secrets to unlock, makes exploring every inch of the landscape worthwhile.\n\nMultiplayer is a nice touch as well, should give the game much more replayability!

Not only graphically good, but the design of the levels has lots of varieties and an excellent quality. The game is pretty much the whole time on a rail though, so in a sense it was easy to create such a detailed and pleasant scenery.\n\nI think this game is a lot underrated. I know about the problem with colorblind people. I am referring though to the game itself. The combat feels great, you feel every stab, every parry, combined with incredible graphics and animations. Online is also very nice to beat barbarians together with another player (Spartacus arena style :)\n\nThe problem is basically that even if the combat is very well made, is the same combat from the beginning till the end. No weapons, not a lot of skills to upgrade, no combos....but well, if you like the first part of the game and you don't get bored after the first 2 hours, it is unlikely that you will not like the rest. I loved the setting and the combat, but I would lie if I did not say that the combat becomes actually boring and repeated to nausea.....\n\n+ incredible graphics and animations\n+ great scenery (how many action games do we have in ancient rome???) and level design\n+ good combat feeling, challenging enough\n+ online multiplayer can be a lot of fun\n\n- combat is good but too repetitive\n\n78/100","February 21, 2015","true","22.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(Price Comparison)\n\nThe argument for gaming on a PC rather than a console is a pretty convincing one.\nIf you’ve got a modern gaming PC it will almost certainly bring more horsepower to the table than its console cousins, of course the down side to this is that a decent gaming PC is also likely to cost a lot more than a “Box of X” or a “Station of Play.”\nThis price of entry (amongst countless other things) contributes to the current dominance of the consoles.\n\n\nP.C. (Popular Consoles)\n\nWhen Little Johnny wants to start “gaming” with his friends, they’ll almost certainly have consoles, so naturally that’s what he’ll want too, which will likely set him on the path of console gamery for the rest of his playing days.\nOf course the reason that all his friends have consoles in the first place could be due to the reluctance of “The bank of mom and dad” to fund the cost of a gaming PC when they can pick up a console for half the price.\n\n\nP.C. (Potential Changes)\n\nAs PC gamers, we know this is a short sighted view; you can’t upgrade the guts of your “Wee Station Play Box One”, its technology is static, everyday it becomes a little more obsolete until finally the lifecycle of the console comes to an end and “SoMicronysoft” want you to invest in their new box of tricks.\nAll the while the PC gamer can continue to stuff new hardware inside his box whenever he feels the need; every day is like a new console release day to a PC owner.\n\n\nP.C.  (Perfect Choice)\n\nIf you’re willing to take the plunge into PC gaming, you’re entering a world of higher frame rates, sharper graphics, continual upgradeability without the need to “throw it out and start again” and a modding community the consoles can only dream of.\nIf that isn’t enough, look up any recent multiplatform release and I’ll bet the PC version is cheaper than its console counterparts.\nThese are just some of the reasons why I’m a PC gamer and a proud member of the glorious PC gaming Master Race.\n...but I do have a confession to make...\n\n\nP.C (Personal Confession)\n\nDespite everything I’ve written above, my PC gaming loyalty has been tested and I’m sorry to say I haven’t always been faithful.\n\nI’ve flirted with the Playstation, I’ve spent long weekends with the Xbox, I even had a brief fling with Nintendo (we all make mistakes) but even when those console temptresses were leading me astray with their joy pads I always knew that the PC was the one I was meant to be with, you know, deep down...\n\nWhy am I making this confession to you now?\n\nWell, my last act of PC gaming infidelity was the purchase of an Xbox One, It was just so tempting, all those Xbox exclusives whispering “play me now”\n\n...I was weak.\n\nOne of those seductive titles happened to be “Ryse Son of Rome.”\n\nRyse was an Xbox One exclusive launch title and ironically, although being one of the main reasons I bought the console in the first place, was never a game I actually got around to playing.\nThat is an oversight I’m happy to correct now that the game has finally made its way across to the PC.\n\n\nP.C. (Port Concerns)\n\nConsole ports always make me nervous; we’ve all played rushed conversions which haven’t been optimised properly for the PC.\nIt can be heartbreaking to see a game running as smooth as butter on your friends console only to have it stutter and lag on your top end computer.\nThankfully Crytek have done a fine job of bringing Rise Son of Rome across to the PC along with some extra content, FPS improvements and enhanced resolution options that most PC gamers expect these days.\n\n\nP.C. (Pretty Cinematics)\n\nDespite the time that has passed following the release of Ryse on the Xbox, the game is still beautiful to behold, especially on the PC.\nSunlight glints off armour, blood sprays through the air and moody facial expressions are abound.\nThe locations are equally spectacular, from cliff top outposts to the glory of Rome itself, everything is achingly beautiful to look at.\nAll of which makes Ryse a great game to watch, but is it fun to play?\n\n\nP.C. (Problematic Combat)\n\nThe combat in Ryse will remind you of the Batman titles, it’s mostly a block and counter affair.\nIt can be a lot of fun turning a sword aside with your shield and countering with a slicing strike that fells your enemy in a spray of blood.\n\nThis block and attack combat mechanic works well and is beautifully animated, which is just as well as you’re going to be seeing an awful lot of it through the 6-8 hours of play time on offer.\n\nBy the time you’re a few hours into the game the combat is going to start feeling a little repetitive, nothing new is really injected into the combat as you progress either which is a real shame, something a little different to break up constant doge, attack, dodge button mashing would have been very welcome.\n\n\nP.C. (Predictable Clichés)\n\nThe story itself is quite interesting , in a clichéd but beautifully presented kind of way.\nSet during the time of Emperor Nero, you’ll find yourself on a quest for revenge.\nA quest which mostly involves charging at the bad guys and killing them.\nWhen the gory blood fest comes to an end you’ll be rewarded with a cut scene to move the story forward a little.\n\nThe cut-scenes themselves are well voiced and again superbly animated; there’s even a little interference by some Roman "Spirits"  to add a little supernatural spice to the tale which is always welcome.\n\nThe game is heavily influenced by movies like Gladiator, I half expected Russell Crowe to pop up in a cut scene and give his "Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife" vengeance speech.\n\n\nP.C. (Player Concerns)\n\nMy biggest concern with Ryse Son of Rome is that I'm not sure if you'll be motivated enough to finish playing it.\nThe game play quickly becomes repetitive and the story might not be strong enough to keep you hooked even though the game itself is fairly short.\nIf you stick with it you’ll be able to finish the 8 chapter single player campaign in a weekend.\nThere is a multiplayer mode to give it a little extra shelf life if that's your thing.\n\n\nP.C. (Preferred  Controls)\n\nWhilst you can play Ryse with a mouse and keyboard I would recommend using a controller.\nClicking away with the mouse works perfectly well but this game was designed with the Xbox in mind and a joy pad feels like a much more natural way to control things.\n\n\nP.C. (Push Characters)\n\nBesides the blocking and attacking controls you can also shove enemies away which will make them temporarily drop their guard, you can also pull off "execution" moves by way of a simple colour coded quick time event during battle. This is a neat touch and leads to some pretty gruesome finishing moves.\nUnfortunately, even these "special" moves begin to feel samey and repetitive as you progress through the game, the fact that most of the barbarians you'll face are cookie cutter enemies and you'll find yourself killing the same character model with the same button presses over and over again really doesn't help.\n\n\nP.C. (Petty Criticism)\n\nThere's a constant deja vu feeling that the rinse and repeat combat mechanics create which only worsens the longer you play.\nHaving said all that, Ryse isn’t a bad game; my expectations were pretty high before playing which probably tainted my experience a little.\n\n\nP.C. (Pensive Conclusion)\n\nDespite its repetitive game play and it’s by the numbers plot there’s still plenty of entertainment to be found here.\nThe game does a good job of making you feel like a competent fighter as you slash and hack your way through an almost endless amount of Russell Crowe wannabies .\n\nVisually the game is stunning, I know.....

It is here to showcase the hardware of that system.\nDoesn't quite fit with PC though. The graphics are a lot worse if you can't afford a huge gaming computer to waste your life on. It is also quite impossible to play without a controller. An X-box controller would be a fine choise. I don't own any X-box related nonsense myself, so getting used to X-box buttons in a game where spamming the correct buttons in a battle is vital.\n\nThe game is quite short. Especially if you sprint through it. It seems to be a heavily cinematic game but everything happened quite quickly so it didn't feel very emmotional. Especially the beginning where the main character loses his parents.\n\nSpeaking of the main character, this young fellow Marius is a Roman legionary who magically survives everything and fights several hundreads of Barbarians with his sword that isn't even a Roman sword. He also has a beard, so he might be a Barbarian (Huge plotwist). No, not really but the game is full of such unrealistic facts, objects and actions. So it's a heavily fictional game, not for those who seek to enjoy the experience of our ancestors.\n\nAs an X-box launch title it is fine to showcase that console, as a Steam game, not so much.\n\n2.4/5","June 22, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Additionally, even though the game is short and plot is simple, Marius and Vitallion are memorable characters, mainly due to the pretty good voice acting.\nWhen it comes to the flaws, the game offers very simplistic fight model, low variety of enemy models and bunch of skilles QTEs.\nTo sum up, if you don't mind Call of Duty-like campaign and QTEs and look for short, bloody game with nice graphics and memorable characters, Ryse son of Rome is a good choice when it's on sale.","April 5","true","6.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Positioning isn't terribly important and you're not smashing horribly complex button combinations to juggle enemies like you'd expect out of the Devil May Cry series or Metal Gear Rising for example.\n\nYou're just left clicking for damage, right clicking to stumble / break guard, space bar for parrying enemy attacks, shift for dodging heavies, and QTEing executions. Targeting is completely automatic. On paper it sounds pretty disappointing, but when you're nailing down the timing on everything, building up 90x+ combos with a perfect chain and executing enemies with legendary timing, it just makes you smile.\n\nVery satisfying.","October 11, 2014","true","7.0"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

This game is bassically the spiritual successor of one of my favorite games, Spartan Total Warrior. It feels wonderfully familiar while at the same time feeling fresh. The controls are a bit to get use to at first but after about a good ten to fifteen minutes you start to comfortably get the hang of it. The graphics speak for themselves of course (Crytek always does an amazing job with their graphics) But what is great is that you can set the graphics quality to low and still get beautiful vistas, detailed soldiers and environments what have you. the art of this game is just magnificent as well from the large Crytek vistas to the little details like grafitti on the walls of buildings.\n\nThis game I can already tell though will suffer from repetivness rather quickly. The combat while feeling cinematic the whole way through will begin to stale as the game seems to be obsessed with kill moves. You dont have to finish every enemy with kill moves but it really doesnt make sense not to use them at the same time as that can just drag out fights. The story I can see will be short and sweet one as well. Which is a bit of shame seeing this is Cryteks first real action game, I feel the campaign can be longer already but on the plus side the Arena will help in justifying the price tag as you fight through wave after wave of enemies.\n\nSo overall, its a beautiful game, fun gameplay though it will get stale, a story that will most likely be too short but from what I see right now of it is pretty entertaining. And a multiplayer mode that if players take advantage of it will most likely prove to be a fun little alternative to anyone looking for a bit of a different experience, is it worth the $40 price tag? That is more or less up to you, I say yes but im already biased to the type of game this is and its setting. But anyone taht is on the fence should probably wait for it go on sale first.\n\nThe only true shame of the game is it never came with a demo, it is a bit of hefty game, and for anyone that is on the fence about getting it that would have definetly given them the most informed decision.","October 10, 2014","true","17.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Before anything else, this game looks gorgeous from both an artistic and graphical stand-point. Its rendition of ancient Rome, while perhaps not entirely accurate, looks great. The brutal executions that you perform while a mind-numbing large amount of debilitations make the mid-combat executions feel extremely satisfying.\n\nThat is, however, where the praises end. Enemy variety seems shockingly low. Granted, I haven't reached the end yet; but, I found the same bearded fat man with a shield about 20 times in the first 0 minutes of the game. Why is it that only bearded barbarians can hold a shield? I didn't look too closely, but I felt that the other throw-away enemies were also lacking in variety. I'm pretty sure, they have less faces and models than Rome Total War 2.\n\nGame-play feels relatively responsive, although the auto-aim for the javelins make ranged combat somewhat annoying. Execuations can be done for various bonuses and is also the only way to heal.  These make you invulnerable and proceed to give you a series of button prompts. Regardless of whether you hit the right buttons or not, the execution will happen. These look great both early and late game, but you will soon get bogged down with execution after execution until you just want to take a quick break during the sequence.\n\nThe story is vaguely reminiscent of the Gladiator movie with some supernatural twists. Voice acting and cut-scenes were well done although quite forgettable. Overall, this game is a 3/5 for me. It looks great when you first dig into it; but once the glamour fades away, all that's left is a shell of a game.","October 10, 2014","true","4.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It's all over the place. From 60fp, to 40fps, to 1fps in the space of a contextual execution. My library to date includes 2300+ games not including gaming platforms outside of Steam. This is as flaky as it gets, completely random and playing around with the settings makes nowhere near the impact which it should on performance as its not a hardware issue, it's quite clearly the game engine. Community hub is littered with similar complaints from people running the game on 970s & 980s and theres an absolute lack of support or acknowledgement of the issue.....\n\nand for that very reason I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone.\n\nEspecially frustrating here as the PC in question runs Arkham Knight at steady 30-60 fps with all gameworks settings and everything else maxed bar a few AA / AF settings, and has no performance issues with Crysis 3.","January 2","false","9.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The game is good as it stands, if you considerd good repeating the exact same thing for over five hours straight while staring through a mediocre storyline filled with cliches and absurdity all along.\nYou have the animations from combat being probrably five, five freaking animations for maybe six models for each enemy that you fight throughout the game. If that's not enought, you also have the game being a terrible port, running at thirty five fps in a system with eigh cores in it's cpu and four gb of memory in it's gpu.\n¿You're going to tell me i can run Battlefield 4 maxed out at a constant 60, but not Ryse?\n\nThe story is a pain to bear through, the characters are bland and boring, the storyline is you're classical revenge story, all of this because apparently there were a group of "barbarians"-wich are the main enemy-attacking Rome all at once, your family gets cought up in between the fight and what a surprise, you have the main character screaming for them in an absurd nonsensical and borderline hilarious way.\n\nI wasted time watching Steam downloading this game, i wasted even more trying different combinations to get a playable framerate-none of them worked-wasted even more trying to convince you in not buying this as it is.\nThis is a broken, blantant, commercial, absurd, cash in, it's a game that was made to show the power of the so called "next-gen consoles" and as an end result not only did it fail achievieng that, it also failed achievieng being a compell game to play.\n\nShame the concept offered a lot more, and the idea certantly could have being explored in a much better way.","December 19, 2014","false","6.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Graphically, it's a solid 10/10. The story, while slightly uninspired, is interesting enough to keep you moving through missions, but nothing you'll remember fondly. That said, the combat mechanics are quite dull after about an hour, and I found myself frequently shutting the game down, going to do something else to quell my boredom, and coming back later. As far as 'ranged' combat goes, I can honestly say that it is one of the most frustrating and broken mechanics I have ever seen in a game. On the topic of broken mechanics, you will often have Roman soldiers following you during missions, and as often as they are following you they will do absolutely nothing to help you. I often found myself fighting 6 or 8 enemies at a time while I had 8+ Romans following me. Fighting high volumes of enemies, being unable to break combat with them, having NPCs that do nothing to help, and being told that you need to fight a specific enemy in a small timeframe or fail your mission ultimately results in assured failure, and aggravating restarts.\n\nI had very high hopes for this game, and I am dissapointed. Poorly designed and implemented mechanics galore, useless NPCs, and repetitive enemies all make for an experiance that can be summarized simply as 'irritating'.","December 20, 2014","false","3.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Well, this is the game to get it done. Featuring unbelievably life like graphics, solid combat and blood aplenty this game is an amazing example of what to do right when porting a game to pc. It's solid. In my playtime I've encountered absolutely no bugs yet and the combat is meaty and well done. Executions are ripping and bone jarring and every hit has a solid impact.

Twice on Xbox One and once on PC. The game is definitely good, but has some very glaring flaws, especially the PC version, but more on that later.\nThis game looks absolutely stunning, without a doubt it is one of the best looking games ever made. The combat is brutal and satisfying, if a bit repetitious. The voice acting and animation are good.\nThe story however barely makes any sense. It's just plain bad. Also the game is REALLY short, it only takes about 5 hours from start to finish. And as for the optimization on PC... my system meets the recommendations (AMD FX-6350 @ 3.9GHz, 8GB RAM, R9 280) and the game really runs like ♥♥♥♥. It's constantly dipping under 30fps, which is almost unplayable. None of the graphics settings make much of an effect on the framerate, which leads me to believe that this game is VERY CPU heavy. All AMD users should beware before spending 40€ on this one. I'd say wait for a sale unless you have a powerful Intel CPU.\n\nEven though I like the game alot, I cannot recommend a game that is this poorly optimized on the PC.\n\nPS. Having later upgraded my PSU, Mobo, CPU (i5-4690) and GPU (GTX 980 Ti) it seems that this problem has nothing to do with CPU or even GPU. For some reason (at least if you're an Nvidia user) you HAVE to have Shadowplay ON in order for the game to run smoothly. What the hell, Crytek? I can only surmise this has something to do with the game being originally and Xbox One exclusive and Xbox One constantly records gameplay. Somehow having Shadowplay recording your gameplay on PC it fixes the horrible stuttering. Silky smooth now.","October 15, 2014","false","27.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The price I paid is too much for the beginning of the game, and, apparently you'd rather all the people who are impressed by your graphics and video promotions just stop buying games entirely.\n\nBut hey, you guys don't believe in industry so apparently it shows in your work, that you allow the testers who, anythingless than entirely difficult is easy to, define what easy means. Think about that: How can a person who really doesn't care about the story or those who don't play for the story be the one whose game play should define the game for those who play for the story?\n\nIt's okay, you ripped us off kiss your partner and your children laughing all the way to the bank, I get it, you're just thieves, you and Steam.\n\nIf you ever patch this game try making the adjustments I just described above, you'll be amazed how your "story mode" attracts a whole bunch more players and those disgruntled like me will be happy we can play further through the campaign and maybe even finish it, instead of feeling ripped off, remembering the name of your company, names of the Devs in the Credits, and deciding never to buy anything by you again. Just look at NCSoft and you get the idea what happens to companies who make a career out of listening to the wrong people in designing their games.\n\nOh, and anyone thinking I am being insulting, mean, cruel etc., remember I bought the game and we're exchanging money that these people get paid by to buy cars, pay for their homes, etc., money I could use for the same thing but due to paying out on games with no refund and where the developers cater solely to players much greater than me, I am ripped off. So until Devs can figure out how not to rip us off, viva la difference, we paid for the right to say what we want about the game. Hope this generation of "challenge means being beaten to death if you're not an elitist" Developers quits destroying the gaming industry, an industry that is the source of computer innovation, not by game difficulties but by people wanting better performing computers. That's the ramifications of incompetence from listening to the wrong people, a domino effect starting with no longer buying games to not needing to upgrade my computer since I am no longer playing games that require that kind of horsepower. But Forrest Gump has made it clear: stupid is as stupid does.\n\nDon't care who doesn't appreciate what I said here since single player gamer money remains top dog and if these businesses want that to stop then hey who are we to argue.\n\nLater....\n\nI finally got out of tutorial but i am at the part after the tower, where you have to take out the catapult and the archers who get to hide behind something and hit you while you aim make you fail. Thanks so much for so many archers and the 2 who take turns hiding the moment you aim at them and the other pops up and klills you.  That part about stupid is as stupid does is clearly the point to "easy" mode like this. What we need is for you to have to do puzzles like this to get your pay sent to the bank, and if you fail, you get nothing, sure you can try over and over but, once you're frustrated enough to say to the boss "Do we really need to do this? I already did my job," it'll maybe ding to you that paying the money for the game is me doing my job, and your making it impossible to see the story you have in this game because someone has a problem with people getting to actually play the game is that level of "stupid is as stupid does" that only makes us wish you had to do the same to get your pay in your bank account, to do a new puzzle, some "clever" player designed challenge that denies you your pay until you pass it.  I wonder how long before you rage quit and get a different job, more pay for less work is probably the goal right? So what makes you think the rest of us want your idea of difficulty foisted on us for easy mode? I don't care about your stupid idea of challenge, I just wanna get through and see more of the game's visuals. At $6.79 and a metacritic rating of 61 out of 100, it's clear you haven't a clue beyond what you want to do, not thinking for even a second, "Hey what if the players don't like it?" Thus the "stupid" part of "stupid" revealed for all to see.\n\nAnother game I bought to just play to a point and not play any further because the Developers never thought about anyone but 1% of the players, ignoring the 99%, as per usual.\n\nLater still.....\n\nI can't even damage Boudica, I can't defend myself from her attacks, I can't advance in the game passed this, and why? A: Devs who design for elitists, no one else, that's why. I want you to think what you'd do oh precious idiot Devs if Boudica was what stood between you and getting in your car, or entering your home, or using you remote on your television. Oh you say that's ridiculous? Well, you just want to go on with whatever you want to do, drive your car, enter your home, turn the TV on, heck they should put something like this to stop you from using your computer, your ipad, your phone as well, until you get the message: There's a story, I want to move on and enjoy the story, not be stuck with an unfinished story because you Devs were too stupid to think my paying for your product and picking easy mode means I want it more difficult than when you get in your car, enter your home, use your devices. Idiot Devs, that's the situation we have, the Starforge, the dying Space Engineers, the Kinetic Voids, etc., and it is this arrogance that you design for the 1% of players that makes game sales fall, makes the next game not sell well, makes an industry fail. Proud Devs, enjoy the investor money you knowingly stole because you don't even have a clue about the variety of gamers, just that 1% you are. But it's an old adage: Ignorance (in the most literal sense of the term) is bliss.\n\n\nIn looking for a solution...\n\n\nDevs, I am sharing a video for 2 reasons:\n\n1) The video is a completely different setting and everything than where I am fighting Boudica, and no idea why. I crossed the river supposed to kidnap her and her father, killed everything, was told to finish off the rest and am facing Boudica. No idea why it's completely different place etc.\n\n2) 50% of the comments are in complete agreement with what I've said above. So you can understand that you've either ticked off and/or chased away 50% of your potential market as a game company by making even easy mode against Boudica so hard that people are rage mad, http://youtu.be/E-g_YUWaBDo.\n\nI am sure you don't care because if you did it wouldn't be like this in the first place, but I figure you should know when your future games don't sell that this is why, that is if you want to know why instead of think another clever idea listening to the 1% will make things work, only to learn again it doesnt, but in pure insanity just do the same stupid thing over and over again, and that's why we won't buy your next game.

The hot buttons are ridiculous, they give you colours but don't tell you what they mean. controls are awkward and the involuntary locking onto enemies is too hard set, not to mention sometimes you are locked into combat with 4-5 enemies but randomly start attacking the ground beside them.  If you get someone pinned in a corner so they cannot move, but you stray outside that 3-4 button sequence, they'll dodge your strikes without actually moving.  It's even the exact same thing for bosses, you just need to learn their button sequence and repeat until they are dead.\n\nThe idea and especially the setting had promise, but the plot ended up being utterly ludicrous and stupid.\n\nOn the plus side, the graphics are really good, though they put all their effort into molding the 3-4 main male characters, the female characters are all just second rate. They put all their effort into modelling their breasts (which are always hanging out) and totally forgot about the rest of their bodies.  The characters themselves were so one-dimensional, I don't know why they put so much effort into modelling them realistically when they act like cartoons.\n\n1/10","January 6, 2015","false","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Each level has the same layout: Enter area fight a horde of same enemies in different skins until they are all dead; move to next area fight horde of enemies until they are dead; issue an abitrary command to some soldiers; defend area where soldiers aren't; walk with soldiers in a shield wall to next area; fight a few waves then a boss; rinse wash repeat. This would be okay if the game hadn't shipped at $59. I'd rather buy gauntlet for $19 do the same thing but at least have more variety and customization. This game would have been better as movie.

If your like me you slavered over the stunning visuals that Ryse, son of Rome boasts, and couldn't wait to buy the game and dive head first into the historical, fantastical action.\nI did just that and despite the gaming living up to the hype as far as graphics and voiceacting were concerned, it left me feeling somewhat deflated.\n\nFirsty, let me just say that I really, really really wanted this game to be good. the Cinematic nature appealed to me when I first saw the trailer and I have to admit, the assassin's creed style, press and watch, style of combat was very cool. For the first hour or so. Unfortunately, stunning visuals, and they are stunning by the way, did very little to distract me from what felt like a very rushed, flat storyline.\n\nThe protagonist worked well as a character, but his story arc was as bland as the art designer's choice of enemy types. The words copy and paste can't help but spring to mind after hacking down your fiftieth enemy who bears more than a striking resemblance to the last guy that tried to kill you.\n\nThe game just is not long enough either. I completed the campaign in around three hours, and although the developers clearly idended a sort of  gears of war esque co-op system for the multiplayer, it doesnt really provide any incentive to make you actually play with other people. You can literally do the whole thing yourself.\n\nFinally. My biggest gripe with this game was how shockingly innacurate it was historically. I must have missed the part in my history books at school where Boudica led a grand invasion of Rome from the back of one of Hannibals war elephants, which he had kindly lent to her for the weekend.\n\nAll in all this game promises a lot but delivers very little. Its redeeming features are few and far between and even if bashing your head aganst hordes of identical siblings for fun is your thing; Dynasty warriors fans i'm looking at you, you would be hard pressed not to be annoyed at Ryse son of Rome.\n\nTo buy or not to buy? That may be the question you are considering and the choice is of course your own, but if i were looking for a cool, visually stunning game with romans in I'd buy Skyrim, play as an imperial and try my best to ignore the Dragons.\n\nHappy Gaming.\n","January 19, 2015","false","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Campaign is repetitive and too short which seems odd to say, but I found the campaign not long enough and basically the same hack and slash fight over and over again. Graphics are stunning, story is ok. There could have been so many great things had this game attmepted to tackle them. I yearned for something more in the Coliseum. I ranked multiplayer 1v1 battle add on would be pretty amazing. They game feels rushed. Co-op multiplayer i boring and more of the same repeat. Why anyone would play it for an extended period I do not not know. If you are ok with putting about 10 hours into this game and never picking it up again it's fine.

Is this the future of beat 'em up/ hack n' slash games inherited by the post-God of War generation? What a drawback. The graphics, the sound FX and the animations are superb... But the combos don't feel rewarding, the difficulty ain't challenging, the game is very linear and present you with no choices at all... The camera is glitchy and sometimes it repositions itself on its own after an execution scene. The game lacks enemy models, you're gonna picture yourself fighting against familiar faces all the time, sometimes a whole wave of foes is composed of clones, hahaha. The multiplayer is only co-op for two players and looks destined to die away soon, so the single player campaing is all you got. Cheesus... Ain't worthy the full price, I've got it at 50% because of Summer Sale and still feel robbed. Also, the game fills 25 Gb of disk space. So much space for an average game.

If your like me you slavered over the stunning visuals that Ryse, son of Rome boasts, and couldn't wait to buy the game and dive head first into the historical, fantastical action.\nI did just that and despite the gaming living up to the hype as far as graphics and voiceacting were concerned, it left me feeling somewhat deflated.\n\nFirsty, let me just say that I really, really really wanted this game to be good. the Cinematic nature appealed to me when I first saw the trailer and I have to admit, the assassin's creed style, press and watch, style of combat was very cool. For the first hour or so. Unfortunately, stunning visuals, and they are stunning by the way, did very little to distract me from what felt like a very rushed, flat storyline.\n\nThe protagonist worked well as a character, but his story arc was as bland as the art designer's choice of enemy types. The words copy and paste can't help but spring to mind after hacking down your fiftieth enemy who bears more than a striking resemblance to the last guy that tried to kill you.\n\nThe game just is not long enough either. I completed the campaign in around three hours, and although the developers clearly idended a sort of  gears of war esque co-op system for the multiplayer, it doesnt really provide any incentive to make you actually play with other people. You can literally do the whole thing yourself.\n\nFinally. My biggest gripe with this game was how shockingly innacurate it was historically. I must have missed the part in my history books at school where Boudica led a grand invasion of Rome from the back of one of Hannibals war elephants, which he had kindly lent to her for the weekend.\n\nAll in all this game promises a lot but delivers very little. Its redeeming features are few and far between and even if bashing your head aganst hordes of identical siblings for fun is your thing; Dynasty warriors fans i'm looking at you, you would be hard pressed not to be annoyed at Ryse son of Rome.\n\nTo buy or not to buy? That may be the question you are considering and the choice is of course your own, but if i were looking for a cool, visually stunning game with romans in I'd buy Skyrim, play as an imperial and try my best to ignore the Dragons.\n\nHappy Gaming.\n","January 19, 2015","false","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Graphics are stunning, story is ok. There could have been so many great things had this game attmepted to tackle them. I yearned for something more in the Coliseum. I ranked multiplayer 1v1 battle add on would be pretty amazing. They game feels rushed. Co-op multiplayer i boring and more of the same repeat.

Is this the future of beat 'em up/ hack n' slash games inherited by the post-God of War generation? What a drawback. The graphics, the sound FX and the animations are superb... But the combos don't feel rewarding, the difficulty ain't challenging, the game is very linear and present you with no choices at all... The camera is glitchy and sometimes it repositions itself on its own after an execution scene. The game lacks enemy models, you're gonna picture yourself fighting against familiar faces all the time, sometimes a whole wave of foes is composed of clones, hahaha. The multiplayer is only co-op for two players and looks destined to die away soon, so the single player campaing is all you got. Cheesus... Ain't worthy the full price, I've got it at 50% because of Summer Sale and still feel robbed. Also, the game fills 25 Gb of disk space. So much space for an average game.

I did not 100% the skill tree, tho I got close but this was because i had absolutely no incentive to do so.\n* Short, I got over it in about 6 hours  and only died like once.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NetchFeverfew/recommended/302510/","NetchFeverfew","Netch Feverfew","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NetchFeverfew/","708 products in account","I wish there was a button that said, "Yes and No" on Steam.\n\nLet me begin by saying I'm not the biggest fans of action games. I feel Nathan Drake from Uncharted and Kratos from God of War are overrated characters that dwelled in the realm of fantasy. I liked Nathan Drake for being three-dimensional. Like a Doctor Who with feelings that is not bordering on whinging. Lara Croft from Tomb Raider left me with lurching feeling, even with the new, graphically improved version of her. That’s what I like about the new improved version of Tomb Raider. Kratos was one-dimensional. He sought nothing but revenge, just like the protagonist of this game.\n\nThis game suffers from several things: anachronisms, poor characterization, and repetition.\nI will commend this game’s beautiful graphics. Remember that this game was originally released on the Xbox One so, the graphics are extremely pretty. With the setting focused on ancient Rome, every nook and cranny felt wonderfully crafted. Even when the game takes you to Caledonia (Scotland) and Britannia (England), the world crafting feels lively, following traditions of Roman mythology and perception. Everything was era accurate in terms of the world. The swords, the shields, the vistas, the villas, the marketplaces, the cloth that people wear and the Coliseum were all breathtakingly beautiful that I felt that I was there.\n\nHowever, I was not. This game suffers from not poor writing but crap historical research. Without giving too much away, I will bring the name Boudica or Boudicea or whatever we are calling her now. She is a secondary antagonist in the game but her character suffers from such grand anachronisms that it makes me sick as a History graduate. Her father in the game is not her father. They ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ize her entire history to make this ill-conceived, water downed version of Boudica in this game. Sure, she fights like she is purported in the old realm of myth but I felt more slighted by the grave injustice they had done to her and her story.\n\nThen, there is the player character himself, Marius or, as I had previously thought, Ryse. It might as well be called “Ruse: Son of Rome” because they did not even use that ♥♥♥♥ing name, Ryse. Besides the dumb naming, he is such a one-dimensional character. Driven entirely by revenge, much like Kratos, he is pretty much like most Greek/Roman epic heroes. That’s why his character suffers because the linearity of the game only drives his one-dimensional characterization even further. They made Marius feel trapped and predestined for his fate in the game, which is like, again, most ancient Greek and Roman epics. Predestination in this game can be a great tool for characters to grow and it was unfortunate that the player character did not.\n\nAnd what also did not change was the fighting mechanics. It was brilliant. It felt smooth, intuitive and responsive. Every action you took with Marius felt epic and fresh. However, after the thousandth time you do an execution move against your enemies, it becomes stale. The repetition of the battles is tedious that it becomes a chore to fight. Sure, the story is convoluted but the battle is blocking your way in unravelling it. But it is so boring fighting hundreds of people, by yourself, with a lack of variety in the middle to throw you out of the loop. They throw in some basic puzzles but that isn’t enough. God of War was exemplary, carving out times for battling and puzzle solving in the game because the Gods of that game were toying with their creations. And even though man created the problems for the sake of this story, this game suffers from some serious problems in terms of pacing.\n\nEpic as this game may be, it is no Assassins’ Creed. It isn’t Tomb Raider, Uncharted, or God of War. It is a historically inaccurate game with poorly-shaped characters and repetition in gameplay. However, I am willing to give this a thumbs up, not because it is a good game but, because this was a test to stress the durability of one’s graphics card. The prettiness of this game in a historical setting made me happy. We rarely get a vision of the past in video games (except for Assassins’ Creed) but this game took it somewhere familiar.\n\nWe want a Ryse 2 but I hope not. I don’t want to see a sequel for another decade until Crytek resolves their storywriting division. They need to fix that.","November 3, 2014","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
