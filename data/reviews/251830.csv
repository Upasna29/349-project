It's pretty much a must buy, especially at this price. It's about a 4-5 hour game that will continuously make you smile. Where some of the frustration coming from the gameplay is mediated immediately by the hilarious characters and overall lighthearted feel of the game. It's like playing a comedy act, in a sense. It has an amazing artstyle, unique and very pretty. "So much art... such beauty" to paraphrase a certain seagull. The printscreens really doesn't do the game justice.\n\nThe gameplay consists of a mixture between platforming, point and click and stealth. It's fine, nothing incredible, but it does it's job. It isn't too hard to progress. It does suffer from having the game be in the way of everything else, where you just want to get past these annoying stealth sessions to get to the good/fun part. The writing and voice acting shined a lot brighter than the gameplay did. This made the mood go down a bit when if you're a complete ♥♥♥♥-up you will be stuck at a few points for a while, but as said before, the game will make it up to you with it's intelligent writing, more or less hilarious humor, artstyle, new and intriguing situations.\n\nBuy this game, now, please. Go do it. It's the most I've laughed in a game since Psychonauts and it's really something everyone should play. It's a game with personality, a personality you will like, and that's sort of rare. Have fun.","December 14, 2013","true","4.8"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","53","61","0","0"

The graphics reminded me of Psychonauts, another great game. That's also where the comparison (mostly) stops. Because this game is charming, fun and original, and it manages to do all that all on its own, without the need to copy from other popular games.\n\nYou play as Ray and early on in the story you manage to get an arm sticking out of your head. Not just an arm, it's actually an alien that makes use of your body. With this arm you can read the minds of other people to get hints on what to do next, but some of the people will also be reminded or think of certain events and that way items can be created.\n\nThe game plays like a platformer, but the gameplay itself is similar to that of a point-and-click adventure. Minus the frustrating, boring puzzles those games usually have.\n\nThe voices are done very well, with plenty of variety as far as characters go.\n\nIt's just a shame that this game is so short. A playthrough will last around 4 hours, which is enough, but it's not enough for a wonderful game like this. I enjoyed it all the way through and never got frustrated. That's partly the reason why I hoped it would last longer. Maybe for a possible sequel (the game does hint at one after all).\n\nA game like this should be a critical and financial success. It truly deserves to be. But I seriously doubt that will happen...\n\nAnyway, let's wrap this up. My verdict: Stick It To The Man is a must-play and must-own for any serious gamer !\n\n[Rating: 88/100]","December 19, 2013","true","5.3"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

Few games venture into the realm of comedy, but Zoink jumps in head first with no reservations. Every line and character is progressively more absurd than the last, with each joke zipping by so fast you might miss it if you aren’t paying attention but making it easy to enjoy the ride due to having little time to actually dissect what’s going on.\n\nstick it to the man pic 1If you were to break it down I doubt Stick It To The Man would elicit much more than a chuckle, but it’s how fully embedded it is in its ridiculous plot and satirical commentary that makes it all work. Every time I started the game it would take a moment to adjust to its outrageous style of humor, but a few minutes later I’d be sticking stickers all over things they don’t belong on and having an immensely good time watching the chaos unfold. Stick It To The Man is like a roller coaster that only goes up, with the stakes and quality of gags getting more and more insane the longer the game goes on even as you’re waiting for it to all come falling apart.\n\nThat’s not to imply Stick It To The Man is a particularly long game, clocking in around 3-4 hours, but it’s so densely packed that I think that’s all I could realistically take. It often felt like I’d been playing longer than I actually had simply do to how much stuff was always happening and continuing to happen even while I was trying to comprehend the scene before. It’s frankly a little exhausting to play, but in a way that makes you glad for its brevity because it ends right when you want it to.\n\nThere’s undeniably a lot of Stick It To The Man that’s little more than functional boredom, whether it’s the dull and obtuse puzzle designs or the few aggravating times you come across an enemy and have to manage the clumsy platforming controls to avoid them. There are only a few instances of this sprinkled throughout the game yet each always longer and worse than the last time you came across one. These scenes might work on a technical level, but there’s never any need for them to have been included.\n\nBut then everything circles around again to how delightfully written Stick It To The Man is even at its worst moments, and how that was more than enough to counteract its mechanical deficiencies for me. It’s as stupid as it is clever and delivered with enough style to make even the most cringeworthy joke work. Even though I can’t say I had a lot of fun playing Stick It To The Man, I was more than happy to spend some time reading the minds of its terrible, oh so entertaining hooligans.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NzuvA9nImg\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 13, 2015","true","3.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I simply can't leave this game uncommented even after only this little amount of time - here I'm sitting, listening to the menu music 4th time in a row. I actually listened it once in the menu before starting the game, it's so awesome (Just Dropped In by Kenny Rogers) The game is really promising - intresting paper world with lots of fourth wall breaking (Ray noticing about how absurd that he has to jump a lot to get to home during a tutorialish first level, checkpoints are photocopiers what prints you as respawning), really well-written and witty dialogues with puns, jokes, and don't forget about the great voice-acting!\nThe game itself is a little weird, it reminds me to some cartoons of the 90s in terms of graphics that's borderline bizarre and weird, but this also gives the game some uniqueness - speaking about being unique, don't forget the "giant pink spaghetti hand".\nSo far platforming mechanics are solid and controls of the character, including the arm are easy to get used to - the mindreading is a great idea, I'm really looking forward for some good laughs and creative problem-solving using this tool.\nI'm really looking forward to continue to play this game, but first I really need some sleep, I'll update the review probably after the completion the game and/or getting all achievements :)\n\nEDIT: Finally finished - 15.8 hours, with lots of afk/desktop running. I would say people are quite right when they say the game is ~ 5-6 hours long , but it really depends on you listening to every single person, or just skip it.\nThe game was fantastic, intresting and I'm especially happy that the story stayed just as solid at the end as it was at it's beginning. I've found quite a few instresting sentences, dialogues, pictures that made me laugh - I even got to save Santa! :)\nThe final level was outstandingly creative - don't want to spoil anyone's joy of exploration - I'll just say it can be hard with mothers  ;)\n\nStick It To The Man! was maybe the most unique game I've played in the past months, along with Jazzpunk.  This game was really a joy to play, always staying curious about what madness the developers put into the next scene.

Your main goal, thanks to being able to read their minds, is to help those in need with an 'extra' arm/hand that grew out of your head (weird, I know~!).

The paper art style is really amazing and the characters you meet along the way all fit the crazy and stylized look. Mechanics enhance the 2D platforming and support the humor of the diologue.\n\nThis is a truly funny game (if you like this kind of bizarre comedy) which is something that not many games can say about themselves.\n\nIf you liked Psychonauts at all, you will like this game. It has similar themes, style, humor, and even a similar name for the main character. The game is somewhat nostalgic with the paper/cardboard art and is very fun to play (if you don't mind being stopped to hear some minor characters engage in a bit of banter every two minutes).","August 29, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

On the run from a shady government organization he has to use his new found powers to read the minds of everyone around him, steal the thoughts from their minds and then use them to solve the obstacles between him and safety. The writing is some of the best I've seen in a long time, even just eavesdropping on people who have no relevance to your current obstacle is well worth the laughter it brings. There is a trailer. Go watch it, then go buy the game. The kind of cleverness and creativity on display here puts me in mind of Double Fine at their finest.

From the bits where you are knocked out and fight out of your own subconscious to reading people's minds to find out what they need or what they are about the story as a whole is light-hearted and funny.

This, combined with the world aesthetic can lead to some pretty extraordinary and hilarious situations. And when I say hilarious, I mean times I genuinely laughed at the clever dialogue and puzzles before me. I even went through and tried to find all the funny dialogue I could, which is quite the achievement.\n\nThe aesthetic for the game is a world made of paper, string to hold things in place, and stickers. With your giant purple hand, you can remove and place stickers in different situations to solve puzzles. For example, if you place a horse head next to a singer, she'll think she's being attacked by the mob, and scream, at which point you can take her screaming mouth and use it somewhere else. It's very creative, fresh, and compelling.\n\nThe story and characters were very likable, especially Ray. He wasn't a perfect person, but he made a perfect protagonist. Paired with lovely voice acting, it was truly something special.\n\nIf I had one problem with it, I would say that there were too many chase areas in the levels. While you could create a checkpoint after clearing it once, there were too few ways to solve them for the number of times it was iterated, and often was unreliable at times when trying to grab thoughts and hitting pins instead, resulting in a quick death.\n\nAll in all, this game was a nice experience. It didn't take too long to beat, around 5 hours, but the time I did spend with it was incredible. An excellent story wrapped up in a competent game with an amazing presentation.","September 23, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

They are in the vein of old adventure games, but use a consistent logic and are fun to solve. The game is a little on the short side, though. A fun and chill experience nonetheless, 10/10 would play again.","May 16, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The style of the game looks super realistically like a cardboard diarama and your job is to utilize stickers and pull back paper to solve the puzzles. The concept of the game is all about reading minds, solving peoples' personal problems, and an awesome little alien dude who needs to get back home. My only con is how short the game is, providing maybe grand total 2 hours of full game play with little to no replayability.

This, combined with the world aesthetic can lead to some pretty extraordinary and hilarious situations. And when I say hilarious, I mean times I genuinely laughed at the clever dialogue and puzzles before me. I even went through and tried to find all the funny dialogue I could, which is quite the achievement.\n\nThe aesthetic for the game is a world made of paper, string to hold things in place, and stickers. With your giant purple hand, you can remove and place stickers in different situations to solve puzzles. For example, if you place a horse head next to a singer, she'll think she's being attacked by the mob, and scream, at which point you can take her screaming mouth and use it somewhere else. It's very creative, fresh, and compelling.\n\nThe story and characters were very likable, especially Ray. He wasn't a perfect person, but he made a perfect protagonist. Paired with lovely voice acting, it was truly something special.\n\nIf I had one problem with it, I would say that there were too many chase areas in the levels. While you could create a checkpoint after clearing it once, there were too few ways to solve them for the number of times it was iterated, and often was unreliable at times when trying to grab thoughts and hitting pins instead, resulting in a quick death.\n\nAll in all, this game was a nice experience. It didn't take too long to beat, around 5 hours, but the time I did spend with it was incredible. An excellent story wrapped up in a competent game with an amazing presentation.","September 23, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/251830/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Stick it to the Man! is an adventure game, using 2D puzzle-platforming as the vehicle for its clumsy humor. You'll solve puzzles by reading people's minds, and manipulating them into thinking about a certain item that you can use somewhere else on the chapter. It's certainly not a hard game, with it nicely structured levels, always subtly guiding your way, never proving frustrating.\n\nIt's been said to be "Psychonauts" spiritual successor. While I have not played Psychonauts, I've played other Double Fine games, and the influence is clear! While the game mechanics don't seem to take the spotlight, they're very well conceived, and fit very well with the game's theme and aesthetics. It was one of the more enjoyable games I've recently played!\n\n\nPresentation\nThis is probably the highlight in this game. Everything from the visuals, to the music and the voice acting is awesome!\nIt's a very colorful game, done in 2.5D. This is achieved by making every sprite like a cardboard cutout. The levels are then set in layers. While the game is mostly 2D, you can sometimes walk back and forth, discovering some charming details that would otherwise be blurred.\nThe character design is also great. While everyone looks silly, their designs clearly shows their personality, coupled with the problems you'll solve and the voice acting... It's good.\n\nThe music is mostly jazz (it reminded me of the bebop soundtrack in Grim Fandango, maybe a bit silly at times) with a bit of sci-fi synth thrown in, at times. I really liked it, and it's certainly something that not only fit the game, but it's also something I'll listen to after I'm finished with the it! (You can get it here: http://stickittotheman.bandcamp.com/releases with a PayWhatYouWant model)\nThe sound-effects Also fit well with the cartoony style. Never felt out of place, so that's good.\n\nThe voice-acting was also great! Reinforcing the characters and the overall feel of the game, and was mostly well done! There were a few characters that felt a bit inconsistent, but nothing too major. Also, you can rewind and fastforward their speech, making the voices even sillier, with a higher tone, if you're in a hurry. It's these details that make this game so enjoyable, honestly!\n\nThe game's writing is great as well! It's not anything deep, as you can imagine (although it does hint at some major issues, in a very lighthearted way), but it's certainly funny, if you're into this kind of humor.\n\n\nGeneral Structure\nThe game's divided by chapters, each with its theme, set of characters and puzzles. You can always go back to previous chapters through the menu, so you don't need to worry about missing an objective and being blocked from going back. This is something I very much appreciate! I hate being blocked for apparently no reason.\nMost of the chapters also have some achievements. Most of them are just a guide to silly characters that were more well hidden. It's a good use of them, to be honest! There are a couple of them that were more skill-based, if you're into that. But the Stick it to the Man! is a very laid-back game, and it never really tests your skills or patience.\nEach level has lots of checkpoints, and you'll never lose any progress. The worst that can happen is you being sent a few meters back, but you never lose items or conversations.\n\nEach level is about 20-40 minutes long. It felt just the right length for me. I played each chapter in one sitting, sometimes 2, and it never felt too short or to drag on. Also, since the levels can be fairly long, walking back would be a pain. As such, they've implemented a sort of fast travel system. Once you reach a certain point, a pipe open up, and you can go back instantly (and go forward once again).\n\nIt's a very comfortable game to play, as weird as it sounds. It's never frustrating, you're unlikely to walk around back and forth pointlessly, it's not punishing... just a nice, funny experience, overall.\n\nMechanics\nBasically, you're hit on the head, and an alien just happens to casually get into your brain. When that happens, a giant floppy pink hand grows out of your head, which only you can see. Nah, of course you're not crazy! It's alieeeens.\n\nAnyway. This giant hand gives you the ability of reading people's minds, and materialize their thoughts. As freeing as it sounds, it's a very "linear" game. They'll only think of things you need, of course.\nWhen you encounter a character, you'll learn about their problems, and then have to find the solution, somewhere. The game's is very similar to a point n' click. However, while the solution aren't too obvious, at first (since they're very non-sensical -- in a good way!), you can easily find everything by walking around and getting more items. If you have more than one, you'll store them, and can switch between them with the mouse-wheel.\nIf you stay put, your character will also say something about the item, leading you in a general direction. There are also very subtle environmental hints, so I doubt you'll get stuck.\n\nSo yeah. You'll walk around the level, speaking to the characters and reading their thoughts, often leading to some very peculiar situations, as you solve their problem in funny ways.\n\nAgain, it's not a game you'd play for the mechanics, but they're still very well put together! They fit with the theme, and even amplify it, never proving a nuisance, unlike other games in a similar style. It's very well designed!\n\n\nIt's pretty hard for me to get more to talk about. The game is very good, but it doesn't seem to do anything that jumps out at you. Everything just seems to fit together brilliantly, to me.\n\nFor an adventure game, the 2D platforming certainly helped, against the traditional Point n' Click style\nUsually, games like this opt for the point n' click genre, rather than 2D platforming. As a result, their movement system is also very clunky and slow, going around the screens, taking seconds of waiting at a time. Stick it to the Man! avoids that entirely, by giving you total control at all times!\nIt makes the game incredibly better, in my eyes. It's not that I have anything against Pn'C games, but I usually find myself frustrated when I have to walk back and forth very slowly, simply to try a random combination of items.\nThis game, however, makes movement faster, and every scene seems to have some little detail that makes the walking around even more enjoyable.\n\nLack of punishment\nThere are games that benefit from being punishing and challenging. This is not one of them, and the developers recognized it very well. It's not that there isn't any challenge. There certainly is (mostly by being chased around the guards -- which people didn't enjoy very much!), but even if you "fail", you don't lose progress, and the more challenging sections are short, just keeping things varied.\n\nThe puzzles keep moving you forward\nLast point I want to make. You rarely have to backtrack to solve a puzzle, at least to the point of annoyance. You'll usually gather items as you go, and use them either very near the place, or further ahead. On the times you do have to go back, the solution are clear, and there's usually an easy game to get back. Again, the point of the game is to present you with a silly story and character interactions, and it does that very well!\n\nConclusion\nI don't have anything else to say, honestly. I really, really enjoyed the whole way through. It's on the short side, but it's certainly worth it. If you like Double Fine's games (the Stacking and Grim Fandango particularly coming to mind -- And Psychonauts for most people), give this one a go! I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\nEven if you don't... if the description sounds appealing, I still recommend it. It's just a very good game!","January 16, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player controls the main character Ray, who has a glowing purple space spaghetti thing sticking out of his head. Ray uses this to read the minds of other characters. In pursuit of his own goals Ray must help other characters fix their life problems which are usually quite humorous (though sometimes I found them pretty sad). Most of the gameplay consists of simple platforming in the pursuit of various items and characters. There are sections where Ray must avoid enemy agents. These sections can be pretty tough in the last couple sections, but death just results in you being printed out of a nearby Mr. Copy so its not that frustrating.\n\nThe game looks and sounds amazing. The soundtrack has a lot of jazz numbers with sprinkles of other stuff like disco or Mickey Newberry's "What Condition My Condition Is In". It all fits well with the environments and mood of the game. The paper cut-out look works great and is bright and colorful. Also this game could run on a toaster. I was downsampling from 4K and it was still running at 80 fps.\n\nWhere this game really shines is the writing and humor. All the characters, even the most minor ones have a real personality to them. I was laughing within the first minute and proceeded to do so for the entire game. There were even some moments that found a way to be funny, sweet, and sad all at the same time. That and a heavy dose of self-awareness make a really compelling experience.\n\nI clocked in around 4.5 hours for my playthrough but it is definetly worth it for the price.","May 14, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, I did not regret my purchase of this game at all. Worst case scenario for you: Just buy it on sale, and you should have no issues.\n\nThis game is so unique and drew me in much more than I expected. The story, from a high-level perspective, is a bit cheesy, and the villain of the game is also somewhat annoying and lacks thrill, BUT that is intentional to fit with the overall style of the game. It is really off-the-wall, filled with random silly jokes and a good bit of dark humor (a couple of places are surprisingly dark), but it all flowed together, in an intentionally messy way.\n\nThe art is in this paper and sticker format, which actually was done in such a way that I enjoyed it very much. It was not tacky at all. Everything is very well drawn, and a good amount of the level design and characters have this interesting sort of dreary, grimy look. Some items, buildings, people, and so on, are brighter and stand out from everything else that has a background tone or shading, but the background itself is really detailed and by all means should be looked at just as much as the stuff with which you interact.\n\nThe theme song of the game was a very good pick, and the sounds and music as you play are pretty simple in most places, but also enjoyable. I did not have a problem with anything that I heard in the game. Then you have the voice acting, which was amazing. So many characters voiced by a small amount of people, and they were definitely unique as well. I didn't notice any characters sounding too close to each other.\n\nThe game itself is split into chapters, or essentially levels, and you must explore the levels and solve small puzzles where other characters are wanting specific objects. You must find the objects either lying around somewhere, or by obtaining them from other characters. As you help certain characters out, they will sometimes do things like break/open doors for you to continue on in the level, or end up giving you another item that you will have to figure out how to use. While the general idea is simple or not necessarily exciting, the game really benefits from its style as mentioned above, as well as the actual gameplay of how you will do the puzzle-solving.\n\nYour character, Ray, has an accident and ends up with a weird arm sticking out of his head, which in and of itself allows for the gameplay. The game is an interesting mix of platforming and point-and-click, where you use your mouse to control the arm and grab objects that you need, as well as do something stranger: read other characters' minds. When you read their minds, you will sometimes just hear thoughts and jokes, while other times will give you hints about what to currently do in a level (e.g., what a character might be looking for), or even end up having a character release a thought cloud which contains an item that you can grab and carry with you.\n\nDon't worry, though: You shouldn't get bored by the above, as the level design and characters are very interesting (as I know I have said multiple times so far), and just about every time you give an item to someone, a cutscene will occur showing some wacky events happening that will very likely make you laugh (assuming you enjoy the humor of the game). Hence, I had fun every single minute of the game, running around and figuring out what to do with so many weird items and people you encounter.\n\nAgain, I will say that the game surprised me. I watched some of the trailers and thought it seemed really odd, and maybe funny, but I didn't go in with any fancy expectations. It turned out to be a lot more than what I felt while watching the trailers. So, unless you absolutely hate the scenes in the trailers, I would say to give the game a chance, even if you are on the fence or somewhat unsure. I expect that you will also be surprised like I was. I really recommend this game.","March 31","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a puzzle platformer that's more of a point-and-click, but neither of those facets of the game aren't super successful.\n\nThe main mechanics of Stick it to the Man! are reading people's minds to gather information and manipulating the world by peeling off stickers and placing them on other things to solve problems, all while avoiding government agents out to get you.\n\nThe mind reading part is tedious. The voice acting is great, but some characters speak very slowly and by the time you finish reading the subtitiles, the character is only halfway through his or her speech. Dialogue cannot be skipped in pieces or scrolled through, only sped up or skipped entirely.\n\nThe puzzles themselves aren't anything special. One of the recurring "puzzles" (if you may call it that) is escaping the agents trying to get you. I didn't enjoy any of these segments. I'm assuming the game expects you to cleverly sneak around the enemies, placing stickers on them to make them fall asleep or distract them. However, this is usually impossible to do as you can't see all the agents on the screen at once and you have only a few seconds before they notice you and start chasing you around. It's much easier to just run to the other side than trying to spend time sticking stickers on people and getting caught.\n\nStick it to the Man's strongest element is its art style. The character design is amazing as every character looks unique with a different personality. Everything has a cardboard or paper-y texture, but it's different than, say, Paper Mario. It's almost as if the game would be stronger as a cartoon instead of a video game, or maybe if the focus was more on a point-and-click style than a platformer.\n\nOverall, I don't think I can recommend this game as a game, but, if you like art and design, it might be worth it to at least try it.","July 2, 2014","false","4.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

There are some platforming challenges involved, but calling them "challenges" is really stretching the definition of the word. The whole thing definitely leans on the casual side of the gaming fence, but what it lacks in challenge it more than makes up for with a great soundtrack, stylized and attractive visuals, and writing/voice acting that at the least got me to smirk for most of my playthrough if not made me laugh out loud a few times.\n\nA short but thoroughly enjoyable experience and a game I'd highly recommend giving a shot.","December 31, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I enjoyed my time, but I can only recommend the game if you like a style and bizzare sense of humor (it's a pretty short game, you need 4-5 hours to finish it on your first playthorugh).\n\nI like a style and a humor, and first couple of levels are very-very fun. Cut-scenes are fun and the game doesn't show you the same cut-scene if you die. If you replay some level, press backspace for 5 seconds to skip.\n\nVoice acting is very good, and most of the dialogs are funny. And you can hold 'd' to speed up the speech if you are bored.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of things I didn't like: it can be a problem with my PC, but controls feel clunky to me. I spend a lot of time retrying jumps of moving platforms. And I am not a new person to the platformers genre. Controls aren't rebindable (at least from the menus). Sometimes you think you can make the jump, but the platform is a bit far away. This won't be a problem, but you have goons in this game.\n\nFirst two or three encounters with goons are good. However, after some time goons are not fun anymore. I just hoped it's the last goon on this level. Good thing you are not forced to do the same section more than once, developers provides you short cuts after you beat the section.\n\nAnd the last thing: I liked some quests, but a lot of them are illogical.

However I was taken by surprise. This is not a point and click adventure game - it's a platformer and a damn good one at that!\n\nThere are some really tricky platforming challenges throughout the 9 chapters. You will be swinging and jumping from platform to platform to out run the bad guys. The actual puzzles in the game are more trial and error, there were moments where I was absolutely stuck and couldn't work out what to do next,  and had to result to just spam clicking each object in hope something happened.\n\nControl wise, very simple. I used the Xbox controller and had absolutely no problems at all. I can imagine it would be a little more difficult with keyboard and mouse, but name me a platformer that isn't like that.\n\nThe story is actually quite enthralling as well.  I didn't really think that such a simple looking game would have such a fulfilling story.  I couldn't wait to find out how the game ended.

Stick it to The Man! is an alternative graphic style game which is pulled off really well, (As well as the protagonist pulls walls off buildings) and I mean really, really well. The music is nice and fitting as well, and the voice acting is of good quality, but that's as far as this game goes. The storyline, I honestly believe they just made it up as they went along, and the dialogue is often cheap, (I'm willing to forgive them for that though, they had to include some cheap dialogue to have as many jokes as what they did (and they had a lot, mostly irony and dark humour, but some satire against popular culture as well) prepare to be pun'd) but the most disapointing part of the game is the gameplay itself, it is literally just a combination of zelda style item collecting / trading, and hostile encounters that pretend to add gameplay, but aren't very well expanded on. This game isn't a puzzler, it's a storyline grind without a storyline, and for that reason I give it a thumbs down, but if it were the free online flash game that it is meant to be, then even if the graphical fidelity wouldn't be nearly as amazing, it would do really well. If you are buying games full price; avoid this game.\n\n[EDIT] I forgot to mention, this game does work extremely well with a gamepad, so if you can, then use one.","December 27, 2013","false","6.7"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","1"

You play as a dude who has an alien in his brain, which gives him mind reading powers and, since the alien is basically a stretchy arm, the ability to jump between platforms and grab things like stickers.\n\nThere is a lot of dialog, which might not be unusual for an adventure game, but I feel like I'm never really playing the game. I was unexpectedly shuffled out of a level without being able to finish all of the tasks, because there was no indication to which tasks were the important ones. The game is full of strangers in the city that you have to help, as you run from some bad guys trying to catch you because of the alien attached to your brain.\n\nTo find out what each stranger needs, you have to read their minds with the sticky arm, which is a really cool, unique feature. But like I said, it slows down the game play so much and a lot of the tasks feel really pointless. The graphics are awesome as well, and I love the paper world feel. But the platforms are easy to jump between, or just frustrating when you've got identical bad guys chasing you so that rather than enjoy the new area you just discovered, you have to instead rush through it to get away.\n\nI really want to love this game, but it's almost impossible. Also, the adventure puzzles are really easy to solve. Once you read everyone's minds, it's really easy to see that you just visit a bunch of places in order and grab the stickers from them and put them elsewhere.\n\nAnd this one is really just my opinion, but the characters are so overly dramatic and cliche that I find it grating. I realize they're probably like this on purpose, but for a game with more adult themes it's weird how cartoonish and childish the cast is.\n\nIf you really want to experience this game, maybe wait for it to go on sale. Who knows? You might really like it. It's not a horrible game, but definitely not one I would recommend to buy at full price.","December 16, 2013","false","1.5"," 10 of 33 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","10","33","0","0"

This is a story of paper men living in a sidescrolling world, and they know it. The hazmat container only drops in the first place because the paper airplane carrying it falls apart in a storm.

Many other outspoken modern titles manage to do a lot less with a lot more resources in this regard, while SITTM characters are imbued with actual character thanks to the actors. This being said, some characters speak a bit slowly so they're king of a chore, however you'll promptly realize you can control voice pitch with A and D keys.

With the help of these stickers you solve all the "puzzles" in the game. I put puzzles in quotations because they're not real puzzles, there is basically no thinking involved, you just try sticking every sticker where it is possible and you solve it, that's all there is to it.\n\nSimilarly, there is no difficulty involved with the platforming in the game. And sadly the same goes for avoiding the enemies. They move in predictable patterns and it's easy to lose them even if you get spotted, that means that you're just going thorugh the motions most of the time.\n\nDespite all that the story, dialogue and art style are here to save the game. It's hard to do humour in video games and Stick it to The Man! manages just that quite often. I am not talking about laugh out loud moments, but I was most certainly entertained throughout the game, even if there is a bit too much of listening to oneliners when you're reading people's minds. Finally, the art style alone is worth checking out, it gives the illusion of everything being made from paper or carboard and it achieves a very nice effect which doesn't get old until  the end.\n\nI couldn't recommend the game based on the gameplay alone, however the style of the game is absolutely worth checking out.\n\n6½ / 10","March 4, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, perhaps not everything.\n\nThe game opens with Ray, the player character, whose job is testing hard-hats. The symbolism behind Ray’s career is soon apparent when an accident occurs that leaves him with severe head trauma. The moral? Wear a hard-hat on construction sites, literally. While not offering a great deal of difficulty with its platform-style mechanics, Stick It presents gamers with something refreshingly unique in a video game – a comedic look at the tragic effect of a decadent society on the mental health of its members. Ray’s ability to read minds and the obstacles that follow as the result of the accident become a constant, subconscious reminder to always keep your head, i.e. mental health, protected.\n\nWhen Ray wakes up, he a notices that there is a neon-pink arm sticking out of his head. This chimerical arm is your best friend. The arm gives Ray the ability to read minds and navigate the game space. It also serves to help Ray rip stickers (in traditional puzzle solvers these would be the “items” in your inventory) out of the game world as well as NPC minds, and stick them in different places to solve puzzles. Ray, however, finds the protuberance alarming and sets off to find a way to get rid of it. As no one else can see it but himself, Ray’s first plan is to head to a psychiatrist who, we soon see, needs more help than he does.\n\nThe game is divided into ten chapters in which Ray is faced with several obstacles to moving on to the next stage. Ray gets around these hindrances by helping other characters with their troubles – and a colourful cast of oddballs it is who require Ray’s help. From a suicidal taxi driver who wants a new set of teeth to a woman with an abandonment complex who prefers her pets taxidermied, Stick It leaves no allusions to obsessive compulsions or mental ailments untouched. The game does not stop there. The social stigma that accompanies those with mental disorders is also represented by a cast of mental institution staff and law enforcement officials who are constantly chasing Ray and locking up those who are deemed unfit.\n\nStick It does not suggest slapping stickers on, what are serious problems in real life, as a solution. That would be all too easy. What Stick It does do, is create a turbulent backdrop of a modern city with the imaginative use of art and colour in order to present, and make you think about, a tragic social problem. More importantly, it does so in a game that is packaged with distinct style, charming characters, comedic dialogue and a genuine, if naïve, notion that love will conquer all.\n\nI say play it.\n","August 27, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absurd, rather odd, and perhaps just a bit deserving of the mad house at times, but completely worth it. Especially the bit where you play through the mad house. In all honesty, I did get frustrated at times because that one miner guy didn't seem reachable, but I really do think that it is worth playing. Stick it to The Man! was an impulse buy for me, and I enjoyed it more than any game since Voodoo Vince on the original Xbox. That includes my fave games, the Portals.

I played it twice back to back, thought it was stellar twice, and have already shared it with all my friends IRL. Now I am sharing it here, so stop reading this thing, buy the game, and play it already!","June 27, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get into an environment and you connect a few dots. None of it is too complicated.

The environment is full of little yuks and fun things along the way. You know, content. You're doing the puzzles to keep getting through good content. You're not juggling a dozen puzzles and hints at a time. So as a puzzler alone, maybe it's less than one might expect.

It's a 2-D puzzle platformer, which I'm usually not too fond of, but in this case, I didn't mind it.  The main draw of this game is its sense of humor.  The $15 price tag is a bit high, but then again I say that about 90% of the games I play.\n\nThe game plays fairly nice.  There's a bit of platforming, but it really isn't that challenging.  Some of the sections with enemies can be a bit tricky, but after a few attempts you can develop a strategy to get around them.  There are also puzzles which revolve around reading people's minds and moving stickers to manipulate the world around you.  The puzzles are really easy, as long as you're careful when exploring the levels.\n\nThe story's pretty good.  You're a guy named Ray, who got hit on the head after returning from work.  When you wake up, you realize that you have a hand sticking out of your head.  This hand can be used to grab stickers, pins, and read other people's minds, all of which are used to solve puzzles.  The story is unique, the dialogue is quite funny, and the voice acting is pretty nice.\n\nIf I had to make one complaint, it’s that the game is rather short.  It only lasted about 5 hours for me, and I even got all of the achievements.  What the game has is fine, but a little more wouldn’t hurt.\n\nOverall, I would suggest picking this game up.  It will make you laugh, plus the achievements aren't too bad to 100%.  I just wish it was a little bit longer.","June 3, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In case of the one here we have a Puzzle - Platformer like game, with some adventure elements. If that does sound awfully broing to you hang on! It's not (ya I was kinda surpised myself). While the main thing you do in the game is running and jumping around there are a few unique and very interesting elements. I do not want to spoil the games story here so I'll just say this: You solve each level by reading the minds of people and tearing parts of the world apart.\n\nThe story itself may not be deep but in conjunction with the graphical appearance of the game it is hilarious (and really, really weird at times). You'll probably never loose your smile playing the game, wich will probably entertain you for 5 to 6 hours if you do not use any guides (wich you shouldn't). Furthermore you'll have a lot of stuff to find, explore and see on your journey, if you pay somewhat close attention to the Dialogues (or monologues....), easter eggs and style. The (amazing) graphical style does go hand in hand with the games mechanics as well. The voice acting is flawless and all together I can't see anything else but a game that shows you all the love going into it.\n\nNow it certainly is stuffed with weird humor you need to get used to but it is worth it.","July 6, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That was one of the games I grew up on.  I also recall Earthworm Jim on the Sega Genesis as well (one of the games available on Sega Channel).  I bought this game because it looked to be about as silly as both of those games.  And it was.  Contrary to what the negative reviews say, I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes.  As for the title song, it fell flat for me when I listened to it on it's own; however, as a theme/title screen song for the game it fits in well.  The music for the rest of the game (during the levels) was far better though.  Overall the experience was enjoyable.\n\nThe puzzle solving in this game is unique.  It definitely wasn't what I was expecting, but it was by no means unwelcome.  However, there are a few levels that, taken as a whole, could have been reworked.  These are the levels where there are little to no puzzles.  It wasn't disappointing to me because they fit well with the storyline.  I also make it a point to go into a new game with minimal expectations, but if I was expecting lots of puzzles those levels might disappoint me overall.  The main drawback for me is short term replayability.  I'm expecting to finish out the Steam Achievements in maybe another playthrough or two.  I got nearly half of them already and I'm on the final chapter during my first playthrough.\n\nOnce I'm done with the Steam Achievements, I probably won't play this game again in the near future.  However, I will definitely come back to it from time to time.","March 2, 2014","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My biggest complaint that I can make is it may be possible to get the same amount of enjoyment from watching as from playing, but the quirky humor is what won me over.\nI've only played through the first level, but so far, I've witnessed a man getting broken up with, used his tears to aid a crazy cannibal chef, took a human arm and used it to coax an alligator out of hiding, took the alligator's teeth and gave them to a dog to ward off some kidnappers, used a portable hole to free a man from a trunk near the kidnappers so the man can win a dancing contest which causes another man to swallow his teeth which I then gave to a man to prevent himself from commiting suicide because his girlfriend is incredibly shallow and only cares about shiny teeth. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go see a shrink, but first I need to give a ghost legs and steal a smile off of a proud father's face.","January 15, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Set up in a paper world (which reminds me Little Big Planet a little), enables new possibilities - like ripping off some loose paper to uncover what's beneath, or using the stickers to change what's going on around. Also, the story and riddles are enjoyable.\n\nI must say that I was first dragged to this game by "Just dropped in (to see what condition my condition was in)" song by Kenny Rogers, which in my mind is strongly connected with "The Big Lebowski" movie - so I expected that the game will remind me it somehow. Well... one may say that there's some similar sense of humour - and it could remind a trippy dream of the Dude, which was accompanied with the song.\n\nFor a short puzzle platformer - it's very strong position, which I would strongly suggest you to play.","January 4, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although this game is fun and at times challenging its not something i can seee myself putting hours into, it's just not quite diverse enough. It would be nice if it wasnt so linear, maybe more toward scribblenaut's sanbox style, being able to place stickers not just where you are supposed to but other places to open alternate routes or just to have fun would be a nice touch. All in all a good game, i'll be keeping an eye open for future offering from this developer.","December 20, 2013","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be it the smooth jazz tracks playing in the background, or the delightfully strange and wonderful characters inhabiting an equally kooky cardboard-cut-out universe.\n\nReading others’ minds is a voyeuristic pleasure, especially when the dialogue is brought to life by genuinely amusing and convincing voice acting. The artwork and art direction are on point, too. Designs and illustrations are reminiscent of 90’s cartoons, a la Rocko’s Modern Life and Ren & Stimpy. I particularly enjoy the portraits that adorn the map screen for any given area.\n\nA lot of care has been taken to ensure the player is thrust into a lively, yet bizarre rendition of a down-town, American city. A game highly recommended for anyone wanting to jump into something fun, light-hearted, and completely silly, which also sports incredible polish.\n\n[Edit: After completing the game]\n\nWhat an incredible ride!

This game allows the player to enter the mind of most any biological being, dead or alive, and therein the game shines!\n\nThere's rich little mini-stories that are perfectly done, and I almost believe that the writers knew about their main story as being straight-forward, so they decided to sprinkle the whole thing with entertaining sub-plots throughout, making an entertaining ride.

It's a 2-D puzzle platformer, which I'm usually not too fond of, but in this case, I didn't mind it.  The main draw of this game is its sense of humor.  The $15 price tag is a bit high, but then again I say that about 90% of the games I play.\n\nThe game plays fairly nice.  There's a bit of platforming, but it really isn't that challenging.  Some of the sections with enemies can be a bit tricky, but after a few attempts you can develop a strategy to get around them.  There are also puzzles which revolve around reading people's minds and moving stickers to manipulate the world around you.  The puzzles are really easy, as long as you're careful when exploring the levels.\n\nThe story's pretty good.  You're a guy named Ray, who got hit on the head after returning from work.  When you wake up, you realize that you have a hand sticking out of your head.  This hand can be used to grab stickers, pins, and read other people's minds, all of which are used to solve puzzles.  The story is unique, the dialogue is quite funny, and the voice acting is pretty nice.\n\nIf I had to make one complaint, it’s that the game is rather short.  It only lasted about 5 hours for me, and I even got all of the achievements.  What the game has is fine, but a little more wouldn’t hurt.\n\nOverall, I would suggest picking this game up.  It will make you laugh, plus the achievements aren't too bad to 100%.  I just wish it was a little bit longer.","June 3, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be it the smooth jazz tracks playing in the background, or the delightfully strange and wonderful characters inhabiting an equally kooky cardboard-cut-out universe.\n\nReading others’ minds is a voyeuristic pleasure, especially when the dialogue is brought to life by genuinely amusing and convincing voice acting. The artwork and art direction are on point, too. Designs and illustrations are reminiscent of 90’s cartoons, a la Rocko’s Modern Life and Ren & Stimpy. I particularly enjoy the portraits that adorn the map screen for any given area.\n\nA lot of care has been taken to ensure the player is thrust into a lively, yet bizarre rendition of a down-town, American city. A game highly recommended for anyone wanting to jump into something fun, light-hearted, and completely silly, which also sports incredible polish.\n\n[Edit: After completing the game]\n\nWhat an incredible ride!

That was one of the games I grew up on.  I also recall Earthworm Jim on the Sega Genesis as well (one of the games available on Sega Channel).  I bought this game because it looked to be about as silly as both of those games.  And it was.  Contrary to what the negative reviews say, I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes.  As for the title song, it fell flat for me when I listened to it on it's own; however, as a theme/title screen song for the game it fits in well.  The music for the rest of the game (during the levels) was far better though.  Overall the experience was enjoyable.\n\nThe puzzle solving in this game is unique.  It definitely wasn't what I was expecting, but it was by no means unwelcome.  However, there are a few levels that, taken as a whole, could have been reworked.  These are the levels where there are little to no puzzles.  It wasn't disappointing to me because they fit well with the storyline.  I also make it a point to go into a new game with minimal expectations, but if I was expecting lots of puzzles those levels might disappoint me overall.  The main drawback for me is short term replayability.  I'm expecting to finish out the Steam Achievements in maybe another playthrough or two.  I got nearly half of them already and I'm on the final chapter during my first playthrough.\n\nOnce I'm done with the Steam Achievements, I probably won't play this game again in the near future.  However, I will definitely come back to it from time to time.","March 2, 2014","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not that that last part matters all that much, but it gives you an idea of how interesting even the side content of this game can be.\n\nThat being said, even disregarding what my playtime says, the game is pretty short in length (probably around 6-8 hours, I'd say, less if you don't read everything's mind) and while some of the enemy evasion sections feel a little on the strict side in terms of getting them just right to get past the guards, the rest of the game is very enjoyable. Especially so if you're not sure what to make of the game and pick it up on a sale. Many of the puzzles are amusing and creative in their own right, often pulling themselves together through the pleasantly bizarre mechanic that the game hinges on, peeling the thoughts from other characters and inexplicably making them real, or peeling parts/items from other characters or the environment for use elsewhere.\n\nThere are some moments where you may find yourself wondering where to use some of the gathered items, the stickers as they call them (hence the game's name), but generally it becomes a rather straightforward affair of picking up what you can and figuring out what remains available to interact with to progress. If you're looking for a laidback puzzle platformer that takes more design cues from old adventure games than games like Braid, and an interesting art style, an enjoyable soundtrack, and a somewhat amusing sense of humor, you can't go too wrong with this game.\n\nWhat it may lack in length and challenge, it more than makes up for in its variety of amusing scenarios.","October 4, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically a man named Ray get's hit on the head and brain slug possesses his mind, giving him the ability to read other peoples thoughts and rip them out to convenience himself. The game plays like a fast paced point and click game where you wander through the levels reading minds and taking their thoughts and using the objects taken to get others help you get through each chapter. The humor goes from dark to self aware, but always keeps this upbeat additude that makes  anything dark hilarious. Like a chef who wants to flavor his stew, and requires the tears of a broken heart for flavor, and then pulls a severed human arm out to taste test the stew. You also have to contend with a mysterious organization that wants the brain slug back and the become an obstacle in Ray way and slowly becoming the big threat in the game.\n\nAs far as replayablity goes, it's pretty much non-existant save for getting any achivements you haven't gotten. The games charm comes from interacting all the characters and their quirks and once you beat the game, and complete the puzzles  these points become pointless and you can pretty much beat the game in a third of the time in a second playthrough. because of this, the 14.99 price tag seems steep, so i would recommend getting it when it goes on sale.

The art style and soundtrack are immediately appealing. The story is humorous, weird, and actually pretty dark at times; but it tells it's story without ever taking itself too seriously.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also fun and interesting. It's mostly split into two catergories: stealth/eluding segments and exploration puzzle solving segments. The stealth segments are fun, with you grappling around with your sticky mind hand to elude guards. The exploration is my favorite part though. It's extremely satisfying going around solving people's problems in order to help yourself get further. There's nver a dull moment, and characters always have something interesting to say.\n\nI'd recommend this game. In terms of length, it's pretty short. So if you want to play this game, but feel like 5 hours of game isn't worth the price, wait till it goes on sale. You won't regret it.","December 23, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a 2-D puzzle platformer, which I'm usually not too fond of, but in this case, I didn't mind it.  The main draw of this game is its sense of humor.  The $15 price tag is a bit high, but then again I say that about 90% of the games I play.\n\nThe game plays fairly nice.  There's a bit of platforming, but it really isn't that challenging.  Some of the sections with enemies can be a bit tricky, but after a few attempts you can develop a strategy to get around them.  There are also puzzles which revolve around reading people's minds and moving stickers to manipulate the world around you.  The puzzles are really easy, as long as you're careful when exploring the levels.\n\nThe story's pretty good.  You're a guy named Ray, who got hit on the head after returning from work.  When you wake up, you realize that you have a hand sticking out of your head.  This hand can be used to grab stickers, pins, and read other people's minds, all of which are used to solve puzzles.  The story is unique, the dialogue is quite funny, and the voice acting is pretty nice.\n\nIf I had to make one complaint, it’s that the game is rather short.  It only lasted about 5 hours for me, and I even got all of the achievements.  What the game has is fine, but a little more wouldn’t hurt.\n\nOverall, I would suggest picking this game up.  It will make you laugh, plus the achievements aren't too bad to 100%.  I just wish it was a little bit longer.","June 3, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get into an environment and you connect a few dots. None of it is too complicated. You don't have a billion items in your inventory to try on a billion different other things in the environment.\n\nBut here's the trick to that. That's ok. The environment is full of little yuks and fun things along the way. You know, content. You're doing the puzzles to keep getting through good content. You're not juggling a dozen puzzles and hints at a time. So as a puzzler alone, maybe it's less than one might expect. But as a game, it's excellently done.\n\nWith a little bit platformer, a little bit puzzle, and a little bit adventure, this game will keep you moving through fun environments with appropriate, enjoyable music.","July 13, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In case of the one here we have a Puzzle - Platformer like game, with some adventure elements. If that does sound awfully broing to you hang on! It's not (ya I was kinda surpised myself). While the main thing you do in the game is running and jumping around there are a few unique and very interesting elements. I do not want to spoil the games story here so I'll just say this: You solve each level by reading the minds of people and tearing parts of the world apart.\n\nThe story itself may not be deep but in conjunction with the graphical appearance of the game it is hilarious (and really, really weird at times). You'll probably never loose your smile playing the game, wich will probably entertain you for 5 to 6 hours if you do not use any guides (wich you shouldn't). Furthermore you'll have a lot of stuff to find, explore and see on your journey, if you pay somewhat close attention to the Dialogues (or monologues....), easter eggs and style. The (amazing) graphical style does go hand in hand with the games mechanics as well. The voice acting is flawless and all together I can't see anything else but a game that shows you all the love going into it.\n\nNow it certainly is stuffed with weird humor you need to get used to but it is worth it.","July 6, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
