"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kourin/recommended/207350/","Kourin","Forgive Your Insanity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kourin/","180 products in account","When I bought this game, I didn't expect too much. Like may be it can kill couple of hours of boredom. Most reviews are of some grand praise but how actually this could be any good, YouTube videos quite meh, nothing amusing.\n\nSo without much anticipation I picked some girl with axe and started in nightmare difficulty. Control was good and responsive; there are some instruments in your arsenal on how to wreak havoc on your enemies. However, your enemies aren’t going to watch you kill them, some immune to this, some immune to that, some shoot barrages of projectiles, some charge without rest, some come in swarms, some bestow loads of status effects. All of them share one thing: they want you DEAD RIGHT NOW.\n\nTerrain is quite simple, however made well in its simplicity: every zone have unique feeling about it, not like “I can watch landscape forever” of course, but certainly adds to game.\n\nMusic was to my liking, which does not necessarily mean that you would like it, but this game strong point is that tracks come in huge variety. Orchestra, piano, violin, harmonica, metal, electronic stuff – game has that all. If you played through whole game and did not like a single track that would be a huuuge “WOW!” from me.\n\nPlot is not complex and has nothing unexpected in it but still makes you feel for characters. If you’re new to YS, it would make a nice introduction, so you won’t have “what’s happening?” feelings, if you’re veteran, some why’s and what’s would be answered.\n\nSo like I said, I picked girl with axe and started playing. Shortly I came across that guy – Velagunder, he is boss of first subsection. And he killed me… repeatedly… for six hours straight… WHAT THE F…?! I sure am not “high skilled” player or something, but I was able to finish battletoads, TNMT, contra, rollergames and such titles on NES in my childhood. What is this guy? He surely is enjoying watching me struggle, shouting angry words and writhing in agony. Six hours after he decided to surrender and I was like: “YEAH! DIE! YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!! HA! HA! HA!” running around the house like an idiot. Great feeling of completion over some pixels dead body, really not what you would have often nowadays.\n\nAnd what I would like to say all of this guy's friends share his hobby. This not much anticipated game gave me hell of a journey. May be not the best game I ever played, but one of most memorable for sure. I liked it so much, so I bought other YS games available on Steam, and expecting more to come. YS is great franchise forged for over 20 years already and doing great on delivering suffering and spanking to people.\n\nIn conclusion, if you’re YS veteran, I wonder why you haven't bought it already, YS Origin lives up to YS series standards in any way possible and if you’re new to YS whatever you like this game or not is up to you but it is sure worth a try.","January 29, 2015","true","142.8"," 52 of 54 people (96%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","96","52","54","10","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/207350/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Ys Origin is quite possibly my favorite game on Steam.\nIt might be because I was already a big fan of the Ys series before I played it, but still! It's a great game.\n\nYs Origin is an action RPG, with a hack and slash styled battle system. There are 3 playable characters, the 3rd being unlocked when you clear the game the first time with either of the first two characters. Each character has a very specific playstyle. To avoid spoilers, I'll only detail the initial two.\n\nHugo Fact is a ranged caster. He is very powerful, firing off spell bullets from his wand and his twin artifacts known as the "Eyes of Fact" that hover at his side at all times. His is very agile, but he cannot fire while moving.\n\nYunica Tovah is a melee attacker. Armed with her handaxe (and later greatsword), she excels at close combat. She is very quick, dealing fast, hard damage to her opponents.\n\nWhen you start the game, you get to choose from many different difficulty settings (Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Nightmare), as well as choose which character you want to play as. Each character has their own storyline, though all three of them are intertwined. Playing each character is highly recommended, as each storyline offers more and more insight into the overall picture.\n\nGameplay consists of your typical RPG fare: battling monsters while exploring your surroundings. In Ys Origin, you are tasked with exploring a giant tower that extends to the heavens. The tower is broken up into segments, with each segment offering a different environment to do battle in and explore. They are varied enough to where sometimes you forget you are in a tower and are instead traversing a dungeon located elsewhere. At the end of each segment (and sometimes in the middle) you are presented with a boss. The end of each segment is always a screen-filling boss, and these are the most fun parts of the game, each requiring some strategy to defeat.\n\nYs Origin includes a neat Arena Bonus Mode and a Boss Rush/Time Attack Mode. In Arena Mode, you choose a character and fight wave after wave of monster in a specific location. As you defeat enemies, you accrue SP. You can then use this SP to unlock a variety of things for this mode, such as extra costumes and even a surprise guest character! In Boss Rush Mode, you can choose to either battle one Boss at a time, or every boss in the game consecutively.\n\nThe music and sound effects are top-notch. The Ys series is known for their amazing soundtracks, and Origin is no exception.  After awhile I found myself whistling along as the music played! You may be inclined to find and purchase the soundtrack online...just a warning! :P\n\nOverall this is just an awesome game. I got it on sale for about $7, but in my opinion the original, full price is WELL worth it. You get a lot of game for the price.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","May 30, 2014","true","142.9"," 82 of 100 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","82","100","0","3"

E3 is in full swing, with publishers announcing their latest and greatest titles. However quite frankly I'm finding myself distracted from all the excitement. Why, do you ask? It's because I have found my personal Game of The Year, and I don't think anything else that could come out right now could possibly top it. You can take your Diablos, your Modern Warfares, your Max Paynes, and you can file them all away for some other time and place. I'm too busy saving the ancient land of Ys from demonic hordes hellbent on the destruction of humanity!\n\nIt has been a mere three months since XSEED made their Steam debut with the smash hit Ys: The Oath in Felghana. In that short time their crack squad of programming gurus and translation wizards have been working overtime to bring us more Ys goodness, and this time they've takes us back to the beginning with Ys Origin. This entry in the series is actually a prequel, taking place 700 years before the events of the first Ys games. This of course means that Adol Christin has to sit this round out, however do not despair! This time around we have THREE playable characters to fill out the roster, and each of them brings their own story and unique gameplay style to the table.\n\nIf you have played a Ys game before (and I'm sure you have) then you should feel right at home with Yunica Tovah, our first playable character. She's a tough but compassionate young girl who has dedicated her life to protecting the goddesses. Do not underestimate her abilities because although she cannot use magic, she can swing around a massive battle axe as if it were a feather duster. Players new to the series should start with Yunica, as she is very easy to handle in combat. Once players feel comfortable they can tackle Hugo Fact, a magic user who plays out like a bullet hell shooter. The third (and secret) character will unlock once you finish the game as either Yunica or Hugo, and suffice it to say he's only for experienced players.\n\nOf course it would not be an Ys game if it didn't have big badass boss fights, and Ys Origin delivers in spades! As usual each boss has it's weak point and a pattern that you can exploit, and half the fun is figuring out how! Unlike other games that have impossibly punishing bosses, in Ys Origin if you're dying frequently you can simply level up and try again. Also be sure to check out the upgrade menu at save points, though they may seem minor, the right enhancement can save your life. Also be on the lookout for rare cleria ore, as it can be used to temper your weapons.\n\nThe music and graphics are of course as stunning as you would expect from a series of such a high caliber as Ys. From the stirring violin strains of the opening theme which give way to choral chants and guitar riffs, you can guess from just that track alone that the soundtrack is something special. And it truly is, with a wildly diverse soundscape of orchestral music inlaid with the finest hair metal that Falcom Sound Team J.D.K. has to offer. Just ad rich are the gorgeously rendered 3d backgrounds and lush sprites that make up the visuals.\n\nAfter you finish the main quest in Ys Origin there's still plenty to do. A host of unlockables including Time Attack, Boss Rush, and Arena modes round out the package, offering hours of gameplay beyond the main story. If you yearn for an epic story with brutal bosses, complex character development, and a truly hardcore soundtrack, look no further than Ys Origin. Newcomers will find an engaging start to a new series, and Ys veterans will find plenty of references to their beloved series, and even answers to some burning questions that they may have. At a solid asking price of $20, Ys Origin is an unbeatable value. Pick it up today!","November 25, 2013","true","19.3"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","53","64","0","7"

The game is also very challenging, but you can put it on an easier difficulty. Normal difficulty will cost you many deaths, especially during the difficult boss battles. The game will last you around 12 hours to play through the storyline portion, but it has high replay value. You can choose from 3 characters (1 is unlockable) and they each have their own storyline. I would say Hugo and the unlockable character have strong storylines, while Yunica has a weak one.","May 4, 2014","true","26.8"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","43","49","0","0"

Ys Origins feels a lot more like a very fast legend of Zelda title mixed with a dungeon crawler, as in you navaigate dungeons while solving puzzles and killing a lot of enemy demons rather than a Final Fantasy type game with it's turn based battle mechanics. The game consists of three characters Yunica, Hugo and Toal, the game must be completed once to unlock Toal.\n\nThe three characters have very different distinct play styles and abilities which really makes the game feel fresh even though you are revisiting the same areas each time, also each time you will see a different side to an interesting story. The entireity of the game is spent climbing a tower, with your surroundings, traps and enemies varying from floor to floor.  You will solve puzzles while fighting hundreds of demons which will give you experience to level up to get stronger and sp to enhance other abilities.\n\nAlong with the three characters the game also contains a time trial mode that times your climb of the tower and an arena mode which you fight waves of monsters increasing the replay value, which you can unlock other versions of the three characters and the main character from the other Ys games.\n\nEnemies are very varied, but every few floors you will face a gigantic boss, the boss's are very challenging needing different tactics each time and extremely rewarding when you finally finish it off.\n\nI really enjoyed playing it as all three characters and will be purchasing the other ys games on steam and reviewing those too.\n\nPros\n- Nice graphics feeling retro and new at the same time\n- Interesting storyline and characters\n- Lots of replay value\n- Fun gameplay\n- Very action packed\n- Amazing boss fights\n\nCons\n- No world map, entirely in the tower\n- The inside of the tower barely changes for each character\n- Some of the steam achievements didnt seem to unlock although im sure I met the criteria\n\nOverall Score\n9/10","November 25, 2013","true","33.6"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","40","46","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SynthetixV3/recommended/207350/","SynthetixV3","Synthetix 【ビールスV3】","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SynthetixV3/","209 products in account","So, an RPG franchise from the 80s-2000s that completely flew under the radar for me until now. Ys Origin, being my very first Ys title makes a VERY great impression on me as not only an RPG obsessed gamer, but a huge fan of the ARPG as a whole.\n\nHaving only experienced Yunica's story thus far, the game itself is beautiful in nearly every way. The art style is what you would expect from the older Final Fantasy games and is greatly complemented by the stellar soundtrack. In fact, during cutscenes during major plot points, the music actually adds a powerful layer of emotion, which really made the game complete for me. The story keeps you wanting more, and you're always itching to progress some more, to see what happens next.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it is nothing but awesome. Even though Origin takes place in one location only, each new floor you ascend to varies from the previous floors, so you never end up feeling bored, or feeling like you're on a slow grind to the summit. Enemies are varied, environments are varied, and nothing really seems to be reused. It's hack n' slash style gameplay is also fast, and furious, and there's little to no downtime between enemy encounters, which keeps the flow of the game fresh and constant, which is a must in an ARPG.\n\nBoss fights are unlike anything you'll see in today's generation. Boss fights have multiple mechanics to each, and force you to learn the mechanics until you're doing that fight like clockwork. Some boss fights become intense endurance matches, and when you see the boss fall to your feet, the feeling of victory is nothing short of amazing.\n\nOverall, if you love RPGs, or you're just looking for an intense hack n' slash game that will keep you busy for quite a while (Between playing through all three storylines, time attack, boss rush, and Arena), give Ys Origin a try. You seriously won't regret one moment of it.","January 2, 2014","true","24.8"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brownninja97/recommended/207350/","brownninja97","Brownninja97","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brownninja97/","402 products in account","This is certainly an interesting game, it starts a little slow and just throws you in but thats pretty standard for a JRPG or a Hack n slash game.\n\nNow the combat has three styles depending on the charecter that you are using, the first uses an axe and physical skills, three skills and each of those skills have charge ups depending on how much power you which to throw at the bad guys. The second charecter is a little slower but they can use magic, its pretty much the same but different ranges/speed/damage etc. The third charecter is a secret you will have to find that yourself because its a spoiler if I tell you. Expect the gameplay to be vastly different for each of these charecters, you can also get various varients of the charecters which changes the way it all plays out.\n\nThe artstyle is pretty old fashioned, its immersive though so it doesnt really matter. In the various dungeons that you are in you will find various artstyles depending on what theme that area is going for. Its pretty cool and the soundtrack that goes with it helps a lot.\n\nOnto music which we touched on before, at the start you would think that its a little cookie cutter but after a while you understand that the music goes with the various themes and the emotions of the game. For this reason they seem to compliment eachother very well and it sort of amplifies the emotions that you feel throughout the game.\n\nStoryline of this game isnt the most complex one ever id say, that being said ive only done a singe playthrough and its designed for you to play the three charecters because they each have different viewpoints in the story, they each lead to the same point but you will have to face various challenges to get to your end goal. At some points you will question what your protagonist is thinking or what their motivations are. Its well thoughtout id say but the introduction into the game was a little poor. As i understand this is the first in the series so i imagine it is meant to lay down a good foundation to the rest of the series so think of it as a prologue, a very long prologue. Its about 10-12 hours to finish the story for a single person, i imagine its the same or faster with the others.\n\nDifficulty, this is the meat of the game because holy hell is it hard. Just go into the discussions and you will witness the poor souls that have come close to throwing all sorts of hardware out the window, at the wall or at a sibling due to how hard this can get especially the bosses. The normal difficulty of this game is hard, the easy difficulty of this game is challenging, hell even in very easy you will struggle at times. Its not for the faint of heart but that is a good thing because its pretty rare to get a fleshed out game with those sorts of scenarios anymore. It also leads to the 400+ types of monsters that you will occur, some are strong, some are weak, some resist fire, some arent. You will encounter all sorts of rabble but they all want to kill you.\n\nIn the end this is a game that i can recommend to anyone, if you dont want to break anything then play on very easy and then work your way up, it certainly is addictive and you get one hell of a euphoria after you beat what seemed like an unbeatable boss at first(looking at you mantid)","July 8, 2015","true","13.0"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","26","26","0","0"

Yes, another great game. As a fan of rpg games. I can say that Ys origin have alot of rich stories from different perspective of the characters. This is an rpg with action that requires more than repeatedly hitting the same buttons. If you have played a YS game before then you probably know what I'm talking about.\n\nThe buttons are simple, it's easy as 1 2 3. There are 5 modes that you can play. Which is the Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard & Nightmare. A single playthrough on Nightmare takes about 30 hours the first time through, it's pretty hard. So those repeatedly buttons will require more than skills to finish it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/recommended/207350/","RaefGall","RaefGall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/","298 products in account","I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:\nhttp://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/07/ys-origin.html\n\nWhat sets this game apart?\nThe Ys series has been a popular action RPG franchise since 1987, but has only had limited release in the US.  Ys Origin serves as a prequel to the rest of the series chronologically, but is one of the most recent releases in the series.    While the combat sometimes seems more like a hack-and-slash action game than an RPG, there is a sense of strategy and patience required in some areas, especially boss fights, which maintains a more cerebral element in the game.  In addition, there are some good platforming sequences and simple puzzle elements that add enough variety to keep the game from feeling monotonous by breaking up the combat sequences.\n\nWhat is the difficulty factor?\nThis game is extremely simple to pick up and play.  It features the choice of mouse and keyboard controls featuring point and click movement, or you can control your character with just the keyboard when more precision is needed.  Personally, I only use the mouse when I have a slice of pizza in my left hand.  When new powers are unlocked, brief tutorial screens pop-up to explain their use, and most of them feel fairly intuitive anyway.  The game also does a fairly good job of offering direction, feeling fairly linear except for a few brief moments, often due to dialogue from the NPCs.\n\nWith that being said, this game is not without its challenging points.  The bosses tend to be extremely powerful, at least until you master the patterns of their attacks.  Even then, they require some precision movement and possibly some level grinding to survive.  For those familiar with the bullet-hell genre, you may find yourselves following a familiar strategy of focusing on not getting hit, only taking attacks when you have the rare opportunity.  The rest of the game is fairly tame, although if you let yourself get impatient or careless you will likely end up dying.  Save often.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nI feel a bit torn regarding the visuals of this game.  The cut scenes use a great mix of 3-D and anime style graphics and are usually gorgeous to look at.  The hand drawn character art used during dialogue is on par with many other games, although the character designs feel a bit stale, like you’ve seen them all used before.  The sprites for the characters have an odd, compressed feel to them, looking more like dwarves than the anime style drawings used outside of gameplay.  The game also uses an odd semi-locked camera at three-quarter view, but the level designs do a good job accounting for this.\n\nThe music in this game is phenomenal, playing on both the classical and rock aspects of traditional game music to keep every fight intense.  One thing that struck me was the lack of voice acting in the game, which I feel could have done a lot to enhance the overall experience of the game, especially during some of the longer cut scenes that can break the momentum of the game.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nWithout a doubt, the star of Ys Origin is the boss fight experience.  Every boss fight seems bigger and more epic than the last, and each one requires better timing and more complex movement to follow its pattern.  Off hand, I really enjoyed the giant centipede boss, Nygtilger, playing as Yunica.  It wasn’t necessarily the hardest boss, but the amount of movement and explosions, coupled with the amount of time you spend climbing on it made it a really fun experience.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nWhile it doesn’t have as many exploration or story elements as many other games of this genre, Ys Origin’s saving grace are its gameplay and music.  Each character has a very different feeling to its playthrough, including some alteration of the level design and especially the bosses, greatly increasing the playtime on this game.  With scalable difficulty and already difficult bosses, it can also prove a suitable challenge for players seeking it, or to encourage subsequent playthroughs.  Personally, while I enjoyed the game, I am glad I picked it up while it was on sale.  If it sounds like your cup of tea, I would wait for the next Steam sale to roll around to pick it up.","November 28, 2013","true","17.2"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","1"

Monsters are essentially piñatas that when killed will explode into an array of multi-colored pieces of equipment. After spending so much time on games such as these, my mind dulls to the point where I stop caring about saving the world, or performing some heroic and death-defying feat. All I really want to do is look at numbers rise. I need an intervention. I need to refocus. I need Ys Origin.\n\nAll you really need to know about the Ys Series is that everyone fights with an un-matched level of veracity. Imagine a thousand buzz-saws being shot out of a thousand cannons, and everything they shred also gets set on fire. When the series was still very young, the early games required the player to kill monsters by running at them and striking either of their sides. In a way the later games such as Ys Origin are an extension of this basic design. In the interest of balance, the improved controls and maneuverability means players have to contend with more intense battles. A plethora of difficulty settings assist the player in finding a level of challenge that suits them. The hardest settings deliver an experience akin to a 2D shooter, where the entire screen is flooded with death.\n\nAs you’d expect from the title, Ys Origin establishes the roots of the series. Fans will quickly note all of the references to the first entry, which include characters, events, and even boss-battles. In fact, the entirety of the game takes place in Darm Tower, which is essentially where most of Ys 1 also took place. Still, aside from the boss-battles none of this is particularly exciting. This game was originally released in late 2006, and even with the update to Steam, an option to skip cut-scenes was never developed. The dialogue is fairly good, but the story is very traditional and there are certain events that have to be sat through. The time spent outside of combat, tends to be really dull.\n\nThere are three playable characters in this game and each of them has a different fighting style, a few unique bosses to contend with, and their own path in the story. Yunica Tovah is the token cute-girl-with-a-big-axe. Her companions and adversaries are quick to point out her lack of magic ability, but I can’t tell the difference, when she’s summoning firebirds that lay everything to waste. Hugo Fact on the other hand is all about the spells, though his style of play can best be described by the classic arcade shooter Mercs. Expect to run & gun your way through the tower if you play as this wizard. Big brother Toal Fact is unlocked after beating the game with either of the other two characters. His fighting style resembles Wolverine. Basically you go pork or bacon on enemies and claw your way to success. Each adventure should take around six or seven hours to complete, although this can be slightly effected by the difficulty setting.\n\nDarm Tower is a lot like Dracula’s Castle in that the forces of evil can shape it to fit their whims. I’m absolutely certain that when I scoured this tower in the first game I did not have to deal with swimming through flooded corridors, jumping over spike-traps, and dealing with that always-necessary lava level. Each level has a theme and by the second or third you’ll figure out everything you need in order to progress. This adventure is almost entirely linear; however you’re free to backtrack in case you missed anything. Unfortunately even though you get some cool powers like the ability to double-jump there really aren’t any instances where you can go back to prior areas to find items you couldn’t get to earlier. This is the same case for all three playable characters, so once you learn the layout, all you have to focus on is the methods for dealing with the demons.\n\nThe combat is by far the greatest aspect of the Ys series, and the same can be said for this entry. All fights move quickly and multiple types of foes all attacking at once is a regular occurrence. To keep things fair the demons have a “tell” when they’re about to attack (they blink white for half a second). Also, while all demons are capable of hitting very hard, as long as you’re exploiting weaknesses they go down just quickly. If you’re not doing enough damage, usually a level-up will balance things out, and a second or third might even make you slightly overpowered. Still, don’t expect to grind through bosses as experience points drop to about one per kill, which will force you to move on. The boss-battles in this game are especially great, probably among the best in the series. At first I was worried that every boss was going to be a weak-point mashing affair, but each encounter is varied and just awesome. Some demons like The Creeper are not only relentless but can also induce serious headaches by healing themselves in mid-battle. Unlike a few of the other Ys entries there also aren’t any herbs, potions, or elixirs that can be purchased to bail you out. But hey, all this difficulty adds to that feeling of accomplishment.\n\nReplay value in Ys Origin is certainly high. After completing the game with all three characters you’re given access to the time-attack, arena mode, and bonus shop. The time-attack is a boss-rush where you can face off against any or all of the major demons for the possibility of a spot on the leaderboards.  Arena mode has you dealing with waves upon waves of monsters, if you survive you can use the points you earn to buy prizes from the bonus shop. You can always head back to the tower and attempt the harder difficulties as well. There are plenty of achievements and getting them all practically requires that you master the game.\n\nReally there’s not a whole lot that can be said about Ys Origin. There’s no hidden meaning to be found and this is not some life-reaffirming experience that I could write thirty pages on. This is simply an excellent action-RPG that despite being more than a few years old it still contends with among the best the genre has to offer. On the other hand if your experience with the genre has never gotten beyond breaking open monsters and collecting all the armors, swords, and belts they were stowing in their nether regions, then steer clear. This game keeps it focused and judges the player entirely on their ability to evade and strike, luck isn’t a factor in the slightest.","May 26","true","26.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Even though the Ys series is as old as Zelda and has enjoyed immense popularity in Japan since the first game, Ys 1: Ancient Ys Vanished (1987), the series has never been that popular outside the Orient.\n\nA few entries did make it west on PS2 and PSP, either through Konami in 2005 with Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim (the first English release of the series in thirteen years) or XSEED’s masterful handling of translations starting with Ys: The Oath in Felghana. XSEED released Ys: The Oath in Felghana, a remake of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys (1989), on Steam in March. This is the first time most PC gamers get to experience what is (in terms of number of game releases) the largest Eastern RPG series second only to Final Fantasy.\n\nReleased on Steam in May, Ys Origin is the seventh game in the Ys series and a prequel. It takes place first in terms of chronology, 700 years before the events of “Ancient Ys Vanished” (Ys I & II). As you explore a huge vertical dungeon known as “Darm Tower”, the game elaborates on much of the series’ backstory, including characters, mystical artifacts and locations.\n\nThere are three playable characters (one is initially locked until you beat the game once with either of the other two), each has their own story and combat style. Yunica, a young knight, uses an axe and sword for close-range melee. Hugo Fact, genius magician and all-round ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, shoots bullets and is the easier of the two to play. We’re not going to spoil the third character for you.\n\nCombat is fast and action-packed, with enemies having clear and recognizable patterns to their attacks. As you hack-and-slash your way up the tower, there are some mild puzzles to solve and mild platforming elements to jump through. There’s a kind of momentum system to keep you pushing forward: as you kill enemies without stopping, you gain a bonus to the rate at which you get experience points and “SP”. The “SP” points are spent to permanently buff your character, such as increasing resistance to negative effects like poison or confuse , or to upgrade your armour.\n\nThe boss fights are where the game (and series) really strut its stuff. While mowing through general enemies is pretty easy, boss fights require focus. You’ll need to learn their attack patterns, figure out which skills to use against them, and if you’re really into that kind of thing there are Time Attack and Boss Rush challenge modes.","September 22, 2014","true","13.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/207350/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","Just like all games in the Ys series, what you're getting with this title is a fast-paced action RPG. The regular enemies are mostly an easy grind, but the boss battles are a different story. If there is another thing the Ys series has a reputation for, it's grueling boss battles that often require multiple attempts and still manage to decimate your HP even if you emerge the victor.\n\nThe one major downside to Ys Origin is that----unlike previous Ys games that involved exploring an overworld, traveling to different towns, and exploring different dungeons---Ys Origin is just one non-stop slash-fest through a single extremely long dungeon. While the dungeon wallpaper does change somewhat as you make progress, the entire dungeon pretty much feels exactly the same, which can leave you feeling bored of the scenery hours before reaching the final boss.\n\nThe game also has multiple characters with which to complete the campaign as well as an unlockable arena mode. If you are the kind of person who likes that kind of extra content and you like the action of the game enough that you feel like making one more go through the dungeon all over again with a second character, then you will be pleased to have the option. As for me, I personally got too bored of being trapped inside the one neverending dungeon for 14 hours, so the idea of doing it all over again just to play with a different skill set for fourteen MORE hours does not sufficiently entice me. Since the game is somewhat of a grindfest (especially near the end), I just don't find the replay value to be nearly that high. Still, it is a great bonus for those who want an extra challenge or just haven't eaten their fill of the hacking and slashing yet.\n\nI feel like I only have one major gripe with the game, which is that the designer chose to arbitrarily disable your ability to pause the game or access the main menu during boss fights or cut scenes (which--to make matters worse--are unskippable). When I raised this concern to other players, some came to its defense explaining that it is an intentional design decision to keep you from swapping equipment in battles. However, I don't think that is a very good excuse. One very well could have disabled access to the inventory/equipment screen only. But making it impossible to pause the game or open the main menu means that, for example, if you decide that you want to QUIT the game during a boss battle, then your only option is to Alt+F4 or kill it via task manager. Both of those are easy enough to do, sure, and yet I can't help but feel like this is an obtuse and unwieldy measure taken for a small design nitpick. The fact that you can't skip cut scenes or even open the main menu during cut scenes seems even less excusable, since there can be no game design argument for it.\n\nSmall gripes aside, if you are at all a JRPG fan/enthusiast and want to slash up some monsters in an action RPG, I'd recommend giving it a whirl.\n\nAs for the other question: is it worth twenty whole dollars? I personally feel like $20 is slightly steep for this one. $15 feels like a good maximum price to me. $10 or below is a bargain. Therefore, using the rating scale below, I rate the game at around a 4.\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.\n6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.\n4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.\n2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.\n1) Avoid at all costs.","November 26, 2015","true","14.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sharza/recommended/207350/","Sharza","Sharza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sharza/","446 products in account","Ys Origin is an original JRPG/Hack & Slash game with really good fighting mechanics, a decend story and Metroidvania style levels.If that's not enough praise, let me say it's one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nYou first (first because you can unlock more characters) play as Yunica Tovah, a young woman who has sworn to protect the godesses of her world; a girl who is looked down upon by all the other guards because she possesses no magical powers whatsoever. A girl, that proves to be more than valuable and capable without magical powers in rescuing the godesses and the whole world in the course of the story.\n\nThe gameplay feels really slick, it's not simply a matter of button mashing but you have to react to what enemies do and figure out strategies to effectively kill each one of them. They have certain movesets that are predictable and thus can be learned - something I really appreciate. There is no buIlsh!t going on with the enemies. If you fail, it's your fault - it's quite Dark Souls'esque in this regard. Especially noteworthy are the bosses that are all very unique in their mechanics and that are thoroughly fun to fight. Each and every one of them has move-sets that are to be learned and understood if you want to defeat them. It's not too difficult to figure out what to do because each of their movements can be predicted by the animations they have - to me it seems that's one of the biggest strengths that Japanese/Asian games have over western games (the rules to beat the game are very clear - it's still tough).\n\nThe level design is great. There may be some backtracking involved but it's really only if you didn't check everything properly in your first run-through. Everything is connected in a consistent and logical manner and there are various styles of areas.\n\nThe sound design is great as well. The feedback you get for your actions is quickly ingrained into your brain, and helps you understand what's happening even if you can't take in all the visual information at the time - perfect. The soundtrack is pumping and very well done, suits the overall game.\n\nThe graphics are not top notch but they suit the kind of game Ys Origins is. They are probably even perfect for what the game tries to achieve. They are simplistic but nice to look at, everything fits together and there is nothing that sticks out as ugly or unfitting. Especially noteworthy are the character models that look very nice.\n\nMy one problem with the game is that if you are underleveled, you will have a really tough time against some of the bosses. An unnecessarily tough time that may force you to go back and grind 2-3 levels. Which doesn't take too much time but is tedious nonetheless and could've been circumvented by making levels count less and making items count more for the overall strength of your character.\n\nAll in all - who woulda thunk it after reading what I just wrote - Ys is one of my favorite games of all times.\n\nI won't give you a stupid random number for this game though - judgements of games are always subjective.\n\nIf anything, I'd give the same rating Conan O'Brien gave for Tomb Raider:\n\nEdit: Sorry, but it doesn't start you at the right time, even though I linked with time. Jump to 7 min, 30s for the rating :)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCe8-1dbXZc&t=7m30s","August 19, 2014","true","23.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I like to think of doing so as letting the game "age like a fine wine" or something like that). Well, I finally blew the dust off the cover (metaphorically) and grabbed my gamepad to begin playing. I was met with a well-done anime-esque intro matched with beautiful music (including a sick electric guitar and violin, two of my favorites). If you are on the fence about buying this, make the jump. It feels so classic and nostalgic to so many of the older action-rpg titles yet handles well and looks beautiful (the graphics, in my opinion, aged rather well).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/recommended/207350/","astralchaos","Falem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/","1065 products in account","Ys Origin is an isometric rpg game that plays like a game you would see in the arcades very action oriented and fluid. in Ys you play as one of three selectable characters and go through their journey in order to help the goddesses fight off evil that dwells within the tower. Each character has their own dialogue and conflicts most notably the secret third character has a lot more bosses than the other two.\n\nProgression\n+Statues offer instant traveling back and forth\n+Enemies are highlighted red to progress\n+Grinding is minimum (10-15 minutes if you're underleveled)\n\nTraveling from floor to floor can take some time, luckily you have goddess statues that teleport you instantly to other statues you have unlocked along your travels in the giant tower. This allows the player to be able to teleport to any floor he thinks requires more exploring weather its to grab a item he missed or simply to teleport back to floor 1 for upgrades. Not only that but you are fully healed when in range of the goddess statue, you can also save.\n\nThere is practically no grinding in this game if you do not skip mobs, even if you were somehow still underleveled its relatively quick to level to the proper tier for the boss. Grinding is not required in order to defeat bosses, it can be beneficial in order to survive more hits but dealing more damage only works on anything under the highest difficulty. Being on nightmare there is set amount of damage you are going to be able to do against any bosses. This is to keep the game challenging for the purpose of the difficulty mode so that players won’t find a easy way to accomplish the feat.\n\nRed highlighted enemies are triggers to progress through the levels. For example killing a red highlighted knight can trigger a jumping platform so you can reach a certain area otherwise unavailable.\n\nLevel Design\n+Nice variety of environments\n\nDespite the entire game taking place in a giant tower there is a surprising variety of environments and design with their own elements that seperate how you proceed through them.\n\nThere is platforming but it never really gets too complicated to the point where you're constantly backtracking because you cannot perform the required jumps, its especially gets easier once you get helpful power ups like double jump.\n\nMechanics\n+Multiple obstacles throughout the game solved with unique items\n-Cinematics can interrupt your movement (Very Rare)\n\nGoing through the game you will find yourself often unable to past an obstacle that requires you to have a special item in order to proceed to the next floor. For example the item that helps with magic resistance will be useful for resisting the pull of statues trying to drag you down into a trap that sets you back to another floor and further away from your goal.\n\nCinematics interrupt your movement if you happen to be above a trap for example in water when you trigger a cinematic you will fall into the spike trap and take damage when you're able to move again\n\nGame Modes\n+Nice leaderboards (keeps track of alot of variables/characters)\n\nUpon beating the game you will unlock more content for example the first time I beat it with Mittens, I unlocked time attack which features a circuit of going through all the bosses you fought throughout the game with set equipment and having to race the leaderboards in order to pass your friends.\n\nConclusion\nYS origin feels like one of those old very challenging arcade games with rpg elements and some platforming. The features a nice variety of boss types, even more bosses can be discovered by playing the other characters which gives the game more replayability. The game lasts around 12 hours per playthrough and with 3 characters thats a good chunk of time not to mention you have extras to go through.","February 5, 2015","true","60.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's also unique compared to other games in the series due to the fact that you never play as Adol, but rather as two (actually three) other characters, each with their own style of combat. There's Yunica, whose style is the most similar to Adol's, with mid-range combat skills. Then there's Hugo, who's more of a long-distance fighter. And finally, the third character, whose storyline is considered the "canon" one but is also the hardest due to his short-range fighting style.\n\nAlthough there are differences between the three, you're still exploring the same dungeon, so it may get repetitive playing as each one. However, doing so helps flesh out the world of Ys further and brings some fun tie-ins to Ys I and II.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is well balanced. Normal feels just tough enough but not too much so, making it an enjoyable and rewarding experience. There's also plenty to do for completionists, from beating the game on the highest difficulty (Nightmare) to doing Boss Rushes to Arenas. It'll keep you coming back until you've unlocked all the things and gotten all the Steam achievements. Again, it's hard but not so hard that it seems impossible.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to people looking for a fun adventure title and are maybe looking to get into the Ys series as a whole. I'd also suggest looking into Ys: The Oath in Felghana, which is equally fun but with more exploration and a shorter game time (which some may prefer).","December 27, 2013","true","78.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's the 8th game from the series. It's only available on Pc and it's a prequel of Ys I & II. (So it's better to play Ys I & II to understand a bit more.)\n\nSo first of all, I just want to add that I have around 120 hours on this game and I didn't finish entirely. (I'm finishing the third character at Nightmare Mode and I'm focusing to get every achievements.)\n\nPros:\n-The story is great. (You will get the point of view on each character.)\n-4 difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard and Nightmare)\n-Music is so great.\n-Fast paced game.\n-Button mashing game.\n-Anime game\n-Time attack/Survival mode\n\nCons:\n-Nightmare mode can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. You really need to focus on farming a lot of level and to know every pattern of each bosses. You will restart a lot of them and yes, you will want to throw you controller at your screen a lot of times.\n-Only two characters (a third one can be unlocked. But if you only play only one time with Yunica or Hugo, you won't be able to unlocked it.)\n-The "real" story is with the third character. So people who don't love to play the same game over and over won't be able to taste it. (You need to complete the game with Yunica and Hugo, that's it.)\n-Maybe overpriced if you only play one time and at easy mode. (Approximately 4-5 hours if you know what to do.)\n\nNote 9/10 because this game has made me a fan of Ys.\n\nEdit : If you want more information about the order that you need to play the game, check this link : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552476829","March 4, 2015","true","122.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It was cheap in a Steam Sale, and I thought 'Hey why not - lol backlog'. However, times are a changing, and it's no longer about buffing that backlog game count, but actually PLAYING GAMES.\n\nYes, playing games. On steam.\n\nSo, having finally gotten around to playing this game (thanks to Steam Roulette), I have to say I'm genuinly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's a simple RPG/Adventure game, with some very basic yet effective hack'n'slash mechanics. While it would be wrong to say it's similar to Devil May Cry in the way that the combat is simple, but at the same time a little frantic, it does help paint a similar picture.\n\nThe most rewarding part of the entire experience are the Boss Battles. They're old school - patterns & phase based, rather than just being normal mobs with a crazy amount of HP, dealing insane damage. Nope, no spank'n'tank here - these bosses have patterns of attacks, and phase of attacks based on their HP. Classic.\nThey're frustrating to the point of fanfare when you finally take them down, which is great.\n\nGames tend to skip over the challenge and frustration these days, which means gamers miss out on learning, resilience and fist pumping when they finally topple the ♥♥♥♥ that's blocked their way for the last hour. This game doesn't deny you that pleasure.\nI feel like I'm not really doing the game justice - if you're still unsure there are 10/11 youtube videos linked to my Steam Account of my playthrough, so you could always check those out too.\n\nUltimately, give it a go and you might surprise yourself.","October 11, 2013","true","24.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cargotruck/recommended/207350/","cargotruck","Trifroze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cargotruck/","12 products in account","Just about everything important is well made in this game. The gameplay is satisfying with its RPG elements, action based combat and simple platforming, the soundtrack is absolutely great and fitting for the gameplay, the main characters are surprisingly interesting and the bosses offer plenty of challenge, really requiring you to learn their patterns and time your attacks correctly especially on higher difficulties. Even the story has its moments despite never being invasive, and the graphics are pleasant enough in all their simplicity. My only slight gripe with the game comes from its few heavily compressed animated cutscenes which could've looked smoother.\n\nThe game will initially take you about 8-12 hours to finish, but it has three different characters with different storylines and slightly different events, and I strongly suggest that you take the time to finish the game with every character if you want to get the most out of it and its story. As such, the replay value is strong especially if you're going for achievements which the game is almost designed for with its multiple difficulties, unlockables and the boss rush mode where you fight all the bosses of the game in a marathon setting. If going for full completion though, the replay value eventually depletes and the process turns into more of a grind towards the end of it.\n\nThe combat consists of slashing and blasting through numbers of enemies with a combination of regular and special attacks while jumping around platforms and structures, avoiding enemy hits and collecting the currency and temporary power ups that they drop, all while the speedy and melodic soundtrack is playing at the background. Most of the depth and challenge comes from the tried and true mechanic of dodging and timing, which is very apparent in the several boss fights the game will throw at you. On harder difficulties you'll have to retry several times to get the patterns down properly, and while you can overlevel yourself by one or two levels with some extra grind to make many bosses noticeably more doable, in boss rush you have no such luxury. On the other hand if you just want to sit back and chill, the game has easier difficulties as well.\n\nOverall, YS Origin is a simple but solid ARPG that I can recommend to anyone.","February 9","true","97.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Hugo is like an SMG, you can spam your basic attacks like crazy, but is slower than a slowpoke. And Yunica has oven mittens... oh, and an axe, and is quite mobile. After that you can choose your difficulty, whereas nightmare really is a nightmare, and easy for Hugo players (yes, I hate him and I can't play him).\nIn this game, nightmare actually adds stuffs like attacks to the enemies, not just way more health and damage. Don't worry if you get stuck on a boss for 3+ hours in this mode.\nUpgrading your character is also possible. You get small crystals which are your ingame-coins. In Nightmare every crystal is 1 point worth. In every other difficulty, I think, the bigger crystals give way more points.\n\nThe story:\nThe goddesses are nowwhere to be found on Ys. It's your job to go to the surface and find them. Of course, they are in the giant Darm Tower, the lair of the evil guys. Depending on which character you play, the story changes a bit. You get a few different bosses and other cutscenes. Due to this, you want to play it again, just to see how everything plays out for each character.\nOverall, to leave it mostly spoilerfree: Each story had it's emotional part and was well thought-out.\n\nGameplay:\nHugo: Will make your hands hurt (You should map a key to autopress the shoot button 30x a second)\nYunica: Solid Movement, good attack speed, fun to play and mittens.\nThere are a lot of enemies. Some are just powered up versions of older enemies, others are completely new. Especially on Nightmare difficulty you have to be very carefully to choose how to deal with the enemy. Some are almost completely immun to your skills. Learing the patterns of your foes helps a great deal.\n\nSetting:\nYou play in a huge tower. However, this doesn't mean the interior is all the same. Every time after one of the bigger bosses, the tower changes completely. One time you play with lava, the other time you play with sand and also mirrors!\n\nUnlockables:\nYes, this game has unlockables. Once you complete the game with any character, you unlock something awesome and the boss rush mode. After you finish the game with every character, you get the arena mode and a shop. In the first you defeat enemies for points, which then can be exchanged for stuff in the latter one. The shop allows you to buy many things, like powered up spells, Hugo still sucks though.\n\nSoundtrack:\nJust listen to the trailer music. It's so awesome! The rest is also pretty good.\n\nLong story short:\nBuy it, so we get even more Ys on steam!","January 9, 2015","true","64.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But it is not as good as Oath. I think its because it feels more padded out. In order to unlock the true final boss you need to run through the same sets of levels in the same order twice as different characters, to unlock the bonus arena mode you have to run through the same game three times as different characters.\n\nThe game is also a lot more wordy than Oath, with all three of the playable characters being unbearably whiny and having daddy issues. Music also took a step down from Oath, most of the non-boss music feels really limp and underwhelming.\n\nThough the boss fights are probably some of the best in the series, and a game that is worse than Oath is still a game worth buying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Atlas141/recommended/207350/","Atlas141","Atlas 141","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Atlas141/","74 products in account","I picked this game up on sale after wanting a really good JRPG, or rather an action platformer. With a good combat system and a strong, responsive, gameplay methodology the game is a winner. You can complete the game inside of 10-20 hours depending on difficulty setting and past that there is a tonne of replay-ability through either doing it on harder modes or in playing the game again from another character's point of view (there are 2 characters to choose from at the start, a third being added at the end). It's well worth whatever price you pick it up for, though if you're not sure you'll like it (it grows on you), I would recommend at least snagging it on a sale. Basically, it's Zelda on the PC in 1080p, or rather a Zelda-esque game.\n\nStory: 8/10\n\nI played through the game on hard as 'Yunica Tovah', aka, Axe Girl. Being more of a agility-speed player it was my natural choice as I've never been that into mage characters, which is the other character model available as you start the game fresh. As a character Yunica is more or less your bumbling anime girl that has inner strength that expresses itself as impatience and immaturity, which naturally changes over time. I found her interesting - a little predictable at times, but as the plot progresses she does develop more facets and towards the end her angry side really is a welcome extension of her persona.\n\nAs for the overall story and setting, I found them engaging and enjoyable. It's definitely a fantasy game firmly within in the anime genre, and if you like that then you'll love the game. Me, personally, I can take it or leave it, so for me the it would be the gameplay that would swing me on this.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic. Fluid, sharp, and precise. Everything I like and enjoy. As a new player to this type of game it only took a quick control re-mapping to something more western - WASD as apposed to ZXCV - and then I picked it up pretty quickly. The gameplay is great because you have a really well thought out of mix of trash mobs, mid-level, high-level, then boss-level type enemies. And towards the end-game they start mixing in conditions and aoe gravity pulls to really start tripping you up if you haven't mastered how to pick off certain enemies. And that's what the gameplay really is at heart: you get thrust into a new situation and you have to adapt to these new conditions pretty quickly through piecing together enemy attacks, patterns, strengths, and weaknesses. This is especially true of the boss fights, which were always thoroughly enjoyable, challenging, and at times, a little frustrating. All of which are designations of a good game.\n\nDifficulty is king here. If you have it on easy, you'll somewhat breeze through the game. Greater difficulties are just that in this game - it's not the western version of difficulty where 'Veteran' is what 'Easy' used to be in the late 90s, Nightmare literally means Hell.\n\nI didn't give the gameplay 10/10 because of one reason: if you miss a chance to power up your weapon and you progress to the next stage, you'll suddenly hit a spike in difficulty. The same can be said if you don't more or less flatten the majority of enemies on contact (at first). So this can be a little infuriating as you suddenly can hit grind mode, unless you go back and find that missing upgrade. But, the good news is there's a transport system so it's not difficult at all. And, worse comes to worse, you can always use GameFAQs to trace your steps to that upgrade.\n\nGame design: 8/10\n\nThis game is obviously Japanese in regards to design which naturally means that some inherent Western expectations aren't fulfilled. This takes the form of, or rather, a lack of:\n\nA nice looking menu\nThe ability to map controls inside the game (instead of inside the launcher only)\nThe ability to skip cutscenes - even if you've already seen them\n\nThese are gripes that you get used to and they're only mildly annoying. If you're a JRPG fan, well, you're used to this kind of thing anyway.\n\nLevel design throughout is interesting and never repetitive; effectively think of the game as like a Mario or Zelda game: you're always in one 'general area' but as you go progress through the levels/stages the scenary changes etc, such as Ice to Fire to Sand and so on. It's classical and is nice to go through again if I'm honest. These different stages bring with them different unique challenges that do require a bit of trial and error occasionally, which I feel is a good thing. Not enough games punish you for messing up, this one does punish you; but never in an unfair way. I like that method of design.\n\nConclusion: 8.5/10\n\nHighly recommended if you want an old school experience in 1080p that is reminiscent of Zelda and old school Mario. It's a great game with solid gameplay elements and the story is engaging and interesting. If you're an anime fan then I'm certain you'll find worth in this game. If you're not an anime fan then your opinion will likely differ, maybe drastically so. But regardless, the gameplay is super strong and rewarding, so if you want a challenge then this is it.\n\nIf you're in the unsure camp like I was, wait for a price reduction via sale then snap it up.","July 16, 2014","true","25.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The PC gaming market is small over there, and it's common for developers to misunderstand PC expectations. Moreover, these types of games attract a passionate fanbase, who will often overlook technical flaws in their reviews.\n\nGood news: none of this applies to Ys Origin.\n\nThe game runs at 60 frames per second without a hitch. Widescreen resolutions are properly supported. There is minimal letterboxing on menus, but devs have added additional graphics on the sides (rather than black bars), a nice touch. 7 hours in, I haven't been able to spot a single bug or glitch. Keyboard controls are implemented and the various tutorial screens actually reference these keys rather than gamepad prompts.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, other reviews give a good overview so there's hardly any need to expand on this. Personal recommandation, don't let your ego get in the way of a fun experience. As someone who finds the Dark Souls series' reputation for punishing difficulty to be largely overblown (and I love all Dark Souls games), Ys Origin's demo boss still handed my ♥♥♥ to me several times on Normal difficulty. Picking Easy for my real playthrough after buying the game, so far it has been appropriately challenging.\n\nAlso worth noting leveling seems to be important in this game. Sometimes, getting two extra levels can be the difference between hitting a boss for 1 damage per hit or 10 damage per hit (those numbers might seem paltry either way, but when you think about it, the latter hits ten times harder). On Easy there hasn't been any need to grind experience so far.\n\nOverall, an excellent game. -75% discounts come and go on a regular basis, and at that price it's a steal if you're even remotely interested in the genre. Heck, I don't even like anime, but one can only stay grumpy for so long in the face of sheer fun.","July 12, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

But the game itself is probably the most polished of all the Ys games on Steam. From the silky smooth 60fps gameplay to the surprisingly decent graphics (and pretty impressive bosses), Origin does a great job graphically despite being an older game. The music of couse kicks ♥♥♥, although I'd put it a notch below the music from Oath in Felghana and Ys I & II. The game is strange in that it doesn't star Adol Christin - instead, three different characters are available to play. To get the most out of the game, you'd need to finish the game with all three characters. In some ways it's rather repetitive since the puzzles and situations don't change much, but the way the characters play differ greatly - especially Hugo, who makes the game almost like a shoot-em-up. Still, it's great to see the story unfold from different perspectives. For Ys fans, this game is a no-brainer - highly satisfying gameplay, good, silky smooth graphics and rocking music. Who could ask for more? 8/10.","March 1, 2014","true","35.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dunno how to format it but i'll try my best\n\nStory: The game has 2 normal endings but 1 true ending, giving 3 in total. While they of course vary, there are many things which stay the same in the story such as how each character progresses. At points this makes you believe you already know all the story and what's going on after one play through, but later on the story can completely take a twist for each character. Each story does start off pretty slow, especially if you go in without any prior knowledge to the Ys series, but once the plot thickens, it thickens good. It is pretty engaging and most the characters are quite understandable and likeable.\n\nGameplay: I suggest you play the demo itself. On higher difficulties it can be fast paced, manic, epic and overall very enjoyable. There are a few moments in the game mind you where it can be frustrating trying to defeat a boss or enemy, because some of them are just soo cruel on the insane difficulty!.. Each character have 3 abilites they unlock through the game, each of them have their special uses for puzzle solving but also for combat, the main problem I find is that you unlock these all of these three abilites around half way, leaving not much else to unlock except for one super move or a sort per character (Which is awesome but missable) and passive abilities.\n\nOne thing which did annoy me a lot though is how vague the game could be with it's in-game instructions. For example - if you play as Yunica the game will tell you about how you can use a descending jump attack, what it DOESN'T tell you until later, after soo many chances where it could have been useful, is that the attack is capable of stunning enemies, but since the attack does little damage alone you will probably spend a lot of time playing the game without knowing this gameplay element. Neither does the game explain thrusting or how the boost meter charges quicker when you have less health (Which is really essential to know for a certain task otherwise you could be waiting about for a good 30 minutes). Now, honest maybe it did explain some of these things in the game, but if it did, it obviously didn't make it's point since i'd completed the game twice without knowing some features...\n\nVisuals and Audio: Uh... Well this is a sorta old-ish game now, so the visuals aren't all that great for the 3D? models. Weirdly though I find the special effect in game to still look top notch, flashy and cool. The audio is fine really, I haven't much comments on it except that the OST is pretty epic and great, especially nearer to the end of the game.\n\nOverall: Since you can, I suggest you just play the demo first, it's a great game in pretty much everyway, there are a few moments which will make you pull out your hair but otherwise the experience as a whole is brilliant for the price.\n8/10","February 5, 2015","true","65.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You start on the first floor as one of three characters (only two initially unlocked) and fight your way up, to deal with the baddie at the top. Along the way you can appreciate some awesome...\n\n[1] Boss fights. The Ys series is known for its boss fights and these are no exception. They're tough, without ever feeling cheap.\n\n[2] Pacing. The game typically involves 2 or 3 floors of regular enemies (who can be quite challenging!) between each boss fight. You'll usually need to explore these thoroughly in order to find the key to the boss and any equipment upgrades. Yet these intermediate sections don't overstay their welcome. And it's entirely possible to run through them if needed.\n\n[3] Polish. The camera works. The controls work. The game provides proper feedback. Everything feels smooth and responsive, which makes the game a joy to play purely at the tactile level.\n\n[4] The music. Ys music is awesome.\n\nOn these strengths, I give the game a thumbs up. If you like old-school ARPGs, this one is sharp and sleek. It'll provide about 10-15 hours of gameplay for the first playthrough. If you really like it, it's then got two other characters as well as boss attack / timed modes (though, big surprise!, the leaderboard is dominated by cheaters).\n\nDo keep in mind, however, that this game doesn't offer as varied an experience as other RPGs. Gear progression is strictly linear. Though each boss and its levels have different environmental themes (sand, lava, etc), there's ultimately not much variety in setting. You certainly aren't doing any globe-trotting. The story is serviceable, rather than inspired. So know what you're getting into.\n\nDIFFICULTY RECOMMENDATION: Ys games can be tough, but provide a variety of difficulties to compensate. This one has very easy, easy, medium, hard, and nightmare. I, personally, wouldn't recommend ANYONE play below medium. If you don't want a challenge, then play a different game. As a veteran gamer, I chose to start on hard. A good choice. Challenging, but never insurmountable. I had to look up only one boss fight - mostly because I misunderstood a mechanic. When I did the boss attack mode on medium after, I beat most fights on my first try. I wouldn't recommend Nightmare for your first playthrough. It'll be tough to learn the fights while simultaneously worrying about timing, aim, and movement.","May 4","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

An action RPG comprising of three separate character journeys through a rather large and complex tower, featuring many natural obstacles and puzzles to overcome. The game is certainly challenging with a combat system that is easy to get used to and offers layers of options to your fighting. You're likely to die to each boss as you figure out the tactics, making it so satisfying when you do break through. There are few other games that have demanded so much attention and kept me hooked throughout the way that Origin has done.\n\nYou can read a full review of this game here.[www.neoseeker.com]","December 29, 2015","true","30.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On top of that, the graphics manage to be impressively beautiful while retaining excellent system performance.  The plot's pretty good, too - about as straightforward as you'd expect in a game like this, but I think the character development carries it, and the fact that there are three slightly different versions of it (one of which is unlocked by clearing the game once, has you initially fighting against the other protagonists, and includes additional plot revelations) improves replayability.\n\nI do feel, though, like Falcom made a mistake with the difficulty levels and achievements - many mistakes, actually.  For starters, SP (points for buying ability upgrades) gain rates are tied to difficulty level, and some upgrades are so exorbitantly expensive that getting the related achievements is only feasible by playing through and farming on the lowest difficulty level, which is so easy as to be boring.  That's not the really crazy part, though.  The crazy part is the extra outfit for one of the characters - let me say that again: it's just an alternate sprite, and an achievement to go with it - that requires beating the game at least 6 times, including 3 on nightmare difficulty, plus spending a lot of time in Arena Mode.  Even if you just want to fight the unlockable optional boss, which I kinda do, you'll still have to do the 3 Nightmare runs and the grinding in Arena Mode.  Now, I do have to give Falcom credit for making the higher difficulty levels challenging in ways that are a little more creative than damage dealt/taken adjustments.  I already mentioned the SP gain rates (I think EXP is also affected to a lesser degree), and your special abilities have longer cooldowns, but the most noticeable difference is in the enemy AI: on higher difficulty levels, enemies will attack more frequently and aggressively, with bosses in particular saturating their lairs with hazards to your health, making the game not just more difficult, but also more exciting.  Unfortunately, though, your chances of surviving still come down to experience level.  A single level gain makes the difference between a boss fight you have absolutely no hope of winning and a boss fight you can probably clear with your character just barely still breathing if you practice a few times.  Upgrades, of course, help too.  And, remember, farming is slower on higher difficulties.  What this means is that a Nightmare playthrough is basically a long, tedious grindfest punctuated by occasional intense boss battles.  It doesn't help that all the dialogue, which ordinarily I'd appreciate, is all unskippable, and there's sometimes a lot of it immediately before a boss.  I had been planning on getting as close to 100% completion as I reasonably could (Caress of Steel?  Ha, ha, NO.), but having beating the game once with each of the three characters, including one Nightmare run, and cleared all but the last arena stage multiple times, it's gotten too repetitive, and I'm kinda sick of it now.  Uninstalling for my own sanity.","January 18","true","72.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I didn't really know what to expect when I started playing it but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The combat is solid and the graphics are charming.  Although you aren't given free reign to upgrade your character like a Western ARPG you level up as you kill monsters which strengthens your stats and you also gain SP by killing monsters which you can use to purchase upgrades for your character to increase passive stats such as Mana Cost for spells. Grinding is also well done in this game, if you kill the monsters as you advance through the game your character will be strong enough to defeat the bosses; however, if you're having trouble with a particular enemy you can grind up to increase your stats if you wish. Speaking of bosses, it was the best part about the game. The boss fights are well designed, challenging, but also fair. It's kind of a "find the pattern" type of deal, but there's a lot of skill involved in defeating the many bosses in the game. It had a Demon's Souls type of feel for the boss battles but the rest of the game had a Zelda-esque feel to it. The bosses were so fun I thought to myself while playing, "it would be awesome if this game had a boss rush mode." Little did I know, it does! It unlocks after you beat the game.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the game a lot, it did have a few problems. The game is linear, with you having to find a key or item to get to the next area and there isn't an open world as you're just going up a tower. That's not to say the environments aren't varied, as they are, it just means there isn't much exploring to do. There's also a bit too much backtracking for my taste, but it wasn't too excessive. The music is pretty low quality and repetative and the control settings aren't adjustable in-game (you have to use a separately loaded launcher) so if you don't have your controller settings set properly you have to exit the entire game to get it right; other than that the controller support in the game is quite good.\n\nThere are three playable characters (one of which is unlockable), each of which gives you a different point of view on the narrative. The unlockable character is actually a demon as well, so you get the antagonist's point of view on the story which I found quite cool. The story itself is rather tropey, but still was a little more adult than other JRPGs I have played (it has swear words and death) which I enjoyed. The game loads and exits in a snap, which is also a plus.\n\nPros:\n\nGameplay\nStoryline (multiple perspectives)\n3 Characters that play quite differently\n"Grinding" done well for a JRPG\nBoss Fights\nUnlockables and Bonus Modes (with leaderboard support!)\nExcellent Replayability\n\nCons:\n\nMusic/Audio\nBacktracking\nLinearity\n\nI really enjoyed this Japanese take on the ARPG genre. If you enjoy killer boss fights I'd recommend it for you. There's also a boss rush mode which is amazing for this game and many other unlockables to keep your interest in the game after you've beaten it. The three available characters all play differently and show you a different perspective on the events of the story and I'm really looking forward to coming back and playing this game again once I've finished the other games in my collection. There are a few negative aspects of Ys Origin (I really disliked the audio engineering) but they don't overbearingly detract from the fun I had with this game. A-\n\nNOTE: I did play Ys Oath in Felghana and I have to say I wasn't as impressed with that game as I was with this one.  The boss battles weren't as epic, grinding felt more necessary, the music was better (but still repetetive), and basically everything that was good about that game is in Origin, but there's a lot missing.  The protagonist is also silent (which hasn't been cool since Freeman did it), and there's only one playable character.  I would NOT recommend Oath, but Origin is great.  If you want more of the same gameplay, play the other characters on Origin - skip Oath unless you REALLY love the series.","March 23, 2013","true","12.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You have to be careful and dodge every attack and in Nightmare mode, the bosses are very durable. It takes patience, quick reflexes and level grinding isn't really that bad.

Both the engines of Ys I & II and Origin & Felghana have the perfect balance between graphics, performance and gameplay quality.\n\nI won't talk too much about the plot because I usually don't care about that stuff.\nYs Origin is a prequel set 700 years before the events of Ys I & II and tells about the past of Ys, the twin goddesses, the black pearl and Solomon Shrine. Most of humanity fled to Solomon Shrine (which is on a floating island up in the sky), as the surface got taken over by demons. For the very first time we're not playing as Adol. We will be playing as one member of a group of adventurers (you can choose between 3 characters) sent to investigate on the disappearance of the twin goddesses, who seem to be inside the Darm tower.\n\nPro / Cons:\n+ = pro\n- = con\n\n- no more "bump mechanics" from Ys I & II. In my opinion, this combat system was unique and kinda set Ys apart from other action RPG's, also it made boss fights a bit more challenging. Ys Origin & other newer Ys games ditched that system for more generic hack n slash mechanics + magic which is okay but nothing special.\n- the game takes place entirely inside of the Darm Tower, so there is not that much variety environment-wise.\n- while Ys I had very short but extremely fast & challenging boss fights (except for a few bosses with bugged AI's), the boss fights on Ys Origin are slow and long, and since the bosses heavily rely on RNG, defeating a boss on Nightmare difficulty is 50% skill 50% luck unless you overlevel to fight that luck factor. Either way, there is too much luck involved in boss fights, and sometimes it can become frustrating even if you can actually beat the boss 100% of the times. This also makes boss rush / time attack extremely tedious and frustrating especially on Nightmare where you will be barely equipped to beat the boss. In Ys I & II, on the other hand, the boss fights were 100% skill based and used nearly no RNG-based attacks, but they were so challenging that you had to practice for a bit to master them even if you memorized them, so the results of the boss fights scaled directly with the player's skill.\n- there is a lot more grinding required, too much for my tastes. Leveling up for bosses takes much longer and filling the monster book is now random instead of having to kill each mob 31 times.\n- the dialogue can be sped up but not skipped. this can be frustrating when playing through the game multiple times.\n- the save system does not allow you anymore to save anywhere - you can teleport to save points, but you will have to save there so that adds some useless backtracking when saving before dangerous situations. On the other hand, the teleport system is handy to quickly teleport to every area of the game, but a system like the wings in Ys II would've been enough.\n- Alt + F4'ing the game has a chance to corrupt your monster book\n+ a playthrough takes about 10 hours if you kill all of the bosses first try and 20-30+ hours if you take a few tries to beat each boss, which is pretty optimal for multiple playthroughs or speedruns.\n+ amazing soundtrack with lots of remasters of the original darm tower musics in Ys I\n+ lots of references to Ys I & II: remastered bosses, lots of monsters in common, lots of remastered music, some key items in common and the plot is nicely linked and properly explains all of the backstory behind Ys I.\n+ very high replay value: each character sees the story from an entirely different perspective, will encounter slightly different bosses and each character's boss fight is balanced differently. There's also an arena mode where you will be able to fight monsters from different areas of the game to gain SP you can use to unlock alternative versions of the characters and other bonus content, including a secret boss. Completing all of the achievements will take up to 6 playthroughs or more. There's also the usual monster book you have to fill by grinding all of the monsters in the game (some are missable), an upgrade system for your characters where you can spend SP earned from mobs, and various Roo's hidden around the game that will give you missable upgrades if you feed them Roda Fruits (also hidden & missable).\n+ the achievements where you have to beat two "unbeatable" boss that you normally have to lose to are pretty interesting challenges even though they're heavily rng based\n+ retrying bosses doesn't make you go through the dialogue all over again\n+ perfect support for the 360 joypad and ps3 joypad + ds3 tool\n+ the engine has a minimum guaranteed performance: for example, if there's too many effects on screen some of them will not display, that way there is always a guaranteed minimum framerate even in the worst scenario.\n+ the bosses partially retain the "bullet hell on foot" feel that Ys I & II had.\n\nIt's not a masterpiece like Ys I & II, but it's an excellent game like most Falcom games and it's certainly worth the price. Highly recommended.","July 30, 2014","true","120.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AtomicProBomb/recommended/207350/","AtomicProBomb","AtomicProBomb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AtomicProBomb/","76 products in account","J-Just.... THE EMERSION! A game that, to me, gave a really good bonding experience with the playable characters. Good difficulty and balance, yet still the possibility to easily gain some more fighting strength for tough fights.\n\nNot many games do, but this game gave me that empty feeling of sadness when it was over. I was forced to consider what just occured, and the meaning of it. And let me tell you, my conclusion wasn't a happy one. Knowing that your character was done and that you would never again experience the same thing is not very pleasant in this case. This is something I rarely see in the modern gaming genres. I want to mention a couple of things to those who have doubts about this game.\n\nIt's a japanese game, so it does have some anime-esk cut-scenes and images. Yet, these occur very rarely, so do not be concerned if you think this would bother you (Though, seriously, why would it?).\n\nIt's an old game, don't look for good graphics and such. Though, that's not what you primarily should be looking for in a game.\n\nThe gameplay feels smooth and fast-paced, something that I thoroughly enjoyed. Characters that are extremely unique and different from one another. Discovering the plot feels utterly fantastic. Any time something plot-related occured in between my beat up sequences, I couldn't help but let my excitement lead me through the dialogues. Remember when I mentioned I felt really empty and sad about my character that I played? How I wasn't going to be able to see her anymore? Well, that happened with not only that one, but some NPCs as well. Definitely an achievement.\n\nSomething more about difficulty. The game has 5 difficulty settings, two above and below normal. This makes it very suitable for people of all skill levels or interests. Keep in mind that you cannot change your difficulty throughout the game, yet this is also not necessary as you will always be able to beat the boss without exception because of the possibility to grind a level or two. Not once have I felt like a boss was truly overpowered. Rather, that I, myself, was underpowered. And that is something that's easy to fix.\n\nNow, something I really appreciate about this game is that you have 3 playable characters. One of which is unlocked by finishing the game with one of the other two. This is because the final one is the hardest one to play and to minimize sploilers for the other two. The reason for that is something you will have to find out for yourself. The last one also has the one true story, meaning, the heaviest plot. This gives the game amazing replayability.\n\nThat is about the best I can give you. If this has not cleared things up for you regarding gameplay and such, I'd say you oughta simply look up a video and see for yourself. Try to minimize spoilers, however! So, to conclude my review, this game is heavily recommended by myself among others.","January 17, 2015","true","26.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The boss battles are pretty hard -- there are no healing spells or resurrecting potions to keep you going. You have to be careful and dodge every attack and in Nightmare mode, the bosses are very durable. It takes patience, quick reflexes and level grinding isn't really that bad. This game also inspired me to revisit the good RPGs of the SNES and PS1 era.

Unfortunately the great gameplay, soundtrack and visuals are dragged down by downright cringeworthy dialogue and a by the numbers story with a very flat ending. The graphics are also a bit dated even for 2006 when this originally came out. However the game still has a charm of its own. The character sprites are well made and environments have clear and different themes and feels. The fast pace of the monster slaying is maybe a bit too often grinded into a halt when you have to sit through lengthy and uninteresting line exchanges between the monotone and cliche characters.\n\nOne interesting thing of note is the other main character of the game, Hugo. He should probably get an award for the most edgy video game protagonist ever. Most of the cringe material of the game comes from his teenage rebel attitude. The story might have been much less cringy had I picked Yunica for playable character, but I also think the edginess is kinda charming and memorable.\n\nIn conclusion the rock solid gameplay and soundtrack totally redeem this game from any negatives I might have towards it.

At the start it appears to be a fairly standard JRPG-esq story with the memorable and challenging hack and slash gameplay Ys is known for, but as you play through the game multiple times with each of the characters, what was first a simple, borderline cliche, if well executed tale becomes far more memorable, complex, and touching. No other game I've seen tells a story like it, and its a damn good story to boot. With memorable characters and story, fantastic gameplay, and a mindblowing soundtrack, there is little reason not to get Ys Origin as soon as you can.","September 28, 2013","true","64.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn`t look like very unique, rather normal. But a Friend of mine, recommended this Game, so i tried it. And how shall i put it? It's Awesome and i am a very big Fan now. The Characters are well-elaborated, the Story is exciting and the Gameplay is so much fun! But the best Thing for me in Ys are the Soundtrack and the Bossfights. Rarely a Game-Series brought me that, what i liked the Most in my Favorite Series like The legend of Zelda, which i love! The one Thing, that can grab you and don´t let you go! And that is what Ys have!\n\n[Deutsch/German]\nYs ist eine der Reihen, die zu Anfang keinen wirklich großen Eindruck hinterlassen! Sie wirkt nicht sehr besonders, eher gewöhnlich. Doch auf die Empfehlung eines Freundes hin, habe ich mir dieses Spiel dann doch besorgt und bin nun ein begeisterter Fan der Reihe! Die Charaktere in Origins sind Spitzenmässig ausgearbeitet, die Story spannend und das Gameplay macht, so simpel es auch gestrikt ist, einfach eine Menge spass. Doch das beste ist der Soundtrack sowie die epischen Bosskämpfe. Selten hat mir eine Spielereihe das gebracht, was ich an meinen Lieblingsreihen wie z.b. The Legend of Zelda geliebt habe. Das Gewisse etwas, ein sog - der nicht mehr loslässt. Und die Ys-Reihe besitzt es!","December 31, 2013","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays very much like an old-school RPG but with action elements instead of turn-based combat.  You're slashing, smashing, and magicking your way through a 20-something story tower full of demons.  I don't want to go much into the story because that's half of what makes this game so brilliant.  I haven't played a game with such a great story in a very long time.  Finish this game through to the end as well, because there's a bunch of unlockables (time-attack and an arena battle mode, to name a couple... naming more would be spoilers).  The replay value is pretty good but if you're going for a 100% completion it could take a long while.\n\nGameplay-wise, it has a few quirks to get used to, and it'll take some time, but once you've got it down it's pretty easy.  The boss battles are INSANE, and there are a LOT.  If you're a fan of great boss fights, you'll love this game.  Each difficulty brings a new attack pattern, etc. to the bosses in addition to basically oneshotting you if you're not properly leveled/geared.\n\nThe only qualm I can see that some people might have is that, like I mentioned earlier, if you aren't properly leveled you're going to have a rough time in certain areas of the game (bosses in particular).  The good news is that you'll catch on pretty quick.  The bad news is that you might have to sit there grinding enemies for a while - which isn't too bad, but you have to make sure you save often just in case.\n\nTLDR: Fantastic story, quirky controls, fantastic boss fights, lots of unlockables and decent replay value.\n\nPick this game up and if you want more of the story, pick up Ys I & II as well as Oath in Felghana.  All four games are worth it, trust me.","January 5, 2014","true","51.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It does a great job explaining how the story started with interesting characters and a plot that suits the game. Dont expect an amazing plot but its decent.\nAs for the content, the game offers three playable characters (one fo them is unlocked after you complete the game with one of the first two) with different story for each one, also there is boss rush,time attack and an arena mode, so there is lots of things to do. Just for completion with one character you will need about 12 hours in normal difficulty.\nThe game can be really hard so think carefully before starting it in hard mode for a first playthrough.\n\nI highly recommend this game for hack and slash action-jrpg fans.","August 22, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are 3 different playable characters with their own playstyles and multiple difficulties to choose from. The basic "grinding" and leveling system is fun and addictive. You'll just want to keep slaying enemies after another, before your accumulating +exp, +str and +mana regen meters run off. The levels have puzzles and ofc treasures aswell, so it's not all brainless grinding (though you still can't turn your brain off while leveling, it's easy to die to normal mobs unless you pay attention). The level designs are nice aswell, there's enough to explore and it's not linear at all.\n\nBut the best part of Ys: Origin are the hard boss battles. (If you're experienced in this kind of genre, I recommend either Hard or Nightmare difficulty to make the best out of the fights) The boss tactics are quite varied, though many resembled me of Touhou games, just in 3D. In other words there's quite a lot of projectiles to avoid, and you can't take too many hits. The fights usually take some time to learn to execute good enough, but beating the boss in the end is a great feeling.\n\nThe story isn't anything fancy unfortunately, so better not get your hopes up on that. Music on the otherhand is great, not the best of the best among the J-RPG composers, but still great. I love those upbeat tunes that play during the boss battles, they make the fights feel even more epic!\n\nThe graphics are really outdated, since the orginal game was released in 2006. The characters are drawn as sprites, but the enviroment is in 3D and looked from an isometric perspective. Though, the game kind of has an old-school feel with it because of this, and it might not be a bad thing. But if you're bothered by the old look, this game is not propably for you.","February 3, 2013","true","56.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At the start it appears to be a fairly standard JRPG-esq story with the memorable and challenging hack and slash gameplay Ys is known for, but as you play through the game multiple times with each of the characters, what was first a simple, borderline cliche, if well executed tale becomes far more memorable, complex, and touching. No other game I've seen tells a story like it, and its a damn good story to boot. With memorable characters and story, fantastic gameplay, and a mindblowing soundtrack, there is little reason not to get Ys Origin as soon as you can.","September 28, 2013","true","64.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I came for Asterbreed but stayed for Ys Origin. I'm not a huge fan of jrpgs and I generally consider them a bit boring (yes even the mythical FF7), but Ys origin has a more realtime, action rpg take on things and it works. In it's simplicity this game puts many AAA titles in shame by it's design, writing and gameplay. Perhaps in 100+ people development teams the heart of fun is often lost. Or maybe the developers of Ys know what they are doing. Either way, give this one a shot.","August 17, 2014","true","24.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZORBURGER/recommended/207350/","ZORBURGER","ZORBURGER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZORBURGER/","141 products in account","Now, let me just say that Falcom and Xseed games did a respectable job with this installment of the Ys series but it is not a game without its flaws. Lets start with the things I really liked. The gameplay was wonderful, honestly I would change a thing about it. Yunica moves where you want, attacks where you want, slaughters thousands of enemies in an effort to grind levels, the way you want... and umm hmm I'll talk about that pretty soon. The visual style was really good to look at with a SNES era feel to it. Although, same of the 3D environments looked a little choppy and jagged it was enough to take away from the game. I liked the good use of colour throughout the games many different environments. What I found really neat that despite the fact you spend the entire game inside a tower the developers still put floors dedicated to elements such as desert, water and lava. My favourite part of the game was hands down the combat which was a pleasure to utilize. The boss fights were always overwhelming and in general were very unique. They provided a great deal of challenge to the player and some would not be defeated easily. Just my basic two cents on what I feel was done right.\n\nOn the other hand there are some areas for improvement that I feel should be touched on. I'm not providing any plot spoilers but I do think the story was all anything to special. If you look at the whole picture then maybe the story is more meaningful, but the events leading up to the end just felt a little bit empty to me. I'm not saying it's bad but it just wasn't what I was expecting. Another thing that I found rather bland was the characters. They weren't very likeable and for that matter many of them just felt forced into the game. A lot of them were unlikeable and literaly added nothing to the game or the story. The villians of the game didn't really have a reason as to why they wanted ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up. A character later in the game dies and the plot sets it up to be very emotional but I think that character had maybe like a dozen lines of dialogue before hand. Anyway, enough about the story elements lets get to the elephant in the room. That's right a JRPG's best friend, grinding. Oh, Jesus Christ, the grinding. Let me just say that I played though this game on normal and I probably spent a very sizable amount of my time proforming mass genoside on these creatures. Why is it that even though I kill all of the enimies in the area, when I get to the boss he rips my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in half? Seriously, like I slaughtered every enemy on the way to the fight and the boss don't give a ♥♥♥♥. So, what do you do? You go back and grind until you level up again. Alright, round 2 you piece of ♥♥♥♥ boss mother ♥♥♥♥er. Nope. You lost again. Game over. Welp, I guess I grind some more levels. This time the boss is ♥♥♥♥ed, right? Nope. ♥♥♥♥ you. And when you finally beat the ♥♥♥♥er you cele-♥♥♥♥ing-brate because you know that all that grinding is past you. You are like overleveled now so, time to go to the next area. The first new enemy you find in the next area does more god damn damage then the ♥♥♥♥ing boss you just beat. At this point you are just like whyyyyy? Why Falcom why? And they are all like ♥♥♥♥ you thats why! So then after crying for half an hour you go back to the last area and grind so you can fight the enemies in the next are and not die. see a pattern here. I've seen more grinding in this game than a the club for ♥♥♥♥ sakes. The worst instance was charging the Evil Ring. After trying to figure out how that criptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t worked, I finally figured out I had to kill those sand goat things an area back. So I start attacking the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and only do 1 ♥♥♥♥ing damage to the little ♥♥♥♥. I start attacking the other monsters in the room and do like 55 to them. So what the ♥♥♥♥ am I doing wrong? Since the trend has been grind grind grind so far I was like fine I'll just level up, it won't be so bad. I ♥♥♥♥ you not, after leveling up 3 ♥♥♥♥ing times, I still did 1 god damn, mother ♥♥♥♥ing, ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ing damage. After stabbing a pencil into my crotch and not playing the game for 4 months I learned that one of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s at the bottom floor upgrades your weapon for you. Now Falcom/Xseed if you can can excuse my language for a second. Ahem... HOW THE ♥♥♥♥ AM I SUPPOSE TO KNOW THAT!?!?! How the ♥♥♥♥ is anyone supposed to know that 4 eyes down there has mastered such witchcraft! You don't because when he spoke he was too busy saying useless rubish that no one gives a sween little ♥♥♥♥ about! On top of that way back closer to the beginning of the game 4 eyes is hiding from you in an empty room that you need the mask to lets you see through walls to find him. which is fine but the the game gave no ♥♥♥♥ing clues or ♥♥♥♥ing hints to wear this ugly mask in this ♥♥♥♥ sucking room. It's not like I would want to where the mask, as it makes me see in black and ♥♥♥♥ing white and also makes all the monsters invisible. Point being that, 4 eyes piece of ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ hat, over here is the scum of the Earth and there should have been a way to throw his troll ♥♥♥ of the side of the tower and its 25 floors of glory.\n\nGames really good. 10/10.","April 3, 2015","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The play control is smooth and seamless whether running, jumping, or fighting.  The short length makes multiple playthroughs easier (and recommended, as the unlockable chracter gives great insights onto the bigger story).\n\nCons: It takes place inside a tower so, for as much variety as they go for, it's alawys indoors and in one geographical location.

Grinding in this game is one of the best grinding experiences in ARPG. Boss battles are tricky and sometimes incredibly brutal, with an upward trend of difficulty in attack patterns and damage received from the first boss to the very last, which is always a crucial key in boss battles design.\n\nStoryline is straightforward and fluid with epic twists (the most literal sense of 'epic'). Covers most of the important key points that explain what happens in the main series, while also leaves very much room for personal interpretation and possibly retelling.\n\nCharacter designs are surprisingly intricate and interesting, considering the fact that Falcom had always been set with simplicity in all Ys titles until Ys Origin came out in 2006.\n\nNot much needs to be said about the music. Falcom JDK Band did a fantastic job as usual. I believe the music in Ys Origin is about as well-praised as that of Oath in Felghana. Beyond the Beginning is personally my favorite track.\n\nThe only potential problem with the game is everything stays the very same throughout all three arcs, except for character combat mechanics, storyline, and minor spoiler: a true final boss. This can be boring to some people, but not to me personally.\n\nOverall, this is definitely a very solid and highly polished dungeon-crawler ARPG from Falcom, and a worthy title to mark the big jump of the series to Ys Seven. Absolutely a huge Yes from me.","December 4, 2013","true","72.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/207350/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","Maybe my biggest surprise / gut purchase ever. Ys is one of those darling series where everyone seems to want to tell you how good it is yet few people have played. While I won't say it's become one of my favorite series, it's become one I've begun to follow, and it along with Trails in the Sky has put Falcom on my mental map when it comes to video games.\n\nYs, pronounced something like "ease" with only the first letter capitalized and no apostrophe, is basically an action jrpg without random battles or a heavy story emphasis. There's a moderate amount of text dialogue but it's interesting enough and no voice acting to drag it down. Ys Origin is essentially a far prequel to the events of Ys I and II, also available on Steam but significantly more dated. You are given two choices of characters. Yunica provides gameplay more similar to that of series protagonist Adol, specilizing in close combat fighting. Hugo seems to be a more experimental playstyle for the series, focusing on long range magic attacks.\n\nI strongly suggest Yunica to be your first playthrough character for the game. Her playstyle is simply exceedingly more engaging than Hugo, who simply becomes a button spam unless playing at one of the more difficult settings. Luckily to unlock the third character you only need to beat the game as one of these two, which is nice if you want to experience the full canon story of the third character without slogging through a Hugo playthrough. Though you may find you don't mind and will want to play his story anyways.\n\nYs Origin is a brief experience, which is good considering that if you want to see everything you have to play the game a few times. It also allows for replays and taking on higher difficulties if you find you truly want to master the battle system. While the common enemies may not offer much lateral thought in how you tackle them, the frequent and varied boss encounters are quite a relative spectacle and there's no re-skinning or re-hashing to be seen here. All of them are tackled in a different way.\n\nThere is a plethora of music selections for each section of the tower. The whole soundtrack is great an I often found myself humming some of the more memorable tracks. There's also good variety, so finding a few floors with a theme you don't really care for is offset by knowing that a new track is just around the corner.\n\nDefinietly consider it if you are looking for a unique jrpg without the bloat that SE or someone like NamcoBandai puts out these days.\n\n8.5/10","December 15, 2013","true","32.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Think Zelda on steroids. An interesting story, awesome gameplay, and very challenging. Well worth the money and made me purchase the other Ys games - which I am also enjoying.\n\nYou are given the choice of playing as a girl with a big axe or a guy with magic. After you beat the game you can go ahead and replay it with the other character or with a new, 3rd character. Playing it with the girl or guy you're first given feels generally the same, although you obviously have an entirely different set of skills. All three characters pretty much trek through the exact same dungeon layout but the 3rd character you unlock fights a set of new bosses and has an entirely different story. Playing on higher difficulties actually changes things besides HP and damage - although the story stays the same.\n\nOne downside is that I feel that the leveling was pretty tedius. You will find yourself in positions where you need to grind out 5 levels because it is literally impossible to beat a boss if you don't have the damage output. This only takes maybe 10-15 minutes before each boss but later in the game I remember having to spend an entire hour just beating up 1,000 grunts.\n\nDefintely one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while.","December 26, 2013","true","28.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mryamyams/recommended/207350/","mryamyams","Talcon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mryamyams/","618 products in account","An expansion pack sequel to Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin has much of the same feel of it's predecessor. New enemies and world to explore, but you handle exactly like Adol Christin, wind-powered spinny attack and all. Origin has three campaigns to justify that extra five dollars on the price tag, but they're all the same, with the exception of bosses. With the same puzzles and monsters, I finished Yunica's campaign but only scratched the surface of the other two, dropping them once I felt like I was going through the motions.\n\nWhat bothers me about the Ys series is that I don't think Falcom understand why their game is good. Every single one of their games starts with at least five minutes of cutscenes, with Oath in Felghana clocking in at 15 before you start to slay monsters. Game, I don't need you to tell me to beat up monsters. Legend of Zelda had an old man in a cave saying "take this sword and ♥♥♥♥ off" and I still saved the world without knowing why or caring. Damningly, around halfway through Yunica's campaign, you get thrown into a supposed-to-lose boss battle, and then your character mopes around for another five minutes of cutscene until your male love interest (no homo) cheers you up and encourages you to keep going. All the while I'm thinking about how much fun I'd be having if I was playing the game. This game needs less talky talky, more stabby stabby.\n\nFour out of five Lennys\n( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( )","April 1, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

LOOOOONG. Like, possibly the longest intro to an RPG I've ever played.\n\nHOWEVER, once you get past the intro, you're introduced to the meat of the gameplay, and holy hell is it satisfying! The combat in Ys: Origin is fast placed hack n slash that seems mindless at first, but if you just mindlessly spam attacks with no thought, you will die. A lot.\n\nIn fact, even if you're careful, you will most likely die a lot, because this game is HARD. The normal enemies are usually no trouble, though there are indeed cases where they can chump you if you're not careful, but the real meat of the difficulty lies in the boss battles.\n\nIf you're at all familiar with the Ys series, than you probably know that one of the series' most lauded aspects is the incredibly designed, incredibly difficult boss fights, and Origin is no exception. You will most likely die to a boss at least once before you learn how to deal with them. And each boss as their own styles, attacks, and strategies, so each boss feels fresh and exciting.\n\nAlso, did I mention the music? Because HOLY HELL the music is amazing. Quite possibly one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for an RPG with fast paced action, an interesting story, amazing bosses, amazing soundtrack, and a difficulty level that constantly keeps you on your toes, then Ys Origin is for you. In fact, give the whole Ys series a try. Its a great series, and Falcom and XSeed are great companies that deserve your support.","August 20, 2014","true","7.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I've been wanting to play a game in this series for a while and I'm so happy I picked this one up. A Diablo-style action RPG, this game is hella fun. I'm several hours into my first playthrough and have really enjoyed it so far. Challenging boss fights, decent level design that rewards you for exploring while providing a decent story. It's all a very solid and polished experience that's worth your time. A lot of games like this have mecahnics that suffer or that are a bit loose. To me, this is a crucial part of enjoying a game's platforming sections. It's very frustrating when you feel like you told your character to jump from the platform they're on to the one on the right only to find that you were pressing every so slightly in an upwards/downwards direction which caused you to miss the platform and fall into the pit. Not so here. I felt like I had good control over the character and rarely if ever made such a mistake that felt all too common even in AAA titles that are top ranked in their class.\n\nOverall I really can't find much to fault in this game. To nitpick I'd say the costumes are a bit plain when you're talking to others but this is also refreshing at the same time. It's simple, and practical. I would also say there maybe could have been more variety with the monsters but this doesn't really bother me at all either. It's just a fun game that's knows what it is and has fun being just that. If you like games like this I highly recommend giving it a try.","August 12, 2014","true","54.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game might look kind of old, but it’s still pretty and plenty of fun. If you’ve played OiF, then the gameplay will feel quite familiar. There are three (one of them must be unlocked) main characters, each with their own style of fighting. The story takes place before the events of Ys I and II, which fans suggest you play before starting this one. Don’t let that stop you from picking this one up whenever you can though! Show your support! Falcom and XSEED are a match made in heaven. I really hope they continue to bring over games to this side of the pond for a long time to come.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heliosleinheart/recommended/207350/","heliosleinheart","Helios Leinheart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heliosleinheart/","641 products in account","It's a satisfying hack and slash game, but keep in mind, this is not a title for the intellectual gamer. I'll start by explaining what I don't like before what I do like.\n\n(IMPORTANT - This game is not worth $19.99. Get it when it goes on sale.)\n\n\nThe writing is horrible and the game treats you like a baby that can't figure anything out on your own. For example, I entered a zone on the 12th floor that would quickly drain my HP simply by being there, forcing me to leave the area. When the character said that it felt like an evil sound boring into her head, I checked my inventory and saw the silver harmonica given to me by one of the goddesses. I figured "No brainer right? I just got this thing, so obviously this is the solution."\n\nI go back into the zone and try using the harmonica, but it doesn't work. And not in the context that the character tried using it, but failed. I mean I went to use the item and got the equivalent of Prof. Oak saying "Now is not the time to use that."\n\nNo, you have to call somebody outside of the room, listen to a conversation, and have the character say bluntly that "Hey, look at this here harmonica. I'll betcha that will solve the problem." So now, I don't feel like somebody who used reasoning to deduce the solution to a problem. I feel like my hand is being held. (And yes, I know that the harmonica still doesn't technically work even after the conversation, but it still serves the purpose of progressing the game.)\n\nAnd again, the writing is fanfiction levels of god awful. Maybe if the writing were better and didn't look like it was tailored to pre-teens, the story could possibly be decent. But with writing like this, there's no way any adult could enjoy it.\n\n---\n\nAs for the good things about the game, despite not being the deepest combat system, it's very fast paced and feels extremely satisfying. I've played the game for about 6 hours now and I'm still not tired of the button mashy combat. Enemies spit out tons of resources after being defeated, giving that packrat portion of our minds a constant tickle.\n\nMy favorite part of the game would have to be the boss fights. Unlike other aspects that treat you like a child, these boss fights are pretty brutal. I'm playing the game on hard mode, and I've had to go through these fights at least 10 or so times before coming away victorious. I love that there's actually room to strategize in these fights. Like a giant centipede that drops poison time bombs from its destroyed body parts. Do you try your best to methodically clear out the bombs, or do you continue assaulting the boss and hope to outlast them? And while you do have the opportunity to go back and grind out some levels to make it easier, these bosses will still command all of your attention.\n\nOverall, I don't believe the game is worth the asking price of $19.99. If the writing were better and if the zones actually had secrets and left more room for exploration, then it would be a no brainer. As it stands, Ys Origin is a fairly straightforward hack and slash that is very good when you're actually playing the game, but suffers when anybody opens their mouth. Again, get it on sale for sure. Around $4.99 is more than acceptable.\n\n","January 7","true","7.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

In 2006 a prequel to the first two games in the series was made called "Ys Origin" it  allowed you to play as three different characters with three different playstyles and abilities. You got to move around a strategize how you were going to attack your foes with melee or magic spells in nicely done varied areas such as a water and fire sections. The game has some platforming and slight puzzle sections at times too which is a nice change of pace. Falcom here again did a nice OST to listen too while your killing those bosses or even when jumping from area to area or running down hallways killing everything in sight. The story as already mentioned is a prequel telling more of the story established in earlier Ys games and connecting them. It's nice and each character you play as has their own little portion in the plot I really like games that do that. If you are craving some action based JRPGs check out this game for sure you won't regret it! :)","August 3, 2013","true","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Each character has their own story that unfolds at a very pleasing rate, but these characters also go to the same places and almost do the same things.  As far as Ys games go this one is definitely one of the best.  One warning though, it is not the best Ys game to start on if you care about the story.  Gamplay wise this game is less like Ys Seven and more like Ys: The Oath in Felghana (Also on steam).  You have three crystals that you will obtain over time and you can upgrade them to do more stuff and get stronger.  This game also has an upgrade system for your armor, weapons, and resistances.  Music wise the Ys games are second to none, a blaring hard rock soundtrack (Plus remixes from Ys 1 & 2).

Each level is a 3D puzzle platformer full of hacking and slashing.  Many of the later boss battles become like shoot-em-up/bullet hell games, except that you A: fight melee (if you choose the melee character, which I did), and B: can jump over the bullets.  Each boss requires a nuanced combination of strategies.\n\nThe RPG elements are pretty minimal, and the XP system is such that you can't grind ahead of the area's level, but you always catch up the area's level before you reach the boss, even if you try to avoid enemies.  IMO that's a pretty good thing, since it means that there is nothing to distract you from the meat of the gameplay.  (It is vital that you find all of the hidden items, though, at least on hard mode).\n\nAlso, while the environments are kinda simple, some of the shader effects look pretty good, the character portrait and sprite art are beautiful, and special effects for character and boss attacks are completely ridiculous (but totally interactive and quite sophisticated; pretty much no scripted execution nonsense).\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention that the music is fantastic.  I still regularly listen to the soundtrack.","December 7, 2013","true","25.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each is a brutal brick wall requiring a lot of learning and retries to get all the patterns down, and, yes, unfortunately, a touch of grinding is required sometimes. There are levels you are meant to be at, as the boss time attack mode makes clear, and sometimes you don't get to those levels without going back and bashing mooks for a while. Still, at the right level, you can treat Ys like a real game and not yet another RPG grindfest.\n\nOther problems, it's flatly worse than Ys Oath in Felghana. The mook combat is more interesting but the addition of multiple characters with different styles screws the balancing all up.\n\nThe story tells an "origin" that doesn't really ever justify itself. The priests of Ys had no grand mystery behind them and other than locking you in a dreary endless tower and throwing a lot of redone Ys 1 and 2 enemies at you, this story ends up offering no real insight to the Ys story, nor does it ever really get interesting enough to justify the freakishly long unskippable cutscenes.  Oath had a bloated tale too but at least it was a rollicking good adventure. Origin isn't even that.\n\nStill, if you liked Oath and want another helping of those amazing boss battles, Origin is worth your time. Even if the balancing is off, the variety is here in spades. If you haven't played Oath yet, go get that.","October 2, 2014","true","26.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yet I'm not one of those; sure, it's basically Ys I&II: The Before Years, but that's EXACTLY why I enjoy the game. Ys as a series has been sorely lacking in back story; many key events in the past have been teased by Falcom, yet we've never seen them. Ys Origin, thankfully, does the job of offering us SOME insight to the history of the flying island, several bosses/main villains of Ys I&II and, finally, the reason why the Goddesses of Ys lost their wings.\n\nEven though Oath of Felghana and even Ark of Napishtim are better in certain aspects, Origin IS NOT in any way truly inferior to them. It has the same great engine and game play of the others, and despite, or perhaps maybe in spite of the fact that it's all contained within Darm Tower, Ys Origin earns its place in my heart for giving me precious back story that's been so scarce.\n\nOh, and Adol is unlockable.

There's enough about it that's bad enough to give it a thumbs down, but it's definitely done some things pretty well.  This review lists major points concisely with more detailed explanations at the bottom.\n\nHere are the flaws I've seen so far:\n-Character and item upgrade systems are pathetically bad.\n-Uninspired levels.\n-The 'puzzles' involve finding an item and backtracking to use it.\n-Framerate issues with some graphical effects.\n-Controls need autofire and autocharge.  Other control problems may be specific to me.\n-Too many rpg text dialogs that can't be skipped.\n-The difficulty curve isn't right.\n-The rate of levelling needs adjusting, and the effect of gaining levels is not done well.  It increases damage done and decreases damage taken, altering boss fight difficulty too much.\n\nGame's strong points:\n+The bosses are very challenging with fully-avoidable attacks\n+The action is fast-paced.\n+The graphics are colorful, and I like the graphical style of the characters.\n\nRegarding difficulty,\nOn Hard difficulty with the magic user, the monsters are a joke, unable to threaten the player.  The bosses are very challenging.  On nightmare difficulty with the melee character, the (skippable) trash monsters are about right, but the bosses are extremely challenging.\nThere is at least 1 boss fight that cannot be won without grinding due to its being a dps race.  It is not obvious that grinding is the intended (and only) way to win the encounter.  Grinding 5 levels for that fight also reduced the boss's attacks from 40 dmg/hit to 9 dmg/hit.  I do not know how hard those bosses are supposed to hit, and I suspect the developers don't either.\nWithout grinding, nightmare bosses can take 1-10 hours to beat, including the time to learn their moves.\n\nUnskippable dialogs\nare ubiquitous and boring.  Even if I were interested in reading the story of a hero who rescues princesses and saves the world, my replays through the game would not be.\nThe intro cinematic is well done, but it can't be skipped either.  It takes at least 15 minutes to start a new game due to the unskippable cut scenes and dialog.\n\nThe controls\ndesperately need an autofire button and a way to hold down the magic charge button.  Using outside configuration utilities creates some problems in the game such as menus opening and closing due to autofire.  Holding down the magic charge button while imtermittently holding down the attack button and periodically jumping has led to some hand soreness.  Without autofire, the repetitive button presses will cause a lot of repetitive stress.\nEven after some configuration, there are still occaisional phantom axis motions, and recharging magic immediately after casting makes it cast twice.","August 16, 2014","false","43.7"," 44 of 106 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","44","106","3","4"

The fact that I am stuck with the resolution 800*600 makes matters even worse.\n\nSo if you play with a keyboard, like stories that takes ages to even let you play and like this retro style with mixed 2d and 3d modells, this might be the game for you.

I know this review is gonna get slated with negative feedback because I'm giving it a thumbs down, but if you're new to Ys then maybe give this a read. I'm not saying it's a bad game. I'm saying that as a Ys noob I just couldn't get into it.\n\nThe controls and combat system work kinda well, and you can remap the controller (which you'll need to do). The graphics and menu system are a little dated and detracted from the overall feel of the game, character design is meh, and you can't skip the lengthy video sequences. I found the music became rather unpleasant after an hour of playing.\n\nThe real killer for me though was the frustrating respawning of enemies every time I left and re-entered a room - even after I'd wiped everything out. This means you have to constantly battle the same dudes in the same places as you venture around solving the puzzles. I did not play enough to comment on the puzzles - I just don't have the inclination to fight the same enemies in a repetitive loop.\n\nI understand this game may be a classic. I can only assume the abundance of rave reviews on Steam are from nostalgic Ys fans (which I can totally understand). For someone new to the Ys series (like me) I'm not sure this will go down as good as the screenshots look. For Ys fans of yesteryear, ofcourse you're gonna love this!

The epic conflict you had in the first game is finally revealed, and what a Hell of a start it is. In terms of story it stands strong, and playing between each character may cause the game to feel repeatable, but it's actually done well. The gameplay may feel a bit stiff or slippery from time to time, but that's because Ys wasn't made to be this combo-ish action game; Adol isn't in it though, so I think that's where the problem lies. It's easy to get to the 100% clearing, but for 100% upgrades you really need to have a love for grinding. And as always in true Ys fashion, if you think this game isn't hard enough there is the Hellish "Nightmare" mode.\nIt offers enough variety for you to play on and a loveable story. Though it may look weird from a linair look, this being Ys 0, the gap of 700 years should indicate that this one will stand on its own like it should be.","December 11, 2014","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is smooth and rewarding, not too complicated but it's not just buttonmashing either. The platforming is done very well, challenging but not frustrating. Bosses are awesome (as far as I've gotten).\nOnly niggle (ugh, really steam? I'm saying n.i.g.g.l.e) is if you're really having trouble with a boss, it may be you're just underleveled. The game doesn't really emphasize your level so it's easy to miss, but I found that after going back and gaining 4 levels, the boss that was seriously kicking my behind, was suddenly pretty easy (although you'll still need to learn each boss' attackpatterns). Luckily though, grinding those 4 levels was very quick, probably no more than half an hour or so, and didn't feel like traditional grinding (aka boring) at all.\nOne comment though, everyone's saying how tough the game is... Well, it's not easy, but you might think it's a frustrating experience. As far as I'm concerned it's not. It offers a challenge, but it never feels unfair and to me personally on normal mode I find it's just right (and I'm not normally a glutton for punishment, still havent dared to start up dark soulds ;-))\nI haven't gotten anywhere near completing this game yet, but just wanted to share this quick review because the game is still on sale for another 21 hours or so.

YES.\n\nIt takes a lot of patience to understand the entire detail of the first story between the first two characters (Yunica and Hugo) in their own perspectives, but understanding it is as rewarding as beating it at higher difficulties -- well worth the effort. But once you complete the game with both of those, you get a new character -- Toal -- and the real story begins. It's difficult to understand like before, but once you figure it out, it's excellent.\n\nYunica is a melee character; Hugo is a ranged character. Toal is a melee character, but his Boost mode turns him into a demon -- crucial for certain areas of the game.

Pretty visuals? An excellent story? Intense action? A challenge? If the answer to the last two questions are "yes", you should try this game. The anime/JRPG style visuals may not be everyone's cup of tea, so take that into account. The story is by no means bad, but nothing that'll keep you at the edge of your seat. But there are some really good reasons why to play this game.\n\nFirst of all, the gameplay. Fast-paced and fluid hack&slash action typical for an ARPG with the difference that it has a vertical dimension as well, adding some platforming to the whole concept. Initially you get to pick between two characters, and can unlock a third one. The story remains more or less the same (it's best described as 3 different points of view), but there are significant differences in how the characters are played, each of the 3 offers a unique gameplay experience. You can pick either a controller or the KB/mouse duo, both work just fine. The configuration tool is user-friendly and offers a lot of freedom in defining your desired configuration.\n\nThere are five difficulty levels, ranging from "very easy" to "nightmare". The game is quite challenging, don't be shy to try it on a lower difficulty if you just don't seem to move forward. The strongest point of this game are the numerous and intense boss-battles, which test your reflexes and wits alike. You won't get anywhere with the "hit it until it stops moving" idea even on "very easy". Expect to hit the retry button numerous times, sometimes it's not obvious what you need to do from the start. Explore and experiment, it's fun!\n\nFinished story mode with all 3 characters? The game still has replay value! In the Time Attack mode, you can test your mettle against the game's bosses without having to replay the whole game again. And it doesn't end there. While Time attack can be played right after completing the game with one character, once you clear the story mode with all 3, you gain access to Arena Mode, where you fight waves of enemies from the level of your choice and collect SP (the game's currency) to unlock bonus content.\n\nThe soundtrack is simply amazing. Masterpiece after masterpiece, greatly adding to the enjoyment the game has to offer.\n\nIf "challenge" is your middle name, then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\nThe verdict: 8.9/10","August 26, 2014","true","186.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is somewhat reminiscent of the older Zelda games, and it's very, very fast-paced.  The graphics are definitely showing their age (the game was originally published in Japan in 2006 or so), but don't really detract from an otherwise enjoyable experience.\n\nThis has been one of my favorite recent purchases.  I hope XSEED is able to publish English translations of more stuff like this and Oath in Felghana (which is also fun, but not quite as good).\n\nPros:\n-Fast paced, fun gameplay\n-Interesting bosses\n-Can reduce the difficulty of boss encounters by grinding a bit to raise character level (good if you're as bad at the boss fights as I am)\n-Although grinding is necessary, there's an XP multiplier based on the number of hits you've made in the last few seconds, so it's possible to grind more quickly by fighting only in crowded rooms\n-Responsive controls\n-Good soundtrack\n-Pretty good replay value--although the levels are all the same, each of the three playable characters has their own story arc with slight variations in the boss sequence and various other details\n-Very good localization work by XSEED; doesn't feel rushed at all\n-Runs very smoothly on modern hardware\n\n\nCons:\n-Graphics a bit stale\n-Long cutscenes and dialog that cannot be skipped (note: there IS an option in the settings applet which suppresses ALL video playback; good for skipping the intro on a second play-through)\n-Character level scaling is very drastic:  Gaining two levels is usually sufficient to turn an unwinnable encounter into a cakewalk, so this tends to inspire a decent amount of grinding\n-You NEED to find all items, particularly weapon power-ups; there are some enemies that are virtually impervious to damage if your weapon is at too low a level.","December 24, 2014","true","58.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Characters can be unlocked within the game, offering up to 4 (one is unofficially unlocked) different selections each with their own types of skill sets. Characters can level up and acquire a set of sword-skills and magic to demolish enemies that are encountered throughout the game. Storyline is paced well, but can be tedious to understand, as the lore of YS is quite deep in this version of the game. Must play as all three storyline characters to completely understand each of their motives.\n\nMusic is also amazing, setting the tone of each and every stage the character enters. Graphics are outdated by modern standards, but the gameplay and music completely allow the user to forget about it.\n\nPlayed through the entire game with all three characters (Yunica/Hugo/Toal).\n\nHighly recommend. 5 out of 5 stars.","August 12, 2012","true","32.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mash Z at baddies. Baddies come straight at you, pushing you towards progress. Build that experience multiplier with every hit. Room emptied? Quick, rush to the next one, don't let it fade away! Mash, mash, hack and slash! Faster, Yunica, faster!\n\nThe part where the game forces you to essentially stop having fun mashing enemies to pieces are decidedly the least fun, and the very first chapter is probably the worst in this regard.\n\nFor the rest, however, the game doesn't look upon you for pushing recklessly forward: the game recognizes that there is nothing wrong with W+M1 (or, rather, Z+↑); it embraces the euphoria you get by building up your attack chain and going from monster to monster, building up buffs in the progress, leveling up without a break -- there is none of that "YOU JUST GOT ONE SKILL POINT STOP EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING AND SPEND IT RIGHT THE HELL NOW" stuff, and the upgrades you CAN buy can wait in between flurries. Hell: the way NPCs in the game described Yunica in their fixed scripts matched perfectly the way I was playing -- accidental Z-mashing-based rolepaying has no right feeling this rewarding.\n\nYou spend 10 hours finishing the game, and you feel rewarded and spent and awesome. And then the game says you've unlocked a new character.\n\nThis is where I usually tune out; I don't really tend to do NG+s with rare exceptions. Ys Origin however was just so much fun it earned a chance for one, and oh boy. This new character's plot is completely different from Yunica's; it feels like the sequel to the story, or rather, a better version of it; and indeed my understanding is that it's this second version of the story that gets picked up in the next games.\n\nThe way he plays, also, is like Yunica squared: for a few boss fights, Yunica could rely on long range attacks to keep safe, but this second character has no ranged options at all. He must get in close and personal and it feels rewarding as hell, even though I've actually been playing on easy throughout -- it's still a game from Japan and I do NOT trust their sense of scale when it comes to difficulty.\n\nI enjoyed Ys Origin a lot and it's almost a pit that the third character's plot doesn't seem different enough to warrant a third replay.\n\nGet it, get the cards and get smashing.","September 4, 2014","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A gloriously atmospheric and rocking soundtrack supports the different zones of the tower while monsterous and menacing bosses bar your path to your ultimate goal of rescuing the goddesses.\n\nThe various ways to complete this game depending on what character you pick through their combat style makes this game very replayable if you are a fan of Ys or real-time action RPGs.

The three main characters in the game play quite differently from each other, Yunica feeling pretty close to Adol's style in Oath, while Hugo is more shmup-ey. The gameplay is pretty much as fast as Oath was, although a bit easier if compared to it,which is a good thing if you thought Oath was hard...\n\nGraphically. it's once again the same deal as Oath. The game is old so it runs on toasters, but it looks great if you can bump up stuff like AA and AF to the max and maintain 60FPS, making the whole package feel fluid.\n\nTo sum: If you like hack-slash JRPG's, it's a pretty great game to play.","March 10, 2013","true","35.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike most Ys games, you don't play as familiar, red-haired protagonist Adol Christin, but rather one of two characters (there is also a 'secret' third character), the axe-wielding Yunica and the mage Hugo. This is a different take on the series than most entries, and is a welcome change as there is a lot of variety with the playstyles of each character, and this also adds to the replay value as you can play through the game multiple times with different characters, the story being slightly different for each as well.\n\nThe story is rather bare-bones, but mildly interesting, particularly if you are an Ys fan or a fan of traditional fantasy storylines. Nothing to set the world on fire, but the main characters are likable (particularly Yunica) and the story does not get in the way of the game's main strength: the fast-paced, action-RPG combat. If you've never played an Ys game, particularly the older titles, the game plays as a mix of a top-down hack n' slash and a 2.5 platformer. Many of the skills you gain have dual uses for both platforming and combat, and there is a decent variety of abilities. That being said, there is much more combat than platforming in the game, and while the platforming can be occasionally frustrating, the combat is where the series, and this game in particular, truly shines. Combat requires you to quickly chain together attacks, make smart use of your skills, and avoid enemy attacks by dodging and jumping. Basic enemies are not too difficult, though there is a wide variety of enemy types to fight, all with their different skillsets and strategies. The bosses are the main attraction, being both difficult and surprisingly epic for a game without state-of-the-art graphics.\n\nOne more thing about this game, and the Ys series as a whole: the music is FANTASTIC! Some of the best videogame music I have ever heard is from this series, and this entry keeps the bar set high. There are quite a few stellar tracks, many of which are boss themes. Overall, I would reccomend this game to any fan of the series, any fan of action RPG's, and any fan of Japanese games. If none of these categories apply to you, then pick this gem up on sale. Trust me, you will not be dissapointed, and maybe you'll become another fan of this underappreciated (but spectacular) series.","July 9, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mash Z at baddies. Baddies come straight at you, pushing you towards progress. Build that experience multiplier with every hit. Room emptied? Quick, rush to the next one, don't let it fade away! Mash, mash, hack and slash! Faster, Yunica, faster!\n\nThe part where the game forces you to essentially stop having fun mashing enemies to pieces are decidedly the least fun, and the very first chapter is probably the worst in this regard.\n\nFor the rest, however, the game doesn't look upon you for pushing recklessly forward: the game recognizes that there is nothing wrong with W+M1 (or, rather, Z+↑); it embraces the euphoria you get by building up your attack chain and going from monster to monster, building up buffs in the progress, leveling up without a break -- there is none of that "YOU JUST GOT ONE SKILL POINT STOP EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING AND SPEND IT RIGHT THE HELL NOW" stuff, and the upgrades you CAN buy can wait in between flurries. Hell: the way NPCs in the game described Yunica in their fixed scripts matched perfectly the way I was playing -- accidental Z-mashing-based rolepaying has no right feeling this rewarding.\n\nYou spend 10 hours finishing the game, and you feel rewarded and spent and awesome. And then the game says you've unlocked a new character.\n\nThis is where I usually tune out; I don't really tend to do NG+s with rare exceptions. Ys Origin however was just so much fun it earned a chance for one, and oh boy. This new character's plot is completely different from Yunica's; it feels like the sequel to the story, or rather, a better version of it; and indeed my understanding is that it's this second version of the story that gets picked up in the next games.\n\nThe way he plays, also, is like Yunica squared: for a few boss fights, Yunica could rely on long range attacks to keep safe, but this second character has no ranged options at all. He must get in close and personal and it feels rewarding as hell, even though I've actually been playing on easy throughout -- it's still a game from Japan and I do NOT trust their sense of scale when it comes to difficulty.\n\nI enjoyed Ys Origin a lot and it's almost a pit that the third character's plot doesn't seem different enough to warrant a third replay.\n\nGet it, get the cards and get smashing.","September 4, 2014","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty visuals? An excellent story? Intense action? A challenge? If the answer to the last two questions are "yes", you should try this game. The anime/JRPG style visuals may not be everyone's cup of tea, so take that into account. The story is by no means bad, but nothing that'll keep you at the edge of your seat. But there are some really good reasons why to play this game.\n\nFirst of all, the gameplay. Fast-paced and fluid hack&slash action typical for an ARPG with the difference that it has a vertical dimension as well, adding some platforming to the whole concept. Initially you get to pick between two characters, and can unlock a third one. The story remains more or less the same (it's best described as 3 different points of view), but there are significant differences in how the characters are played, each of the 3 offers a unique gameplay experience. You can pick either a controller or the KB/mouse duo, both work just fine. The configuration tool is user-friendly and offers a lot of freedom in defining your desired configuration.\n\nThere are five difficulty levels, ranging from "very easy" to "nightmare". The game is quite challenging, don't be shy to try it on a lower difficulty if you just don't seem to move forward. The strongest point of this game are the numerous and intense boss-battles, which test your reflexes and wits alike. You won't get anywhere with the "hit it until it stops moving" idea even on "very easy". Expect to hit the retry button numerous times, sometimes it's not obvious what you need to do from the start. Explore and experiment, it's fun!\n\nFinished story mode with all 3 characters? The game still has replay value! In the Time Attack mode, you can test your mettle against the game's bosses without having to replay the whole game again. And it doesn't end there. While Time attack can be played right after completing the game with one character, once you clear the story mode with all 3, you gain access to Arena Mode, where you fight waves of enemies from the level of your choice and collect SP (the game's currency) to unlock bonus content.\n\nThe soundtrack is simply amazing. Masterpiece after masterpiece, greatly adding to the enjoyment the game has to offer.\n\nIf "challenge" is your middle name, then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\nThe verdict: 8.9/10","August 26, 2014","true","186.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story-line wise, there's nothing ground breaking here with some 'world is ending, must save it' fayre but the dialogue between characters is strong and there's just enough intrigue implied throughout to make you want know what's going to happen next.\n\nOn the downside, some may find the combat element repetitive but it is fast paced and the dearth of creatures with their different attack patterns should keep things interesting. Boss battles on the other hand are a different kettle of fish, bold and brash with more than a nod to old school 90's boss fights they are tricky and engaging, providing you with a real sense of achievement when you finally succeed in downing the overseer blocking your path.\n\nGraphically it's not going to win any awards, lets be honest, it's functional but plenty of set pieces (normally coupled in with the boss fights mentioned above) provide the highlights in what is an average looking game. However the art style has it's own unique character which has been maintained since the original release of Ys, which is charming and beautiful all the way through.\n\nThis is a solid game, plenty to keep you occupied and with a meaty enough story for each of the playable characters to deserve a playthrough, which is all well and good as if you're out hunting achievements, multiple playthroughs await you. Give it a look, especially if it's on sale, you'll be glad you did.","June 14, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is fast, fun and fluid and the boss fights are challenging yet rewarding. Youre standard enemies are easy to kill and don't provide much of a challenge at all, they really only exist to grind if you want to when the bosses start kicking you ♥♥♥. Three main story characters, all of which have unique fighting styles and individual stories, really help to make the game feel whole.\n\nOn their own, the stories are jagged and a bit weak. The writing is VERY amateurish in my opinion, but that adds to the charm of the game. The sometimes hilariously bad dialogue makes it feel as though you're playing through an early 90's anime, but the incredible combat makes up for it.\n\nIt's a fast paced game but definitely not for everyone. If you're hesitatnt, i'd recommend checking out some gameplay footage or waiting until it goes on sale.","July 31, 2013","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an excellent prequel to Ys 1&2. It does a great job leading into the other games in the series if you've never played them, and ties up all the loose ends if you have played them. All difficulty levels pose some level of challenge, even on the easiest setting, which keeps with the Ys tradition of hair-pulling moments. This game really appeals to me as an avid Ys enthusiast because of all the refernces to Ys 1&2 that aren't story related. Obviously, as a prequel, many story elements have a lot to do with the events of other games, but it's the more subtle references that I enjoy. I especially liked the fact that most of the bosses are from the original games, but the fights are different. I get to see the familiar names and remember my experiences from the original games but have unique and refreshing fights with them.

The story's nothing to cry home about, but it's engaging enough to make you want to learn more about characters. Basically an okay plot, points for that.\n\nGameplay is fantastic; three unique characters that each get their own special abilities and varied fighting styles, as well as boss battles that are tailored to their story rather than set bosses (though set bosses still appear). Again, more actiony than RPG-y, but it makes it fun.\n\nThe music helps carry the game, since it almost obviously coined the term "rpg combat music". It is literally as generic fantasy-rock as you can get. I swear this is how a music company got its start. The music still helps the game move along.\n\nOverall a rather fun game to play, and one of the few I've played multiple times just to see everything.

I mean this is not multi-million dollar production, but it does have cut scenes, like-able characters and even some psuedo anime/cg thrown in for good measures.\n\nIt reminds me of those games of yesterday and I have to say I enjoy it's simplicity and fun combat.

Playing the game with all three characters does add a significant amount of replay value, as they play completely differently, and also have some unique story elements.

And thought i would play it just because it's in my library.\nTurned out this game is awesome!\n\nIt's an action RPG, hack 'n' slash style. Combat is very fluid and responsive and more importantly fun.\nThe story in the game is also very good, although it develops along slowly, so it wont rope you in that fast. But once it gets it's hooks in you it's too late. This is the first Ys game i bought and after completing it i had to buy Ys I & II Chronicles+, i want to know how the story continues, and i will get the other games aswell.\n\nThe game is unique in that you have to play the game through 3 times to get the full story. There are 3 characters to play. Yunica, Hugo and Toal. Toal can only be played after you have completed the game with Yunica and Hugo, and rightfuly so as Toals playthrough contains the most story with couple plot twists even.\n\nThis game also has a very high replayability. It wont get boring to play through it several times. And after you beat the game there is also time attack mode, boss rush and arena where you can compete for leaderboards. In arena you also get points you can use in a bonus shop to buy alternative characters to play through the story with.\n\nBig time bang for your buck!\n\nOn story page it says this game has partial controller support. I played through it with controller, also tried keyboard both works fine, i just liked controler better.

A gloriously atmospheric and rocking soundtrack supports the different zones of the tower while monsterous and menacing bosses bar your path to your ultimate goal of rescuing the goddesses.\n\nThe various ways to complete this game depending on what character you pick through their combat style makes this game very replayable if you are a fan of Ys or real-time action RPGs. Through the use of magic artifacts and different weapons you are able to find unique weaknesses in enemies and exploit them viciously. While your equipment is very limited for a Ys game, the items you can pick up are mostly the ones you know and love from other installments as they are recovered from the broken land of Ys here initially.\n\nI never had a Ys game before Oath, but with this, I and II (remade with the old "bump" combat style), and Oath as well in my library I always keep coming back to Ys for another adventure.","November 4, 2013","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is solid but doesn't have a ton of depth. The characters are likable but don't have a ton of depth. The story is your standard "bad guys did something bad; now the good guys better do something about it" fare, so it won't carry anything on its own (not to mention it only shows up for a few minutes of exposition every hour or so). It would be a fairly satisfying little timekiller that doesn't really stand out in any way except for one thing: a lot of the unlocks feel like they're on a free-to-play schedule in a non-free-to-play game.\n\nThe higher tier upgrades in the story mode take an absurd amount of grinding to pay for. Can't beat a boss? Grind some levels, because a single level's worth of stats will make an enormous difference in the damage you deal/take. Two levels will change a fight from brutally hard to a pushover (although that's more "return of the 90s" than "when free-to-play games attack"). There are a bunch of bonus game modes you can unlock and extra characters and alternate character versions with different attacks and all sorts of stuff like that, but they require beating the entire story mode so many times (and weirdly, most of the achievement requirements are also "beat the game multiple times") that I'm guessing at least 90% of people will never even see things like arena mode. I know I certainly won't, even though I'd try it out if it were available immediately after having beaten the game the first time. It makes Korean MMOs look like they're concerned that you don't get outside enough.\n\nAside from that, it's fun enough, but I'd mostly only recommend it to people who want more backstory to the Ys games.","May 13, 2013","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is old-school, balls-to-the-walls hack'n'slay action and it is glorious.\n\nCombat feels smoth and responsive (as long as you avoid playing as Hugo), the story is cheesy and fun without getting too silly or taking you out of your comfort-zone. You also don't really need to play any previous games to understand what the hell is going on, which is always nice. Boss battles are without a doubt the highlight of the game and especially the "duels" with enemy warriors and mages are extremely well-made and memorable in every way. As is the soundtrack, even when it still sounds like really-badly-made-MIDI-file.\n\nThis game is EXTREMELY linear. Most chests contain mandatory character upgrades and even branching hallways are few and far between. Also, if you are the type of person that is easily bored by a single activity, Ys is probably not for you (although the game tries it's best to mix things up every now and again, to varying success).\n\nFor those of you not put off by those things, Ys Origin is a wonderul throwback to simpler times. I can't promise you'll enjoy it but I sure did.","November 28, 2013","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Isometric view, 2D sprites on a 3D background, and fast-paced button-mashing combat. It can be rather challenging on the higher difficulties, where bosses both massive and man-sized will repeatedly deliver you a taste of the afterlife. The story drives the action nicely and sets up for the events of Ys I&II, but it's not the most memorable tale ever told. The real soul of Ys Origin is in smashing 50-foot bosses using your trusty adolescent girl with a giant axe and conveniently-placed magical artifacts. With 3 playable characters (and you'll probably want to play through the game with each) and a more than ten-hour campaign, Ys Origin gives you a lot of bang for your buck.

So even if your equipments and levels are important, player's skill is highly rewarded as well.\n\nI played as Yunica on Normal difficulty and based on that I loved this game! The challenge is good but rarely too difficult that you can't defeat a particular boss, which all are creative and fun to fight against.\n\nThere isn't much customization as this is somewhat of a dungeon crawler, as you battle your way to the top a of tower but there's plenty of story to see and characters to meet on your way.\n\nOne particular point I feel I must mention before ending this short review is how awesome the music is. I have played tons of RPGs over the years, be they Japanese or Western and the music in this game easily is among the top!\n\nSo in all, I highly recommend this game to RPG fans in general.

The game tells the story of two children(?) whom are traveling with their people to find their deities that seem to have gotten captured. You pick one of the two characters, each offering a "unique" story but ultimately the same main points are hit the same and you play through the exact same levels. What keeps this fresh is that the two characters offer a completely different play style, one is like a tank the other a mage (there's also a third one who plays like a berserker) so there's a little replayability. The stories are mildly interesting nothing ground breaking, it's pretty much every jrpg ever so you climb the tower, find bad guys, things aren't what they seem to be, etc. I'm being a little harsh on the story, many may like it far more than me but after playing games like The Walking Dead and Ni no Kuni it seems lacking in comparision.\nI reccomend this game to any ARPG lovers or JRPG fans in general.\n8/10","June 30, 2014","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is old-school, balls-to-the-walls hack'n'slay action and it is glorious.\n\nCombat feels smoth and responsive (as long as you avoid playing as Hugo), the story is cheesy and fun without getting too silly or taking you out of your comfort-zone. You also don't really need to play any previous games to understand what the hell is going on, which is always nice. Boss battles are without a doubt the highlight of the game and especially the "duels" with enemy warriors and mages are extremely well-made and memorable in every way. As is the soundtrack, even when it still sounds like really-badly-made-MIDI-file.\n\nThis game is EXTREMELY linear. Most chests contain mandatory character upgrades and even branching hallways are few and far between. Also, if you are the type of person that is easily bored by a single activity, Ys is probably not for you (although the game tries it's best to mix things up every now and again, to varying success).\n\nFor those of you not put off by those things, Ys Origin is a wonderul throwback to simpler times. I can't promise you'll enjoy it but I sure did.","November 28, 2013","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game primarily revolves around either Yunica Tovah or Hugo Fact, and yes, those family names should be familiar to those who've played the first two games. Each of them plays differently, with some mechanics making some fights a lot easier than others, some more difficult.\n\nThis game serves as the seventh canonical entry in the Ys series (Ys V is non-canon), and as a prequel to the entire series. It does a lot to explain a lot of the lore in the first two games, as well as why even in the main series, there is always a seemingly world ending threat around the corner.\n\nThe game has three characters, two of which are available from the start: Yunica Tovah and Hugo Fact. The third is unlockable after beating the game with either one and finishes the story with its true ending. Even if you don't beat it with him, there is still a lot that is canon from Yunica and Hugo's endings, just not the true mastermind, a very familiar enemy who was responsible for the events in Ys I & II.\n\nKilling normal enemies is rather easy, and if you are having trouble, go back to a previous zone and grind a couple of levels, then come back. You will easily know when you've grinded enough in a zone when the experience rewards vs. the amount needed to level becomes more grindy than the time needed is worth. Basically, if you need to level, you can gain   a level in about 10 - 15 minutes, sooner if you're on the low side for the zone.\n\nStill, the main focus is the bosses. Each has unique mechanics and weaknesses that you need to take into account. Don't be surprised if you die a few times figuring out the boss, and if your attention slips, or you make a wrong move, then you are in for a world of hurt. That's where the fun is.","February 14, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You gain very temporary stat boosts every time you kill an enemy so it rewards you for playing at breakneck speed which is very satisfying.\n\nThe overall plot is a bit generic but the dialogue itself is absolutely fantastic. The exchanges between the characters feels very natural and interesting. It is also free of the unintentional awkward moments that JRPGs tend to have due to sloppy translations.\n\nThe game is of about medium length for an action game, about 10-15 hours on hard mode. However  you are able to play through multiple times as different characters to get a different perspective on the story and each has a unique style of fighting.\n\nThe graphics are a little dated and look like they belong on the Playstation 2 but that's a minor fault.\n\nLastly, the game is clearly designed to be played on a gamepad.

I'll make sure to come back later and polish it up. :)\n\nI've never played any Ys game before, but I'm thoroughly enjoying my playthrough so far. Only about 6 floors in so I have no idea howmuch there is left and I'm repeatedly getting my rear handed to me on nightmare mode first playthrough. I have to say this is one of the few games where constant death doesn't bother me as it generally feels like I made a mistake.\n\nSo far the enemies have been scaling really well in all of their drops, and anytime I get stuck on a boss (so far both I've run into one) I don't mind going back and grinding a level or two to beef up my stats and try again and feel a noticeable difference. Leveling feels really solid so far as I feel a discernible, if not momentous, difference each time I gain a level, and makes me feel rewarded for hard work.\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight with the combat and platforming working very well to challenge your mastery of the game's mechanics. I can't say I've blamed hitboxes or funky camera angles so far whenever I fail to make a jump or whatnot, and that's a solid plus in my book.\n\nWant a challenging game that could very well dunk you on the first practice fight? (Yea that happened, and it felt great). Do you enjoy platforming? Do you like feeling rewarded every time you grind up a level or want upgrades that make you think about a purchase? This game is probably for you.","January 2, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The boss fights are a good challenge on hard difficulty and are very fair in that you can dodge just about everything with practice and/or playing very carefully.

It has been known for being one of the first game series to emphasize story, its brutal bosses,   fantastic rock soundtrack.....and barely ever being imported into the U.S. My own only experience with the series was Ys III, released in 1991, on the Sega Genesis\n\nYs Origins is a surprisingly polished game, considering its original release in 2006. With a focus on combat and dungeon exploration, the game feels familiar, but is polished enough to stay entertained enough through its campaign.\n\nAnd what a campaign. Though a single character's story line is no longer than 8 to 9 hours, Ys Origins provides 3 different characters, each with a completely different fighting style, viewpoint in the story, and even differences in area accessability and boss battles. Combined with bonus time attack and boss rush modes, where devoted players can earn special costumes, battles, and even a bonus character, Ys Origin can easily be enjoyed for over 30 hours.\n\nYs Origin is not without flaws. The story is serviceable, but fairly predictable. Some later boss battles can be an exercise in frustration, and you'll wish that they mixed up the dungeons a bit more between characters. However, for anyone looking for a classic, rewarding, challenging action RPG with all of the Japanese trappings, you can do a lot worse than this artifact of the previous decade.","April 16, 2013","true","36.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is surprisingly flexible for its simplicity.  The set piece boss fights are creative, complex, and completely unforgiving, but for the most part tuned very well -- a player who's practiced up can take them down reliably and feel like a total badass in the process.  Experience gain is tuned to scale based on the level difference between you and your opponent, so you catch up very quickly when underleveled but can always crank out an extra level for an edge against something.\n\nThere are exceptions, of course.  Kishgal is capable of randomly screwing you depending on which moves he does in succession, and a couple bosses (Gelaldy, Pictimos) are long and tedious enough to stop feeling fun after the first half of their HP bar.  The latter third of the game is extremely melee-unfriendly, and poor Yunica is largely reduced to spamming one special attack.","November 24, 2014","true","187.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, the level designs and monsters were fairly basic, but this is not so much of an issue as you progress higher up the tower.  The amount of variety in the demon designs and floor designs later on isn't spectacular, but keep in mind this is all going on inside of a tower.  The bosses--I would say--are the only exception.  The level and skill system revolve around finding new equipment and gems.  Although simple in design, there is just enough variety to keep you interested.  The story itself is alright (at least to the point where I am at...), and the characters aren't too bad.  You won't be interacting with them too much anyway.  In order to improve your character's own abilities and the abilities of some of your weapons and other equipment, the game allows players to cash in the SP dropped by defeated demons.  This SP is cashed in at the game's Goddess statues, which also serve as save points.  Generally, the distance between these save points is just the "right" distance.  If you don't know what difficulty to play at, I would recommend the "normal" difficulty setting.  Normal might seem too easy at first, but the game becomes significantly harder later on.  However, action RPG veterans will likely want to bump up the difficulty a notch or two.  If not at the normal price, then consider adding Ys Origin to your Steam library the next time the game is on sale.","July 31, 2013","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And thought i would play it just because it's in my library.\nTurned out this game is awesome!\n\nIt's an action RPG, hack 'n' slash style. Combat is very fluid and responsive and more importantly fun.\nThe story in the game is also very good, although it develops along slowly, so it wont rope you in that fast. But once it gets it's hooks in you it's too late. This is the first Ys game i bought and after completing it i had to buy Ys I & II Chronicles+, i want to know how the story continues, and i will get the other games aswell.\n\nThe game is unique in that you have to play the game through 3 times to get the full story. There are 3 characters to play. Yunica, Hugo and Toal. Toal can only be played after you have completed the game with Yunica and Hugo, and rightfuly so as Toals playthrough contains the most story with couple plot twists even.\n\nThis game also has a very high replayability. It wont get boring to play through it several times. And after you beat the game there is also time attack mode, boss rush and arena where you can compete for leaderboards. In arena you also get points you can use in a bonus shop to buy alternative characters to play through the story with.\n\nBig time bang for your buck!\n\nOn story page it says this game has partial controller support. I played through it with controller, also tried keyboard both works fine, i just liked controler better. Even if all tutorial popups show keyboard keybinds.","August 30, 2015","true","37.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing out of ordinary here, but not bad either.\n\nCONTROLS: 5/5\nIt has fantastic controls. I just finished my first playthrough and started my second one (with another character) using an xbox controller and it plays just awesome. Responsive action, simple, yet rewarding controls. Maybe that's the best part of the whole game, it sounds kind of silly, but it just feels good to control the characters as you go. In a simple sentence: the game just feels amazing on your thumbs as you play.\n\nGRAPHICS: 4/5\nPretty cool graphics that remind me of PS1's RPG games: anime-like portraits, Ragnarok like sprites, pretty good, overall. The in game effects (such as explosions and fire) are just okay, but the cutscenes are pretty good and nicely rendered.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 5/5\nA simple, intuitive item/level system, with very few choices to make. Reminds me a little of how DMC deals with this kind of thing: you get stronger as the enemies get stronger (no choices in stats), and your weapons compose a little, but handful, arsenal, which you'll have to switch around to get through various enemies/situations. I usually like this kind of system, since it gets me more focused on the gameplay, not on the mechanics, but I do feel they could have done with a little more variety, ability wise. Still, solid system, which absolutely doesn't get frustrating as you go (i.e. no grinding absolutely required, at least on normal dificulty playthroughs).\n\nSOUND FX and MUSIC: 3/5\nMusic is pretty cool too, although a bit repetitive. Sound effects are what you'd expect from this kind of game, adds to the good feeling you get from hacking at an enemy (could have used the rumble feature on a controller, though).\n\nOVERALL:  4/5\nOverall, I give this game a solid 4 out of 5 score. It's not a Steam MUST PLAY, but you definitely won't regret going through a couple of playthroughs. If you like old school PS1 RPGs and don't mind (or actually prefer) having little to no control over your character's status and are rather just there for the fun of the combat, I DEFINITELY recommend you get this one.","September 13, 2015","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I mean that as a huge compliment.\n\nCaked in classic JRPG atmosphere, simple but lush graphics and addictive arcade style gameplay, YS Origin should yet al the buttons for JRPG fans.  You get a choice of (eventually) 3 characters, all with different playstyles,  and each character follows a different branch of the main story from a slightly different perspective, which means you’ll probably at his for 30 hours to complete all three storylines, which is just enough for this kinda game.  YS forsakes the turn-based combat of most JRPGS for an arcade-action style of button mashing mayhem.  The combat system isn’t very deep, but it’s a hell of a lot of fun in the way that something like Golden Axe or Gauntlet was in the 80s, and magical effects are really beautiful.  However, what really impressed my about YS Origin is the quality of the PC port; its got graphics options galore, has been properly adjusted for PC monitors, supports keyboard and gamepads (go with a gamepad, trust me), and it runs at a constant smooth framerate. Hopefully, Japanese developers will take notice, and this quality of port will become the norm.\n\nFancy a blast down nostalgia lane?  Got an itch for  an action JRPG with simple but addictive gameplay?  Give this a try.","August 9, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing out of ordinary here, but not bad either.\n\nCONTROLS: 5/5\nIt has fantastic controls. I just finished my first playthrough and started my second one (with another character) using an xbox controller and it plays just awesome. Responsive action, simple, yet rewarding controls. Maybe that's the best part of the whole game, it sounds kind of silly, but it just feels good to control the characters as you go. In a simple sentence: the game just feels amazing on your thumbs as you play.\n\nGRAPHICS: 4/5\nPretty cool graphics that remind me of PS1's RPG games: anime-like portraits, Ragnarok like sprites, pretty good, overall. The in game effects (such as explosions and fire) are just okay, but the cutscenes are pretty good and nicely rendered.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 5/5\nA simple, intuitive item/level system, with very few choices to make. Reminds me a little of how DMC deals with this kind of thing: you get stronger as the enemies get stronger (no choices in stats), and your weapons compose a little, but handful, arsenal, which you'll have to switch around to get through various enemies/situations. I usually like this kind of system, since it gets me more focused on the gameplay, not on the mechanics, but I do feel they could have done with a little more variety, ability wise. Still, solid system, which absolutely doesn't get frustrating as you go (i.e. no grinding absolutely required, at least on normal dificulty playthroughs).\n\nSOUND FX and MUSIC: 3/5\nMusic is pretty cool too, although a bit repetitive. Sound effects are what you'd expect from this kind of game, adds to the good feeling you get from hacking at an enemy (could have used the rumble feature on a controller, though).\n\nOVERALL:  4/5\nOverall, I give this game a solid 4 out of 5 score. It's not a Steam MUST PLAY, but you definitely won't regret going through a couple of playthroughs. If you like old school PS1 RPGs and don't mind (or actually prefer) having little to no control over your character's status and are rather just there for the fun of the combat, I DEFINITELY recommend you get this one.","September 13, 2015","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one is a bit of exception in length and challenge, but not as negative aspects. While the length for one character is the average of any other Ys, the replay value lies in the fact there are THREE characters in total, each one with their own play style and emphasizing one aspect or another. And the story also changes itself, showing things that happens with that character while it was not on camera to another, or sometimes fate itself will twist and a whole new situation will unfold.\n\nFor those seeking for challenge, bosses and enemies can be blazed through in easier difficulties, grinded in average ones, or skillfully fought in later difficulties. I could go on and on in an in-depth analysis of this game, but I will keep it short and simple: if you want a good story and challenge, Ys Origin is your game.","February 21","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Would recommend to basically anyone who can still appreciate older style games and who isn't turned off by cheesy japanese storytelling. This game is also very friendly to the PC master race, supporting resolutions beyond 1080p and refresh rates beyond 60Hz. The game actually renders very well at higher resolutions, though the textures don't look super great.\n\nYs Origin is essentially a 3D action platformer in the style of Alundra for PS1, and to some extent the 2D Zelda games. Emphasis is primarily on combat, but also on finding your way through the game. Each area has a few branching sub-areas which you must navigate to find a key to the boss room. This usually involves going through the area until you reack a fork in the road where reaching the end of one fork will activate some switch that will allow you to grab the boss key from the other side of the fork.\n\nCombat is very fast consists of attacking, using special abilities, jumping, and some other moves. You have 3 special abilities that you can use in combat that offer you some mix of damage, utility, and range. The abilities are different for each character but serve the same general purpose. Part of the game is figuring out which ability is most effective for the area you are exploring.\n\nThe best part about this game is without a doubt the bosses. Every fight throws something completely unexpected, yet refreshingly original at you. Very rarely will you ever go up to a boss and whack it until it dies. Almost every boss has a weakness that must be revealed in some way before you get the chance to actually deal damage. And each boss has attacks that you need to dodge in creative ways instead of just running in a circle.\n\nI will give the example of what was probably my favorite boss in the game. The boss is basically a centipede where each pair of legs was its own section of body. The way to kill the boss is to destroy each body segment. The problem is that each time you destroy a body segment, it will start spewing poison bombs that explode if left on the ground too long. This severely inhibits your mobility and also throws a lot of extra damage into the mix. Keep in mind the boss is constantly moving, so you not only need to dodge everything, but also catch up to it so you can actualyl deal damage. By the end of the fight the field is entirely covered in poison bombs and you have to find a way to weave through them, jump on the boss, and kill the last segment before you die. This boss killed me probably 20 times, but it was still a great experience because each time you would make tiny optimizations or notice something new about an attack that would let you avoid it more easily.\n\nThough this game actually involves very little actual platforming, the game utilizes 3D space very well. You are constantly moving up and down through the environment which is a nice change from the typical top-down games where everything is just a flat plane. 3D space is even utilized in combat, with airborne enemies that must be taken down with jumping attacks, to boss attacks that can only be dodged by jumping. From my boss example above, the same boss is able to climb on walls, going completely out of your reach. While doing this he will shoot lightning at you, which you must avoid to keep from falling behind. However, you have a special ability that when charged up has a huge vertical range. If you want, you can hit the boss with this move while he is on the wall. This introduces a risk into the fight by letting you hit the boss while he is high up, but you need to come to a stop to use the attack, opening up the possibility of getting hit by the lightning. Many combat moments in the game involes this same sort of risk/reward that weighs more damage against a higher probability of getting hit, which leads me into my next point...\n\nThis game has no consumable healing items and no way to heal yourself during combat. This is especially relevant during boss fights. You only have one health bar, and you have to kill the boss before he kills you. This makes for very tense fights, knowing that each mistake is permanent, each risk you take is a real risk and can't be immediately undone by healing yourself. These fights are reminiscent of many boss fights in JRPGs where you desperately hope that you can kill the boss before your healers run out of MP. You can't cheese out any boss by spamming healing items each time you take a lot of damage. This game forces you to learn the patterns and exploit the weaknesses of every single boss. The same is true during regular combat, but normal enemies drop health pickups and there is also an accessory in the game that allows you to heal which standing still. Even so, the game sometimes throws extra tough enemies your way, and you are forced to kill the lot of them in one go which can be just as challenging, especially if none of them drop a health pickup.\n\n\nNow for some minor complaints:\n\nThe game starts throwing really annoying enemies at you late in the game. While I appreciate challening combat where you don't just mash a button until everything dies, these enemies also flat out waste your time either by being extremely resistant to damage or having small, spread out periods of vulnerability.\n\nThe plot of the game is pretty bottom of the barrel. It's the exact same good vs evil, friendship is power, find your true strength generic japanese crap that we've all heard a million times before. The game isn't quite as cheery as something like Dragon Quest, but you can pretty much predict the exact plot of the game if you've played any other game that follows the same story structure.\n\n\nHere is some stuff that may be good or bad, depending on your tastes:\n\nWhile there are no healing items in the game, you can always just grind levels and become near-invulnerable if you are having trouble with a boss. I would really recomend not doing this, as every boss in the game is beatable in a reasonable amount of tries without this, but it's still possible. Sometimes grinding a bit can really help out, as being underleveled during a boss fight is extremely punishing as you can sometimes be dealing damage in the single digits and taking huge chunks of damage for small mistakes.\n\nThe game takes place in a tower and only in a tower. This means no towns, you never encounter any new NPCs to talk to, the only "shop" is at save points, and the only way to go is up. This does bring about a few perks as well though. If you like streamlined games with no fluff, this is perfect for you. The tower structure also lends itself to being a game with almost zero backtracking through previous levels. The only times you do this are for quick story progression segments.\n\n\nOverall, this game is great and worth playing at least once, if not multiple times with each playable character. It is very reminiscent of older games that were made by a small team of dedicated devs, and you can tell the game was made with love. If you are already a Ys fan, expect something above and beyond. If not, maybe save this one for last becuase I truly think it is the cream of the crop as far as the PC titles go.","February 23","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, your mileage may vary on how these games compare (how easy is is to make money, gain exp, etc.)\n\nNote 2: I will be comparing this to Oath in Felghana's gameplay. Spoilers for both games will be unmarked, so please read at your discretion.\nThis is a review of the game from a technical/gameplay standpoint  not  a review regarding the storyline, graphics, etc. I am writing this review for those that wish to play the Ys games in chronological order.\n\nFor those of you that don't know, Origin, Oath in Felghana, and Ark of Napishtim use the same engine. However, OiF and Origin were released after Ark of Napishtim, in that order, and thus were "tweaked" or "improved," rather, in terms of combat, stat growth, and money gain. Playing in chronological order means playing Origin, then Oif, then Ark, and getting used to things that might be missing, as you go through the series.\n\nNow, I've played Origin all the way through on all characters on Nightmare difficulty, and the first thing to compare between Origin and Oif, is that Yunica and Adol play similarly to each other, without being exactly the same. For example, while Yunica and Adol's fire spells function identically, Yunica gets her fire magic from a sword, which does slightly more damage than her normal weapon, but swings slower. Other than that, their attack patterns are pretty similar, with Adol doing more thrusting as opposed to Yunica swinging her axe about (which makes sense, considering you don't stab with it).\n\nIn Origin, your dash attack has a chance of lowering the enemy's defence, including bosses. This is incredibly helpful as it can be chained into your normal combo. In OiF, you still have a dash attack, however, instead of lowering the enemy's defence, it is a quick 3-hits, that can be chained into your normal combo. That being said, in Origin, it's imperative to learn how to effectively use your dash attack, where as in OiF, you can almost completely disregard it, and get by just fine.\n\nThe second thing to note, OiF and Origin have a thing called Boost, which functions similar to a Limit Break, if you will; while it's active, movement and attack speed is increased, while damage is greatly reduced. However, Origin added an additional power to that, called Burst, a special attack that, when activated, will use the remaining time on your Boost. The attack varies for each character, but is nice to have, as it's essentially a panic button, to go along with your Limit Break. You don't  need  it, but it's nice to have, in the situations where you are surrounded by enemies with 3 HP, and no way out.\n\nRegarding the difficulty as a whole, of both games, Nightmare is incredibly hard, even frustrating at times, in both Origin and OiF. The difference, however, is that OiF has boss fights that are much more demanding in terms of snap decisions, timing, and reflexes, whereas the dungeons leading up to said fights, are a fun challange. Not particularly terrifying or anything. The first boss, Ellefale, is both a perfect representation of what to expect later on, as well as being a nice throwback to Ys 2, where everything died by fire. If you try to dodge her attacks too early, they will chace after you, and you'll get hit, and likewise, dodge too late, and you get hit. For a first boss, having to learn the timing right then and there is incredibly demanding, especially when you die in 2 or 3 hits. Boss fights like Gyalva and Gildias very much felt the same way, requiring precise timing, quick thinking, and not using every tool in your arsenal will cost you your life.\n\nOn the other hand, Origin had much harder dungeons, yet had less demanding boss fights (not to say that they aren't exactly "harder"). I found myself dying quite a bit, as trash mobs used their numbers and large attack power to hit for all I'm worth. The Water Prison has you fighting enemies that can only be destroyed with your earth power, while trying to navigate underwater, looking for more oxygen. The Silent Desert has enemies that, when you first get there, can't be permanantly killed, all the while traversing quicksand, while they come from the ground and dance around you. At times, I felt myself traversing these dungeons with a sense of caution, as the next batch of enemies, and a wrong move would be the end of me. While poor planning will also get you killed in dungeons in OiF, it felt a lot more frequent in Origin.\n\nBoss fights, however, were a lot more fair. The dodging you had to do from enemy's attacks would prepare you for this moment, because a lot of the bosses have projectiles, or attacks that reach large sections of the field. Jenocres' attacks feel very much like playing a shoot 'em up, for example. Which leads to one of the more noticible changes between Origin and OiF; You see the entire battlefield, and always have eyes on the boss, at all times. During the course of the fight, lightning strikes will come down in the area where you are standing, indicated by circles on the ground. You have to keep running, until the lightning is finished chasing you. Being able to see where  Jenocres is, as well as the entire arena, while dodging attacks that reach every corner of the screen is keeps you from running into another attack, after dodging the last one.\n\nThis, cannot be said for OiF. With the exception of Gildias and Ellefale, you do not normally have constant sight on the boss, the entire arena, and Adol, at the same time, without keeping within a certain distance of the boss. The arena in which you fight is about the same average size as the ones in Origin, however, the camera is focused on Adol, zoomed out for the boss fight. What this means is that to see all of the boss's tells and attacks before they happen, you must keep within a certain proximity. However, the result of that is a smaller margin of error for dodging and reacting to attacks.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of traditional shops, Origin has a system implemented where you can buy powers, named Blessings, which allow your character active passives such as boosted ailment resistance, reduced damage from terrain, or things such as increased item drop rate. However, on Nightmare, all SP (the currency of the game) is worth 1 SP. With the occasional treasure chest giving SP, you will have just enough SP throughout the game to increase the defence on your armour, and obtain 1 to 2 extra skills, depending on what you get, and assuming you are leveling normally. The lack of shops also means that you will find all of your weapons and armour, and any items you obtain must either be found, or otherwise obtained from the story. OiF does not suffer from this, as it does use the traditional shop. You do still find weapons and armour during your escapades, however, you can also buy weapons, armour, and expendable items. Thankfully, unlike in Origin, currency in the land of Felghana is a lot easier to come by, so there is no worrying about saving for just the right moment.\n\nUpgrading weapons and armour requires two things: money, and Cleria Ore. In OiF, ore comes in abundance, dropped by enemies, along with gold. Every weapon and piece of armour requires both gold, and ore to level up (stat increase), with better equipment being more expensive. Origin has simplified this process, in accordance with the shop system and/or money drop rates. Weapons are upgraded specifically with Cleria Ore, however, they are scattered throughout the game, and power up your weapon enough to last you until the next upgrade, and armour is upgraded by spending SP.","August 19, 2015","true","136.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

I wasn't sold on the demo, but I got this one on sale. So happy I decided to do that. The demo does not do it justice, not by any means.\n\nPros\n\n- The gameplay is the best part of this game. Fast paced and challenging in a good way. You're not going to find yourself losing because of cheap tricks, it's almost always something you didn't do correctly. The boss fights are intense and unforgiving. You have to learn how to beat a boss, you won't be able to mash buttons and luck your way through it. They demand skill, and will likely take multiple tries on a reasonable difficulty level before you figure out how to counter everything a boss can throw at you.\n-The stories are also an amazing aspect of the game. Each character is unique and will draw you into their individual approaches toward the main plot.\n- The graphics are simple and beautiful, and perfect for this type of game. I love that they didn't try to make this into a movie, like the idea seems to be for far too many games today. If you want a game that's going to blow you away with the gameplay and not make you feel like you're spending 5 minutes playing and then 15 minutes watching a pretty animated movie, this is the game for you.\n\nCons\n\n- The only con I have, and it may just be my situation, is that my mouse does not like this game at all. It seems to lag horribly, and this makes particular parts of the game a real mess. It can be very frustrating when you lose a battle not because you did anything wrong, but because you were trying to move one direction, but because of latency issues, you move another. Also, I've found that the skills (controlled by my mouse wheel) seem to switch even when I'm sure I haven't touched the mouse wheel at all. The game can be played with a keyboard, but that presents it's own challenges. This game really seems like it's perfectly suited for a controller.\n\nOverall I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one. The difficulty levels are scaled perfectly, and there's one for every type of gamer. It's one that you'll probably keep playing just to complete everything about it that you possibly can, because it's that addicting.","February 20","true","37.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one solid little franchise.  There are so many things that Falcom does right in caring for this classic property, and I have high hopes for future Ys games I will be playing.\n\nThis is yet another perfect little charming gem of an action RPG.  It mixes 2D sprite animation and seamless 3D architecture to create a style both retro and timeless.  The care and attention payed to the characters, story, music, and ys heritage is truly admirable.\n\nDesign wise, this game is a typical dungeon crawl, but the challenge is quite thrilling during boss fights.  The exploration aspect can get a bit tedious if you play through the game multiple times in quick succession, but I imagine this can be offset by tweaking difficulty levels to your liking.\n\nOn that note, the story of Ys Origin plays out with a Roshamon style redundancy; with three individual character's story-lines.  Much of the joy of this game comes from experiencing the events of the narrative from these different perspectives.  Granted, there are slight differences in each Character's narrative, with only one (Claw's) considered 'cannon', but walking through the game in each of their shoes lets you become much more familiar with the characters and the world in which they live.  I can't imagine having only played through this game with a single character, and I found each separate run interesting and challenging due to the different play mechanics.\n\nIt's a faithful loveletter to the Lore Falcom has developed for Ys over the last several decades.  The characters, the settings, and even the music is heavily inspired by past games in the franchise.  Now at the time of this writing, I had managed to play the steam releases of Ys 1&2, as well as Oath in Felghana (remake of ys 3).  These games stand perfectly fine on their own story wise, and it is absolutely unnecessary for anyone to have any prior knowledge of the franchise to get your money's worth.  That being said, each entry also helps to paint a beautifully detailed picture of a larger whole.  Falcom seem quite devoted to the world they've created, and the relationship between games is actually quite nuanced.\n\nI'm so very glad I played through this, and I encourage everyone to take it for a spin.  If you're only interested in a charming hack 'n slash romp, by all means coast through it.  If you're at all interested in the story of Ys, I very much encourage you to experience each story line.  On the lower difficulties, each play through should take about 8 hours.  I, myself, played the first round on normal, then coasted through the next two on easier settings for a total playtime of 26 hours.","March 14","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's worth every bit of money I spent on it. But it's not perfect. There are some flaws with the game that prevents the game from being great.\n\n1) The story\n-If you've already played Ys back in the golden age of the Super Famicom, you'll probably appreciate the story in this prequel. But if you never played them, chances are you'll be disappointed with the story. It's very cliche and predictable. Even worse is the story for each characters. Long story short, each of them aren't parallel with each other.\n\n2) The difficulty\n-Hard games are good and welcomed but the difficulty in Ys Origin is borderline cheap and unfair. Basically, the higher difficulty means enemies have more health, takes less damage and deals more damage to you. It pretty much boils down to grinding enough levels by killing the same enemies over and over again, just to inflict damage more than 1 to the enemy. That, and finding power-up item to strengthen your weapon because if not, the later stages becomes nearly impossible. Unless you're a masochist or have a lot of free time, just play it on normal or easy.\n\n3) The gameplay\n-It's fun enough for a few hours, especially after getting all abilities but it get pretty old as you play. Equipment, stats, abilities, items, etc are all streamlined and simplified. You'll be begging for more complexity the more you play. Almost no exploration or secret locations to discover, a few unneeded platforming and a non-existent puzzles to solve.\n\nI'm giving this a thumbs up simply because it succeeded in giving me a brief moment of enjoyment.\n\nRECOMMENDED        : For Ys fans. If not, buy this during a sale.\nNOT RECOMMENDED: Player who seeks more complexity than slash-fest J Action RPG","January 8","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game truly shines mechanics-wise in the boss fights, they're hard but not unfair and can be a lot easier if you grind. If you just want to fight some bosses, there's the boss rush mode after you finish the story. The soundtrack is also extremely good, with musics that suits all the moments in the game very well.\n\nIn short, Ys Origin is a masterpiece and a excellent prequel for a excellent series.

The Silent Desert has enemies that, when you first get there, can't be permanantly killed, all the while traversing quicksand, while they come from the ground and dance around you. At times, I felt myself traversing these dungeons with a sense of caution, as the next batch of enemies, and a wrong move would be the end of me. While poor planning will also get you killed in dungeons in OiF, it felt a lot more frequent in Origin.\n\nBoss fights, however, were a lot more fair. The dodging you had to do from enemy's attacks would prepare you for this moment, because a lot of the bosses have projectiles, or attacks that reach large sections of the field. Jenocres' attacks feel very much like playing a shoot 'em up, for example. Which leads to one of the more noticible changes between Origin and OiF; You see the entire battlefield, and always have eyes on the boss, at all times. During the course of the fight, lightning strikes will come down in the area where you are standing, indicated by circles on the ground. You have to keep running, until the lightning is finished chasing you. Being able to see where  Jenocres is, as well as the entire arena, while dodging attacks that reach every corner of the screen is keeps you from running into another attack, after dodging the last one.\n\nThis, cannot be said for OiF. With the exception of Gildias and Ellefale, you do not normally have constant sight on the boss, the entire arena, and Adol, at the same time, without keeping within a certain distance of the boss. The arena in which you fight is about the same average size as the ones in Origin, however, the camera is focused on Adol, zoomed out for the boss fight. What this means is that to see all of the boss's tells and attacks before they happen, you must keep within a certain proximity. However, the result of that is a smaller margin of error for dodging and reacting to attacks.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of traditional shops, Origin has a system implemented where you can buy powers, named Blessings, which allow your character active passives such as boosted ailment resistance, reduced damage from terrain, or things such as increased item drop rate. However, on Nightmare, all SP (the currency of the game) is worth 1 SP. With the occasional treasure chest giving SP, you will have just enough SP throughout the game to increase the defence on your armour, and obtain 1 to 2 extra skills, depending on what you get, and assuming you are leveling normally. The lack of shops also means that you will find all of your weapons and armour, and any items you obtain must either be found, or otherwise obtained from the story. OiF does not suffer from this, as it does use the traditional shop. You do still find weapons and armour during your escapades, however, you can also buy weapons, armour, and expendable items. Thankfully, unlike in Origin, currency in the land of Felghana is a lot easier to come by, so there is no worrying about saving for just the right moment.\n\nUpgrading weapons and armour requires two things: money, and Cleria Ore. In OiF, ore comes in abundance, dropped by enemies, along with gold. Every weapon and piece of armour requires both gold, and ore to level up (stat increase), with better equipment being more expensive. Origin has simplified this process, in accordance with the shop system and/or money drop rates. Weapons are upgraded specifically with Cleria Ore, however, they are scattered throughout the game, and power up your weapon enough to last you until the next upgrade, and armour is upgraded by spending SP.","August 19, 2015","true","136.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ParselMaster/recommended/207350/","ParselMaster","ParselMaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ParselMaster/","286 products in account","This is, so far, one of the most satisfying action games that I have played in recent years. It is deceptively simple in its mechanisms, but it adds layers of different components and tricks as time goes on.  The gameplay is intense, but strategic. The music is equally intense. The game rewards you the faster you cut down foes by rewarding additional XP per hit, but that counter will decrease as time goes on; this encourages you to keep progressing. The boss-fights are intriguing, and are (deservingly) much more difficult than the enemies around them. This requires a more tactical approach than just mashing buttons; you may end up dead before you can blink if you don't pace yourself.  The platforming elements require timing and focus.\n\nYour mileage may vary on a few of these next details, but I think that they are good to note. The game doesn't force you through several of the immersion-breaking and random overworld fetch-quests that can detract from other JRPGs, but at the cost of no overword (that I have seen) to explore. I see it as a pro for this particular game as the world around the tower is a wasteland rather than a varied environment to explore. Due to the facts that the game only appears to take place in a tower, that it is an action game based on a relatively simple to use combat system, and that the game is fast-paced, I suspect that some playing this would tire quickly. Play on Nightmare difficulties for getting the most out of the game: truly exhilarating boss-fights.\n\nAll in all, an excellent game that I recommend highly.","May 10","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
