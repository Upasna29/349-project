BUT as bonus difficulty you have to meet todays standards for RTSs, because now you want to be an RTS also.\n\nDespite being in development for a very long time now, the game is very light contentwise. It's a bit of a backtrack to the first version of Godus, although you have to do less now.\nYou are there to level the ground, so that your people (which you can't control)\ncan build their houses on plots(which appear automatically)\nto generate belief (which now gets collected automatically, one of the few positive aspects).\nWhen you have enough belief, you build a fort (out of your houses that merge together automatically to a chunk with battlements) where you can recruit soldiers.\nThese soldiers are somewhat controllable, although their pathfinding is terrible and the mouse response is too, and you send them to conquer and destroy the enemy village.\nAlso the animations are clunky and ugly, the collision detection doesn't work that great resulting in corpses hovering above ground and blood splatters spread widely although the corpse is already gone.\n\nThat's it for the beginning, so at the moment the game is neither fish nor meat, as RTS it falls flat on its face because there are way better ones out there, and the god game aspect is mainly moving around dirt to make way for plots, not very interesting either.\n\nVERDICT:\nI gave the first Godus the benefit of the doubt, rating it positive, because it showed promise and I changed my rating to negative when the support ceased and the game died.\nThis time I will do it the other way round, so it gets a negative rating from the start (because it absolutely deserves this), BUT this version of Godus also shows promise, so if it gets way better and deeper than it is now, the rating might also change. As for now, NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\n(PS: And dear developers, get rid of that cheap mobil-ish feel of the game, as long as your plan isn't to use PC gamers as beta testers for mobile AGAIN, this won't do you any good.)","February 3","false","1.4"," 240 of 267 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","240","267","0","1"

An attempt to sweep the reviews under the carpet, it still has the godawful sculpting mechanism that forces you to click and click and click and click, except now instead of running on a unified engine, it switches between Unity and I -think- WebGL (I can't be sure, but it's a pain in the rear because it bounces back and forth like a hyperactive kid who missed a ritalin dose). Every time I want to switch resolution, it needs time to think, every time I start a map, it needs a moment.\n\nIt reminds me of Battlelog. That's not a good thing. The RTS mechanics? Oh they're simplistic, you generate units, you send them forward, the pathing AI is terrible, with units unable to react if hostiles enter their firing vicinity, units pathbugging the moment they try to fire upon buildings. It's bad, oh god it's bad. It's like 22Cans thought slapping a REALLY BAD version of Divinity Dragon Commanders' RTS (and that wasn't even a particularly shining RTS example to be fair) on top of their already creaky god sim was a capital idea.\n\nSo where does this leave the entire Godus experience, and what does this say about Mr. Molyneux?\nUnsurprisingly, GODUS was a splotchy mess. GODUS Wars is also a splotchy mess. Fable was a lovely splotchy mess. Most games that Molyneux has been involved in have been to some extent, a splotchy mess. There's a recurring pattern in among this. The successes have come about when the rest of the team have been able to refine the splotchy messes and turn them into something that resembles what is actually either going on in Molyneux's head, or a marketable game, or somewhere between the two. It's tricky to figure out where the magic is, when it hits, like Black and White, it opens up whole new ways of looking at games in general, but unfortunately, you wind up seeing a lot of splotchy messes between the rare flashes of inspiration.\n\nNot that it stops him. Now this would be perfectly human and forgivable were it not for the fact that Peter has a ... well, an almost Steve Jobs like "Reality Distortion Field" that he projects. It's as if there are two different worlds in existence at any one time when Peter talks about his games, and when he talks, we're getting a glimpse of the game -he- sees, and not the one -we- see. Case in point would be "Curiosity : What's inside the cube". Peter called it a profoundly lifechanging experience. Pete, mate, IT WAS A GAME WHERE YOU CLICKED CUBES. IT WAS COWCLICKER FOR APPLE DEVICES. THAT IS NOT A LIFECHANGING EXPERIENCE.\n\nThe sad part is, the person who won Curiosity still hasn't got a single penny from the fund that was supposedly reserved for him, he may never see such a penny.\n\nIs there any hope for 22Cans?\nOne day someone will tether Pete to the ground, and then we may once again see a return to form like the Bullfrog games of old, until then, we're going to see splotchy messes, infused with occasional strokes of genius, but often way, way oversold and far over marketed by Mr. Molyneux himself. Take anything that comes from him OR his dev team with liberal quantities of salt, and look up information about the game from other sources, then make your own decision if things like GODUS and GODUS Wars might appeal in the long run.\n\nRight now GODUS Wars is barely a game, it's two very distinct halves cut and shut together into one ugly, frankensteined whole, and that's created a horrible, malformed monster baby out of code, and out of game. I wish I could describe just how terrible it feels, but the best description I can come up with is that it's the worst elements of Divinity Dragon Commander (which had a lot going for it, but the RTS -was- the weakest link), Battlefield 3's battlelog system (which made people invent new swear words), GODUS (which was frankly appalling), and the horror that comes from letting Peter Molyneux off the leash with nobody to force him to stick to a singular vision.\n\nWould I recommend the package of GODUS or Godus Wars on it's own?\n\n...\n\n...\n\nThat would be asking me if I recommend Lutefisk. Only to the very worst of my enemies.\n\nThe most observant among you may notice that some of this review was taken from my initial GODUS review, that's because like GODUS, big chunks of it have been taken and dropped, liberally into the "new" game, and much like GODUS, lots of it holds true here. I see no reason to change parts of what I said then, as it's just as valid now. If Pete feels the need to recycle terrible mechanics like that horrific land shaping thing, then I shall recycle what I said about his work prior.\n\nVerdict : Fly, you fools!\n\nPandalicious: Any time a reviewer is forced to grapple with the culinary genocide that is Swedish cuisine, it is a clear indication that the manure has not just hit the fan but splattered itself across the wall in a fashion that any modern painter would be proud to take credit for under the name "An Ode to Brown".","February 3","false","0.8"," 210 of 230 people (91%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","91","210","230","35","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/recommended/422420/","fredriknd","Fnord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/","2594 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is by far the dullest strategy game I've played in my entire life. And I've played a lot of them.\nWith an opening like that, it's questionable if you actually need to read any more, but let's take a look at what's up with Godus Wars\n\nFor some reason 22cans decided to work on two games at once, based on Godus. They scrapped the original store page for Godus and started anew with Godus Wars (you still get the original Godus if you buy Godus Wars). This is something that several developers have done in the last year or so with games that have received very negative reviews, and while I can't say for sure that they did this to hide the old negative reviews, I can't help but think it might at least have been in the back of their minds.\n\nGameplay\nGodus Wars advertises itself as a mix between a strategy game and a god game, and it does combine elements for traditional RTSs and games like Populous. This is not inherently a bad idea, though it's not a new one, Populous 3 did this to some degree (though it leaned heavier on the RTS part).\nThe god game part is simple enough, you click on a piece of land and drag to either raise or lower it. You click on things in the world, such as rocks & trees, to remove them. In order to do your godly deeds, you need followers who generate energy, the more followers you have, the more energy you generate, and the more godly deeds you can commit which in turn can help you make more room for your followers to build their houses. It's simple enough in theory, and quite similar to the basics of Populous. The issue here is that the controls are terrible. Raising and lowering land feels imprecise, and the land has a tendency to "snap back". Raising or lowering land by more than one level is a chore, in particular raising it. It's not fun, and unless this part of the game receives a complete overhaul it never will be. Something like say left click to lower the land around your cursor and right click to raise it would work a lot better. But simply put, there's not any joy in the god game part of this game, and generating the power needed can feel slow.\nWith the god game part being really bad, how does the RTS part fare? Worse. This is quite possibly the most simplistic RTS I've ever played. In order to build units you need to build forts, this is done by having a bunch of houses that your followers live in being merged together. The more houses that are merged, the larger the fort. Larger forts can support more units. Once your archers are built you can just send them out to fight, and if they win their fights they will get a bit more powerful. It would seem like unit preservation is important, but in reality combat mainly boils down to "who has the most archers?". If a unit of archers die, you can just build a new one at no other cost than time. Capture an important building that the enemy has and you win.\nMoving units across the field is a slow process, having them kill enemy units is a slow process, having them attack enemy buildings is a slow process, and capturing the main enemy building is a slow process. Everything is slow, slow and dull. The game lacks any real sense of strategy, it's just try to clear as much land as possible, spam archers, and if you're feeling brave, use some boring godly powers to make your units slightly stronger. The RTS portion of the game would, much like the god game portion, need a complete overhaul to be enjoyable.\n\nGraphics & sound\nEverything is highly stylized in Godus. If you like the style, well that's up to you, I personally find it a bit charming. Animation quality leaves a bit to desire, and there's not a lot of things going on at any given time, making things look a bit dull after a while, but at least everything feels consistent.\nThe sound is monotonous and boring. There's not much going on, nothing feels like it has any real impact and the few sound effects that exist are played over and over again. In their current state, turning off the sound actually had very little impact on my enjoyment (or lack thereof) of the game, and that's not good.\n\nFinal thoughts\nGodus Wars is an incredibly dull & boring game. Sometimes with early access games you can see potential, they might have a few warts & wrinkles, but with a bit more work they might turn into a gem. Godus Wars does not have potential. It would need to be re-worked from the ground up to be worth playing, and considering it seems to be quite far into development, I doubt that will happen. Everything is slow, and there's nothing to do, no real strategy is involved, playing this game just feels like a huge waste of time. And I would not consider playing this on my phone either, I have better strategy games on it as well. This is quite simply the dullest and most boring strategy game I've ever played.","February 7","false","0.5"," 94 of 99 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","94","99","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frij/recommended/422420/","frij","Frijoles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frij/","784 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou know, I actually didn't mind Godus. Sure, the clicking was annoying, but I did spend a fair amount of time in there building things up and exploring the lands. It wasn't terrible. But this? I don't even know what to make of it. There's only one reason I can think of as to why a company would release a game in this state, and that's money. They should simply call it, "Godus - We Need Money". Where to begin? I'm going to do my review backwards from what I usually do.\n\nThe UglyWhy, in all the holy lands of Godus, does this application launch a second full screen application when I try to battle? I can't even fathom how this works. Are they using some sort of battle engine in Godus that they didn't want to port over to Godus Wars? What happens if I uninstall Godus (I may try this)? I'm completely flabbergasted on this. I wanted to ask in the forum, or maybe it's in the FAQ, but...\n\nThe BadThe forums are currently locked. Any time a company locks the forum and allows no discussion, right away you know it's to avoid negative threads. And this game, AS IS, will only be negative threads. They knew this was a pile of ... going in to it, yet they pushed it out anyway. Was there no way to simply wait a few weeks until the engine could be fleshed out? They put up absolute garbage and praised it, despite it being several orders of magnitude worse than Godus.\n\nThe battles themselves, when they work, are fairly simple. This (I hope) changes later on, but I haven't gotten very far yet because the game keeps crashing. Perhaps it's releated to it trying to run another process and getting confused somewhere inbetween. The few times it has worked, I had to manually select the second window it opens.\n\nOne of the major complaints in Godus was all the clicking. The clicking is still in this game, but luckily it appears you don't HAVE to do it. It feels more like a bonus click now. The game generates points on its own, but you can still click the rocks and trees to get additional points. I put this in the bad section because I fear it's going to feel like I still have to click all those rocks if I want to stay ahead.\n\nGraphics-wise, the cards it shows me are blurry if I click on them. They don't appear to be very high resolution (I was running on 1920x1200). The rest of the engine in the battles looked fine since it was the Godus style, but the other windows that were tacked on for this just don't have a crisp look to them. I understand this is EA (very very early EA I hope), so maybe they can be bothered to drop a slighly higher resolution image in sometime during the EA period.\n\nThe starting God Powers, sculpting land, seems a bit pointless so far. I can't destroy the land under my enemies and destroy their village. I hope there's more later on (at this point I wouldn't put it past them to not have other powers), but I certainly don't feel very powerful here. Esentially the first few maps are:  Click this building, build a unit, send them to the enemy, go to next map. If your map is going to last 30 seconds, why bother? Make it a bigger map. Especially if you're going to screw around with my resolution and desktop switching from application to application.\n\nThe GoodLike Hearthstone, this game has a spinner at the start. Unlike Hearthstone, this one actually matters. It changes the battle from making items/cards cost more to giving you bonuses or debuffs. I like the random nature of this, and if it works right, it would add a lot of replayability.\n\n... boy, not much else to say that's good. I rarely do reviews. Godus Wars is clearly a cash grab disguised as.. I don't know what. If you still have Godus in your library, stick with that. It at least has a calming effect, unlike this that just causes anger.\n","February 3","false","2.0"," 89 of 94 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","89","94","0","0"

This very limited and flawed reboot of GODUS comes after a 12month period in which no major content updates were made to GODUS. The release of this game is the first meaningful communication from 22Cans in five months. As a potential customer you need to know they do not serve their community, they serve their wallets.","February 3","false","0.1"," 75 of 80 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","75","80","0","0"

Instead this is just more highly questionable behaviour used to distort and twist things in a long history of shady practises from this company.\n\nDon't be fooled into thinking this is a positive step or signs of life. It's just 22Cans attempt to cover their ♥♥♥ and avoid the fallout of being accountable for lying to customers and killing off a game by releasing something else and saying "Oh no, this is just a continuation of another aspect of the Godus experience!"\n\nIt's not the next step taking Godus further, it's not adding to Godus nor is it as 22Cans claim "A action packed extension to the Godus experience". It's something 22Cans have had a small sub-team throw together in Unity during the year or more of Godus development being dead and buried to try and bury Godus and the crap they pulled.","February 3","false","0.8"," 281 of 377 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","281","377","0","26"

(You can use those one-time cards to make everything even faster!)\n\nStrategy:\n1. Harvest Belief from environment while first house completes\n2. Build 1-star Capital as soon as possible (costs 500 belief)\n3. Start production of a platoon\n4. Select the not yet spawned platoon and place their flag at the enemy base\n5. Harvest more Belief while platoon is being constructed.\n6. When the platoon is ready, right-click the platoon's portrait to center the camera on them.\n7. Use the speed buff.\n8. If the enemy has not created a capital on your platoons arrival, capture their belief tower. VICTORY!\n\nelse if the enemy has a capital, use your Damage buff, then attack the capital. Switch to enemy troops if they manage to construct any and use your Leech buff to keep your troops healthy. After their capital goes down, capture their belief tower. VICTORY!\n\nIf the enemy has multiple troops you have been waaaay to slow and must now slowly construct an army, attack their towers while keeping your troops alive so they level up and then take down the enemy troops and capitals. Pray that you are able to direct your troops accordingly, as it can be hard to select enemy troops near and behind buildings.\n\nFEEDBACK:\n- The environments in each level doesn't change how the levels are played out.\n- The random rules doesn't appear to be random. (another person got the exact same rules for each map, the same goes with the reward card selection)\n- The rule that increases the cost of god-powers doesn't change the shown values accordingly.\n- When you get to the second continent you keep your cards and keys, but the new continent kinder got the same cost of keys throughout as the first continent. Actually.. The whole Key thing is rubbish in its current state.\n- Enemy troops hit-boxes should take priority over buildings when ordering an attack, but they do not.\n- The readability of what the troops are attacking is low.\n- The readability of your troops target could be improved. (There is a difference between when you target enemy troops and enemy buildings, but it could be clearer)\n\n\nWhy the Key mechanic is stupid:\n- To play a level you must not only consume keys to unlock it, but you are also required to have completed a level next to it.\n- The reward for completing a level is at least the same amount as is required to unlock it.\n\nThe only case where the function of consuming keys to unlock levels is meaningful, is when a player unlocks a level, but doesn't complete it. The only sensible reason for this behaviour is if the player has taken on a too difficult challenge and simply cannot beat the unlocked level.\n\nSay the player uses 8 out of his 12 keys to unlock a level that he can't beat.\nNow he can only choose new levels that costs 1-4 keys to unlock.\n\nThat is a huge problem. The mechanic only serves to future hurt an already frustrated player.\nFuture purposing of the keys can't be an argument, it will simply be a horrible excuse for a currently bad design.\n\nA better way to do it is by simply not consume the keys in the first place.\n\nSo instead of:\n5 keys - 3 keys + 4 keys = 6 keys\nit would be:\n5 keys + 1 key = 6 keys\n\nBam! Just like Super Mario 64 and most other games. Also.. why something so generic as keys? Why not keep to the theme of conquering? Like.. Castles? Cities? Might? Strength? Power? Houses of God?\n\nIf there is supposed to be another purpose to the keys, then I'm sure seperating the keys from the unlocking of levels is only for the better. Else.. I can't wait to be proven wrong.\n\n70 UNIQUE AND DEFORMABLE LEVELS\nThat bring all the same circumstances and doesn't change your approach whatsoever!\n\nThe only meaningful difference between levels can be found in your starting area as you will sometimes have to clean it up. Well there is more, like differently placed and different amounts of junk to get belief from and some heights that will depled your belief as you sculpt, but none of it is memorable.\n\nThe quality of the level-designs are worse than randomly generated maps in other RTS's (like Age of Empires). Or maybe I should say it's the same quality? As I feel sorry for whoever had to sit and create these junk-levels. There is simply nothing to design a level from.\n\nOther games have meaningful mechanics to base the levels around. A game like Heroes of Might and Magic got plenty of entities to fill the map with. Games like Warcraft got ressources to control and units for land, water and air. An obscure title such as Gruntz got important equipables, powers and triggers around the maps.\n\nGodus Wars has nothing, but the opposition. It got mechanics that should allow for an ever changing battlefield. It got a Swamp spell that can make one way seem less favourable than another, it got a sculptable environment. The sculpting is however not reliable and impactful enough to use strategically in any big way.\n\nThe current levels are all symmetrical Skirmish maps, the enemy AI is weak, but the current mechanics of the game doesn't allow for a more interesting AI, as it will only be able to create a boring tug-of-war against the player.\n\nMany other RTS's actually suffer the same problem, as it is not easy to make an intersting AI for such levels, infact, most RTS's singleplayer heavily relies on completely different scenarios. Populous: The Beginning's singleplayer maps tend to all be unfavourable to the player as he has to invade enemies already established bases while the enemy at times sends units out. The obscure game Gruntz main singleplayer mode is actually a Puzzle game using the exact mechanics as seen in the Skirmish maps, this creates a great environment to learn the player the full extend of the mechanics. And popular RTS's like Starcraft tend to give player a limited squad and various objectives throughout a map while the enemy units are spread out and only attack when provoked.\n\nGodus Wars store page says "Maps that change as you play with the unique deformable land - No two battles will be the same! " - and yet every battle can be put in a straight line.\n\nINClUDES FEATURELESS STUFF!\n4 playable Deities with a range of abilities\n\nA playable deity means you get 1 permanent card and 1 consumable card, that is it. So you pretty much get to choose your first permanent card between 4 choices. The consumable has no impact as you will get those more often than not after each victory and the one you get with the deity is not of a different quality than those you get from victories.\n\nThe first permanent card you get with your deity also has no real impact in the long run as you will quickly gather similar permanent cards throughout your campaign.\n\nSaying that each choice of Deity are with "a range of abilities" is simply misleading.\n\n2 Deity opponents - including Bryan Henderson!\nPoor Bryan\n\nVERDICT:\nThe current build is not made with the consumers in mind.\n\nP.S. The Premium Content debacle is insulting and the store page was misinforming: Only the first line of what is included in the build mentioned content locked away behind a premium purchase while all the other lines boasts about content which includes the content that is locked away! This is obviously not meant to help the consumers make an informed purchase. It is decieving and misleading.\n\n"The Early Access build includes:\nFirst continent included as standard - Second continent available unlock-able via premium addon.\nOver 70 unique and deformable levels\n4 playable Deities with a range of abilities\n2 base unit types - Archers & Catapults!\n20 cards with 10 power levels!\n2 Deity opponents - including Bryan Henderson!\nOriginal Godus included"","February 5","false","2.2"," 67 of 70 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","67","70","0","2"

You're lucky if you can get through a match without it crashing, but then crashing is basically a part of the design because when the game crashes it will open itself again throw some bunk at you about how "embarassing" this all this and then just GIVE YOU the rewards for playing the match. This makes tweaking things around quickly an actual strategy to just win a level without having to put forth any effort.\n\nEven more amusingly each level has a random modifier, one of which can be that sculpting is completely disabled. Removing the one real aspect of being a god left in the game and reducing you to the rank of glorified shaman buffing your soldiers as they run into battle.\n\nYes this is early access, but so was godus for ages without any real progress and what we have here is nothing new save for a shody grannery to hold belief and some soldiers and a new menu interface. Frustratingly there are keys required to open new sections of the map as well as cards that can be used up repeatedly continuing the bad aftertaste of this being some sort of Mobile+ game.\n\nPass on this or at the very least wait several months to see if any real progress is made.

In Godus Wars, you wait until you can build one of two types of unit, then click on the enemy, then repeat that until you move on to the next stage where you do the exact same thing. In Godus, the player waits until they can move small amounts of terrain around so buildings can be built, then they wait some more to do the same. There's apparently a victory condition, but there's a persistent bug that prevents players from moving on.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Godus Wars patch is a bug-riddled, slapdash mess that can barely keep one window functioning properly, let alone the two it currently requires.\n\nOutside of the previous lovely art direction and momentarily interesting terrain manipulation, there's nothing about Godus Wars worth recommending. If it hadn't been in development for three years, I'd write it off as a bad game, but given its history, I can't believe it's anything but a scam.","February 4","false","1.0"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","0"

Sure, we all know he never said there would be two seperate games.  We could just go back and look at the Kickstarter if we really wanted to.  The reality is that the original Godus was pushed into Negative Review oblivion and instead of continuing to update that hunk of junk, or you know, actually finish it, they released this as a seperate game to get out from all those negative reviews.  The only problem is that they would have to give this new game to all the people who originally backed Godus and feel completely betrayed.  Further proof that Peter and team treat their fans like idiots.  Did they think we would forgive them or think this crap RTS makes up for anything?\n\nIf you must have this game for some silly reason, at least wait until it makes it out of Early Access and gets completed (Hah!)\n\nIt is not the game I was originally promised and it probably never will be.

So I restarted the game, and somehow I had won something, but only for nothing to have changed in the game, so I attacked the same island. The game was still windowed and seemed to freeze, or it wasn't being made clear what I needed to do, so I just quit.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, and this is what I get after how many years. At the end of the day there is little to show for after 3 or so years. And it is clear that this is designed for mobile, just look at the style, everything is large text and thick borders.

Saying that the game was always envisioned as two separate entities is a downright lie. As it currently stands, most of the bugs from the original (failed) Godus are present here, plus some extra.\n\nAs for the game play, it barely counts as an RTS either way. Unit control is spotty and AI is braindead.\n\nSave your money, don't buy this.

First this was a horrible attempt to side step all the negative reviews for the original Godus by renaming the game to Godus Wars.  Even ignoring the train wreck from the first attempts at a free2play mobile game, this new game is just as bad but with new bugs and tech problems.  The game launches two windows, a strategic mode window with the world map and another that runs for the battles.  This second window is almost never in focus or even on fully on screen.  Furthermore, you can't fullscreen the second new window and end up unable to read parts that windows task bar overlaps.  Unity selection is flaky and often times ends up making you deform the terrain instead.\n\nThere are new card and map mode changes to Godus Wars that make it feel even more like a free flash game.  Add to that when it was released they had paywalls for DLC content for a $20 unfinished game.  It really tells you what kind of company/developers they are at heart.

It's unfinished. Just like the sad example of one of the worst early-access schemes ever, Godus. I can't imagine the nerve of developer Peter Molyneux (who was so brilliant, once) trying to sell this as a game when he completely abanoded Godus. This was supposed to be one game; people dropped money on his promise to reboot Populus. And now I am so suspicious of early-access games; Godus has decimated my desire to help indie companies in fear that it will be their "retirement" game. The game they never finish, just collect enough money so they can go pension somewhere. The game's tagline is completely misleading.

Many had presumed Godus was dead and buried, but to our surprise Godus Wars comes along.\n\nThe "combat" update...This was the start of the long-awaited "combat" update for Godus - which is now being framed as a stand-alone RTS game.  The original concept for battles existed in the 2013 alpha builds, but was pulled with the version 2 "it's not free-to-play focused, honest" revamp. Unfortunately, the F2P ethos still lives large (as does the mobile-focused gaming engine, Marmalade) and this is more real time sculpting than it is real time strategy.\n\nThe "strategy"...I've never seen a strategy game with such a linear path before...\nPick four cards (if you even have four)\nSculpt the ground for a bit\nBuild houses\nBuild a citadel, maybe two\nTrain armies (by clicking a button)\nTell the army where to go\nWatch the army get trapped because it uses the same broken pathing logic that Godus did\nFive minutes later, start a fight - and either win or lose.\nIf you win, stand around the opponent's silo for 30 seconds.\nI gave up after ten levels - which is handy as the first paywall would have kicked in soon after!\n\nBeware the DLC hype...As with Godus, 22cans are eager to promote what functionality "will" exist in the future, and eager to blur the lines as to what is included in the base price of £10.99 ($14.99) and what is paid-for DLC.  At the time of writing, only the first continent is available in the base package, the second continent by DLC ($4.99), and the remaining five to be determined at a later date - it's possible the final game will cost more than $40.\n\nIn summaryWhen you add in the primitive enemy AI, the continuing game crashes from Marmalade and the pointless mechanics such as keys (which appear to restrict your ability to deviate from the intended path) - it's a concept that suffers as a mobile RTS game, and fails as a PC one.\n\nDespite the "early access" label, three years on Godus Wars is no closer to an RTS game than Godus itself is to a "reimaginating of the god game".  It's going to need some serious work to achieve either of those goals.\n\nIf you are looking to spend £15/$20 on an RTS game - there are dozens of better alternatives out there, games like Rise of Nations and Age of Empires II have stood the test of time and I'm sure Steam can recommend plenty of modern classics too.","February 4","false","2.4"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

Peter Moleneux, the maker of games like Black & White, has come to this malformed piece of @!#". I couldn't get past the first 5 minutes without hating myself for wasting my money.\n\nFirst of all, if you're going to label this as a seperate game, WHY THE HELL put a choice between Godus and Godus Wars on the opening screen? IF I WANTED TO PLAY GODUS, I WILL HAVE CHOSEN IT IN MY STEAM LIBRARY. Sorry for the use of all caps but that was a point I wanted to make clear, and absolutely clear.\n\nWhen I get in the game, I was asked to pick a God, so I did. Poof. Game died. Restart:  I'm greeted with a globe and images of a God in red and my God in blue. When I spin the globe for some reason, little sprites of blue followers fly out for some reason (like you do, I nearly fell off of our planet the other day) and I don't mean 3 dimensional little people, but crappy 2D sprites, flying off in a 3D view, that you can view from any angle, and, as you can imagine, if you look down the middle then fortunately these thingies go. So after I spend a good minute wondering wth that globe thing is for I realise the glowing red continent is what the game wants me to go on, so I click it and click "Next".\n\nSo I'm in. Or am I? It seems I'm in an overview of this continent, with my people, or whatever you can call them, at one side of the continent and the enemy at the other. Or, I assume they are. I mean with this game, who knows. I am then directed to send my people to some innocent people who are next to mine. So, I go to battle with them. WHAT'S THIS? I'M IN GODUS?? Oh yes, apparently they couldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to package the Godus code and stuff into a different application so they just went and fudged it and linked it to Godus. Because I don't have enough applications open. So, I play along, and I have a village and the other village, the enemy village, is on the other side, simple. So I have to summon my archers through the "Citadel" and the send them to the village. I do so, and my archers are sent to massacre the innocent people of this island. They do so, and a house topple over on to it's side. But, guess what. When it toppled over, the underside of the adobe has a transparent texture, for christ sake.\n\nTo finalise, do not buy.

I’ll recommended it because I’m honestly having fun playing it, even though I’m fed up with Peter and his treacherous company. I still disagree with you guys basically abandoning Godus and splitting these two games up. So please merge them together and make us a real game. You messed up with your payment model which was clearly based off of your first game entirely, so pick up the pieces of what’s left of your game and put it together. Your reviews will go up, your company would redeem itself, and for the love of God, shut Peter up.\n\nStop Peter from making broken promises and also stop him from thinking up of ideas for new games when his current one is in ruins and highly unfinished. By releasing a new game, you guys will literally kill off what’s left of your business. You will not bring new fans or create new ones. Anyone who’s hooked up to the internet will easily figure out what you and your company has done previously. You have two options, redeem yourselves or fail. I believe you guys do have what it takes to make a great game, don't give up.\n\nEdit:\n\nJust read what this game has already done wrong which is probably the last straw to see the utter failure of this company as a whole. After a previous attempt to add micro-transactions to Godus which was a disaster, they ended up trying the same crap with this game. Basically it was a paywall, a DLC for an early access game which is far from finished. Not sure how Phillips, who’s now supposed to be acting as a CEO, let this new game and DLC slide.\n\nSo much for gaining our trust, you guys simply never learn, are greedy, and are terrible when it comes to business. They ended up removing the paywall, but the damage has been done and the game’s history will be forever recorded. Whoever made this call, just costed 22cans’ failure unfortunately. Another thing, for a game in early access, there is little to no updates along with the original Godus which continues to be an unfinished game. These games are abandoned. It shouldn’t take a game more than a month to patch an early access game which the entire staff is working on. I don’t trust them, you shouldn’t either.

But its far from it, the graphics and gameplay are dated, the game frequenty crashes. I couldnt get passed the first two missions simply beacuse it just crashed all the time. They have this terrible two window system, that just doesnt work.\n\nThis is not the game we were promised, its incomplete, buggy, not fun at all to play and I feel cheated by 22cans.\n\nDont buy this game.","April 4","false","0.3"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

You no longer have to worry about building support structures, since it does that for you... automatically... wherever it wants.

I also suppose they will somehow combine both games into one to make it more holistic and the revolutionary game they initially wanted to create. At the moment this is only presented as a separate game to Godus. You are given a world map with continents and try to conquer each part of the continent one by one. There are cards you obtain and deities to choose from but they really make very little difference to the strategy and gameplay. One opponent is at one end of the map and you are at the other. Very easy to conquer and very long but overly linear to reach the goal. After you have finished one continent the same process is renewed with other continents. Not sure what happens after you have conquered all continents but, as stated, the game is too tedious to try to find out.\n\nOn a side note (since I'm a graphic designer and feel the need to comment on it) the "blood" aspect is way too present : The title screen, the animation... we get it, it's war. However, as it doesn't really fit in with the already existing graphic style (which is neither "gore" nor "dark humor"), this much blood makes it too deliberate and incompatible.","February 15","false","21.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

So basicly you can have up to 4 windows at one time and in win 10 dual monitor setup it isn't even full screen on any of them it just pop out in the middle and you have monitor borders dividing you game screen.

However, it seems like 22Cans is so concerned about creating something "new" that will make them significant residual income that they (or more likely Peter) refuses to accept that fact. Were they to scrap the cards, make the terrain sculpting easier and more powerful, allow buildings to be torn down to make room for larger abodes, and took away the player's direct control of units and instead gave them Godly powers to indirectly influence the civilians, you'd pretty much be there.\n\nAs it is, this seems to be a poor attempt to run away from the negative reviews of Godus by simply rereleasing it under another name, with an RTS game that is incredibly simple and also includes some terrain sculpting. It's just not fun.\n\nPeter, buddy, just keep repeating that above line to yourself. You can turn the game around, and people would buy it because they loved Populous.

Then I noticed Godus Wars had appeared in my library. So after looking around to see what the hell was going on, and learning how shady it all looked, I downloaded the game and tried it out. I never had much invested in godus or paid much attention to its development, so this is a review of Godus Wars on its own as a game that mysteriously appeared in my steam library.\n\nI launched it and after being presented with a group of 22cans employees' portraits under the heading "Your Team" (my team? can I fire them if I dislike this?), I was shown a selection titled "Choose Your God"... and a box down below explaining that I need to choose my god. The overbearing tutorial continued. I was told to unlock a land, so I did, then a second window popped up. I clicked on the other window out of curiosity, upon which the new window disappeared visually, but was still there and blocking input to my background windows. Since it seemed nothing was happening, I closed both windows, and then tried to restart the game, but steam said it was already running. This is a level of technical quality that even for an early access game that mysteriously appeared in my library for free, is enough to merit a negative review from me. So I came to the store page to leave a review, and while trying to find the box for the review, Godus War's Separate Battle Window™ popped back up, and it was a completely scripted tutorial. Upon completing following the directions, most of which involved waiting for my archers to burn everything down (couldn't I have just seized the farm and made use of it?), the window closed, and steam finally decided the game was no longer running. I started the game back up and it remembered that I won the battle, which may have been the first time the game worked properly, so that was nice. I was thrown back to the continent map. Overbearing tutorials are annoying, but in most cases they end. However, Molyneux has decided that's not quite annoying enough, and the tutorial continued, directing me to where the second battle was to take place. After a bit of poking around, this turned out to not only be the obvious next place to try, but the only place I could possibly have gone.\n\nThis game is a travesty, and it's a travesty all its own. The technical quality of the game is apalling, even for early access,  and especially from an industry veteran like Molyneux. The lies, broken promises, and general sleazyness of 22cans only provides more reason to avoid this game, but they're not required for a negative review.","February 6","false","0.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I don't think any game has ever received such a high percentage of bad reviews compared to good ones. Godus: Wars has even managed to beat Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. It is the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (Atari 2600) of our time. Seriously this is so bad it may warrant a new "Do you recommend this game?" choice that is lower than "no". If you can think of the worst thing possible to ever exist and multiply it by 2, you would have this game. It's like when you go see a live performance that is so terribly bad you feel embarassed for even being there to behold it.\n\nThis game is a collection of gameplay elements that sound fun if done properly, but don't work well together or the way they were implemented. Some worked with Vanilla Godus, but some were still bad and were even worse when combined with combat.\n\nAll in all you have to be a real masochist to enjoy this game. It is frustratingly punishingly slow and annoying to the point of actual outright suffering. I can't think of anything at all in this game anybody in their right mind would consider fun.\n\nThere are so many annoyances in this game. I don't think there could be more annoyances if they were trying to pack as many in there as they could ON PURPOSE. I mean seriously, did none of this come up in the meetings? Did the developers even try to play this before they released it? It is so bad it is hard to say where I should even start.\n\nFirst of all I have never liked the terraforming. It has been implemented in a way that just does not work well with a mouse. You end up clicking and dragging the same spot 500 times just to make a tiny area of land. This might not be so bad if it weren't such an important part of the game and if it weren't combined with the need to get it done fast because now you have an enemy doing the same thing but he doesn't have to ♥♥♥♥ around with a mouse. The terraforming ♥♥♥♥ implemented as it is now does not work well at all for a combat-oriented game where everything is time sensitive. Leave it for the casual game, not the war game. If anything, let the NPCs do it.\n\nSecondly, the pathing is ♥♥♥♥. The troops tend to run back and forth not knowing where they need to go, or run around in circles while being shot at. You are pretty much forced to control the warbands independantly because the pathing is even worse when you try to combine them into an army. They should replace the combat units with headless chickens, it would be more realistic.\n\nOne of the most annoying things about this game is the lack of any way to navigate the map with any convenience. Your troops are slaughtered so you need to make another army fast but your base is on the other side of the map so you have to slowly scroll there while your armies are fighting and dying. I guess Godus is too cool for a minimap.\n\nHalf the time when you add a new warband to your army it just sits there and doesn't bother trying to get to the rest of the army. I wouldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ either if I were them, it's not like they will do any good anyway.\n\nWhen attacked by enemy troops, your army will shoot buildings and just let the enemy kill them. I guess I would be suicidal too if I were a character in this terrible game.\n\nWhen the enemy is standing on the mission objective you cannot target them. Even when they are sitting out in the open with nothing near them it is STILL hard as ♥♥♥♥ to target them. It's like walking over to this building is more important than shooting something that is killing you.\n\nYou have to deactivate a god power before you can click on anything else. Very annoying, especially when you forget it is activated. One would expect it to be automatically deactivated when you try to do something else. God powers are pretty useless anyway. Might as well remove them completely. In fact remove the whole game and replace it with RTS elements that are already established that people expect to be in a RTS game becuase they work.\n\nYou can still squish houses to your base even after it is maxed. There is no feedback at all letting you know if it is even doing anything anymore. I liked it better when I could just use gold to upgrade a base. "Squishing" doesn't make anything more fun.\n\nEach zone of each island is exactly the same. It feels like there is no progression at all. How can this game take up 3 gigs when there are only like 4 art assets?\n\nReward cards are terrible. Really I just spent an hour so I could get 4 extra followers for the next stage? Maybe if they were PERMANENT it would be sort of worth it.\n\nIf you alt tab out of the game and get back into it, the window is now slightly underneath the windows task bar. Congratulations now you can't see half your UI.\n\nWTF 2 game windows? How does this enhance the game again?\n\nIt is a repetitive game of attrition. Make armies, go shoot houses until your armies have intentionally killed themselves, repeat (and hopefully you slowed down their army generation by at least 1%). How is this fun?\n\n\nPeter, if you are going to try to be innovative, why not do it with something we WANT to see like a sequal to Populous or Theme Park? So bite the bullet and pay for licensing, it would be cheaper than total failures like these. I couldn't even tell you how to save this one, it is such a big failure I don't think anything can be done.  The only way to make this game more fun that it is now is if it did everything itself and all you had to do was watch.\n\nThen again maybe I am wrong about all this. Maybe they were trying to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game on purpose to win some 'worst game of the'.. EVER... awards. Well, "congrations, you winner !".","February 5","false","2.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","17","20","4","0"

Well. It's actually a pretty good game, it is! But while it’s seems to be a game where you kind of do the same kind of war over and over, it also gives you a sort of relaxation that I don’t find in many games, especially in games that has to do with war of any kind. Now, with that said, this relaxation also gets replaced with stress that comes from a feeling of having to hurry op. Now don’t think this game is a time management type of game, it’s not. No the stress comes from never knowing when the game is going to crash yet again. A crash is extremely likely in this game.\nI am a very patient person in general. I don’t mind a game crashes once in a while. But there is 2 factors here that make my blood boil:\n1: this game crashes a lot. I mean really often.\n2: there is no way to save the game in a battle.\n\nWith these 2 factors combined I get kind of angry. Because this means that when the game crashes, you will have to start a battle all over again. The game does sometimes notice a crash and try to compensate by giving you keys. Keys you get after each battle to open for a new area. I’m not sure if you’ll lose any temporary cards though - cards that you use in battle to get advantages.\n\nBecause of all this I am not going to recommend this game, unless this is going to be fixed.\nI have no clue if that will ever happen, because of the disaster around Godus – their first game.\n\nNow also please do notice that this game is in early access. This means that it is not a finished product. But yet again, I do need to see them fix the severe bugs and actually finish the game before I am convinced it’s going to change, and with the memory about Godus still very clear in my mind, they need to make an effort to convince me that I can go from NOT recommending to recommending this game.","May 12","false","15.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","2"

I understand why most folks are angry. Personally, I'm a backer and I'm willing to forgive all this if the final product is good.\nBut is the game good ? No. Godus war tries to be a mix of a God game and a RTS, but it's a horrible RTS and a okay-ish God game.\n\nWhat is lacking, in descending order of importance\n- The ability to select multiple unit by creating a selection rectangle around them with a simple click of your mouse. The game kinda have control group but that's not enough.\n- A minimap.\n- Add more units type. I have only played one unit type (archer) in 4 or 5 battles, so the game started to feel repetitive.\n- A move-attack order. But don't remove the simple move order, the game needs both.\n- Production queue for barracks.\n- Moving the camera by placing your cursor on the edge of the screen.\n- Healthbar for units directly in the world. Okay, you have a list of every units on the top of the screen, but you can't read the health of units in a control group, and it's hard to know what unit in the world have how many health.\n- Hover help text for powers and cards.\n- (Rebindable) Hotkeys.\n- Rally flag for barracks. You can rally a unit while it's under construction, but you can't rally every units ever build here.\n\n\nWhat should be removed or reworked, in descending order of importance\n- KEYS. Don't lock players behind arbitrary condition. I quit and uninstalled the game because after losing one battle, I didn't have any keys left, so I couldn't do anything. That's unbelievably stupid.\n- Giving to the player a choice of one card in 3 is a good idea... if only I could know what card does what.\n- The pathfinding is not great, although that's a minor issue considering everything I've written before.\n- Buffs spells feels underwhelming for the moment. Maybe you should make them global ? (click on the buff and every units you control gain it while it last)\n- Tone down the blood a little.\n\nSo yeah, until those complaints are fixed, Godus wars will be a bad game not worth your money (and I won't play it).","February 4","false","1.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feindfeuer/recommended/422420/","Feindfeuer","Feindfeuer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feindfeuer/","1015 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGodus Wars includes both the original Godus and its new RTS spin-off Godus War. Which takes the Godus art assetts and clunky controlls, adds some blood and a bare-bones RTS interface that is just as terrible as the basic landscaping interface of the original game. Which should come as no suprise, as the terrible interface was the inspiration for the RTS spin-off.\n\nTo quote Peter himself:\n"We’ve always loved the landscape forming, changing and sculpting but quickly realised that it’s slightly more uncomfortable to do a lot of sculpting with a mouse. Really what it lacked was brutality, was war, was the ability to take on challenge and use your god powers and sculpting powers to fight, war and battle. And that’s where our initial concept of Wars started."\n\nYes, Mr. Molyneux thought that the interface was terrible, and his idea of improving on that was to do a completly different game with the exact same interface.\n\nThe RTS content is lack-luster and in the first missions it's just down to whomever builds the barracks first so he can kill the enemy barracks. Which is not really a challenge as the AI is rather lacking in aggression. This might change later ingame, but with the minimalistic approach to the RTS genre I couldn't get myself to play for long enough to see more content... or if there is even more content at all.\n\nThe game tries to freshen up the RTS mechanics by adding god-ability cards that you win in battles and than can use as one-time resource boosts or ingame abilities. Once used they are gone and you'll have to regrind them from the lower missions that you did before. You also get randomized extra-rules in each battle that might give extra damage for having a hight advantage or increase the cost of god powers... with all that thought going into how to 'freshen up the RTS genre' one wonders why there are so many basics just missing, like a mini-map for example.\n\ntl;dr\nminimalistic RTS that may be fun if you just want to see low-poly bow-men shoot at helpless farmers for 10 minutes between loading screens but doesn't offer anything interesting. This might change later on, as it's still early access, but if the original Godus is any indication I wouldn't get my hopes up.","February 4","false","0.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

I asked myself "What could this be?"\n\nYou can imagine my horror when I realized that 22cans was back with fraud simulator 1.5! And alas! It's the same god game I blindly put my faith into a few years ago! Now you may wonder to yourself, "But why is this not just part of Godus?" Well the answer to that my friend is simple! It's an attempt at scam #2. While Godus sits unfinished and abandoned in my library 22cans has the gall to sell another early acess game that I guarantee you they will not finish.\n\nTo sum it all up, don't buy this game. It will not be finished. They will take your money and run. You have been warned. Do not trust a fraudulent company like 22cans. They will lie to you, they will take your money.

So i would not know what, if any, improvements where done to that title.

So let us put all the 22Cans and Peter Molyneux stuff away for a second, and actually look at the game.\n\nIt not longer is a click fest, like i remembered, which is nice.\nIt has some simple combat (1 unit type, as far as i got before the game crashed)\nThe landscaping is decent, allthough still a bit annoying at times.\nThe Citadel/City feature is annoying at times, as it kinda bugs out when choosing where to center it.\nLoad screens are annoying, as the screen flickers between the 2 open windows.\nBesides these issues, i did have a little fun with this title.\n\nAnd that is about it for the game. Not much more there.\n\nIn its current state it is an ok game. There is maybe a few hours of fun here, if you can looks past its flaws and the lacking content. If the price was set at half of the current price, i would recommend it since it is Early Access.\n\nBUT\n\nThis is where The whole 22Cans and Peter Molyneux part can not be overlooked.\n\nAny game from this studio/developer, needs to be considered a final product wether it is Early Access or not.\nAny and all promises about future features, need to be ignored and forgotten.\n\nSo, until it is fully released with all the features you wish for, i would stay well clear of this title.\nIt is not worth your time nor money, until that day comes.\n\nI would rate it 6/10, if it was not for 22Cans and Peter Molyneux.\n(Still not good enough for a recommend in my book though)","February 4","false","3.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Let's just begin this review by saying I was one of the many fools who kickstarted this trainwreck. And for that, I am sorry.\nI'm not going to talk about the "old" Godus (which is bundled here) because I feel its shortcomings are common knowledge at this point, but rather review the new bits of gameplay.\nPros:\nhum... Cons:\nGraphic options are barebones... resolution and full screen on/off, that's all\nAwful graphics, jaggies everywhere. Could be considered pretty if it was a iOS game...\nLow resolution assets everywhere (ui, cards, loading screens, etc.)\nCluncky and childish UI in the menus (buttons floating, rotating, flying everywhere)... this also has the consequence of making it feel very slow and unresponsive\nThe game launches a new window everytime you start a new "battle". It's weird and feels very unprofessional\nGameplay is bland and very primitive. You can find way better RTS' for less than Godus' asking price\nNo godly powers to use in game\nGodus wasn't supposed to be an RTS\nMoving landmasses is still cluncky\nMicrotrans... hum "premium addon" (they were removed because it "really isn’t a popular choice" but for how long as they think "that it does represent good value, especially considering that Godus Wars has been delivered as a free update to hundreds of thousands of users"... did they forget we already paid for Godus and all subsequent updates... No EA game would ever think to make you pay for updates your game)Plus, they have the worst mod team on the forums, locking threads and banning people left and right. They even go as far as to split the forums into tiny subforums to try to hide all the negative feedback in the"off topic" sub forum (there isn't even a "general discussion" sub forum).\n\nThis is a mess, I'm uninstalling this and I'm thinking of asking Valve to completely remove it from my library","February 4","false","0.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

There are supposed to be seven sets of levels on a little globe but only the first two are done. Yesterday the second set cost extra money, which was to pay for making the third set but today that feature was removed.\n\nWhen you start a battle it makes a new window and you can alt-tab between them but the controls for this are not explained. You also have to press Ctrl-Alt-Delete and stop two applications and a third extra process when it crashes. The little battles need more than a Gigabyte of memory, like in Populus. Multiplayer does not work yet because the game does not cost enough money.\n\nYou can type a code in game to make all of the people be called Peter Molyneux and then you can rain fire on them and they will all sing a song about how it's raining. This code is the one found on your Mom's credit card, plus three secret digits which are hidden on the back.

Take the good aspects of Populous\n2. Take the good aspects of Black & White\n\nMerge them into a game.\n\nThis is not what we asked for. Godus Wars, in theory, is a step in the right direction. However, this has absolutely no impact on the main game (as of yet), and to be honest feels rather pointless. All that work going into building your cities? Doesn't matter. All the victories in here? Doesn't matter.\n\nIt's just frustrating. Many of us can see exactly what needs to be done, but the developers appear oblivious. The potential is through the roof, but nothing is being done with it.\n\nIt doesn't need to be the next Crusader Kings in terms of complexity, but how about not producing such a dumbed down, casualised game? Add some complexity, make it have an impact in regular Godus, actually update and improve regular Godus instead of just dropping it in favour of this.\n\nSome communication with the customers wouldn't go amiss either. Most of us was unaware this even existed.","March 3","false","0.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Worst is that it takes so looong. The people are dumb, they do move that none wants to do and if they can build a house near they do. So you may have just 2 people who are building house over the full map and almost building in the ennemy base. Who does that?\nThe attack command of your war units is bad either. You click to attack and it may work but it may not work too, it depends on your luck it seems.\nEach map is annoying, there are no interaction between you and the ennemy until you attack. (Maybe it changes later in the game, I can't go further in it).\nOnly played 1 hour and a half, but this is enough for me.

Your troops almost never go where you want them to, or the directions you want them to.  The maps get awfully repetitive.

But I think it's not there yet. I've been playing for some hours and got tired of crashes (they usually happen when an enemy has a champion). I couldn't even finish the first island.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Pretty simple and intuitive.\n- The graphics are really nice.\n- I like the game mechanics. Although it's been a long time since last time I played an strategy game, this looks different and new. I liked the ideas this game has.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- It crashes. A lot. At least when there's a champion as I said. Being winning a battle and getting a crash is not really pleasant.\n- There's a lack of descriptions everywhere. I would have expected the cards to have more information when clicking them, but it just zoom them. For example, I got the Quagmire card and still don't know what is it about.\n- There are only archers. I would like to be able to build an army of different units. But this is an early access, hopefully they would be added before the release.\n- Some more buildings could also be good. I get bored of just having to improve one. But the same, that can be added later.\n- Sculpting is sometimes really slow. If I press on a ground level it means I want to expand that level, so if there's something over it, I would like it to be removed. And if I expand it over a zone in a lower level, I would like it to increase all of the layers at the same time. I don't know if I'm the only one, but there are times I find myself just clicking and clicking, what is a bit annoying.\n- The UI is really poor. I would like more information about the game. For example, I don't really know if the believers increase during the game, but I think so, as you can also kill them. I would like to know how many I have. And I don't know if it's shown elsewhere, but it could be good to have it close to the mana.\n\nI think this game was just "released" (even if it's an early access) before it should, and I don't see the quality I was expecting. I understand some of the problems, but things like the game crashing every other game it's not really aceptable. Hopefully, it will get better. But right now I don't feel like I can recommend it.","June 2","false","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And If you're an avid stategy-gamer as I am, you'll want this in your library. Why? Well here are four reasons why Godus Wars should be on your RTS wishlist this Christmas season:\n\n1. Challenging UI\n- How do you make the element of difficulty in an RTS unique and refreshing? Make the UI so cluttered and unnecessary that the main menu itself requires a strategy. Then, while the game has seemingly started, block out the "Exit Game" option in the menu screen.\n\n2. Pathing\n-  Pathing is a quintessential aspect of all RTS games, which is why Molyneux knew he had to reinvent it to stand out. His solution? Use minimal programming, blame any problems on dynamic terrain, and then make it so that right-clicking is both the unit position command and the only way to move the camera fluidly. Didn't hold down the mouse button long enough after you clicked? Guess where your unit is going.\n\n3. Buffer Overflow\n-  To give your games more close-to-home difficulty, losing even a single match inserts malicious batch executables into random string values in your client, disabling your Data Execution Protection and attacking your computer memory relentlessly.\n\n4. Dune II\n- Essentially, Godus Wars is a reboot of Dune II, one of the greatest RTS games known to man. Molyneux's reinvisioning of the classic strategy game incorporates only its best elements with new standards in visuals and performance not capable in the early 90's.\n\n\n5. Supportive Community\n- Important to every developing Early Access title is an active and friendly community of developers and moderators. Continuing the trend set by the original Godus, Godus Wars is host to exactly that. If the slightest problem occurs, your reported issues and concerns are closed handled efficiently by 22Cans and its moderators.","February 3","true","0.2"," 88 of 230 people (38%) found this review helpful 167 people found this review funny","38","88","230","167","11"

I put in 175+ hours, though probably 50 of that was leaving it on when I went to bed, since the first few interations had relatively slow belief respawn times.\n\nI've seen Godus when it was new - lots of bugs, but relatively fun.  Then, cleaning the slate and beginning again.  I didn't like the second attempt as much as I liked the first, but I still play-tested and reported bugs here and there.  And then *it* happened - i.e. the game was released on mobile platforms and that was when **** hit 22cans.  The production of the game basically died, forums exploded in rage, Peter asked if he was pathologically a liar, etc.\n\nNow, a YEAR since the last update, I can say I am pleased that this little game came out - *finally, something*.  I am going to base this game against populous, and against the previous Godus (which comes with this game if you want to play it).\n\nAgainst populous:  This game is very simple in it's current form.  On the first continent there is only 2 units: the villager, and the archer.  Another unit, the catapult, appears for the enemy on the second continent, but I never was able to use it myself.  Compare this to Populous, which had 7.  From an RTS standpoint, having so few attack unit types seems silly.  They do level up, which makes for some differentiation between the different units, but their movement and attack patterns are the same.\nIn populous, you had a shaman who cast the powerful "god-like" spells.  In Godus Wars, you can sculpt land but your spells are limited to those you bring with you, in the form of cards.  You get 4 cards per match, and you gain cards as you progress through the continent. (I have completed second continent, so my review at this time doesn't deal with any continents after that).  I don't like this aspect of the game and I feel it needs work, or some sort of explanation or reasoning.  Why does a God have to choose only 4 spells?\nOne big thing - the sculpting is much more enjoyable and comfortable in Godus Wars than in Populous.  Also, I like the updated graphics.  In most ways, however, Populous beats Godus Wars from an RTS level.\n\nAgainst Godus:  These two games are very different.  Most of the time you spend in godus is spent in a zen-like state or half-subconscious state where you are just doing things and clicking on things.  What is the goal?  It's hard to say... you are doing things for kinda whatever you want.  Back when you built roads to make settlement types, that was probably my favorite thing to do for some reason.  Anyways, Godus it's NOT a great revisioning of populous.  External threats don't present themselves for a very long time, and dealing with those threats is like dealing with pesky ants.  They are really just an annoyance, and can be very difficult to exterminate. (once you get into hub world, from building the boat on your home world.)\nYou are limited in strange ways in Godus.  Ex. Your villagers are dependent on you for all resource gathering (wtf).\nGodus Wars does not suffer in this way.  Belief is automatically collected.  It is the only resource at the moment.  So, rescource management wise it feels much better and in-line with a god game for me.  I hope they re-add the resources for some purpose, and they are still auto-collected.  In general, more depth needs to be added to Godus Wars.\n\nGeneral review of Godus/Godus Wars:  I truely would personally like to see a true God Game where villagers make up their own minds, and maybe your actions determine behaviors or characteristics of the culture within your people.  Gods do not manually control people or cause wars.  They influence belief systems and THAT can lead to conflicts within differing cultures.  I think 22Cans needs to really reconsider what they have going here in general.  For more info reference the predestination forum thread in origional Godus...\n\nSo in conclusion:  Do I recommend Godus Wars?  I think it is close, but yes.  I find that when I finish a match I'd like to play another, and that is how I base if I am enjoying playing a game or not.\n\nIt is a milestone between Godus and Populous.  The game does not suffer from the click-fest of resource collections that Godus had, but as an RTS Populous has more depth to the strategy.  However, it has a LONG WAY TO GO TO BE A FULL GAME, but also HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO A GREAT GOD RTS GAME NOW.  I would only recommend it to people with patience, and who are willing to really wait on the game.\n\n\ndirect issues with the game:\nSo few unit types.\n\nI don't like the cards, also the cards are poorly explained.  Ex.  What does leech do?  Steal health? belief? I think there would be some better way to handle limiters.\n\nDid they take away screen rotation?\n\nZERG RUSH FTW.\n\n\nDev review:  22Cans -  All I can say is, Why? I playtested you Godus game for a very long time.  Checked forums on steam regularly.  I know you were getting lots of kick-back on the forums, but you can't just disappear like you did.  It may be tempting to abandon the community, but you know what?  There are people on there who care about this project.  You did a great dis-service to them by going dark like that.  You have to live above the vitriol.  Please. don't. go. silent. again.\n\nedit: mainly spelling issues, also there appears to be a second attack unit type on the second continent.","February 8","true","7.3"," 10 of 55 people (18%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","18","10","55","3","3"

You will find the discussions where people say I must play at least 0.1 hour of this so I can log in and give a negative review. I am not a person who cares about politics or the effects of past reviews of another game. Point in fact I played Godus, I liked Godus, I still like Godus, it just needs more work. ON to Godus Wars.\n\nThe game itself is slightly different from Godus because it relies on an unfinished combat system as opposed to simply collecting pink bubbles and trinkets and other stuff from Godus. Instead we have a map where you choose a God and fight an opposing God for world dominance.\n\nAlthough the game will probably get harder later on, in this form it is very easy for anyone who plays strategy games, and by that I mean, make lots of archers and keep sending them until you overwhelm the opposing forces.\n\nNow even though its very simple, and very easy in its present form, there is something here worth playing. I like style that they have built the game upon, and appreciate the 1v1 battles, though simple to win.\n\nIt's still early access and clearly they need to do a lot of work to make this more of a game, more warrior types, weapons, cards, etc, but what they have now is a good start,\n\nThe only thing I thought was bad, was the rolling random active rules that makes it look like a direct ripoff of hearthstone, but it could just be a placeholder for something later. The fact that it uses a launcher to open an additional window can throw you off at first as well, but someone who is used to playing games like League of Legends has seen this kind of thing before.\n\nAll in all a good start, needs work, but shows some promise. Is it worth what they are asking? That I don't know. As someone who purchased Godus and was given Godus Wars free, I can see why someone might think its not worth the $14.99 price tag in its current state and that's a fair observation. I like playing the game, and though this is clearly more mobile oriented in its current form, its still a good game. My final verdict is 7 out of 10. It could easily get a higher rating when more is added to it.","February 8","true","4.4"," 4 of 47 people (9%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","9","4","47","3","0"

I found it slow, heavy on clicking and just rather unenjoyable so I didn't play much of it at all. I didn't have the highest expectations for Godus Wars but despite saying that so far I'm really really enjoying the gameplay. It seems Godus has become a bit of a punching bag for people though.\n\nGodus Wars is Godus meets a very, very, very basic Age of Mythology style gameplay. In the original Godus the your aim was to build belief from your followers to be able to sculpt your world and find treasures and such. Godus Wars takes the sculpting and belief elements and combines them with some RTS features. The aim of Godus Wars seems to be defeating the enemy God by controlling the whole map which you do stage by stage. Each map stage is unlocked using keys and rewards you at the end of each with more keys and a random card. Cards are used within each map stage to buff your followers/soldiers/belief/cooldowns and you are able to select up to four cards per map stage. Some are reusable spells such as 'shield' to give your soldiers a shield boost and others are consumable such as '+8 followers'.\nEach map stage requires you to capture the enemy belief tower to win and this is done by building up belief to buy soldiers and destroying anything in your path.\n\nSince this game is in Early Access I have come across a few bugs as expected. The game opens up a second process for the map stages and this seems pretty unstable. I've had it crash on me three times so far. It seems that the developers know about this though as there is a failsafe to still reward you with some keys or to allow you to replay the level upon this crash. However on one of the crashes it would not let me replay the level and gave me no keys. This left me completely out of keys and forced me to replay an earlier level just to proceed. A few other minor bugs involved followers not being able to find a route until I unsculpted and re-sculpted it, but this didn't cause much trouble at all.\n\nUltimately I've only played two hours but I really am enjoying the premise of the game and I am glad to be able to finally get a feel of how Godus was mean to be made. I look forward to the future updates and it's good to see the developers still working on Godus along side this rather than just abandoning it like I've seen often in Early Access. I'm not sure if it justifies the full £10.99 price tag but as a counterpart to Godus it's 100% worth it.","February 3","true","5.2"," 33 of 149 people (22%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","22","33","149","6","0"

Godus was a genius, if flawed game, beautiful to play - though with no ending and "less" than promised, even with hours of play.\n\nGodus Wars first release is promising, though buggy and unbalanced.  Get your archer's experience to a gold "super archer" and they just destroy everything.  Though controlling a bunch of archers is difficult, even tedious when they do their own thing and die.  Moving a group of archers sends them in all directions, probably just to die.  Better to control them individually.  The game crashes frequently for me too.\n\nAnyway, kudos to 22 cans for trying to release more of Godus.  This first release leaves a lot to be desired, but I hope they can do so.","February 4","true","8.3"," 6 of 71 people (8%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","8","6","71","4","1"

You pave the ground, your little buggers build up the town, you claim land, and you send units to fight. Again in thought it's Godus as what was sold to us years ago on Kickstarter just minus the build up. The biggest gripe I have at the moment is the game loads up Godus every time you actually try to play a match, which, is annoying to suddenly have two windows open for no reason. It seems that Godus Wars directly handles match creation against the AI and then it loads up Godus for the map building and units because they just couldn't be bothered to port things over to the new program and save us a slight headache.\n\nI'd semi-recommend the game if it was an option but it's not. The game still hails from a company I will never directly support again because they are a bunch of horrid thieves lead by someone who used to be a visionary for gaming but turned into a scumbag after he realized that in the current market he's all talk and no action. Get the game if you want an odd spin on a really quick RTS but most people who own this game got it for free because they fell for Godus in the first place. Supposedly they are closing the other Godus store page soon and will be hawking over forums so expect clensing over time.","February 3","true","1.9"," 28 of 139 people (20%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","20","28","139","9","0"

As a person who followed the Kickstarter but was smart enough to not pay for a game that was just a concept at the time and actually expect a decent product (or the exact product I paid for), I can't say I'm qaulified to weigh in on that drama. The big upset was that 22cans went in on developing a mobile game, which was the primary focus of developement, when as far as I know that wasn't even mentioned in the Kickstarter. I've seen Godus panned again and again in video reviews, where the reviewer gave up in the tutorial, just because of the negative stigma; it's really quite unfair.\n\nI will say that game developement takes more money than Kickstarter goals ever aim for. $1 million is NOTHING. $1 million for 'the best game ever' is IMPOSSIBLE. Look at Star Citizen. Almost a billion dollars down on that game, and it's barely a demo after like 2 years. I'd also like to point out that Planetary Annhiliation only delivered it's $1 million dollar goal in spirit. It also had to release an 'expansion pack' to cover all the promises made in the Kickstarter. And that game gets good reviews... and it's only a good game in multiplayer, if your PC can run it in multiplayer. At least Godus gave everyone the expansion pack who previously owned Godus, even if you only payed $2 for it.\n\n==Godus + Godus Wars Summary==\n\nGodus is a good game, though. There's a lot of complaints about waiting, but it's pretty much made to check in every few hours... Like a mobile game. But's it's much better than any mobile game I've ever played. It's very relaxing to build, sculpt, fill in oceans, name citizies, make building projects go faster, and ultimately take over the enemy settlements. It's a very pretty game, too.\n\nIt's very well optimized, but there are crash bugs and slow down every once in awhile. Godus Wars, though, opens several windows in the background.. which makes very little sense. That might be a placeholder for some online play feature? There was a map I couldn't play in Godus Wars, in the first release build, that was unplayable for crash bugs\n\nThe battles in Godus Wars are strategic enough, mostly focused on city building and planning to overwhelm or get the high ground. It seems like there's a lot of content to offer, and I'm having fun with it so far. It's not a waiting game at all, but it's a little annoying that at least in the starter island you don't get any of the powers you would have in the lategame singleplayer game. It's at the very least better than Populous (which sucks, imo) and that Flash game that everyone raves about based on Populous (which was okay). It reminds me of Age of Empires Online if that game had been enjoyable at all.\n\nFor the $15 price tag, the Godus portion of the game is well worth it. I put 47 hours into the base game, up until an island was introduced that was VERY mobile wait-timey. But all the fun I had in the starter world was well worth it. If you like building and tinkering and making your own civilization, with a moderate ammount of forethought, I highly recommend Godus.","February 4","true","3.7"," 11 of 91 people (12%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","12","11","91","6","12"

Godus Wars takes everything I liked about Godus (the art style, the scultping) and drops into a much more exciting game that feels like it has a lot more purpose.  I love the idea of the belief vault so you don't have to spend all your time clicking to collect and if this is the direction the game is heading, then I for one am really excited.  Even at this early stage it feels like a Molyneaux game in a way Godus never did, liuttle touches like the funny messages before battles start serve to give it a lot more character.  It's early days, but I'm already enjoying what they have here, I can't wait to try out multiplayer when it launches.  Peter, as a long time fan of your work, from Populus onwards, I think this is brilliant and I can't wait to see what happens next.","February 3","true","1.2"," 12 of 95 people (13%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","13","12","95","3","0"

I like the combat. If Godus Wars get the story they planned for Godus and this is like the campaign map that's cool.\nThe next step is combining the two actual games. Give us a homeworld where we can sculpt land however we want en combine it with the war campaign map. I played a few missions and I spent more time sculpting and create room for abodes than actual attacking so yeah. Combining the two games will be hard but I believe 22 Cans can do it.\nI'm not necessarily angry Godus isn't turning out like they said in the beggining as I played +70 hours of Godus.\n\nWhat I don't think is good is the name. It gives a wrong impression as to what you want this game to be.\nAnyway looking forward on what you are going to do with this.","February 4","true","0.7"," 4 of 70 people (6%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","6","4","70","4","5"

The controls were a bit squanky at times, but that might just have been myself doing rocky work.\n\nIf they proceed into the multiplayer area with this idea, I see it doing quite well, it probably won't knock out Starcraft 2, but it definitely would be an interesting RTS to bring to the table of competitive RTS' and that is why I recommend you try-out the game, help providing feedback for 22-cans and hopefully we will be rewarded with an incredibly well-done and entertaining: God simulator, comeptitive RTS.\n\n#Neverletgoofyourdreams","February 3","true","0.8"," 8 of 83 people (10%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","10","8","83","2","0"

I read all the reviews who hated but was not swayed bythem.  I played Godus and enjoyed it.  So imagine my joy to find out that PM was producing a new game and giving it away for free to current owners.\n\nI just had my first shot at the game and it is a god game.  Like Populous you need to capture cities to improve your standing.  All the sculpting stuff from the first game is there also.  You claim land by destroying the enemy positions.  I enjoyed it. Give it a chance you will enjoy it also.  Remember this is a fresh game so try not to let your feelings for the first one cloud your judgement.  That is if you were negative.\n\nSome producers of games never do anything after the product is out.  I am thinking of Haunted house here.  Put out broken then dumped.

Un-helpful reviewers...\n\nAs a loyal Godus fan (100hr+), I've been checking for news on Godus, weekly for over a year, so was happy to find this. But after having beaten the game in 7hr, I am disappointed.\n\nMaps start getting recycled, the gameplay gets tedious (as does the music), and the god-powers on offer are very limited.\n\nIt was fun to break the AI though:\nUse bonuses to starting belief count, or starting villager count, to build a base fast, make a barracks as soon as you have 500 belief (even on 3 houses on the sand), send your first troop with speed buff, and you can rush victories in under 3min.\n\nIf not, Frenzy (+3 Attack) is way overpowered and you can handidly wipe everyone out in a few volleys. Also, the AI only landscapes in a small radius outside its base, so screw with the trerrain beyond that radius and they'll never expand.

At least how they stand today on 6/5/2016.\nI'll note that I'm placing a few things aside.\n1) Godus\n2) The pay-per-map crap they tried to pull\n3) VERY frequent crashes. In my opinion crashes are to be expected with Early Access games and I don't think it entirely fair to harp too much on the crashes at this point in Godus War's stage of development.\n\n\nThe core of what this game is, is really really fun to me.\nYou build homes, produce people, create armies and destroy your enemy, all while editing the terrain to your benefit. There are game cards that give you an edge, (but I've found I don't really use them).\nI've played roughly 4.5 hours and have found the AI to not be too difficult. Maybe that changes with different maps?\n\nI find an atmosphere of zen while playing. It's extremely relaxing and enjoyable. The only not relaxing thing about it is the constant crashing which requires you to start the level over.\n\nIt's that constant crashing that has stopped me from continuing to play at this point, but so far I really enjoy what this game is brings.\n\nAs far as recommending this game...it's in EA. As of right now, no I wouldn't recommend this game because it's buggy and still being developed. But I would recommend it based on what (I hope) it brings come release day.\n\nTake my review for what it is. I am one of the early adopters of the game that 22cans has kinda let down with Godus. But If I'm being honest, I think Godus Wars is going to be a really fun game.","June 5","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
