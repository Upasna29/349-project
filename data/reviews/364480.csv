"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mongolianmisfit/recommended/364480/","mongolianmisfit","MongolianMisfit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mongolianmisfit/","342 products in account","A fantastic throwback surprise. A modern work in authentic NES style game design. Simplistic, stylistic, atmospheric. At times peaceful and relaxing, at times frustrating and intense. Fight your own logic as much as the featured slope jump mechanics as you work your way through a world that speaks very little and lets you embrace a childhood sense of imagination, fervor, and challenge. It's charming, with a top notch, catchy, addictive soundtrack. First playthrough was a little over 5 hrs to completion. Short? Perhaps it's not that the game is too short, but rather that I really wanted more once I finished. I would like to see more diverse enemies in a future expansion or sequel. 5 dollars well spent.\n\nSteam player synopsis:\nFell far.\nLived.\nThrew fireballs.\nBlobs died.\nJumped high.\nSpinning death trap.\nWalked in grass.\nFalling spike trap.\nWalked in more grass.\nAppearing spike trap.\nDouble jumped across a chasm.\nFloated like a tanooki suited Mario.\nMissed ledge.\nFell in Spikes...wasn't a trap.\nJust spikes.\nDied to many Spikes.\nEnjoyed it.\nAlot.\n\nRetro review: Would jump into spikes again.\n","May 16, 2015","true","7.9"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","25","38","5","2"

Other spikes are placed in such a way that moving from one screen into another that the player has NEVER been to before can get the player killed because they didn't enter from the right side or decided to jump.\n\nIf you're looking for what I was looking for, do not buy this game. If you are looking for anything resembling a GOOD high-difficulty game, do not buy this game. I want to un-buy this game. The fact that I can say all of this with so little playtime behind me and COMPLETE confidence should tell you everything you need to know.","June 19, 2015","false","0.5"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","27","43","2","7"

And not by skill. You've got to die a few times to know where are the traps and then you can go through the level.\n\nThen the game got even more difficult (for more unfair reasons) and I abandoned it.","September 22, 2015","false","1.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"

I would definitely recommend this game to people who like a challenge.\n\nOne thing I would love to see for this game is controller support.","September 30, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Fitting music and cute art make it less frustrating when things go wrong. I imagine things will be less painful when I start unlocking some of the specials.\n\nWill update this review after I've played a little more, so far it's a worthy purchase.","June 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

I honestly feel like AVGN while playing this... in fact I think AVGN needs to review this. Here are the problems:\n- Serious performance issues on most modern CPUs (WTF?)\n- Horribly designed levels\n- Bad/laggy jump controls\n- "gotcha!" traps everywhere, basically like eryi's action but in a non-fun way. Yes, it is mentioned in the game description that this is one of those kind of games but this is just.. wow\n\nHonestly, I would have refunded it, but I discovered steam refund 15 days after I bought this game, one day too late, sigh. this money could have gone to charity.","May 19, 2015","false","0.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"
