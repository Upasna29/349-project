Just as it was building up again, it stopped with a silent video.\n- Majority of the rooms are the same, and have no reason for you to enter.\n\n+ Had a couple creepy moments.\n+ Interesting stair section. Neverending, but only ever have to go up one flight to get back to the main level. Freaked me out.\n+ Good audio. Really set the atmosphere.\n","February 13","false","1.0"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","34","37","2","0"

At least this one has the borderline decency to pass on charging you $10 for the privilege.\n\nBook-ended by a text card for an introduction and some monotone cartoon stills for an ending, forgoing even the formality of a title screen, you can't really yell at Inside: Before Birth for having a lazy plot because that's really like yelling at a monkey for not having wings. The plot, the gameplay, the tension, it was never going to be there. It's a school project that somebody's misplaced pride led them to sell on Steam, rather than just submit as coursework.\n\nWhat can I say? I feel like I should be rounding these horror games up by the dozen lately and branding them all with the same review. Ignore. Walk away. It is worth no moneys and so to spend any on it would only contribute to a deep remorse that may well eventually place you at the bottom of a ravine. Why take the risk, eh?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnwzYAVn3_U","February 15","false","0.7"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","29","31","8","0"

They took a map that would take 2 minutes to walk through and artificially extended it to 30 minutes by locking doors and making you look for keys in a ton of identical rooms over and over again.

If it were .99c or better, free! Then I would say its good. The look and feel are nice, just needs polish. Not sure if there is replayability or not but it seems like maybe? I played it once, took about 30mins as others have said. I wanted to like it enough to say its worth a purchase but its not. Worth a play, yes, especially if this is up your alley just not the money.\n\nGood game, do not get me wrong\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udAG4L14yj0","February 13","false","0.6"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

Hallway thrown in.\nIf you are okay with spending $3 for less than 30 minutes of gameplay, you can do worse on Steam.\n\nI don't know what that running man is in the screenshots though as according to my in game shadow, I play as a nude woman & I didn't see him or that cutscene in the game.","February 12","true","0.8"," 11 of 40 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","11","40","0","2"

I really liked some parts were stuff happening was completely unexpected (an example is the "welcome to hell"'s infinite stairs part).
