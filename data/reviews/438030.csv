The gameplay is fine, I guess, but there's not really anything to keep me playing it.  There's no replay value, the computer players don't seem to show up when I try to do singleplayer vs computer.  It's just me against a bunch of enemies and there doesn't seem to be a way to win.  The main thing that annoyed me about this game is that upon installing it and attempting to play, you will receive an error saying that steam cannot find the executable file for this game.  somebody was nice enough to post a solution on the forums: http://steamcommunity.com/app/438030/discussions/0/405691147594349721/\nSo you have to rename the .exe based on whether you are playing it on mac or pc.  The fact that the game didn't even work on first startup was the main issue for me.  Having to jump through hoops just to get a game to work is not my idea of a pleasant experience.  If this issue gets fixed in the future, then I guess you can ignore this technical issue, but at the time of reviewing, it is unacceptable.","March 6","false","2.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

It's too boring to talk about the substance of the game, but I want to focus on how it presents itself.\n\nBefore you buy the game, it's prudent to point out that, despite the game being Windows-only, the trailer was recorded on Mac OS.\n\nThe control scheme is awkward at best, and to me, completely unintuitive.  In what other PC game is Player 1's fire button "L key"?  There aren't any graphics options either, so no windowed mode.\n\nThis is a Flash game in a shiny, 16-cent wrapper.  The biggest, and final nail in this game's coffin it the COMPLETE LACK OF EXIT BUTTON.  THAT is a PC gaming faux pas.  Surmountable, but nevertheless obnoxious\n\nThis game gets my Stamp of Broken-ness.  There are some urgent fixes that the developer needs to get on to make this game playable.

Except, I wish dead6hot could have been better than this. The idea for this game is good. I like fast-paced shooting games, except this game is not fast-paced at all. The enemies take a long time to kill. The weapons don’t act the way they do like in any other game. For example, the pistol works exactly like a machine gun and the shotgun does as much damage as a pistol. Lastly, the game gets repetitive after 5 minutes of gameplay.\n\nThe versus mode for the game is local only and from what I can tell, it is supposed to justify the bad controls. Whenever I play the versus mode for the game, the match goes on forever. The only way to win is to make sure the opponent never gets a first-aid kit. If they do, it will prolong the match. That isn’t a good way to decide who wins or loses.\n\nAside from the gameplay mechanics, the music is just chiptune garbage that loops every 10 seconds. The graphics look like it is trying way too hard to capture the theme of “retro” when it really just comes off as bland. With a forgettable game that will not let you quit, I wouldn’t recommend Dead6hot nor its prequel Dead5hot to anyone.\n","February 10","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For most people, rename Deadshot022916.exe to Deadshot122115.exe. For Mac users, rename to Deadshot020516. The developer has not done anything to try and fix this so the rest of the review can be disregarded unless you get the game to actually play.\n\nI recently purchased this game at the time of writing (8th February 2016) in the Lunar New Year Sale. I have not played very much (evident by my playtime) but have a basic grasp on the gameplay and how the game works, enough to write a review of decent length.\n\nI bought this game on an impulse buy seeing how cheap it was. I only briefly glanced at the reviews, they were mostly short and there wasn't much to go on. I aim to correct that. Dead6hot is a retro-styled 2D platformer mixed with fighter and shooter elements. I do enjoy platformers, fighters and games with a retro art direction, but this will not add bias to my review.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is fairly simple. There are two modes, Singleplayer and Multiplayer. At the time of writing, I have not tried Multiplayer, as there is no online mode and I have no one to play with at this moment. Multiplayer is local multiplayer, not requiring an internet connection on your device to play. Multiplayer and Singleplayer both include the Versus mode, which is a generic fight between two characters. There are 5 stages to pick from, all with varying layouts. On top of this, there are 10 different characters, ranging from a clown to a minotaur. In Versus Mode, it is a 1v1 match, where both characters have 3 lives.\n\nThe character you use can run left and right, and also can jump, but doesn't have a mid-air double jump. Your character starts off with a pistol and a special (as far as I can tell this changes depending on which character you use). However every weapon in this game does have an ammunition limit. It is impossible to leave the stage, as going off the sides will bring you out it's opposite (the left side with bring you out on the right side, and the bottom will make you fall from the top, and vice versa). Item crates appear occasionally on stages, allowing you to get a new weapon to swap your current one with or to refill the ammo of the weapon in use. The controls for Player 1 use the arrow keys to control your movement, the L key to fire your weapon and the O key to use your special. As far as I am aware, these cannot be changed. Each character can only use 3 specials at one time. Health packs also spawn on the stages, allowing you to completely refill the health bar, which is located in the top corners of the screen. CPU ability levels can also be changed, from Timid, then onto Split, then Aggro.\n\nThe other mode that is found is simply called Singleplayer or Co-Op. The name changes depending whether you are playing in Singleplayer or Multiplayer. You pick a stage and character as normal, but when the game begins, it is more of a platforming side. You are fighting multiple enemies. One is a small slime, which spanws the most frequently, while the other is a floating eye, which is taller. The CPU enemies do not have weapons for themselves, and can only hurt your character by touching them. If your character falls on top of an enemy, you will still take damage. You are tasked with surviving as long as possible and killing as many enemies as possible too. There is no timer for any of the modes in Dead6hot\n\nPros:\n- A good selection of different character designs.\n- Great art direction and style for the game.\n- Enjoyable and not frustrating for the user to play.\n- Set at a good price.\n\nCons/Improvements To Be Made:\n- Characters are no different in abilities and movement. It would be good to differenciate between each character and not make the different choices purely astethic.\n- Weapon and stage choices are limited. It would be amazing if you could improve the roster of both.\n- Health packs are very overpowered. They need to be reduced in the amount they can heal, or matches can become almost impossible to win and will last forever.\n- There isn't a button to exit the game as of yet. That is a feature that needs to be implemented; the only way to exit the game right now is to press Alt+Enter and close the game.\n- There is no online multiplayer. It would be a great addition and is almost required for a game of this style to thrive. If it is implemented, it will appeal to people who don't have others to play with.\n\nGlitches Found:\n- This has been confirmed as a glitch but was kept in because the game wasn't meant to be very serious. When I have been playing Singleplayer mode, I have found that jumping on top of an enemy can send you at least twice as high as normal jumping. I can't tell whether it is due to the damage system or simply a glitch due to collision boxes or maybe even something completely different.\n\nExtra Points To Note:\n- It feels like the controls for the stage and character selection are backwards. This may be a deliberate design choice, but the movement doesn't seem right to me.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, I enjoy this game. The creators have done a great job in capturing the feel of a retro game with the art style and soundtrack. The gameplay features are working and strong. There are quite a few things that can be improved, but the developers (Ridhwann Patel, Chuck Obrien and Tanner Daniels, as well as collaboration with New Reality Games) have a very good work-in-progress Steam game on their hands that I will play for hours as new updates come out. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers, fighting games, shooter games and retro-styled games.\n\nI will be updating this review when new updates come and if I find something new with the game.","February 8","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
