Completely different from the original gritty medieval feel of the first QUAKE but nevertheless amazing, with an interesting twist on the staple alien landscape of other sci fi games.\n\nThe storyline is fairly simple but strong, giving you one main objective per level leading up to a very epic end battle against the Strogg leader.\n\nThe game had impressive graphics for a FPS from the 90’s but still keeps a worthy atmosphere today, being the first game to use modern sky boxes.\n\nSame goes for the AI of all the enemies, it was superior back then but is still comparable to some current games.\n\nThe Multiplayer is really good (being a predecessor to QUAKE III as well as everything else) but either the system was too old or Valve and id software did not play nice but at any rate it has not been updated to today’s standards.\n\nIt is still possible to connect to a server via manually typing in a IP address but there’s only a few rogue Russian servers left and they will destroy you.\n\nQUAKE I is known for its technological breakthroughs, QUAKE III (ARENA) is known for its vast bot improvement and virtually seamless multiplayer fragging ability so QUAKE II has ended up as a sort of middle child.\n\nIt is a fairly underrated game on Steam today due to the similar, slightly higher quality games from the 90’s that overshadow it like the HλLF-LIFE duo.\n\nWhich is also ironic because HλLF-LIFE 1 was originally Valve's plan to rival the release of Quake II in the first place but was ultimately released a year later on a separate, "more advanced game engine" which was actually a heavily modified version of the QUAKE I engine........Is that double Irony?\n\nUltimately if you enjoy Retro games or are a big fan of FPSs this will be a crucial part of your collection.\n\nAs a Die-Hard QUAKE fan I have played thousands of hours of the original CD-ROM box set and was delighted when I saw all of the quake series and DLC’s on Steam.\nI’m Secretly An Expert On This Game\n\n\n\nOne last selling point\nThis game contains one of the most 0rg@$m1c intro cut-scenes in video game history.\n\nI would personally buy an HD version of the cutscene and have it loop on a photo frame by my bed if that was a real option.......but its not......................Buy the game.","June 29, 2014","true","9.1"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","48","50","0","5"

Out of curiousity of trying, I have to say I loved Quake 2 more than Quake 4!\n\nAs a person who's been playing old school first-person shooters since Duke Nukem 3D. It is horribly addicting, fast paced, intense, and overall fun! Like a Typical FPS before Half-Life 1, it was a satisfyingly ultra-violent game where you take down cyborg aliens know as the strogg, and given lots of weapons and kill them however you want. Each weapon has a pros and cons. For example, the BFG 10k is a devastating weapon, but could hurt you if you are too close and consumes lots of ammunition.\n\nIn the story, you are BItterman, a soldier from earth invading Stroggos to destroy the Stroggs invading humanity and prevent them from turning humanity into cybernetic slaves. While landing with the army, you got hit by a cowboy, and you land somewhere else. Thankfully getting hit saved you when all the soldiers were pinned KIA or MIA.\n\nAlso, thanks to steam, we still have a dedicated audience of multiplayer to this game! Like the single player game. Super addicting! All I can say about the Multiplayer, it is a total blast with deathmatch, team deathmatch, Capture The Flag, and so many other modes! Especially Co-Op!\n\nAlso, try to find the Ultimate Quake Patch for the soundtrack! Sonic Mayhem has made the best soundtrack for the Quake series.\n\nAmazing game, get it!","September 23, 2014","true","74.7"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","36","38","0","1"

From the first time I played it on the PlayStation back in 1999, I come back to it every now and then when I just want to let myself loose. And it feels great every time, no matter the platform - Nintendo 64, PlayStation or PC. Although, many people were disappointed it's not a true sequel to the original Quake - it is the first entry in the Strogg saga.\n\nSome time in the future, the Earth has been invaded by the Strogg, a race of cybernetic aliens, whose past and origins aren't quite clear. They don't take prisoners, they take unwilling recruits. Dead or alive, they will serve as an extension of the ever growing Strogg army. The Space Marine Corps have decided to show the Strogg they won't just sit around while our planet's population is being decimated by the alien forces, and have launched a massive counter-assault on Stroggos, the invaders' home planet (or, at least, their current home planet).\n\nAs the operation goes downhill the minute it started, the player assumes control of Bitterman, one of the few marines left alive on the surface of Stroggos. Armed with whatever he finds along the way (and he will find a plethora of weapons), Bitterman must cut his way through Strogg defenses all by himself, and try and bring the Strogg forces down.\n\nThe unique atmosphere of the game will keep you on your toes all along, as the Strogg fall under your sights one by one and you complete objectives sent by the Earth command.\n\nThe only downside of the Steam version is the lack of the original soundtrack, a very strong heavy metal score composed by Sonic Mayhem, which really gave the game a unique feel. This is something that should really be rectified in an update or a patch, as playing Quake II without the Quake II music is like riding a horse, naked. It just doesn't work. Since the original game read music directly from the CD, I don't think it's such a big problem to have the OST in a compressed format, along with the game. Or at least have the CD image of the game available for those who purchase it, so they can burn it and enjoy the full Quake II experience.","April 4, 2015","true","4.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","31","34","5","0"

It had amazing mods like TF, Airquake, Rune Quake, Headhunters and so on, but Quake2, is really an epic expansion were Quake 1 left off.\n\nThey made a mod addon CD called Quake 2 Extremities, which has many popular Quake 2 multiplayer mods, etc. I played them all!, listed here\nhttp://www.quakewiki.net/archives/modcentral/extremtiesfaq.htm\nMost of these mods are dead but the mods on my profile are alive and kicking!\nI really got into CTF when I was younger after deathmatching got old, then it itself, I moved on to mods. Ive never really seen a game in its time to have so many mods and content as it did. If this game had steamworks workshop, and all its content if not lost somewhere on broken old links from years ago, it might be as massive as Skyrim's steam workshop today.\n\nSingle player has its replay value to the max.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daxbutane/recommended/2320/","daxbutane","Butane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daxbutane/","149 products in account","A review for this game is long overdue... I'll try to make it short and sweet.\n\nQuake 2 is without a doubt one of the greatest FPS games ever created. It was ahead of its time in so many ways when it was released in 1997 and almost 20 years later it's still a great looking game and fun as hell to play.\n\nThis game, along with duke3d, was basically my teenage years (I know, I know, biased review, eh?). Between 1998-2001 I'd say I spent 80% of my gaming time on Quake 2. I was there for the q2_test.exe release, before the deathmatch maps (Q2DM1-8) were released, before player models had viewable weapons (this was created by the modding community), and when LMCTF[lmctf.com] (the original/first CTF game mode also created by the community) was released. Quake 2 was THE game and you couldn't escape it;[www.bluesnews.com] it was everywhere and for good reason too!\n\nI have yet to find an FPS game today that has such a great single player campaign and amazing multiplayer with some of the best balanced weapons ever. The movement is fluid and fast. The look, feel and sound of the weapons are top notch. No one can touch the Q2 Railgun, it's THE pimp gun to use and FEELS powerful as it should.\n\nWhere the game really shines though is in the maps. I cannot stress enough how amazing and memorable the level design in Quake 2 is. Every single map is a work of art. At the time I craved city style maps and environments like the ones found in Duke Nukem 3D but now the tables have turned; those kind of environments are practically in every FPS currently being released and I long for the sci-fi and gothic based fantasy worlds of Quake.\n\nAs I'm writing this review I searched online to find out just who exactly is responsible for creating these amazing maps. I almost gave up until I found one of John Romero's archived .plan files. Apparently Tim Willits created the bulk of the maps in Quake 2. Romero himself praised the level design by saying Originally posted by "John Romero": I'm a map designer at heart and the levels in Quake 2 are the most beautifully architected alternate realities i've ever experienced. They are so much better than Quake 1's maps that i'm almost embarassed to see my earlier work and say that it's still good.  So I'm not alone or crazy when I worship these maps :) If you're interested in reading Romero's full thoughts on Quake 2 scroll down to December 11, 1997[dk.toastednet.org]\n\nI believe this is the game developers should study when aiming to make an old school type of shooter today. Primarily for the level design/layout but also for enemy placement because hordes of enemies coming at you in waves gets boring very fast.\n\nOut of all the Quake games I think this is the best looking one to date. The atmosphere in it is just awesome especially with all the environmental sounds masterfully placed throughout the game.\n\nIf you're a fan of the FPS genre you need to play this game. Forget Half Life, this was the game that took the world by storm. This game is a masterpiece.\n\nI would recommend playing Quake 2 as vanilla as possible.\n\nThis is the ONLY patch you need to enjoy Quake 2 in all its greatness: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=208440395 --- It enables higher resolutions with widescreen support AND ADDS the original music! Yes, you read that right, THE MUSIC which everyone complains is missing on the Steam version of Quake 2. Just run that patch and the music will automatically be installed and enabled.\n\nThe community and multiplayer is very much alive.\nA big thank you to quadz and whoever else is responsible for running Tastyspleen[www.tastyspleen.net] -- This is basically the bulk of Q2 community.\n\nFor a list of servers check http://q2servers.com","February 12","true","90.2"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","4"

It adds outdoor lighting, slightly more realistic lighting from Quake 1 (since Quake 2 uses a completely new engine the IDtech 2 engine instead of an improved version of the DooM engine the IDTech1 V2) and instead of fighting the DooM-style hellish creatures like in the origenal you fight agenst a cybernetic faction thats just as crazy if not more so, they're called the Strogg.\nThe weapons in the game are very similar to the weapons in DooMs 1 and 2 (NOTE: i say 2 because the super shotgun isn't on DooM 1)\nAlso the character animations are better and the AI are smarter and In multiplayer it actually shows which weapon your character has out.\nPlayer models are handled differently to previous IDTech games, instead of everyone having recoloured versions of one player model there are different model sets, unfortunitly you can't recolour them though, but you can add new ones or possibly variants of the default set.\nAnd there is a part that feels like a part that Valve used in Half-Life, just thought i'd mention it.","November 26, 2013","true","10.3"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","32","43","0","0"

It's not really a sequel to Quake 1, but instead it was developed as serapate title and then at the end was given such name. It also had PS1 and N64 ports. I didn't play them, but they are probably inferior ones. Though, from what I seen, PS1 has best usage of colors.\n\nSo, how Steam version was handled? In id style! Which means no soundtrack for you. It just wasn't included, once again. You will have to track down (soundtrack) CD of a game. And then deal with music looping issues. _inmm software helped me here.\n\nGame also doesn't support widescreen by default. But I am sure you can find a way to tweak it. Or just use sourceport.\nIt also was stuttering for me by default. Strange enough, once I would go into Video setting and exit, it would get fixed for me.\nIt also refused to save configuration for me, so I had to change things back on each launch.\n\nMultiplayer community is small but still there. Now, I may not be good enough to tell away bot from human, but I belive that you will at least find one Deathmatch with 5-10 players. Though yea, Free For All Deathmatch is the only gametype you will end up playing. Small.\n\nThe plot follows Bitterman as he is one of the marines that were sent to planet of flesh-hungry cyborgs - Stroggs. As offense is the best defence. He ends up being possibly the only one surviving the first human attack on planet and now has to destroy and disable all the important strogg structures, alone.\nSo yea, sounds like another Rambo vs World. Though, you can actually meet some captured marines in the levels, but they all went insane. It addsa  nice touch to the setting, though it still feels a bit too gamey to see that you can't interact with them in any way. Or just that there are no sane ones, just crawling around.\nIt also has CGI cutscenes. Which would be awesome, but it's a wasted potential, as almost all of them are nothing but a fancy intermission screens. Hexen on PS1 made better use of them, really.\nManual is nice though.\n\nAnd well, to be honest, Quake 2 is the last title in Quake series that I played. I heard that it was a classic and heard many other good things. And once I got to play it, I was amazed... at how awfully generic FPS title it was.\n\nI mean, sure, it's better than Quake on theory. Because more realistical levels. Or better enemy AI. Or just better engine from technical standpoint, with smooth animation and colored lighting.\nYet the game as a whole it creates a fairly dull single-player experience.\n\nSetting isn't exactly interesting. It's nice that levels are connected into small hub and that they are bigger. And that you are given missions that explain what to do next. But level layouts are still linear, so it hardly matters. There are very few interesting levels, mostly factory and research labs, where you can see what Stroggs do with humans. Terrifying.\n\nBut outside of them they don't have anything interesting going on, while also not being as abstract as Quake or Doom ones. It also doesn't help that game looks awful. Whatever technical improvements engine may have, they all are supposed to just improve art design. And art design here is quite bad, consisting of red and grey. Grey and red. And more red than you will ever want to see. Even Hexen 2 which used Quake 1 engine looked better. Or Quake 1, which still used more colors and it was contributing to gritty atmoshpere.\n\nGameplay isn't exciting either. It's much more slowed-paced. It makes use of more hitscan enemies attacks. It just feels like it promotes more of cover-based tactics. Sure, there are few different enemy types with slightly different attacks, but in the end it still doesn't make a big difference. You peek out, you shoot, you hide from machinegun bullets back around corner. Or from railgun. Quake 1 had Ogres and Fiends, one would spam grenades around room and was often placed in interesting spots, while fiends were dangerous enemies that easily charged at you, all of which making you strafe and navigate, being more interestign to fight against. Quake 2 is just plain not exciting. Even melee enemy, Berserker, isn't threatening here, being slow, attacks while standing, easy to get out of attack reach with a single step, easy to knock down.\n\nOn more positive note, Enemy AI was improved. While they don't provide as much of fun as Hexen 2 ones, they still show more life to them. Mostly just ducking here and there. They get covered in blood as you shoot them down and some of the common enemies can even give the last few shots before dying. Don't worry, they don't aim when they do that, just shoot straight, so it's not annoying and looks awesome. Can always gib.\n\nNot sure what to say about equipment. Yes, you got more weapons than before. They got some interesting ideas behind, I like that recoil on Machine Gun, back before recoil was a common thing. You can also choose whether you want to have weapon on left, right or in center, which impacts where shots come from too (it's in multiplayer setting, but affects single as well). And heck, it has railgun. Which even does extra damage on unaware enemies. It's still feels like you have too much ammo and that weapons aren't too specialized in single. But still, nice.\n\nQuake 2 also adds inventory. It wasn't implented good. There aren't so many items to use. Sure, being able to use Quad Damage whenever you want is nice, radiation suit and rebreather help with secrets. But that's about it. It suffers because developers decided that they have to put weapons you have as inventory items as well, making it harder to navigate while bringing nothing. Even worse is that they put grenades between all this mess that you can't select otherwise.\nEDIT: Was wrong, grenade are easily selectable with "G" button. Items have other keybinds, but not something I want to always remember.\n\nBosses are quite meh. You can quad-damage them anyway.\n\nSoundtrack is quite nice. At least great when you listen to it serapately and some memoriable rock. Or whatever genre this is. It gets a bit monotonial after a while. A nice touch is that music suddenly ends when you complete all goals on the level, showing that you got nothing to do there anymore. It somehow ends up being awkward though, when you still got something to do.\n\nMultiplayer on other hand is a big improvement over Quake. Now, it's still old-school and will not interest many, especially seeing how Quake 3 Arena is out. But you got to say that's it's quite a little fun. It's slower-paced, sure. But it finally got balance in weapons. The one who has rocket launcher no longer dominates whole arena, as other weapons are viable alternatives with their own specialization, mostly range difference. Better for those who prefer a bit more thinking and a bit less reflexes. I do have a bad feelign that railgun may end up being a bit too good, penetrating and killing unarmed players in one shot. But I didn't play for long.\n\nAnd well, I wrote some bad things here, sure. Yes, I think that this game is generic and missable. But you know, it's still a fine generic FPS. With very few bright spots. It's not something I would call a classic, but you can still have fun with it. And it doesn't do anything way too bad in gameplay. No cheap deaths or such to frustrate you. So, feel free to check it out.","July 30, 2015","true","27.1"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","1"

This right here is my favourite PC game I have ever played. The graphics are good, the sound is loud and powerful and the mutliplayer is fast and challenging. Quake II was released in 1997 but that dosen't mean it's not good to play. I'm a old school gamer, so I play stuff way older than this.\n\nThe Graphics\n\nThe engine in the game is called "Id Tech 2", or you can just call it "The Quake 2 Engine". It's opengl support is fantastic. The lighting in the game is superb, better than what Id Tech 1/The Quake 1 engine could handle. The textures are good as well. And, a little secret. In the console type "gl_shadows 1. It allows realistic shadows into the game and shines light over objects, enimies and other things. It's quite amazing. In the Id Tech 2 engine, unlike the Id Tech 1 engine, you can puch some objects around. And, Id Software, yet again brought back the exlposive barrels. But, you can move them, but be careful. They are highly explosive.\n\nThe Sound\n\nWow, Quake II has some pretty amazing sound. Most of the weapons are load and I love them that way. The Super Shotgun is big and delivers a huge blast to make you feel satisfied. The BFG 10K Is the biggest out of all of the guns and damm, I just love that BFG noice. The Strogg noices for me (when i was about 6) were creepy.","July 5, 2014","true","395.3"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","16","22","3","1"

Period.\n\nQuake II is a classic FPS, which was famous because at the time it supported 3d Graphic Acceleration (the good old 3dfx), the enemy AI was very improved from the classic "runandshootatyou" (enemies had different kind of attacks and behaviours, and the most dangerous ones will crouch to avoid your projectiles), many of them will still try to shoot you a couple of times before dying and... flies will gather around fresh corpses of enemies you've just killed... XD\nAt its days this game held a huge amount of innovations and, considering the title, one of them was the completely different setting from the previous chapter. No more dungeon-medieval themed levels and enemies: now there are stroggs, cybernetic aliens that create their army by taking enemies corpses and reviving them with cybernetic improvements. Scary enough? Not until you see the levels with your space marine comrades captured, tortured and gone completely crazy. Definitely on a different level compared to Quake.\nThe arsenal is more interesting than the previous chapter and even bigger, considering there are 10 weapons, and there's a BFG again.\nAnother huge innovation is the level structure. It was confusing at the time because in certain areas you had to solve certain puzzles in order to proceed, and they required items or explorations in other "dead end-levels".\nAs a metalhead I can't help but mention the badass soundtrack, something rare to hear nowadays.\nAnother interesting thing is the possibility to play in Coop the main campaign.\nLong story short, this game is the definition of "Old but Gold".\n\n+++PROs+++ ENGINE. The Quake II Engine is quite old now, but it still is enjoyable nowadays.\nSOUNDTRACK. Very Badass Soundtrack. 'Nuff said...\nINNOVATION. Nowadays it may look quite a common game but for the time this title was so full of innovation from the Enemy AI to the Level structure.\nSETTING. The stroggs are quite scary considering their "nature" and the levels we find them in, not to mention the tortured marines we find around in the most advanced levels.---CONs---....... ehm.... OLD. It's old. It's not a DX12 game. Is this a good reason to ignore this game?\nCOMPATIBILITY ISSUES. OK, seriously, as usual this game presents compatibility issues due to its age. Luckily there's the Steam community with various solutions and patches that will make this game run flawlessly, as if your i7 with your GTX 970 was an MMX with a Vodoo 3dfx... And, seriously, if you want to exploit more your hardware you can always look up for some Port that will load the game for you with enhanced graphics.\nSTEAM RELEASE. This is supposed to be the classic garbage steam release, with no particular updates and some compatibility issues, as mentioned before. I am told there's not even the music in this release. I never noticed as I HAD to use the patch to make it run and this patch includes music as well. So no particular harm was done to me... Still there are some Old game bugs that I still remember since its original release, such as missing power cubes, unopened doors holding data spinners or loop levels, where you follow the objectives, go to a level, follow your objectives, then it tells to go back and once you're done there's a barrier blocking you, asking you to do everything again (Reactor and Cooling facility)... Meh... Nothing that a good old noclip can't fix... XD","May 31","true","6.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

In this game, you're fighting against the Strogg, once again all by yourself. The levels are objective-based, however they still play pretty much the same as original Quake levels, but less maze-like for the most part. This may put some people off.\n\nThe game has been given a complete graphical overhaul; more or less every texture and model in the game has been completely remade to fit the look of Quake II.\n\nI would write more, but I haven't played this game in a long time and my memory of it isn't too good.

Quite literally, the moment achievements come out on the game, if they ever do, I'll be among the first to get them all.\n\nQuake 2 is basically a game where you infiltrate and alien world in order to kil their leader and make way for a larger-scale attack, while deactivating defense grids and blowing up a giant gun battery. You also kill things.\n\nThe game has very little story, delivered in the manual of the game (which i don't think comes with the game), but basically you're a soldier who deploys in a drop pod to the world named Stroggos. Your pod gets hit hugely off-course, and you land in an outpost of not much consequence.\nYou are totally alone. No buddies, no air-support, all you have is your blaster, and your PDA which give you stat readouts on the area (like how many people are still waiting to die, or how many secrets) but more importantly, your objectives beamed down from the capital ship in orbit into said PDA.\n\nThe game is essentially as good as FPS adventure action games get witohut going into arena FPS territory, and is (in my opinion) the only one to do this to date.\n\nThe game has level stats exactly like in Duke Nukem 3D, Quake 1 and even Doom 1, and the secrets are always really good and memorizing their locations can become second-nature and are even instrumental on Hard+ difficulty.\n\nQuake 2 is an FPS that can be played mainly as a singleplayer game, but has Multiplayer and even Co-op, and lived in the days when Balancing wasn't even a matter that was at all important in the eyes of Developers.\n\nMultiplayer is essentialy arena-FPS and that's awesome.\n\nThe game has 3 mission packs, 2 of which are on Steam (and i think the 3rd is too).\n\nFor anyone who likes FPS games that doesn't easy-mode the experience by giving you regeneration, checkpoints, and newly refreshed ammo and weapons at the beginning of every new level, Quake 2 is a must have.","July 7, 2014","true","2.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But I don't like the singleplayer to Quake 2.\n\nThe original Quake is one of my favorite first person shooters ever. It features a great sense of speed and flow. Levels are completed relatively quickly, the enemies were very original and forced the player to adapt to the levels, and the game had this spooky haunted house aesthetic combined with an excellent OST by Nine Inch Nails.\n\nQuake 2 however always felt to me like a step backwards. A lot of the enemies are much more generic cyborgs with hitscan weapons that mostly just stand as obstacles before you get a keycard to open a door. There's no sense of flow to the levels where you're expected to prioritize enemies by how dangerous they were and how much they required you to dodge their attacks. Here I just go into a room, shoot 3 similar enemies standing still, repeat. It makes the game feel very dull and for many years I never understood why I could never finish Quake 2 until I started to notice that.\n\nHowever all that being said the biggest thing Quake 2 does well is it's multiplayer. Quake 2's multiplayer in many ways is a lot better than the original. It features great diversity with weapons like rocket launchers and railguns. Complete with a great selection of levels. The high octane heavy metal soundtrack Quake 2 has suits a multiplayer game much more than Quake 1's spooky haunted house music did.\n\nIt's one of my more polarizing opinions on the game. I don't really hate Quake 2 since there are things about it I like. But it's easily the Id singleplayer game I've played the least of.","January 11","true","5.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","As someone who was born too early to enjoy the '90s first-person shooter craze, series like Doom and Quake were something that passed over me.  Arena shooters (Painkiller, Serious Sam, etc.) were what started my old-school fascination.\n\nWhile both Doom's and Quake's games are timeless, I find that the Quake series is something more familiar for newcomers than the original Doom games. 3D level design of Quake is hardly something new compared to the sprite-based 2.5D design of Doom.\n\nEven with programs to enable mouselook and higher textures/better effects for Doom, the Quake series feels like a game that has only aged by its looks. Not the core gameplay.\n\nAudio Problems: Get Ultimate Quake Patch\nFor some technical reason, Steam's version of Quake (and Quake 2) do not have the soundtracks included. Before you go to GOG, you should know that their version also lacks the soundtracks.\n\nIf you type in Ultimate Quake Patch (for one or two), you'll find Steam pages where you can download a specific patch just for Steam which will run the game on some other engine with the soundtrack fixed as well as larger font for messages. (It also has controller/joypad support).\n\nI cannot stress this enough: You need that patch. Playing this game without the soundtrack is so boring. Admittedly it feels more atmospherc and horrorish, but having the soundtrack will ease your nerves and keep you going. (The texts also seem more abundant to let you know what to do next.)\n\nWhy You Should Play Quake (and Quake 2) in 2015\nThe main reason I think Quake is much easier to get into than Doom is not the visuals nor the lack of freelook (without any mods or programs like GZDoom, obviously). No, the main reason is because of Quake's sense of verticality and the 3D level design.\n\nThe level design of Quake games are these open-ended, yet linear, maps where objectives require you to move from one place to the next. These involve different transitions to new areas or multiple floor areas with secrets hidden plenty. And backtracking rewards you with finding secrets or alternative routes through the levels.\n\nIt's also important to note that these games being linear is not a bad thing. In fact, it's how the game obscures its linear nature that makes it feel rewarding.\n\nThe 3D level design makes the game never feel like an 2D labyrinth where you have to exhaust all means to find the exit, and the ways the levels twist-back on themselves makes the levels have a nice sense of cohesion and thought put into them.\n\nThat attention is made clear with Quake's sense of verticality. It's not just having multiple floors; Doom has several levels with elevation changes. The game relies on the one thing that breaks Doom: Jumping.\n\nEven if you enable mouse-look for Doom to make it play like a modern game, enabling the ability to jump will break the game itself. Secrets, manueverability around enemies, etc. were built around that limitation, and it feels like an artificial limitation to not use the jump button yourself.\n\nQuake, however, rewards exploration with the mechanic. It enables you a viable means to fake-out the enemies or dodge a projectile. It encourages you to explore above you and below for items you may need.\n\nAll of what I'm saying is Quake's demand of the player's spatial awareness goes a long way to distract the player from what is otherwise a linear experience.\n\nForget the Numbers\nThe differences between Q1 and Q2 are too numerous to state here. They play similarly enough, yet they both look and feel far removed from each other that you could consider them two seperate games. I think it's personal preference for which is superior.\n\nHowever, there are several things about Q2 that I think would make it a better introduction than the first game.\n\nFor starters, the enemy abilities and telegraphs are much more obvious than in Q1. While I love the Lovecraftian/Gothic Horror vibe of Q1, the Strogg are simply a better enemy type because they all stand out and they all have better visual cues for the player.\n\nCompare the Strogg with the chaingun and grenade launcher hands from Q2 to the chainsaw guys in Q1. It is much clearer to know what to do when the arm with the grenade launcher aims at you than the chainsaw guy's other arm.\n\nA lot of enemies in Q2 have visual cues that you'll learn without having your hand held by the game. The enemies' designs are varied to not become confusing when you have to handle more than one.\n\nAnother reason why Q2 is a better place to start is that the game isn't relentless with its enemy mobs. Q1 is more relentless with its nonstop action; Q2 relies on pacing out the fights to guide the player in the "right" direction.\n\nThere are also gameplay means to ease the difficulty. Things like the Power Armor (charged by cells for some guns) will improve your odds at the cost of not using up your more powerful weapons.  (And then you have the power-ups you can ration out.)\n\nThese will encourage you to not save-scum your way through the game, which will help you get better at other old-school games (like Quake 1).\n\n"Where do I go? What do I do?"\nBacktracking is one thing about Quake 2 that may make or break you, and unlike Doom there is no map-screen.\n\nThe game is full of backtracking objectives, but you will more often know where the next objective is if you're thorough with your exploration.\n\nFor the most part.\n\nWhile I have gone into great detail for how Quake relies on the player's awareness for their surroundings, I found one part of the game impossible to solve on my own for my first and second playthrough: Mission 9.\n\nNormally, you can usually check your Mission Objectives to nudge you into the right area to be, and there is usually some visual clue on what you affected with a switch or button. (Besides the text prompts or map names.) And the levels usually feature some visually themed objects or names of facilities to let you know what you are walking into.\n\nEven with a year's difference between my first and second playthrough, I found most of the direction of Q2 intutive and not time-consuming. Except for Mission 9: the Inner and Outer Palace.\n\nThis level is an absolute mess of switching forcefields off, transitioning between loading screens, and other means of backtracking. Some rooms feel like Escher staircases, and some rooms will take you to areas you didn't think would be there.\n\nSolution for mission 9: Bring an FAQ or find a video guide to help.\n\nAn Unoriginal Classic\nThough not as groundbreaking or "new" as DOOM and not as favorited as the original, Quake 2 is still a well-polished game despite the aging years. Brown-grime color palatte and the lacking Gothic Horror tone aside, Q2 is a classic old-school first-person-shooter that deserves to be played by modern audiences.\n\nIt's a game that has not aged well on the eyes, yet it has retained all its vigor in its design.","December 24, 2015","true","16.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

One of the funnest games I've ever played. Very fast paced. All the maps have a maze like set up to them. A very large arsenal with each weapons having an advantage and disadvantage.

The game rewards your efforts to explore locations with many bonuses like quad damage or extra armor or even a gas mask to help you stay underwater alot longer or a fancy new weapon.\n\nA word of advice, If you ever plan to get the quake series off of steam you will need to install a patch or two. The game that steam releases itself looks very clunky, with very few options to modify the game properly, and worst of all no gameplay soundtrack (which is one of the best features of the quake series).\n\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756937 This includes the patchs that I installed for Quake II.

HOWEVER, in the interest of seeing it through, I soldiered on (SO NOBLE), and eventually found myself enjoying the latter half of the game.

Instead of an alien invasion of supernatural creatures like in Doom and Quake 1, this is an invasion from an Alien from outer space. Which is what I like more from Quake 2. Instead of recycling the idea from the Doom games, they made something new. They gameplay, is what makes this game my all time favorite game. Fast paced non-stop action all the time.

And it was playable at those speeds, too!\n\nQuake II is a classic shooter. There's no hand-holding here - you're plopped in the middle of a war-zone with nothing but your pistol and wits to get you started. Enemies are plentiful and in some instances, tough. And if you don't do some exploration to find extra ammo and armor, you'll find yourself in trouble quickly.\n\nThe graphics don't look too amazing when set against 2013 standards, but they certainly deserve to be appreciated, for a game originally released in 1997. Sound is sparse, a bit like what you'll find in games like Doom, but without the constant ambient music.\n\nI enjoy playing this game every now and then for a little nostalgia, but I usually end up playing for longer than I thought I would, just because the simplified, raw experience can be so much fun.","December 2, 2013","true","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","5"

It's still definitely Quake in feel, but with a frame story of fighting for humanity's survival against the Borg-like Strogg. And to be honest, I'm not sure why I prefer it to the original. Maybe it's the more refined FPS mechanics or the improved graphics, but ultimately I think it's just personal preference as to which Quake game someone likes the most.

Its art style is some of my favorite theme;, a horryfing mash of alien technology and human corpses as your enemies and level design that is militaristic yet barren.

Nothing wrong with that but it's more Sci FI.\nAnd it's a good game. While different from the first one it's a good game imo.\nThis time instead of playing as the Quake Ranger/Quake guy you play as a Space Marine? Whatever alien know as bitterman. Cool i guess but not as cool as that badass Quake ranger.\nBack to the point. This time you fight a new enemy know as the strogg and they're pretty evil.(Again i guess)\nSo they're trying to invade earth and you bitterman of course kill their leader/overlord and stop their invasion of earth...for now...until i play Quake 4. So yea that's about it. It's a good game. You get a variety of badass weapons ranging from the badass BFG1000 and that kick ♥♥♥ Rail gun as well as a good chaingun and your typical cool looking double barrel shotgun and of course a rocket  launcher and other weapons. Their's also items. One of them is a the quad damage and  invulnerability and more that i can't remember since i don't know their names. You go trough several levels/chapters. Ranging from a prison to a factor ranging to a city to a palace.\nCool levels but they can be rather annoying and confusing at times. So yeah all in all i rate it a 8/10.\nIf your're a more of a Sci fi guy then get this game.\nPersonally i enjoyed and prefer Quake 1 more. Why?\nWell i honestly enjoyed the Lovecraft horror and gloomy type style of Quake 1 then the sci fi of Quake 2. (And this is coming from a Sci fi fan)\nI guess i'm just a sucker from Lovecraftian type elements in games. Plus i enjoyed the short 4 worlds quake 1 had instead of going trough a bunch of levels completing different task and goals. Plus the strogg is just well ridiculous. I can't take them seriously nor find them scary.\nThey just look really silly and ridiculous imo. Not the trooper guys but the others. Quake 1's enemies on the other ♥♥♥♥ing scare me.

I had no internet back then, so there's no way to explain how exciting it was to have the opportunity of playing a FPS with other people on the PC. Anyway, although I had a lot of fun, I didn't have a good hardware back home (neither the game), so I had to wait for a couple of years until I could eventually manage to do it. Well, although the gameplay is surely fluid, for some reason I couldn't let to compare it with the previous game (which was so much better in my own opinion), so in the end I was quite disappointed with the single player mode. Then a few years later, I've tried to play the coop campaign via Hamachi with my friends, but still we've never played to the end.

I was expecting Shambers; I found cyborgs. Yet, when I consider the co-operative experience of Quake (1) versus Quake II, I always find myself saying that Quake II was a real turning point for id Software - a plot, objectives, and level progression that made sense. I love shooting Vores and Ogres as much as the next guy, but Quake (1) had a decidedly single-player focus.\n\nMissing out on Quake II is missing out the adolescence of 3D graphics accelerators in the PC world. With both software and hardware (OpenGL) renderers, it bridged the gap in the PC space at the time and showed the power of 3D accelerators to me: the atomospere looks significantly more immersive with OpenGL at 60 FPS.","September 30, 2013","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We used to have this midterm fair every year and for some reason, someone decided to assemble this LAN with this game on it. I had no internet back then, so there's no way to explain how exciting it was to have the opportunity of playing a FPS with other people on the PC. Anyway, although I had a lot of fun, I didn't have a good hardware back home (neither the game), so I had to wait for a couple of years until I could eventually manage to do it. Well, although the gameplay is surely fluid, for some reason I couldn't let to compare it with the previous game (which was so much better in my own opinion), so in the end I was quite disappointed with the single player mode. Then a few years later, I've tried to play the coop campaign via Hamachi with my friends, but still we've never played to the end.

Being around since the dawn of video games, I first started with a new Atari 2600 untill they abandoned the platform, but I had an investment that wouldn't play on the Atari 5200. After I got over that I moved onto Nintendo 8 bit. It had been around long enough, and had an extensive library, and even started adapting some Atari titles. after they started making forward compatible consoles, without allowing my Atari library, I'd had it with the consoles. I finally got my first computer from a neighbor, and the first First Person shooter I got was Quake 2 in the cheap bin not realizing I would get hooked on a last generation computer game. I sought for Quake (1), and the add on packs, and it has kept me playing and replaying- which I like to do. They upsated Wolfenstein, didn't they? And as Quake became unplayable with Windows upgrades, I was glad sream offered it AL in a package for the same price as Quake 2 cost new.\nThey could upgrade Quake again. I still like first person shooters that don't blind me with speed, explosions, and glorify criminals. Everything now seems based on Quake amyway, and zombies just bore me, but I still like to go back to Quake, and try different routes, or play through with just one weapon, and so on.\nI am still hoping to find Quake World mods that work on Steam though-so far they have been relatively unstable...","May 21, 2014","true","516.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The gameplay, like all the Quake games, is the main attraction. Guns still feel satisfying and enemy designs are still unique, but the attempts to show off the graphics go over just as poorly as you would expect. Lighting up rooms with your gun feels unessicary  and the shots somee enemies take at you while dying barely make a diffrence. While I do appreciate the detail, these additions don't add to the game and I have mixed feelings about their addition. Also, the great feeling of using the guns is migitated when they killing someone makes them spin around like a Saturday morning cartoon. But, despite all this, Quake II is still a great game that is certainly worth buying. 8/10","July 26, 2014","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played both Quake games in 2014 for the first time and while I had a great time with Quake 1, Quake 2 was okay, but never really made that much fun.\nThe weapons sound and feel very weak, the enemy design is just random and boring, levels look all the same, soundtrack doesnt fit the game at all and is annoying so that I had to turn it off.\nIts not a bad game, but compared to the masterpiece that Quake 1 is, its a very bid dissapointment. If you skip this game you miss nothing, if its cheap and you have nothing else to play then grab it.","June 23, 2014","false","2.8"," 11 of 84 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","11","84","2","8"

I'll look at PROS and CONS of it's existence, throw in some fun personal notes and impressions, and then throw down my verdict on whether you should invest money into it.\n\n-----\n\nFirstly, QUAKE II suffers from a very serious problem. It's boring. Sloggy. Tedious. Clunky.\n\nNormally, taking the age into account you can look past all of this and cheerily stroke memories of you getting it for Christmas from your none-the-wiser parents when you were 8 or 12 or however old.\n\nThe thing is, this game aged like trash and so did the engine. Though lets get on with a fun section with bullet points!\n\n-\nPROS:\nIt has a story, which is something QUAKE was almost entirely without.\n\nGuns. It sure does have them!\n\nParticle Acceleration. Wow! Those 124MBs of RAM will come in handy.\n\n\nCONS:\nThe guns are vomit worthy, in function and appearance.\n\nWhen bullets don't instantly hit, their speed can be described as a light saunter.\n\nGray. Brown. Tannish Orange. Gunmetal Gray. Red. There was more color variation in the first Borderlands.\n\nAny thought that went into the level design is completely lost on the mind numbing tedium of actually getting through one.\n\nEverything looks fat and stupid and clunky. Just look at the basic Strogg infantry's run, there's nothing threatening about these enemies.\n-\n\nThere was a serious problem of not taking advantage of what the engine had to offer.\n\nEven with Dai-Katana, there was concept and variety with things like weapons and stages. There were also colors and things that could be seen as "interesting to look at". Just look at, say, JonTron's review of it. It looks like ♥♥♥♥, but god dammit it's colorful ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIn all, this game is nothing but a showboat for the QUAKE II engine and should be treated that way.\n\nThis is a terrific series, QUAKE is, but this iteration never failed to bore me to quitting not even 2/3rds of the way into a level.\n\n-\nSHOULD YOU BUY? THREE SITUATIONS...\n\n1. If you love the QUAKE series, if you've always loved it and played them when you were a wee chitlun then yes, but this review is not made with nostalgia-goggles or whatever edgy term we're using for fond, clouding memories detailing our days of yore. Though I'm not sure why you don't already have several cds or flash disks with it already.\n\n2. No, I say if you're looking for something interesting and fun to challenge yourself with then this most certainly is not the game for you as there are arguably more appropriate things for that. I recommend QUAKE or QUAKE III: Arena, it's predecessor and successor respectively.\n\n3. I also say that if you are new and have an interest in the QUAKE series of games then by god go for it and learn some lore or be completionist or whatever.\n\n---\n\nWith that I'm done.\n\nIf you've already disliked this just based on the fact it's a negative review of a game you like. Eat a ♥♥♥♥. Eat twenty. Without any milk.\n\nIf you disagree and have something coherent to bring to a discussion comment and see if your infallible reason can sway me about giving this game more chances.\n\nGood day.","January 18, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 71 people (8%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","8","6","71","6","49"

It gave some gamers exactly what they wanted from an action relentless fast paced in your face action. ID software set out to change the world with Wolfenstein 3-D and then changed the world for a second time with the original DOOM in 1993. Doom and Wolfenstein brought to the table staples of the genre back in the day:\n1. Key hunts\n2. Lots of Action\n3.Progressivley Harder enemies\n4.Secrets\n5.Limited health and ammo\n6.And your basic loadout of guns\nDoom improved upon these with its very open very maze like levels, lots and lots of gore, a crapton more enemies(and a larger variety of them at that) the list goes on and on. But they made one last change to the whole FPS genre that changed what people that the capcity of a shooter was. One word, one single word that shook the gaming world forever. It stoodm for something that would leave other shooters in the dust: "QUAKE". This was the first truly 3-D shooter where the graphics did'nt look like crap. The models and textures were great for the time, each episode had totally different and unique art styles, enemies, and textures. The game had fast paced action and what seemed like ♥♥♥♥ing neverending waves of enemies. Now that's all fine and good but what really made QUAKE huge: ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. It was there in DOOM but QUAKE made it better.\n\nNow what do I think of Quake 2.........HOLY BALLS THIS GAMES KICKS MORE ♥♥♥ THEN A DONKEY ABUSER.\nQuake 2 had wayyy ahead of it's time graphics back in the day, better multiplayer, smoother and faster gameplay, but it had one thing that even today is still used in every single FPS today and that is a mission structure for every single level. Instead of just finding keys, killing enemies then ending the level. You are now told why you are doing this via a computer menu (can be opened by pressing F1 by default) this gave  some sort of structure to the game that wasn't too offensive. The levels are still fairly open and explorable with some areas not being open until you beat a later level. That's another thing as the game progresses there will be times where you have to return too return to a previously explred area to continue which I found cool.\n\nThe music absolutley steals the show with this one. Doom had an excellent thrash metal soundtrack that kicked ♥♥♥ and made you wanna rip and tear through all kinds of alien zombie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but Quake 2 IMO completley blows it out of the water. With a very head-banging heavy metal soundtrack (that sounds all kinds of crisp because CD based music and shiz) it feels like the perfect soundtrack for a game about a lone marine killing everything that breathes in his general directoin. The soundtrack is what made me pursue this game and is part of the reason why I think this game has aged fairly well.\n\nOverall quake 2 is kick ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥. Great visuals, good enemy variety, AMAZING MUSIC, cool guns, addictive multiplayer, frantic and fast paaced action that keeps you on your toes, and classic key card hunts make this an FPS everyone absolutley has to try. Its not perfect and the visuals have aged but the fast action, high difficulty and great music keeps this game alive and kicking.\n\nI LOVE THIS GAME AND SO SHOULD YOU FPS FANS","December 27, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember the first time I played this wonderful game. It was a quiet spring day and I got home from school. I immediately booted up my old Windows 98, which was a little slow but for games it worked well. I waited patiently for it to finish loading up everything. While it was doing that, I looked around the messy computer desk to find a game to play when I found a copy of a game with a name that I immediately recognized. Quake II. I had already played the first game. It was one of the first games I ever played. It was a memory that would never leave my head. So, as a curious child with nothing else to do, I popped the game into my CD drive.\n\nI immediately noticed something different with the game. The install screen showed creatures I had never seen from the first game and the backgrounds during installation showed futuristic facilities that looked nothing like the first game. I was confused, but excited at the same time. I could not wait to see what hid inside the game itself. The game finished installing and, as a now very excited child, started up the game. The menus looked and sounded a lot different from the near-steampunk menus of the first game, but I shrugged, set the difficulty on easy (I was a kid what do you expect?), and watched the intro.\n\nThe intro starts off with a camera zooming out of a weird structure while weird news reports were discussing the plot of the game. An alien race, known as the Strogg, have invaded earth in a galactic war against the human race. They destroyed numerous cities in their time on Earth. The humans surprisingly shove them back home and now we are going to fight them on the Strogg home planet. Then the camera zoomed out to the Quake II logo. A light suddenly shined behind it and blew up the logo! I was completely speechless. I didn't know what else to do except keep watching.\n\nAfter the explosion, a ship flies from the bottom of the screen with tons of guns and artillery for taking the Strogg down. The intro then cuts to a bay that looked like a prison, but then the doors opened and revealed what I thought initially were cannons. Next I saw one of these weird things about to be launched. It had the name "Bitterman" on it. I then knew that these were pods about to be sent to take down the Strogg. After being launched, Bitterman gets clipped by some cowboy and loses a little control but gets situated. On the planet, we come to this big cannon looking thing on the planet and suddenly...all hell breaks loose.\n\nScreams blast through my speakers as I learn what happens next. Apparently, the Strogg forces knew the humans would be coming, so they prepared an EMP for them and killed the marines with it. Somehow, getting clipped by that cowboy saves Bitterman, but he overshoots the landing zone and crash lands into a bunker on the left side of the big gun. The screen goes black as the sound of clashing steel fills my speakers. Shocked by the intro I had just witnessed, I had to play this game. I was completely speechless from the intro and I had to see what the gameplay was like.\n\nAs soon as the game started up, I looked at where I was and was amazed by the graphics. It looked great! And I loved how I could see the hand that was holding the gun. A nice touch by id Software, and a really innovative thing for 3D graphics in 1998. The look of the levels was really astonishing too! The color looked so much better than the really brown color of the original Quake. I was very pleased with the look of the game.\n\nBut when the game loaded, something else filled my speakers. The soundtrack. The legendary guitar-filled soundtrack. This is easily one of the best parts of Quake II. The original Quake had a more ambient soundtrack which did sound great, but I felt that it didn't fit the actions you were doing. Quake II however had a much more fitting soundtrack. It's definitely awesome to listen to. I highly recommend the soundtrack. The sound effects sound really good too. The blaster sounds like I would imagine a blaster to sound like, and the other guns have really satisfying sounds. My favorite sound effect has to be the Super Shotgun blast. It sounds powerful, like how a double-barrel instrument of destruction should sound.\n\nThe controls are of course fluent as they should be. One thing Quake II adds is the ability to crouch. It's a nice new action that does help with aiming and avoiding enemy projectiles. It also adds new ways to get secrets in each of the levels that are in the game. Speaking of the levels, I LOVE the level design in Quake II. They are big and wide open with lots of secrets to find. You could play a level for hours just to find all of the secrets! Yes you could do this in the original, but Quake II I feel is a little better at this.\n\nThe one thing I did enjoy more than the already awesome single player was the addicting multiplayer. This was the first game I ever played online. I was a child, but that didn't matter to me! I was playing one of my favorite games with other people! I was enjoying all of it! Of course I sucked, but it was fun just playing with others on the internet! It didn't matter to me back then. I was just having fun!\n\nOf course I could only have so much fun with Deathmatch. I did notice however that there was a server with a bunch of players, so I checked it out. I was in for a ride though as I found myself playing what would become my favorite game type in any video game. Good ol' CTF! In CTF, short for Capture The Flag, you are on a team going after the other team's flag and returning it to your base. It was super addicting and really fun. I must have been on for hours just playing CTF with whoever was on at the time! It comes with Quake II nowadays so it's awesome to see that it is avaliable at anytime!\n\nWhat I also discovered on the CTF server I was on was custom character models to play as in Quake II! Pretty much, a character model, a huge improvement over the skins system in Quakeworld, is a custom-made model of any character you can think of to be used in Quake II to play as. I'm not even joking when I say any character you can think of. There's a huge variety! Beavis and Butthead, the kids from South Park, Fox McCloud, and tons more to choose from! If there's a character, there's probably someone who made them avaliable to play as in Quake II.\n\nOverall, Quake II is legendary. As soon as I was done playing it for the first time, I knew I had found something special. Everything in Quake II is amazing. The graphics, the sound, the single player and multiplayer, everything. It was the first game I tried to introduce to a friend and he got into it really quickly. It was my favorite PC game for many years. If it wasn't for the badass Duke Nukem 3D, this would still be my all-time favorite PC game.\n\nBUY IT NOW!!!!","December 20, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It gave some gamers exactly what they wanted from an action relentless fast paced in your face action. ID software set out to change the world with Wolfenstein 3-D and then changed the world for a second time with the original DOOM in 1993. Doom and Wolfenstein brought to the table staples of the genre back in the day:\n1. Key hunts\n2. Lots of Action\n3.Progressivley Harder enemies\n4.Secrets\n5.Limited health and ammo\n6.And your basic loadout of guns\nDoom improved upon these with its very open very maze like levels, lots and lots of gore, a crapton more enemies(and a larger variety of them at that) the list goes on and on. But they made one last change to the whole FPS genre that changed what people that the capcity of a shooter was. One word, one single word that shook the gaming world forever. It stoodm for something that would leave other shooters in the dust: "QUAKE". This was the first truly 3-D shooter where the graphics did'nt look like crap. The models and textures were great for the time, each episode had totally different and unique art styles, enemies, and textures. The game had fast paced action and what seemed like ♥♥♥♥ing neverending waves of enemies. Now that's all fine and good but what really made QUAKE huge: ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. It was there in DOOM but QUAKE made it better.\n\nNow what do I think of Quake 2.........HOLY BALLS THIS GAMES KICKS MORE ♥♥♥ THEN A DONKEY ABUSER.\nQuake 2 had wayyy ahead of it's time graphics back in the day, better multiplayer, smoother and faster gameplay, but it had one thing that even today is still used in every single FPS today and that is a mission structure for every single level. Instead of just finding keys, killing enemies then ending the level. You are now told why you are doing this via a computer menu (can be opened by pressing F1 by default) this gave  some sort of structure to the game that wasn't too offensive. The levels are still fairly open and explorable with some areas not being open until you beat a later level. That's another thing as the game progresses there will be times where you have to return too return to a previously explred area to continue which I found cool.\n\nThe music absolutley steals the show with this one. Doom had an excellent thrash metal soundtrack that kicked ♥♥♥ and made you wanna rip and tear through all kinds of alien zombie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but Quake 2 IMO completley blows it out of the water. With a very head-banging heavy metal soundtrack (that sounds all kinds of crisp because CD based music and shiz) it feels like the perfect soundtrack for a game about a lone marine killing everything that breathes in his general directoin. The soundtrack is what made me pursue this game and is part of the reason why I think this game has aged fairly well.\n\nOverall quake 2 is kick ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥. Great visuals, good enemy variety, AMAZING MUSIC, cool guns, addictive multiplayer, frantic and fast paaced action that keeps you on your toes, and classic key card hunts make this an FPS everyone absolutley has to try. Its not perfect and the visuals have aged but the fast action, high difficulty and great music keeps this game alive and kicking.\n\nI LOVE THIS GAME AND SO SHOULD YOU FPS FANS","December 27, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
