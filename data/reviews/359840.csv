It just goes to show that whether you're large & fat or small & skinny you can still work in unison to overcome every obstacle you're faced with... uh...unless you're married.\nPro tip: Do not play this game in co-op with your spouse because you'll always be fighting as to who's better at puzzle solving. jk!\n\n*Although I played the beta version of this game offered for review, I definitely recommend this game to everyone!","September 10, 2015","true","1.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","19","21","3","0"

Since they share the same mass, when one creature is large the other has to be small and vice versa. The two creatures can change shape at any time. Many of the puzzles in the game are designed around this premise. This mechanic is interesting and the developers have created some puzzles that do a good job utilizing it.\n\nWhile the single player levels are better than I expected, the multiplayer is the best part of the game. I played the multiplayer local co-op so I can't comment on how well the online co-op works. I thought the game did a good job of keeping both players active in the puzzle solving making it that no one player can take control over everything.\n\nAt this early stage of early access there are a couple issues that will be hopefully resolved through further development. In around 2 hours I completed all but the most recently added levels. I also found the puzzles to be kind of easy. I play a lot of puzzle platformers though so that could be a contributing factor. As the developers add more levels I think both issues could be resolved.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Shift Happens. Other than receiving a free review copy I received no other compensation for this review and it had no impact of the content of this review.\n\nRead My Full Preview [www.geekyhobbies.com]","September 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

The progression with new ways to use the characters and objects was great.  With the amount of different ways to use them I can see levels being very tough in the future.  I also enjoy the fact that, like any good platformer, you can get through the level just as is or try to get all the extra stuff as well.  Makes it a bit more intresting to have secondary objectives.  Cant wait to try the multiplayer when someone gets home.  This game has a ton of potential with speedruns and a level editor.  Exctited to follow through the EA development process.","September 9, 2015","true","12.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

It's in early-access currently and some areas like the menu's do show this.\n\nFantastic that the developer has made the decision to make this online co-op, some of the puzzle solving will probably require some form of communication between players to be most efficient, e.g messaging at the minimum, VOIP as a preference.  Obviously for couch play you can shout at your mate when he doesn't do the right thing at the right time!!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623253197\n\nThe game itself and the mechanics involved really are great fun and it's teamwork all the way!  The game involves you and your partner switching between characters (a large one and a small one) to progress the level via obstacle style puzzles.  After the first couple of levels changing forms can result in the death of your team-mate which can lead to some hilarity, if you swtich forms whilst your large team-mate is standing in deep water making him take the small form and thus being submerged and drowning!!\n\nThe optional challenges also involve completing the level in set times and the Gold times are set at a level where both players are going to have to operate as a very smoothly oiled machine.  Any mistakes and you probably won't make it, but really satisfying when you do!!  Also there are stars to collect with one bunch of them hidden somewhere secret in each level.\n\nHighly recommend this if you are looking for a puzzle-platformer with co-op mode.","February 14","true","4.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Best played with a friend. You should get it!\n\nLong version:\nShift Happens is a puzzle intense platformer featuring two characters who can switch their masses (One is always small, while the other one is huge). The developers make what is in my opinion the most out of this great mechanic! The puzzles are very well designed, as are the levels.\n\nThe singleplayer works surprisingly well. You control both of the characters (one at a time) and have to puzzle your way through the levels. The learning curve is very nice, and in later levels it can get very tricky - which I love!\n\nHowever, the focus of the game lays on Coop. The devs really understood what Coop-fun is based on! You'll have to play together, think together and coordinate your actions to succeed. BUT: Every player has an own coin-count and you're able to trick your mate and steal his coins. Damn, it can be so fun to challenge your friendship!\n\nThanks for this great game!","September 16, 2015","true","7.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
