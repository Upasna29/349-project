Passed the 1st part of the game (meadow).\n\nTrial-and-error 2d Platformer.\n\nThere's no introduction, its just bam: you're in the game. While playing you'll understand what youre supposed to do.\nYou can walk, jump and freeze time. Thats it. (EDIT: a boomerang is added later in this game)\nWhile time is frozen you can destroy little "heads" by jumping on them. Clearing all heads in a puzzle means the gate gets opened -> proceed to next puzzle. Its all about common sense and timing. You miss a jump or take too much time you have to start over. Luckily there are plenty of these spawn points, and always in front of a puzzle.\nI think I spent about 15 minutes on one of the puzzles, dying over and over because my brain couldnt solve it (I blame the Belgian beer). Turned out to be pretty easy. Hah.\n\nThere's no text and no speech in this game. There's just some soothing and very nice background music. You could call this relaxing if there werent these annoying puzzles. Irritating, annoying, but addictive.\nCould have been called Bliss: Prepare to Die.\nGraphics are nice but repetitive.\n\nIts pretty damn cool just 1 guy made this in this free time (during office hours he works for a AAA developer). I have a lot of respect for that.\n\nThe good:\n- Simple controls\n- Nice music\n- A challenge\n\nThe ok\n- Graphics. Could use some variation.\n\nThe bad\n- No controller support. I like to play my platformers using a controller.\n- No graphics setting option. There should be at least the option to change the resolution or play full screen.\n\nIts an ok 2D platformer with some nice challenges. And nicely priced.\nRecommend? Yes: 70/100","December 9, 2014","true","0.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","1"

The levels of the game are meant to represent the five stages of grief, so each level is with different music, color palette and introduces new gameplay mechanic.\nEverything starts with denial - it's all sunshine and lollipops with a cheerful colors, as you learn, that you can freeze time. Confusion is next, where you can drop from the bottom of the screen and instead of dying, you come falling from the top. In Anger, angry sculls are coming to get you,when you use the freeze time. In bargaining a ripped off teddy-bear's head follows your cursor around and tries to get ya, once you freeze the time. The depression level can get depressing, as you learn to complete different tasks with each hand.\nAt the end of each level but denial, there is a boss waiting for you, with quite different mechanics and can be somewhat challenging. Once you defeat a boss, you can then replay it from the "main menu" (if you can call it that, the game really does not have any interface) in a "challenging" mode - a slightly changed up boss fight with pretty big increase in the difficulty.\nThe game saves automatically, and the checkpoints are pretty close at first and quite reasonable towards the end, and I never felt, that I'm replaying something too much. I would love to see more than 1 save slot though!\nThe game controls are pretty tight. I wish, that I am able to rebind them, as I died a lot, trying to jump and pressing space, but that freezes time instead :p I found the music pretty fitting for each of the levels and generally enjoyed it, especially the main theme!\nOverall a pretty solid puzzle platformer - yea the game could use some polishing, like a fullscreen option and some interface elements, but I still enjoyed it and can recommend it!\nI enjoyed the game so much, that I created a let's play :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353739105\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353759015\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353759014\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353759012\n","December 9, 2014","true","3.9"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The platforming concepts are simple yet the puzzles range from "i got this" to "i hate you." It is the best of multiple worlds with an amazing soundtrack backing it.

The art direction is impeccable, and even though it does two things I hate -- timed puzzles and spikes --, it's ok because I get to start the timer myself by pressing "space". That makes it more a game of strategy and position than one of twitch.\n\nBasically you follow a small guy from left to right, and he has to pass doors by jumping on hairy heads while the timer runs down, which means you have to get the sequence right or you won't make it in time. The other puzzle element I've seen so far involves falling and rising blocks that stop while the timer runs down, so your aim is to stop them where they'll be most useful.\n\nThis game gives me a lot of control, taxes the left side of my brain with puzzles, and the right side with a beautiful mysterious story told without words and haunting music. Fully recommended.\n\n(It is on sale on the Indiegala Monday bundle for a few more hours.)","February 16, 2015","true","2.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/315450/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","This game really isn’t good. The starts out immediately on a bad note, game is only windowed, with no fullscreen, no controller input (for a platformer?) and you cannot rebind controls. For a pc game, those are unacceptable. You play this stick guy with a mime face and a sperm-shaped head. You run around and use this time freeze ability to jump on black heads, and use a boomerang as well. That is it, for the entire game. It is super repetitive, and 2/3 of the puzzles are just you trying to jump on all the black heads before your time stop ability timer (which is changed with each puzzle to the preset time the developer decided, which is another annoyance) runs out. I got so sick of doing the same thing every time. They say this is story heavy, but doesn’t involve words or text, but that’s b-u-l-l-s-h-i-t. There is pretend story about loss in the background, but its really just an excuse for no real story, its just about you running around and jumping on things with the same song, that only changes every hour, playing.\n\nBad boss fights with multiple parts where you have to start the entire thing over if you get hit once. Game crashes, which is annoying especially after a lost progress of beating a stupid boss. There are bugs, like me getting hit by fire attack from a boss that I ran past that hadn't happened yet, but still counted as being there even though it wasn't on the screen yet. Then every time you die, instead of restarting at checkpoint right away, you have to slowly float back, wasting time while you just sit there. The jumping also seems off, as you will jump expecting to land on something, but float down and land over the object. There is difficulty, but thats just because it is artificially put in by you having this set amount of time, only being able to pause once, and you have to hit a bunch of things, while jumping, while also doing other things. For a game called “bliss”, the frustratingly terrible controls, lack of normal pc options, and repetition of gameplay, this game causes anything but that while playing.  4/10.","June 6, 2015","false","5.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

It is best described as the result of putting eversion, limbo, and braid put into a blender. It has a touching story narrating my own future in a few years as well as reminding me of past grief in 2011. The game is also appropiately priced. However, this game is doomed to complete obscurity for the following reasons:\n- The name is abysmal, game names need to be googleable and distinguishable. Not only is "bliss" a common english word, but its also the name of a different android game\n- No effort whatsoever was put into the settings, there are no settings in fact, it's not even possible to put the game into fullscreen and experience some immersion. This makes Bliss the polar opposite of Mortal Kombat X on launch day.\n- The game starts easy enough but after an hour or so it starts to approach IWBTG in terms of difficulty. This means the game will only appeal to hardcore gamers.","April 21, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Good.\nThe boss fights? Abysmal.\nIt balances out into a just-barely positive review, but dear god are those boss fights bad. The first one's okay, at least, the second one is short enough to be forgiveable, but the third is tedious as hell and the fourth has literal RNG.\nThe level design is mostly a series of action puzzles, figuring out the best way to kill all the enemies on the screen, and they're pretty neat, each world has its own gimmick and the entire game allows you to time stop, plus there's a boomerang introduced in the second world which adds to the fun. I did quite enjoy the bulk of this game, none of the puzzles were too tough and they all have a pretty reasonable execution factor to them. No complaints here.\nBut those bosses. Just. Why.  The challenge bosses are even worse, mostly just adding spikes or extra enemies to the arena to make the tedious bosses more tedious. The third challenge boss especially is just complete trash.\nSo if you want a pretty neat puzzle platformer marred by awful boss design, this one's for you I guess. I don't regret playing it or anything though, but it's probably not worth its asking price and it's not anything too special.","April 19, 2015","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
