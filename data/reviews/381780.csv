While 80 Days is in that realm, there is something really magical about it. After finishing a run, I literally felt as if I'd experienced an epic trip around the world - I can recall all the craziness and wild adventures as if they were real memories. Its hard to explain, but the game is very immersive.\n\nEssentially, the gameplay consists of role-playing a servant, and you make text-based decisions about how you want to interact with people and situations. 80 Days also has heavy strategy elements because a large part of your success depends on how you plan out your route around the world. There is also an economy element of balancing your funds through buying-low-selling-high, among other things.\n\nPros:\n+The writing is front-and-center here. Masterfully done writing. Some of the vocab even had me looking up words (in a good way).\n+The story is really good, and just feels incredibly immersive.\n+Great balance of strategy and story-telling.\n+Lots of classic literature easter eggs to be found :)\n\nCons:\n-Lots of reading - not for the impatient. 'The journey is the reward' - is truly applicable here.\n-It was built for mobile, but enough has been added/tweaked to merit the more expensive Steam purchase IMO.\n-Sometimes I wish I had better control over the map. I mean its fine, but I wish I could look at it on hardcopy.\n\nThis was recognized by Time magazine, among many many other awards. When video games gather the attention of outside media, you generally know its something great (ie. Minecraft). This is a real gem, IMO.","December 3, 2015","true","3.6"," 64 of 72 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","64","72","5","2"

The world is beautifully described and you will even catch a glimpse of the politic affairs playing in the steampunky world you live in. The game allows for multiple playthroughs, because of the huge amount of different cities to visit, the randomized seeds for the world and ofcourse the urge to beat your friends or your previous records!\n\nMy personal record is 75 days, and during this particular journey I walked the ocean floor, was kidnapped by dangerous pirates, traveled both with a walking AND a floating city, crashed a hot air baloon in the ocean, only to be saved by a handful of fishermen.\nI came across a lot more of interesting stories, but I won't spoil them all, they're for you to discover!\n\nThe game is based on the 1872 novel "Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours" by Jules Verne and the story viewed from Passepartouts perspective, just like Jules Verne's book.\n\nThe only improvable annoyance I found in this game is the 'conversation'-option you'll get during travels. It is a good way to learn a bit more about the possible roads you can take but it feels like more like some random generated lines than an actual conversation. However, the backstory of the vehicles you use are superb.\n\nEasily worth the 10 bucks in my opinion. A perfect game to play on a relaxing night, it feels like you're reading a different version of Jules Verne's novel.","October 8, 2015","true","17.1"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","54","58","5","4"

This game is a great example of an interactive novel. You are Passepartout, Phileas Fogg's valet, and it your job to plan the route that will take you Around the World in 80 Days ( I couldn't resist). As you plan your route, you have to manage the finances which involves purchasing gear that will help speed up travel or be more comfortable, or purchase artifacts or luxury items to sell in other parts of the world. The routes you can take depend on what maps you have, and who you talk to. There are so many ways to travel around the world, and so many side stories to be discovered. Expect multiple playthroughs to discover them all. The only potential drawback with this game is that you have to read everything. There are nice backgrounds to each place you go but the game relies on the players imagination to visualize a great bulk of the action. Overall, this is a very fun game with loads of replayability.\n\nUPDATE: I just want to say that knowing what I now know about this game, I would have paid full price for this game.\n\nExpect a much more fleshed out review coming soon from The Adventure Lantern!","October 24, 2015","true","7.2"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","34","40","0","3"

But with no save system, you cannot explore the "What ifs?" of your current story.\n\nPlot hooks and conversational links are so obscure that you'll either need hundreds of playthroughs or a walkthrough guide. If at any point you fail to go to the right city, or choose the right conversational option, your fascinating story comes to an abrupt halt. Too bad, play again.\n\nHow could you not realise that to finish the Mongolian plot you needed to travel between two particular cities in South America, in order to meet someone who'd never previously been mentioned? And that's far from the worst example.\n\nI've found other subplots which I'm fairly sure have a deeper storyline... but no walkthrough mentions them, not all start seeds have them, and there's no hint of how to bring the tale to the surface.\n\nIf it was a hardcore action game I could deal with an abrupt story end.\n\nBut '80 Days' ends up feeling like you were halfway through a book, when suddenly someone ripped up the last 3 chapters.\n\nIf you don't like story driven games, you won't like '80 Days'.\nAnd if you do like story driven games, you better be prepared for countless replays.","March 27","false","30.4"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","30","39","0","2"

Although it is possible to "lose", winning and losing are not really what this is about.\n-This is not a particularly "fun" game.  The pacing and story-bound nature of this title don't really lend themselves to instant gratification.  It is far more contemplative than that.\n-This isn't really a "game" at all.  As other have mentioned, it is much more a choose-your-own adventure book, heavily steeped in a strange alternate reality that we might call steampunkish, but which is really a close modern approximation of what Jules Verne's imagination produced.  If you don't enjoy reading, steer clear of this one.\n\nWith all that out of the way, I really enjoyed my first play through, and look forward to completing several more.  I think the format of the game lends itself well to multiple replays, as there are numerous routes and methods at your disposal to get from one place to the next, and the time requirement makes visiting more than a handful of locations during a single playthrough difficult. How replayable it is after more than a handful of playthroughs is debatable.  I'd guess that after about 4 or 5 circuits (about 8-10 hours) you'd have exhausted many of the locations and dialogue, and it might start to get a bit stale.\n\nMy only real gripes are that the interface is slightly wonky for keyboard and mouse, as it was designed for iOS.  I had a hard time figuring out how to get from "planning" back to where you could go to the bank, etc while in a city.  Turns out you have to click on the city you're currently in to go back.  Also, it should be noted that on PC this title is 10 bucks, whereas on iOS, it is 5.  I think the experience lends itself better to a tablet as well.  So there's that.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy books and reading, and especially if you are a Verne fan, you'll likely love this.  If you dislike reading and are looking for action and excitement, you'll probably hate it.  If you have an iPad, consider getting it on there vice PC.","November 21, 2015","true","3.1"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","1"

Be it inquiring fellow travellers about possible routes, preparing Fogg's shaving water or just making conversation to improve his mood and constitution.\n\nHowever, the game is obviously based on Jules Verne's famous novel and if you've read it, you already know that travelling won't be a walk in the park. There await countless random events; technical malfunctions, robbery, mutiny - even death.\nBut fear not, for you will also encounter various characters with the most interesting backgrounds whose friendship (and sometimes even love) you can win and who will often aid you on your voyage.\n\nThe story feels surprisingly thorough and responsive, considering it used to be "one of those pesky mobile games".\nIn pretty much every situation you have 2 or 3 different (text) options to choose from and alter the progress of the overall journey.\nThey managed to create and maintain a perfect balance between wanting to make haste in order to win the bet (circumnavigate the world in less than 80 days) and wanting to explore foreign culture. A perfect balance between "I can't wait to continue on my way because I'm keen to visit new cities and countries" and "But I also want to explore this city some more and learn about its recent history and its people".\nI think this is probably the greatest plus of the game and the reason it feels so incredibly vivid, almost as vivid as the actual novel.\n\nThroughout the adventure Passepartout will also develop in a certain way, depending on the choices you make. So it's entirely up to you if you want to be the exquisite Monseigneur or a sly daredevil - or maybe it's for the best of your gutless character to stay out of trouble and keep quiet?\n\nConcluding my impressions after almost 3 hours into the game I can promise you that if you are a fan of Verne's works, there is no risk at all in buying this. I can also wholeheartedly recommend it to historically interested people, since you get to learn quite a lot about the time the game is set in.\nJust make sure to keep in mind that it's more of a strategical exploration game with lots of text.\n\nUltimately, if you're still not sure whether to buy or not, just do it. The limit of 2 hours for the Steam refunds is more than enough time to get a good impression of the game.","September 30, 2015","true","3.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

The interface and inventory is simple but effective, presenting the player with choices in dialogue, traveling routes, and buying and selling of items, with the constraints of time and money encouraging resourcefulness and essential tradeoffs.

The conveyances in particular are well rendered, which you may see in the screenshots.  The map itself is very nice.\n+Good ambient sound and music\n+It's a piece of interactive fiction with a story to tell.  There aren't "wrong" choices, just different ones.\n+The Phineas Fogg health mechanic is EXCELLENT!  Instead of managing your character's health, you are charged as Mr. Fogg's valet.  You may abuse him or care for him as your whim dictates.\n+The system is relatively intuitive and operates very much as though you had a globe and touch-menu available in your room.  They ported it from iOS or whatever very well.\n+The game autosaves often, which offers an easy way to treat this as a casual game.  I did not mind that I couldn't manually save given the relatively short amount of time it took to play a journey.\n\nCons:\n\n-Every journey (so far for me) starts from London to Paris.\n-Playing through a journey sort of wears out the fun.  Each journey builds toward the triumphant return to London (if you make it!), so for me starting a new trip right after completing one felt more like a burden than a truly new adventure\n-Each city, conveyance, and character has its own art, but really the only striking art was the conveyance.  The characters are very much colored cameo/silhouettes, while cities are a bit forgettable.\n-No tutorial or other instruction is readily apparent.  It took me half an hour to figure out that it was easier to use the arrow keys to switch between possible routes and an hour to figure out that my character needed particular equipment in order to negotiate quicker passage with the available conveyances.\n\nIn all, if you're even considering getting this game then I recommend it.  It's a nice way to while away the time on a lazy afternoon or quiet evening, offering a bit of adventure to contemplate.  The script author is an excellent writer, and I very much enjoyed seeing what she came up with.  I think it's a good bargain at $10.  That's how much I would spend on a two hour movie and I expect to get quite a bit more time out of this game than that.","October 25, 2015","true","2.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

I worked nights and the bustle and noise of so many people under one roof made sleeping during the day difficult. I remember coming home in predawn hours however, and brewing a cup of tea. I would take a fine leather bound volume of Jules Verne stories from the bookshelf on the mantle, and sit down to lose myself in strange places and wondrous adventures. I would quite often disappear from the phenomenal world and regain my footing in sublime places.\n\nPlaying inkle.Ltd’s spectacular 80 Days has taken me back to those days. The game mechanically is a grandiose, “choose your own adventure” tale of a man becoming a man of the world. Though minimal in execution, the game’s presentation is perfect for what it is. My first playthrough was a 3 hour time flash which, I swear, only lasted 30 minutes.\n\nIn these days of jagged and blocky 8 bit dark silhouette characters jumping around in pixelated indie games with nary a storyline at all, it’s refreshing to find a game replete with such an incredible amount of imagination put into it.\n\nPlaying Phileas Fogg’s ever loyal servant plucked right from the pages of Jules Verne’s novel, Around the World in Eighty Days, I got us both kidnapped by cultists in Calcutta. I delivered a baby in the South Pacific while sailing to Manila, and in Manila I contracted cholera. I flattened myself against an alley wall in Dallas, Texas as hooded members of the Ku Klux Klan walked past me, torches in hand. And in New Orleans, Death sat at my table in a bar, bought me a drink and kissed my hand.\n\nNo. I didn’t win the race, nor did I complete my world tour in 80 days.

This immensely dialogue rich game immerses the player in a world (with a little imagination) not too dissimilar from our own. Set in the 1872 it explores not only the geological but plunges into the philosophical and ethical as you converse with people around the world in every country.\n\nWhile the visual aspect of this game belies it's touch-screen origins it did not detract from the overall aesthetics as the vector heavy, high contrast, less-is-more approach to the graphic content more than made up for this very slight shortfall. 9/10\n\nThe audio is palatable for a few hours as it assists in immersing the player into the world it offers, however, depending on your sensibilities, it may take a single playthrough to notice the looped tracks. Personally I played through twice before switching to my own playlist. I can appreciate the attention to detail of the composition of these tracks and how they seem to draw the player ever along on their global trek changing slightly to befit the corresponding country. 6/10\n\nThis game has a ridiculously high replay value and I relished the opportunity to play through again and again as not only did I want to explore and discover the seemingly limitless paths spurring me on to London but also to follow in my footprints yet again to uncover a conversation I had missed or a city I had passed on a rail journey of which we did not disembark to explore. 9/10\n\nRegarding gameplay I cannot speak highly enough. It was refreshing to play a character that you could flirt with two young ladies leaving France for a holiday, or have a romantic interlude with the muscular captain of an ice-walker. The dialogue and response options were also a breath of fresh air, this character could have shortcomings or may have a grandiose personality, or a penchant for mischief. Being able to choose your character's personality as you go really made it a giddy experience and a reminder that even if you try your hardest you can still fail; which is just another one of the positive aspects of this game. While I did found the audio a little repetitive, the immersiveness, replay value and relaxing aesthetics make this a game I shall continue to enjoy for many more hours to come. 10/10\n\nOverall I love this game for many reasons. From the simple and elegant visuals, the rich story, the depth of the dialogue through to the gameplay and replay value. 9/10\n\nTL;DR:\nAudio 6/10\nGraphics 9/10\nReplay Value 9/10\nGameplay 10/10\nOverall 9/10 - would happily repack luggage again and again and again...\n","May 16","true","66.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/381780/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","To start off 80 Days is an interactive fiction game, so if you don’t like lots of reading, steer clear.  The game is an adaption of the classic Jules Verne novel about consummate British gentleman Phileas Fogg and his wager to circumnavigate the world in 80 Days, and does its own spin on it by adding steampunk. Now steampunk is usually squandered into just being greasy nerds covering themselves in gears and talking in bad British accents instead of actually exploring the punk part of the term, but 80 Days uses the trappings very effectively, adding on to the feelings of wonder and adventure as well as actually exploring the social and economic impact of such inventions like dealing with how they interact with the ills of the Victorian Era, but also the hope for a brighter future such innovations could bring as well. The world of 80 Days is also an interesting a mix of real history such as France still recovering from their humiliating defeat in the Franco-Prussian War that led to the unification of Germany and alt history such as the Zulu being a rising world power that successfully repelled British invasion. You play as Fogg’s valet, Jean Passepartout, and gameplay is strategizing your money and supplies as well as making choices to learn more about possible routes, win people to your side, and improve relations with Fogg, among other things. This game is dense as hell and there are so many places to go and people to meet on your journey that you will definitely miss out on a lot in just one playthrough.\n\nOverall it’s a really engaging experience and to just give a more detailed example, in my first playthrough I took a northern route cutting through the Baltic and going overland through Russia. Hijinks along the way included getting caught in a battle between Communist rebels and the Czar’s mech-pilot soldiers in St. Petersburg, getting chucked off the Siberian Express in the ♥♥♥-end of Siberia after inadvertently deep sixing a young romance, getting waylaid to Beijing and seeing a Chinese opera performed by robots, delivering the captain’s baby on a boat from Honolulu to San Fran and running into a gang of Chicago hooligans that lifted houses off their foundations with their machines if they didn’t get paid protection money. With less than a week left and finding myself in New York, I sold all our stuff to take a rocket sub to Iceland, and after that finally made the worldwide journey back to London…82 days later.\n\nBut in the end it didn’t feel like a failure, it kind of felt like a fitting ending. Fogg and Passepartout didn’t make it, but close enough to still make it impressive, and their whole journey was a grand adventure and the two became close friends by the end of it. My two subsequent playthroughs were much more successful and were unique adventures of their own, such as solving a murder and going down the Amazon. And that’s what 80 Days really succeeds at and deserves the praise it’s gotten, really making you feel you went on an adventure. In conclusion, 80 Days is a fantastic adventure game and a must play.","December 30, 2015","true","20.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/381780/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","There's something to be said for the increasing number of remasters on the market these days. I'm not a particularly big fan of them, but if they are being made, they must be selling. It's quite peculiar, though, to see a video game straddle different forms of media, to re-tell Jules Verne's classic tale of Phileas Fogg and his 80 day trip around the globe, and in a choose-your-own visual novel, no less! True, it isn't a direct re-telling, in fact it's almost entirely original material, bar the initial bet that sees Fogg traipse across the planet. But if 80 Days can rekindle my love for the written word, then I'm all for it.\n\nIf you've previously read Around The World in Eighty Days, you can pretty much forget everything you thought you knew about Fogg and his valet, Passepartout's, journey around the globe. While Fogg is still a stuffy, well to do type, and Passepartout attends to his every whim, the world around them is drastically different. The age of steam, gears and machinery has taken hold, and it's up to Fogg and Co to take advantage of it to arrive back in London before their 80 day deadline is up. A fortune awaits them if they can make it back in time, with bitter defeat and ridicule being the only other option - a fate worse than death!\n\nSetting off from London, they can travel to any of a large number of cities, all across the globe. There's very little in the way of restrictions to stop Fogg and Passepartout,well, aside from their bank balance.\n\nTheir journey is set against a beautifully-rendered interactive globe, with sprawling travel routes running like a circulatory system across the planet. Each city they visit has its own story, people, market and events. So whether you're in Paris sipping coffee in a cafe, or stealing heavy machinery with a mining crew in South America, each location feels unique, and most importantly, authentic - no mean feat considering the truly monumental scale of the game.\n\nBeing men of the world, Fogg and Passepartout bump into all kinds of characters. Sometimes, you'll get a great tip about places to visit or faster travel routes, other times, you might end up comatose in an opium den, only to end up on an airship going in the wrong direction. Mon Dieu!\n\nTraveling across the world isn't cheap, and whilst Fogg is a wealthy man, you'll still need to watch your expenses. Fortunately, you won't be shy of an opportunity to earn some coin. Marketplaces are a great spot to pick up trinkets, travel-appropriate clothing, and items that might be worth a bob or two in other parts of the world. Failing that, Passepartout can always dress up as a bearded lady in the circus.\n\nMoney affords Fogg and Passepartout comfort and luxury, but some routes may not be so accommodating, meaning traveling can impact their health. If you've managed to collect appropriate clothing sets for your journey, like scarves and hats, you can lessen the damage done., but some times you will be left with no option than to rest. You can keep Fogg in tip top shape by attending to his needs whilst you travel. It's amazing what a cup of tea and a tidy moustache can do! Just don't drink the local water.\n\nMake no mistake about it, 80 Days is a gorgeously detailed book, rich in detail, and with more than a few laughs thrown in for good measure. Developer, Inkle, has crafted a gamebook so lavish with descriptive language that its easy to become engrossed. It doesn't matter if you win the bet or not, so long as you enjoy the journey, and trust me, you will.\n\n80 Days is a wonderful re-imagination of Jules Verne's classic book "Around The World in 80 Days"\n\nhttp://criticalindiegamer.com/2015/10/around-the-world-in-80-days-or-so/","October 5, 2015","true","7.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

WHat it is is a re-imagining of sorts of Jules Vene's classic "Around the World in 80 Days". Your master, upon accpetance of a wager, intends on circling the globe in under 80 days. You are his Valet and are in charge of not only caring for you masters well being, but planning his route. Along your journey you will engage in buying and selling goods from various markets to balance your funds (and to make your journey easier at times!). Another key component to the gameplay is the conversations. You must explore and converse as much as possible in order to find and open up new routes to facilitate your journey. Then, you must pick and choose carefully which of these routes you will take. The entire game is built around the CYOA mechanic, as you read through the incredibly well written dialogue you must make choices as to which direction the story takes as well. All in all, the writing is superb and the art and sounds are very, very beautiful. It is no wonder that Time Magazine gave it Game of the Year status for 2014. THis is also available on mobile devices, but the Steam version is well worth it. 5/5 and easily worth $10.\n\nHappy Gaming!\n","January 2","true","9.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Along the way, you have opportunities to discover the lore of this world to learn more about its secrets and to occasionally unravel alternative travel routes. You can also leverage your inventory space in order to carry equipment that can make your journey easier, or instead carry valuables that fetch a higher price in a different city.\n\n80 Days is a game about balance. Balancing your budget with modes of transportation. Balancing your curiosity with the need to get moving. And balancing risk with reward. Danger is very real, whether its from mutinous crewmembers, pick pockets, or a nun on a mission to destroy all automatons, you’ll often have your hands full keeping distractions at bay.\n\nA worthy little game that comes with plenty of replay value, I highly recommend it to anyone who favors excellent storytelling wrapped in a neat, efficient gameplay package.\n","October 24, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

An interactive story full of possibility and adventure, it is truly a spectacle to behold. I only bought the game this afternoon and have already made two around the world trips!\n\nThe art style is cartoonish and fun, but the actual images are limited, it is the story which drives the game. It is left up to the imagination of the player to how things look and how things sound. This gives it many advantages over a traditional game in that it is much more immersive, I truly felt connected to this game, I truly felt I was Passepartout and the sense of wanderlust I experienced whilst playing this game was truly joyous. I really felt like I was in a sense visiting these places and it has encouraged me to continue my world travels myself, as I have only seen a fraction of the world this game shows! I can honestly say I have not been this immersed in this game in a long time.\n\nAside from the storyline, the gameplay is extremely fun. Though it may seem simplistic, this is the beauty of the game. On the surface of it all you do is click a few buttons, but the brilliant storyline and the very real urgency to circumnavigate the globe along with constant surprises through brilliant characters, disasters and mysterious places leave you excited and always hungry for more. I was never bored.\n\nI will certainly be attempting another round the world trip tomorrow!","November 18, 2015","true","21.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kattius/recommended/381780/","kattius","[nBn] Kat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kattius/","317 products in account","80 Days is a charming game where you must plan your journey to cross the world in 80 days (or less!), which is a lot harder than it might sound. You must juggle departure times, funds, and your luggagge if you hope to make it back to London in time to win the wager, and even when you think you've got the perfect route, accidents can happen occur along the way.\n\nI bought 80 Days as part of the Narrative Humble Bundle, so I didn't pay full price for it, but I think it's probably worth its retail price--there's a lot of replayability in this game, as you're never going to be able to visit every city AND make it back to London in time, so you have to prioritise different tasks in different playthroughs. But I think there's more than enough content, particularly as you get to choose different responses and thus provoke different outcomes to the situations you and Fogg find yourselves in.\n\nMy only complaint, really, is that the game will show you other players' progress as you're playing, which isn't particularly obtrusive but I found it kind of distracting, and I can't find a way to turn this off in the game settings.\n\nNonetheless, I fully recommend 80 Days! It's a lot of fun if you like choose-your-own adventure-style text games, and it's a lovely new take on Jules Verne's original novel, with a whole host of secondary characters. The game also feels very progressive in the right places--a lot of female characters, particularly women of colour, play prominent roles within the side stories in positions of power or academia, and there is at least one storyline where you, as a male character, can kiss another man.","June 3","true","5.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Zane/recommended/381780/","-Zane","Zane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Zane/","67 products in account","A very enjoyable game for me personally. You play as Passepartout, a valet of his master Fogg. The master waged a bet that he could travel the globe in 80 days or less, so off you go, travelling from city to city in a steampunk world, discovering new routes along the way and trying to figure out the most effecient route while managing your finances and hoping you won't get any obstacles on your way - which you surelly will get!\n\nIn the beginning I had the urge to finish my trip as quickly as possible - which is obviously the intention - but because of that I was more focussed on moving along and thus missed out on some exploration/background story in various cities which might have resulted in discovering better routes or learning more things. Luckily this game has a high replayability value since the world is randomly generated and has a lot of cities to visit and many routes to use. So my advice, don't go for a record run on the first try but rather enjoy the world a bit more, play relaxed and you'll gain more satisfaction from playing.\n\nThe pro's:\nStory rich world\nHigh replayability\nYou can see how other players did on their journey compared to you and which route they followed while you're travelling. It gives a positive sense of competition because you can see how far in front or behind you are from others by seeing the amounts of days travelled so far.\nNice art which suites the setting of the world\nThe Con's:\nSometimes background music doesn't loop fluently.\nWhen in conversation with characters while traveling/'on the road', their answers to some of your questions seem odd to me\nMy first travel summarisedI did my first run in 82 days which took me about 2.5h playtime. Knowing the replayability you can get your money out of this game easily. Started in london, took mainly the train through central Europe towards Moscow to then take the Siberian Express. I planned on using the train till Vladivostok but I heard only Military personnel was allowed there so I got off early. Encountered a group of Mongols and traveled through the mountains on horseback which wasn't really comfortable for master Fogg. Once arrived in a city in Central Asia I mainly took aireal rides in mechanical birds towards Japan to end up somewhere in the Pacific. There I took a titanic-like looking ship (which also had the posibility to submerge) towards the US. Due to a storm the ship had to divert to central America. We attempted a munity to regain control on that trip but failed miserably. From Central America we crossed through the Amazon on a large digging machine to the east coast. From there on we took an air ride towards Africa to then travel north back to London. Despite not succeeding in the 80 day deadline I was satisfied with the various little adventures that made up the big one.","October 15, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hannahbee157/recommended/381780/","hannahbee157","Sophie Frances","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hannahbee157/","386 products in account","80 Days is a video game based on Jules Verne's Around The World In Eighty Days. It tells the story of Phileas Fogg, who takes a bet to circle the world in 80 days, starting from London in October of 1872. You play as Passepartout, Fogg's new valet, who assists him on his journey. That is where the similarities end, though. The story takes place in an alternate history 1872, in a world full of fantastical technology such as automatons, underwater trains, flying machines, and even mechanical camels, but it's also very aware of contemporary political and cultural struggles.\n\nThe game part of this game comes in planning out your journey, trying to find the quickest path, managing your funds, and negotiating for lower ticket prices, seats on trains or zeppelins or submarines. BUT ALSO, you talk to people in the cities you travel to, witnessing or becoming part of the stories. For example, one path gets you involved in an Agatha Christie style murder mystery that you can try to solve. In my first game, I got arrested, organized a mutiny, accidentally blew up a boat, and lost a boxing match and still managed to get back to London JUST UNDER the time limit at 78 days.\n\nThe writing in this game is fantastic. It's a wonderful adventure, full of surprises and thrills and even heartbreak. Everywhere I went, I encountered people who touched the character's heart in unexpected ways. But I had to leave them behind, because the game is focused on the challenge. You're always moving forward, leaving things behind.\n\nAnd the game also explores themes of anti-colonialism, unique cultures and how varied the cultures of the world are, as well as celebrating a diverse cast of adventurers, inventors, and even criminals (in my game, I had a romantic tryst with a woman who was an internationally wanted thief and cardsharp). All manner of people are represented and from my admittedly white perspective, it represents the world cultures in a way that is not exoticized.\n\nThe world is realized so well. The beautiful art is simple and evocative. The historical events represented are all affected by the game's fantastic steampunk-ish world, and your characters are not the focus of the world, just participants in it.\n\nAt it's core, it's an incredibly complex choose-your-own-adventure story, with hundreds of branching paths and possible narratives. There are 170 cities in the world you can visit, and in a single playthrough, you might visit 20, and depending on your choices, you might only see one possible part of the stories present in that city. Discussing this game with my girlfriend, my mind began spiraling from the possibilities of this story. And all of these possibilities are elegantly tied together with the focus on your goal and your relationship with Fogg as you go on this journey together.\n\nThis is a wonderful, beautiful game, and I'm certainly not the first person to see this; it won Time Magazine's Game Of The Year in 2014, and it was even nominated for 4 BAFTA awards. I highly recommend it to anyone.","February 16","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was curious and wanted to try it, but the screenshots made me a little reluctant. Honestly going into it, I thought it was going to be a linear, pre-plotted course. I thought the decisions would be in the dialogue, where occasionally you might give advice regarding the next destination.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised. You get to choose the course entirely, also each time you play (or at least every time I've played) the seed changes. I'm not even sure what all that changes, all I know is I've plotted a different course every time I played and each time offered quite a different journey. This game is a lot of fun and really rich with adventure. I did not expect the replayability to be so high, but it truly is great. I've gone on four runs, so far.\n\nOn my first run, I was still familiarizing myself with the game and made some poor decisions. We were late, and made it back to London in 90 days (I got stuck in Africa, my only way out was an airship full of people mad at me for riding in on a slaver ship, I had to spend a week and a half begging for money to afford the venture). I was pleased to discover that even once you pass the 80 day mark, you still plot your way home as normal, there's no instant YOU LOSE screen or anything.\n\nOn my second run, armed with my new knowledge of how the game works, I pulled off a round-the-world trip in only 60 days! Huzzah!\n\nOn my third run, I believe was my trip north, I made it in 50 days. That was quite adventurous.\n\nMy most recent run I did not break my record or anything, it was 60-70 days and I took over a ship, beat a champion boxer, and came home with $10,000, and my peak during our trip was $17,000.

My computer kept freezing (although my computer is not the fastest). There are also a couple low-res textures. And for people like me, I just want this to be fixed ASAP. Other than that, it's a great game.\n\n9.24/10","October 4, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aniforprez/recommended/381780/","aniforprez","ani.for.prez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aniforprez/","322 products in account","At the time of writing this review, I have done a single trip around the world which took me about 2.7 hours.\n\nI'm VERY glad I didn't read a single review of this game but saw it rated very positively here which prompted me to get it in the latest Humble Bundle because most of the reviews are blatantly spoiling one of the best twists in the early stages of this game which blew my mind and which make this game VERY different from the Jules Verne affair which was fantastic in it's own right. This game does take heavy inspiration from the Jules Verne novel but adds it's own unique twist and spins a narrative around your actions that is VERY compelling.\n\nYou start as Passepartout, the valet of Phineas Fogg who has just made a wager where he must travel around the world in 80 days. As the valet, you must plan your travels across the major cities on the globe and ensure you meet the goal and win the bet for your master. You must decide upon your mode of transport from one city to the next, manage your finances, go to markets and buy and sell goods which will fetch you some profit with which to pay for passage to the next city. You will face many situations and forced to make choices along the way which shape the narrative of the game.\n\nWhat sets this game apart is it's one of the first games I have played which is narratively focused where your actions will ACTUALLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME. As enjoyable as the Walking Dead series by Telltale games is I never feel as if any of my choices leading up to the end ever mattered leaving me only with a binary choice of some meager description. This game is so refreshing in it's beautifully written world which changes as you make choices along the journey and in the cities you visit. The way you interact with people you talk to, the decisions you make, the items you buy, the paths you take, every single one of them shapes how your journey goes and whether you actually return to London, the city from where you begin this epic tale, on time to win the wager for Phineas. There are also so many references to the original which are done brilliantly yet subtly which I absolutely loved.\n\nFor all the praises I have been singing about this game, truly there is but one, though enormous, demerit to this game. One that would almost make me not recommend the game. For all this amazing story-telling along the way, what they give you at the end of the journey as a "journal" of your travels is so pathetically sparse and idiotic in it's presentation that I almost don't feel like playing it again. What happened to the grand tales of my fight on a train, my almost missing a boat, my meeting the owner of a freight company and other such amazing little tales? All they show you are logs of what happened and the date AND THAT'S IT!\n\nIf it weren't for the pure joy of seeing your journey unfold before your very eyes and the amazing number of branched paths that are possible and events that you may face which I very much look forward to finding, I would have completely stopped playing yet I find myself wanting more. I want to experience that thrill of exploring and finding people, nooks and crannies that show me new things along the way. And grudgingly, I will go through the game many more times and will surely forget the issues along the way because this game truly is a joy to play.","June 4","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/381780/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].\n“I have entered into the service of a new gentleman. It would seem he is a gambling man.” Orchestral music with a sense of urgency starts up as the globe begins to turn around its axis. Right off the bat, 80 Days gives out an intriguing vibe. The journey begins in London and, as everyone knows, follows the adventures of Phileas Fogg as he attempts to circumnavigate the world in 80 days. In this take of the Jules Verne classic novel Around the World in Eighty Days, Fogg takes a backseat to his French servant Passepartout. Players assume the role of the valet who is in charge of picking the route, handling the funds, baggage, and taking care of Fogg himself.\n\nThe game distances itself from its inspiration even further thanks to its setting. It is still set in the second half of the 19th century, but 80 Days boldly embraces a steampunk theme and an alternate take on history, which simply makes perfect sense. As you travel the world, you will discover strange means of transportation, automatons, and a mysterious guild of creators called the Artificers. There is something interesting to learn about each city, sometimes without ever even going there.\n\n80 Days is designed as a roguelike and it is intended to be played over and over again, discovering new routes, visiting new places, and experiencing a new story. 80 Days is quite an undertaking regarding the storytelling. There are massive amounts of text here with choices at every turn. Even though the choices primarily impact your experience, sometimes they also have more tangible repercussions. For example, your actions might get you imprisoned in Russia or your intended route might get drastically altered after a scuffle in the middle of the ocean. The most remarkable thing about this game is that each playthrough is totally unique thanks to this emergent method of storytelling. You never know what is going to happen next and where you will ultimately end up, which truly contributes so much to the game’s sense of discovery and wonder.\n\nThe writing is interesting and strong throughout. Each part of the trip consist of these lovely mini-stories with unusual and fascinating characters. However, there are also these separate conversations that you can engage in while travelling from point to point and they feel completely different. They are very poorly written and they simply feel completely unnatural. The main purpose of these conversations is to determine new routes and find out information regarding valuable items and trades.\n\nOutside of storyline choices, the gameplay revolves around managing all aspects of the voyage. As Passepartout, you will need to choose the best possible route, taking in mind the price and conditions of each trip. A cheap trip in a run down car or a shanty boat will take its toll on Fogg, lowering his health. He won’t die if his health gets depleted, but he won’t be able to travel any further until he recovers. You can tend to him during travels, or buy items that you can use in order to increase his health points. You can also buy outfit sets. Some sets will nullify negative health points while travelling by train, others will provide bonuses when riding on horseback. Outfits can also help negotiate faster departure times, so that you don’t have to be stuck somewhere for two or more days. Sleeping in hotels instead of the streets with homeless people and dogs will also help keep Fogg’s health up.\n\nGoing around the world costs money. There are several ways of earning enough of it to arrive in London on time. You can take out a loan in a bank, but you will have to wait for the money up to a week – depending on how much you want to withdraw. A more efficient way is to buy items along the way and then sell them in cities where they are worth much more. However, this approach may take you off your desired route. But it is actually this kind of unpredictability that is most appealing about 80 Days. It should be noted that you don’t really have to make it back to London in 80 days. You can just explore and go wherever you want. My first playthrough took over 100 days. You can play the game in any way you like. You can race the clock and try to beat your best time, or you can simply unwind and just take in the sights.\n\nEven though the game actually gets more interesting on repeated playthroughs as some additional routes and storylines open up, I have also experienced moments of boredom. Certain stretches just feel a bit laborious and dull. I also have to say that the interface is somewhat clunky, especially when you want to do several things in a hurry (visit the market, check your luggage) before your transport departs.\n\nThe game sports a clean art style that is pleasing to the eye. The music is also good, but there is not a lot of variety there. Overall, the production values provide a sufficient amount of atmosphere, but I was left with the impression that more could have been done to give each location a stronger sense of place. For a game that is all about travel and discovery, locations could have had more of an awe-inspiring impact from an audiovisual standpoint.\n\n80 Days is a unique and imaginative game that serves as an apt and worthy homage to its inspiration. It manages to bring so much of its own regarding the storytelling and world-building, and it competently mixes multiple styles of gameplay. This is one grand voyage you should not miss out on.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)","November 19, 2015","true","9.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is based off of the famous novel  Around the World in 80 Days  by Jules Verne. The game consists of travelling between cities and dealing with events that occurboth within the cities and between them.\n\nMost of the game occurs in a text based setting. You read a description of were you are, maybe a bit of dialogue, and you choose from one or more choices. Admittedly a one option choice isn't really a thing, but that's just nitpicking. The writing is clever and works well for the style. I highly recommend using accents for the people (especially if you don't know who they are yet. Gruff, English women are always good fun).\n\nThe game is procedurally created each time you play. That means a good amount of replay value.\n\nThe art style is simple and vivid. It isn't so elaborate that it pulls the eye away from the reading, while still having a good amount of character to it.\n\nOverall, this game is worthy of a recommendation for the price of $10.

The game places you in its narrative as the valet of Phileas Fogg, a gentleman adventurer propelled onward by a wager to circumnavigate the globe within the titular 80 day period. On this journey you will explore the world's cities as you chart your own course to make it back to London before the clock runs out, balancing Fogg's health and your monetary funds as you plot and trade your way across the world.\n\nAs 80 Days is essentially a text-based game (though it is dressed up quite a bit with an attractive interface and travel graphics reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies), its success lives or dies on the quality of its writing - and it manages to live quite large. The story woven in your character's journal is superbly written, and you find yourself heavily engaged as you decide the course your character will take and the way they react to events while exploring the game's cities and interacting with some of its characters.\n\nIt is a short game - easily playable in just a couple of hours depending on how well you do -, but features fantastic replayability. Though I'm not usually one to revisit a game like this, I'll certainly be going on another journey soon, as there's just so many different cities to visit, and you could easily play the game many different times before repeating a single step of your journey. Adding to this is that the game's parameters change as you play through on different starting seeds (there are 8, which you advance through in order with each subsequent playthrough), each slightly altering items available for trade, available travel routes and departure times, as well as introducing new elements to the game's story.\n\nIt's a cute little game that I thoroughly enjoyed - well worth the low price of its $10 entry.","November 24, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A literary classic told through fitting music, charming art that while simple never becomes boring and surprisingly deep and involving game mechanics. I was physically unable to stop my journey once it had first begun, and though much of it was played relatively safe there was still plenty of close shaves and action which made the entire experience one of the best adventures I've had in a game in recent memory. Sadly, I did not make the first trip in 80 days, in part due to poor planning but also from being marooned on a small island in the middle of the pacific ocean where Mr. Fogg almost left his senses. I am already excited to start my next playthrough, with so much of the world left to discover I believe it won't be the last one, either.\n\nIf I had to have one complaint, only one, it is that I felt like I experienced an abnormally high amount of female characters compared to male ones. From my start in London, over Paris, Copenhagen, into Russia and across the middle east, East-Asia to New Zealand and into the dark heart of Africa and back into Europe, the amount of male characters I encountered could be counted on one hand (and left me wondering where they all were. Replaced by automatons?). On one hand it was humours, given the game takes places in an (albeit fictional) period of time where women were not often seen in these very male-centric professions, on the other the almost total lack of male characters (and the game at one point describing a grizzled boiler-room engineer as a petite Indian women in a beautiful sari) took a little away from the overall immersion, and I had to wonder if it was intentional or if my route just happened to let me encounter every possible pilot, captain and engineer of the feminine persuasion. Either way, I guess I'll see if this changes on my further adventures.","November 27, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are the servant of a wealthy man who bet that he can make it around the world in 80 days, as the title suggests.\n\nAnd this world is really something.  The whole place is this incredibly realized steampunk alternate future where horses have been replaced by metal horses, and where pirates use airships to plunder over land.  I don't want to give anymore away, those are two early examples of the game's incredibly cool atmosphere.  Some if it is incredibly inventive, at least as someone who doesn't know much steampunk stuff.\n\nAnd the game is, as I said, quite punishing in a fair way.  You can miss an entire day just by missing the departure of your chosen method of travel.  If 3 different methods of transport leave at 1:00 PM and you're still clicking the option to get an extra bag on-board at 12:59, you'll miss the train/ship/car/railroad etc.  It's both frustrating and realistic, seeing as they won't wait around for you all day.\n\nThe game is about managing the options for your travel amid various circumstances which present themselves in the game's choose your own adventure texts.  You go through multiple stages of dialog which can improve your relationship with your master, or with strangers, and perhaps net you items or new information on how to travel to another destination.\n\nYou have to be wary of your master's health, which decreases over arduous journeys, or he'll die.  You can buy gear which aids traveling over the stressful paths, like desert clothes or storm gear for oceanliners.  Be sure to get items from various cities to sell elsewhere, too, so you can afford transport costs.  There's lots of really funny, interesting things that happen and I've only gotten to day 70 on my first try (I had to restart because I screwed up).  There's an entire northern half of Europe, both North and South America which I've yet to even step foot in.\n\nYou really should get this game, and hopefully many more games like this come about in the future.  It's got great music, the writing is easy to read and not overly wordy (unlike lots of games which bombard you with text and then claim to have "great writing," such as something like Pillars of Eternity).  Even the globe of the game has a color scheme which reinforces the theme.  All the art is very pretty to look at also.\n\nJust an absolute joy to play the game.  The myriad of choice supports multiple playthroughs, though you will doubtless run into some scenarios twice.  You can handle these differently to see what the outcome is though.  The game also reacts to your path and the number of days you have left in a way which seems really impressive; my master was not pleased when I decided to go west after heading northeast because it went against our progress, even though it meant we'd be able to do this quest and get tons of money while boarding the trains more to the south.\n\nDefinitely get this game if you like choose your own adventure style games, and this is a really cool introduction to the genre for people who don't normally play this kind of thing.","December 28, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Isarii/recommended/381780/","Isarii","Isarii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Isarii/","98 products in account","80 Days is essentially a choose your own adventure story inspired by the Jules Verne novel Around the World in 80 Days, set in a steampunk Victorian world with mechanical automatons, airships, a walking city, and further fantastical marvels. The game places you in its narrative as the valet of Phileas Fogg, a gentleman adventurer propelled onward by a wager to circumnavigate the globe within the titular 80 day period. On this journey you will explore the world's cities as you chart your own course to make it back to London before the clock runs out, balancing Fogg's health and your monetary funds as you plot and trade your way across the world.\n\nAs 80 Days is essentially a text-based game (though it is dressed up quite a bit with an attractive interface and travel graphics reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies), its success lives or dies on the quality of its writing - and it manages to live quite large. The story woven in your character's journal is superbly written, and you find yourself heavily engaged as you decide the course your character will take and the way they react to events while exploring the game's cities and interacting with some of its characters.\n\nIt is a short game - easily playable in just a couple of hours depending on how well you do -, but features fantastic replayability. Though I'm not usually one to revisit a game like this, I'll certainly be going on another journey soon, as there's just so many different cities to visit, and you could easily play the game many different times before repeating a single step of your journey. Adding to this is that the game's parameters change as you play through on different starting seeds (there are 8, which you advance through in order with each subsequent playthrough), each slightly altering items available for trade, available travel routes and departure times, as well as introducing new elements to the game's story.\n\nIt's a cute little game that I thoroughly enjoyed - well worth the low price of its $10 entry.","November 24, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A literary classic told through fitting music, charming art that while simple never becomes boring and surprisingly deep and involving game mechanics. I was physically unable to stop my journey once it had first begun, and though much of it was played relatively safe there was still plenty of close shaves and action which made the entire experience one of the best adventures I've had in a game in recent memory. Sadly, I did not make the first trip in 80 days, in part due to poor planning but also from being marooned on a small island in the middle of the pacific ocean where Mr. Fogg almost left his senses. I am already excited to start my next playthrough, with so much of the world left to discover I believe it won't be the last one, either.\n\nIf I had to have one complaint, only one, it is that I felt like I experienced an abnormally high amount of female characters compared to male ones. From my start in London, over Paris, Copenhagen, into Russia and across the middle east, East-Asia to New Zealand and into the dark heart of Africa and back into Europe, the amount of male characters I encountered could be counted on one hand (and left me wondering where they all were. Replaced by automatons?). On one hand it was humours, given the game takes places in an (albeit fictional) period of time where women were not often seen in these very male-centric professions, on the other the almost total lack of male characters (and the game at one point describing a grizzled boiler-room engineer as a petite Indian women in a beautiful sari) took a little away from the overall immersion, and I had to wonder if it was intentional or if my route just happened to let me encounter every possible pilot, captain and engineer of the feminine persuasion. Either way, I guess I'll see if this changes on my further adventures.","November 27, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is quite the exception! 80 Days is a charming "choose your own story" type of game in which you take the role of a faithful valet in service to Phineas Fogg, an English gentleman. Fogg has taken a bet, in now so have you! Your goal is to circumnavigate the globe of an alternate history late 19th century world filled with steampunk creations in 80 days or less. I found discovering unique modes of transportation to be an ingenius plot advancement device and I never knew what might come at the next stop. I'd like nothing more than to describe just a few of these fictional vehicles, yet to do so would ruin that sense of discovery that I've enjoyed so far.\n\nSo, aside from managing your master and deciding on your route, you must also balance your books and ensure you have funds to spare. Much of this is done by buying and selling for profit. This is all quite transparent and easy to understand. That is a boon to this title! Simplicity and ease is one of the greatest selling points of 80 Days and I would even recommend it to those who don't regularly play PC games.\n\nI highly recommend this title to just about anyone. Whether it is the exploration, excellent writing and plot or the challenge of the unknown and a strict timetable, this title will not disappoint. That being said, do not expect to win on the first play through. This is a game that is highly replayable, and I would even say that it is a necessity.

Having completed a trip a few times on Android I wanted to give it a go on Windows for the achievements and the comfort of a bigger screen and a mouse.\n\n80 Days follows the story of the wealthy Phileas Fogg and his valet Passepartout. In the game you have to try to travel the world in eighty days (what a surprise!). How you do it is up to the player: will you try and brave the deserts of Arabi or take the long railway through the cold Russian lands? You can make a lot of decisions which make for a unique travel each time you play the game.\n\nWhen you find yourself in cities, you have multiple options to pass the time: find banks to transfer money from London, visit markets to buy and sell items to help funding the trip or to ease the harsh travelconditions. You can also explore each city to find new travel methods and interesting stories about the city you're in. Each city has a nice story, some longer than the others, which can really add something to the experience or the trip.\n\nWhen travelling stories will present themselves in which you can make choices what to do and what to say. These choices can really matter, so be careful what you choose. You can fall in love, get your airship boarded by pirates, strand at sea with no escape left; there's a lot to explore, discover and experience.\n\nThe world itself is very interesting. It's a futuristic steampunkish world with its own morals and codes. It's a world Jules Verne (the game is based upon his novel) has created and it's really amazing. The developers did a great way to shape the content to be a hommage to Verne.\n\n\nIs this game something for you? If you like cool storylines with a great interactive touch this is something for you. It has a little bit of strategic management into it with the markets and the items you can find there, but also how you will travel and if you can persuade people to help you in your endeavor to travel the world in eighty days.","December 22, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it has a simple format, no flash graphics,it really works.  Sound (on PC) adds great atmosphere and the single image for each town or journey are well crafted. I'm learning plenty of geography too.  I've played through at least 8 journeys, each one different from the previous.  Lots of different branches in the story, and puzzles to solve. A different choice of response can take you down a totally different path, opening and closing story options.\n\nMy only caution is, your character, Passepartout, has opportunities for romance with various people you meet along the way,  both male and female, which may be confronting for some people. You need to be flirtatious to open these storylines, so don't let this put you off an excellent game. But thinking of some of my friends with young children, they would not thank me for my recommendation without this caution.","January 16","true","71.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play the trusty valet/sidekick Passpartout, charged with getting your gentleman master Phileas Fogg safely around the planet on time and on budget, no matter what the world throws at you in terms of surprises. That said, some of the greatest adventures are not along the more direct or traditional Foggish route, and there are loads of little encounters with historical figures of the era as well, be they inventors, poets or adventurers. It can take a while to sort of the real people from the fictious ones.\n\nThe writing in this game is superb, and the many potential paths - some of which take a while to unlock or riddle out - offer great replay value. Going the same route won't likely be as appealing, as the story of each city or travel path is largely identical with each gameplay (there are factors that alter dialogue options, such as items in your inventory, past choices, and Passpartout's valeting skill) - but with the possible exception of Paris, you'll still have so much choice of where to go that this potential repeat has little consequence in your first few dozen playthroughs.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about the game is that you cannot pause the clock (if it's running - it stops whenever there is something to read). This can make you miss vital connections because you suddenly realize you have too many bags of luggage when you attempt to depart, and by the time you've thrown surplus items away, the ship has sailed without you. Quite vexing, if you paid the captain thousands of pounds the night before to sail a few days early. :-p\n\nYou do not want to be a packrat in this game; travel light - the world is large and is begging to be explored. If you enjoy a good read and adventure, 80 Days will not disappoint - be it this game or the novel it is based on.","January 17","true","51.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fairly short game if you're just trying to make the 80 day limit, but there's a lot to see and do at every stop and on every transport. I already see myself sinking a ton of time into this one just to see what new things I can do and discover with each playthrough. The steampunk setting is really interesting and the text-based descriptions are incredibly vivid and almost make you forget it's text-based. My only real complaint is the unskippable opening credits. I'd really prefer to not have to sit through them every time I start up the game.\n\nUPDATE, having explored a bit more in this game: I need to reiterate that the setting is absolutely fantastic. Every place you visit and every vehicle you take is fully realized with a rich backstory to discover. In one of my recent playthroughs I just kept going north until I hit the North Pole, and even fell in love along the way (so far the second same-sex romance option I've discovered - another point in this game's favor). I still haven't explored most of South America, Australia, or Africa yet, and I can't wait for my next playthrough to see what else this game has in store for our friend Passepartout.","April 10","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's way more substantial than I expected going in, meaty in terms of story but also fanciful and whimsical at times. Plus, on my first playthrough I released an Indian rebel from British forces.  I also met a mechanical dragon, flew on the back of a giant eagle-mech, spent some ghastly time in a Russian jail, and got delayed on a ship where I led a failed mutiny.\n\nI definitely lost some time in the beginning due to not understanding the mechanics at first (time passes while you are trading in market, etc.), but just barely made it around the world in 80 days, with the kind of nail-biting, edge of your seat decision-making that feels like a great accomplishment in the end.\n\nThere is only one save file, similar to the Banner Saga, which auto-saves after events.  It is not as lenient as Banner Saga, and does not allow manual saves.\n\nPlayers need to manage money, and can turn a tidy profit through trading.  Players must also manage the health of the English gentlemen who they serve as a valet, and can roleplay either a friendly or hostile relationship with him.\n\nRecommended for readers of Jules Verne, Italo Calvino, and fans of the Banner Saga series.","May 17","true","29.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't mean too, Having just installed it, I'd planned a quick look before I went to bed, then I started my journey...\n\nFor a game that is mostly just text, with a smattering of route planning and luggage management, it conjures up a wealth of vivid images in my head. Just like a good book in fact, only it's you (in the guise of Passepartout) in the book. It is a completely unique experience, I'd never come across a game that engaged me in that way before. At no point in the journey did I want to stop, even though a part of my brain began nagging at me that dawn was breaking.\n\nI nearly died twice, once in an airship crash and then again when I had a bit of a run in with some slavers.\n\nThen there was the incident at the market in Lisbon. In some ways I don't like to mention it. It was a heart-stopping moment of my adventure. Less than 24 hours from London and my literally world collapsed. I found myself back on the desktop, the game had crashed! Were my 78 days of travelling going to end so ignominously? With a shaking hand I at last found the courage to click on the button that would bring things back to life. Perhaps, just perhaps, there'd be an autosave that meant I'd only have lost a day or two of my trip. In all my excitement it had certainly never occured to me to make any form of manual bookmark.\n\nI needn't have worried, the creators in their wisdom had tracked my progress right down to the moment I'd made the ill-advised visit to the market. I was back at the hotel, all my bags were where they should be and my master was waiting for me. In my relief, I abandoned any thought of making a last-minute deal in the markets of Lisbon and hurried aboard that last airship to London.\n\nSomehow I (or maybe that should be we) made it, with almost two days to spare and money in our pockets at that!","June 1","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want a game that will tell you amazing stories, this is it. It also does a fantastic job of making you feel like you're on a journey as you only see snipets of characters' lives before you are whisked away. The writing is superb and the simple presentation encourages your imagination to run wild.\n\nGameplay-wise it's very simple. It's most like a visual novel with some very simple time, inventory, and money management to push you along.\n\nRepresentation-wise this game is also fantastic. The world is a crazy steampunk Victorian era. Half the drivers, captains, and pilots as well as incidental characters are women. The racial diversity is also plentiful, as one would hope of a game about traveling around the world. Additionally, half the romance options are female and half are male.\nIf you're turned off by all this SJW crap, you should play the game anyway. It all works in service of building a unique and varied world that's not just entirely populated by white men with brown hair and giving you a sense of the rich tapestry of people that inhabit the entire world.\n\nOverall, you should absolutely pick this game up. It can get a bit repetitive as you repeat travel routes and stories multiple times, but it's not so much that it's a deal breaker. The game is also available on mobile devices, which perfectly suits the traveling nature of the game. I highly recommend you try it.","June 3","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's mystery and intrigue enough to fill every city with a worthy visit. Meanwhile you're focused on working within your time and monetary budgets to transport your dear Mr. Fogg across the globe as comfortably as possible.\n\nIn short, this game is easily worth the purchase price even if you only play it once. Amazingly, it also has an amazing amount of replay value and depth.\n\nThe interface feels a bit more touch focused, but easily handles  a mouse as well. The soundtrack and art are invigoratingly upbeat by comparison to doom and gloom.\n\nThis game suprised me at every turn with its depth and intensity of play even though you mainly just choose dialog options and map destinations. I eagerly look forward to my next playthrough.","June 2","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though I didn't make it in 80 days, every time I've gone through it this game has been an incomparable adventure.","June 5","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was never much interested in historical events but the game told me in such an impressive manner how cruesome yet deeply intriguing it can be. You almost feel the vehicles you are using throughout your journey and picking which way to go and what to do in certain cities and parts of your journy is absoulutely fascinating.\n\nI liked how you saw where other players were and what routes they took. Either making you feel comfortable if they are behind you or the other way around.\n\nI hope there will be similiar games like this one. The narrative style was just overwhelming!!\n\nThank you for that experience","June 6","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a collection of small choices that will ultimately determine success or failure. What ultimately made me enjoy this game after my first playthrough was the fact that I had won after giving in to failure. I only had 5 days to go and was only on my way to Atlanta, I had wasted too much time in Saudi Arabia and India, and because of that I did not have enough time to make it to London. However, transport through America moved quickly even after a steam boat blew up and cost me a couple days. I knew if I could get to New York that I would be able to get transport directly to London and could only pray that it would be fast enough. I made it to D.C. and immediately jumped onto the next transport to New York, luckily we didn't need to wait a day. Upon reachng New York the market was open but I was more concerned in ensuring that transport could be arranged to London quickly. The next airship was scheduled for two days, but some extra money in hand was enough to depart tomorrow at 3 pm. So we went to sleep at a hotel and awoke early to get to the airship, but oh no, I was $30 short of the ticket, and the market wasn't open, I can't believe I let this happen. I explored in hopes that the market would open with enough time to make the airship too. I quickly sold off some items and bought the ticket with an hour to spare, and we were off to london. As long as no unforseen issues come up then we will make it on time. So gladly we arrived on day 78 with more than enough time to spare, but I didn't relax until we had won the bet and finished the game.\nThe game balances time management, money, health, and relationship very well in a risk/reward game.","June 6","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An interactive-novel steampunk-inspired retelling of Jules Verne's novel. I cannot recommend this enough.","June 3","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
