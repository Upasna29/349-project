"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Achelon/recommended/318530/","Achelon","Achelon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Achelon/","433 products in account","After playing Wings of Vi for a good while I decided to do a proper review.\n\nDifficulty\nUsually I'd mention gameplay first, but I think the difficulty this presents will be the largest single deciding factor on whether you'll like it or not.\n\nWings of Vi is a very brutal experience, you'll likely find that the difficulty ramps up faster than you can learn the game, meaning you'll have to crank out repetitive grinding to overcome some areas, boss fights especially are showstoppers, as they're both tanky and spammy, so you'll need to dissect their patterns to nigh perfection if you want to progress. However Wings of Vi never pulls cheap shots, everything is approriately telegraphed so the amount of foresight required to beat obstacles is sparce, however if it's a laid back sunday platformer you're looking for, I'd look elsewhere.\n\nNote that the game does have difficulty settings: "easy" is a lot more gratious, but by no means any kind of autowin, Grynsoft has voiced an interest in trying to soften the experience on "easy" difficulty to accomodate a broader audience though, I'll update this review if any significant progress happens on that front.\n\nGameplay\nThe platforming elements of Wings of Vi are heavily vested in both precision, timing as well as resource management: Using the right actions, at the right spots and in the right amount. You'll mainly be working with two mechanics: Jumping and fluttering. Jumping is a familiar friend and it works as you'd expect, with the exception that a lot of obstacles will require you to drop off the edge and then jump to manuveur below a platforming section, midair jumps of this sort count towards the same charge as a ground jump does, so learning the distinction of when to use one or the other becomes a vital choice. The flutter works as a sort of midair glide with a slight amount of lift, which you'll want to use when you want a greater amount of horizontal (rather than vertical) traverse.\n\nWhile the platforming elements are mainly static, the combat feels somewhat more dynamic and RNG-based, where you have to learn the behaviour and patterns of enemies and react to them rather than use memorization. The boss fights have some RNG too, where which pattern (and subpattern) the boss cycles to is randomized, but the patterns themselves can be dissected and memorized in full, the boss fights are extremely engaging and fun, with a weighty feel of tension to them as you slowly and surely wear them down after having practiced the ordeal religiously.\n\nThe controls are extremely tight, midair control has a nice sweave to it, the flutter works as a counterstop, falling speed is light and feather-like, though the resource management part of the controls may feel unintuitive at first.\n\nStylistic Choices\nThe game has a very pleasant and vibrant aesthetic with sleek-lined and fluid spritework, the music has delightful chiptunes and groovy waltz, sometimes with a bit of an apocalyptic intermix, the sound work is meaty and gritty to accomodate the demonic side to the story and the dialogue is witty and charming.\n\nConclusion\nWings of Vi is a well-realized platformer, with tight controls, difficult but imaginative platforming and a pleasing style, it's a grand adventure through a variety of themes, a little quirky and self-ironic and shouldn't be missed by any platforming fan looking for a challenge, highly recommended.","December 4, 2014","true","66.9"," 116 of 120 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","116","120","0","0"

May remind you of the NES or SNES days.\n-Boobs.\n-Very Challenging gameplay.

For the most part if you die it feels like your fault.\n-Character customization.\n-Solid Dialogue. Interesting characters.\n-Game includes at least one cat pun.\n\nCons:\n-Game may be too hard for some. Even the "easy" mode may have you stuck on certain parts for over an hour. Not great if you're easily frustrated or just want to hear a good story. A casual mode of some kind would be nice.\n-Story is nothing special, but it get's the job done.\n-Not much dialogue.\n\nThis is a nice game overall, and would be a great fit for someone who wants a challenge. The graphics are nice, and the characters are engaging but you should definately know what you're getting into before buying. This game will most likely take you ages to complete, and if you're someone who's been known to break controllers this is probably not a good fit for you.","December 22, 2014","true","7.9"," 120 of 135 people (89%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","89","120","135","21","5"

(At least to me)\nYou basically have one or two jumps stored up, and every time you land on solid ground, those jumps come back.\nThis means you can jump in midair, and do many unusual maneuvers.\n\nThe combat isn't too great against normal enemies, but it shines on the boss battles, as you must dodge, figure out their patterns, and predict them accordingly, while attacking.\n\nTheir is a lot of progression in this game. It feels great to unlock a new ability, or even just a cosmetic item.\nI found it very pleasant that you can customize your character, Vi, with a myriad of options that you find in hidden areas.\nIt's a fun little distraction and adds a bit of re-playability and exploration to the game\n\nThe difficulty is the main thing that I would feel set most people off. Even though there is a "easy" mode, you will still be grinding the same sections and rooms and bosses over and over again just to progress forward. The mix of platforming and conbat work well, but even someone who considers themselves seasoned in old platform games will be taken off guard by this game. There are many gauntlets or boss battles you will see where the only thing you will be able to think is, "I'm supposed to do this? This is a joke right?!" But you will still have to accomplish the challenge by means of trial and error. If you are one to give up easily, or don't have much time to spend on games, you may not make it very far in this game.\n\nOverall, this game has wonderful sprite work and animation, good combat, decent story, great platforming, and insane difficulty, (Even on easy!)\n\nI still love this game. (Even though it'll probably give me a heart attack!)","January 3, 2015","true","18.8"," 85 of 87 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","85","87","5","0"

You will die. You will die over and over and over and over again. If you rage, I strongly recommend you do not play this game.\n\nThat being said, this game is amazing. The controls are tight, the game is well made (not including the problems at launch, which many many games have), and most of all, it is a ton of fun. The tech in this game is really solid. Sliding, jumping, ranged attacks, melee attacks, double jump, flutter, and much more. Honestly, this game not only does an amazing job with the tech introduced throughout the game, but it also is really good at giving "easy" obstacles to practice the new tech, and ramping up from there. I felt like every part I played in the game was possible. Nothing felt stupidly difficult, jsut really REALLY hard. There were a couple parts I was getting really salty on, but I managed to overcome them. I'm near the end of the game now, and even though I have lost to the same boss probably an upward 300 times, I am still enjoying myself each fight.\n\nAnd on top of all that? Completely unnecessary content in the form of character customization. This game has so much great platforming and numerous fun bosses, it feels like customization is something the game didn't even need, but it is very appreciatted. Sure, it probably isn't difficult to make these simple customizations (the cosmetic ones, of course), it still was something the game didn't even need to be amazing, it just makes the game that more amazing, and adds a lot of replayability in the form of returning to levels and collecting missed items and secrets.\n\nI give this game a 10/10. As an avid Boshy fan, I can say this game is even better then Boshy. Keep it up Solgryn, I'll continue to follow you through all your game development.\n\nTL;DR: If you don't rage, like difficult platforming/bosses, and like being a super kawaii angel, GET THIS GAME.","December 2, 2014","true","57.1"," 57 of 66 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","57","66","0","0"

I'm surprised how difficult actually. I expected a challenge, but not quite this much of one! - Don't take this as a complaint though.\n\nHowever, because the controls are quite tight, certainly much better than say the controls in Bunny Must Die, that it ends up being less frustrating despite actually being more difficult.  Not perfect, but very good.\n\nI only compare it to Bunny Must Die because in a way it's quite similar just without the Metroidvania.\n\nThis game is basically split into "sections" that you have to tackle and you don't really do much real backtracking in it.\n\nActually... that's my only complaint about this game. It seems almost 100% linear so far... more like Castlevana 1 than 2 for example. I think I would enjoy it a little bit more if it was more metroidvaniaish, or had alternate paths.\n\nRegardless, I certainly recommend this game to anyone who likes:\na) Very difficult platoformers with pretty damn tight controls\nb) Very difficult boss fights.\n\nThat is all, hope this review has been helpful to someone.","December 25, 2014","true","34.1"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","47","52","0","0"

It's a hard game with tight platforming. You will die, but every time you die, you get one step closer to the next checkpoint, and getting to the next checkpoint after a couple attempts is a great feeling. Being a precision platformer, it's not for everyone. You're going to need patience, and a lot of it. Previous experience in precise games is recommended, though not required.\n\nThe game throws new mechanics at you in a nice, relaxing pace, unlike how it makes you learn these new mechanics. Once you get a new mechanic, you're thrown right into a much more challenging platforming experience, requiring you to step your game up. The learning curve might be steep some places, but mastering it after a while gives you a sense of satisfaction.\n\nFor someone new to the whole "hard games scene", this is a great start. Even if it's one of the - if not the hardest game I've ever had the pleasure to play, it's a great experience. If you like challenging games, if you just want to try out something hard instead of one of the "hold right and press X once in a while to win" games, I'd go for Wings of Vi.","December 7, 2014","true","186.8"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","41","43","0","0"

This game certainly was an adventure!\n\nFirst I have to say the most important thing is that 95%+ of the population has not beat this game as of a couple months of this game being released. The game is extremely difficult even on Angel Mode (Easy) for a majority of players, and Mortal Mode (Regular) is much more difficult. Take into account this game was made by the person who made 'I wanna be the Boshy' which is known as one of the most notoriously difficult games to date.\n\nWith that said, this game is absolutely stunning.\n\n\nThe Controls are great, they are very responsive with both a keyboard and controller.\n\nThe Music is fantastic, I ended up buying the Album and I rarely buy music, Ashton Morris definitely put his heart and soul into his tracks.\n\nThe games length is quite long, and with the difficulty it will give you many of hours of fun (and agony). Every boss is very unique and most of them are very difficult so expect to die a lot until you get their attack patterns memorized.\n\nThere are quite a lot of secrets in the game which all give you garments your character can wear, also defeating bosses and getting achievements earn you them too. There are also several hidden weapons to find in the game, though are not needed to complete it.\n\nThe story is decent, nothing extremely special but I didnt jump into this game expecting a deep story but it gets the job done. Pretty much 'kill the bad guy save the world' kind of deal.\n\n\nHere are my bad experiences with the game.\n\nThere are a few parts in the game that will legitimately make you angry and want to quit unless you stay persistant and learn to perfect an obstacle until you get past it. There are a few parts that require perfect timing and execution so you will die hundreds of times on some parts of the game.\n\nAlso, the last boss is one of the most frustrating experiences I have had in a game in a very long time. Every other boss you progress further as you learn their move sets and for the most part are very enjoyable, but not the final boss. You will bash your face on it for a long time, nearly everyone I have spoken too will agree that it is not a very enjoyable encounter at all; to which many have quit and not finish the game.\n\n\nI seriously recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an extremely challenging platformer. If you do pick up Wings of Vi I truely hope you enjoy this game as much as I did!\n\nCheers!","January 10, 2015","true","72.7"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","34","36","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pleasedonothurtme/recommended/318530/","pleasedonothurtme","Lone Cannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pleasedonothurtme/","232 products in account","Now, before you go buying this game because some obscure Steam user recommended it, keep in mind this is not a full recommendation.\n\nThis game is hard. Really, really hard. Harder than Super Meat Boy (and harder than Dark Souls from what I've heard, although I have not played that game).\n\nThere's no way out of it. On the easiest mode, an experienced platform-player is likely to die over 2000 times just trying to get through the game at all.\n\nThis game is mostly fair in its difficulty. There are a few trial and error moments, particularly in the boss fights. However, it's not I Wanna Be the Guy style gameplay in which you have to memorize 40 different patterns to avoid dying. Rather, whenever you get hit by a trial and error moment, you'll simply say to yourself "Well, I probably would've died anyways, so I'll just keep that one thing in mind now." Respawning is instant, and there's even a button you can press to respawn at any time, so death isn't a big deal.\n\nSo yes, it's usually your fault if you die. Throughout the entire game, there were only a few moments when it wasn't my fault, and those weren't too bad.\n\nVi's attack is only really effective at short range, and she has a tall hitbox (though it's very narrow too). This makes the game hard, but not worse. Rather, it's just different. I've heard people complain about this, but there's no real issue with it. The game controls very well. My one issue is that sometimes hitboxes are misleading. For instance, the Ancient Constructs battle (8th boss of the game) makes it somewhat easy to accidentally touch one of the constructs.\n\nThe game sort of reminds me of Super Meat Boy in its platforming (at least on easy mode). In getting through obstacles, the main challenge comes in learning and practicing the obstacles to the point where you can do them precisely without issue. There are a lot of savepoints on easy mode (though not on the other modes), so for the most part, you'll only have to deal with one thing at a time.\n\nAs mentioned, easy mode is incredibly hard. Normal mode is even harder. Starting with it is not advisable unless you're very confident in your platforming abilities, or in your ability to not cry.\n\nThe game contains a lot of collectibles. You probably noticed the protagonist's appearance. It's like that for the entire game. You can make it more noticeable, or you can turn her into a hideous monster using weird unlocks. I did the latter, since I personally felt a little dirty playing the game leaving Vi as she is. Anyhow, getting collectibles is a nice feature for perfectionists. You're rewarded with them for beating bosses without getting hit a single time, or for finding secrets.\n\nThis game has great, fun, precise platforming. Vi has a few abilities (mainly revolving around jumping) that make it very interesting. Knowing when to use your different forms of jumps (and your slide ability) is important, and getting through a tough platforming section successfully will make you feel good about yourself.\n\nOne thing to note is that the game starts with a focus on combat, which is often criticized. Once you're good at the game, the combat is another positive point, as it's all about being able to effectively dodge and attack enemies and understand their patterns. However, the focus on combat goes away for most of the game after the initial sections. That is to say, don't be discouraged if you don't like the beginning of the game. You will get used to it eventually, and most of the game is epic bossfights and tight platforming anyways.\n\nOn a sidenote, the game's story is terrible. That's all there is to say about it. You can just skip all of it by spamming the escape key, so I wouldn't worry about it. Oh wait, there is one thing to keep in mind about the story. Ruby (or is it Rubi? I can't be bothered to remember) is the worst person in history, and you can make her die by losing to the second boss and then waiting a few seconds on the game over screen. Have fun with that.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game to everyone. I only recommend it to anyone who is really good at platformers (I would consider beating Super Meat Boy a prerequisite for this game), someone who's a masochist, or both. To those people, I strongly recommend this game. To others, I strongly recommend you avoid this game. It's not for you. If you're not sure, try out the demo. Also, don't buy this game for boobs. You won't have time to focus on boobs, what with all the demons trying to kill you.","February 6, 2015","true","45.9"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","40","47","5","0"

Yes, this game has awesome bosses, combat with regular enemies, and some mild exploration, but 90% of your time with the title will be spent dying over and over to tricky precision-demanding jumping segments.\n\nTo post a review I had to either pick 'Recommended' or 'Not Recommended'.  I ultimately chose the latter, but not because I think Wings of Vi is a bad game.  It's pretty well designed for what it is, and there's a niche that will love it.  I just don't think it's something that will appeal to most gamers, even ones who think on paper that they want a challenge.  I've beaten Super Meat Boy, Rayman Origins, Spelunky and the harder levels in all the Mario games.  I love From Software's Souls games.  I'm not averse to difficult games, but I found Wings of Vi too much for me even on the easiest mode.   Maybe if I had played and loved extra-extra-hard games like I Wanna Be The Guy I'd feel differently.\n\nAs of writing this review I'm about halfway through it.  I'm certain I could beat it if I kept at it, but I don't know if I will.  I don't think I'm having enough fun.  It's more like a grind, and like I'm trying to force myself to like it more than I do.  When I beat a difficult part rather than feeling happy and accomplished I more often found myself thinking "Ugh, what will I have to do next?"  Once I decided I wasn't sure if I was going to continue or not I watched footage of the rest of the game to satisfy my curiosity about what I might miss.  I learned the second half is more of the same, for better and for worse, and that the parts I've played are enough to let me draw some opinions on the game.\n\nPLATFORMING\n\nThe game's levels are mainly a series of short, tough platforming challenges divded up by liberal checkpoints.  The areas are technically continuous, but since you'll usually have to retry each jumping bit several times before you pass it, they feel very segmented.\n\nFor most of the game your core platforming toolbox will consist of a Double Jump and a Flutter/Hover Jump, which you can do in any order before hitting the ground (e.g., Flutter, Jump, Jump; Jump, Flutter, Jump).  Later in the game you get some other movement abilities, but they're context specific.    Each platforming segment feels like a mini puzzle since you'll have to figure out the right order of actions to get through the obstacles ("Oh, so I've got to fall down, Flutter between the first set of spikes, then Double Jump through the other ones").  The game gets a lot of mileage out of that central set of moves and is able to keep throwing fresh and varied challenges at you.\n\nA big reason I didn't find the platforming as fun as I could have is that doesn't give you a lot of 'breathing room' or 'joy of movement'.  In a game like Super Meat Boy the levels have a clear path through them, but usually you have enough open space that there can be some flexibility and variation in how you jump and run past the obstacles.  Wings of Vi often has you leaping through narrow spike-filled corridors  that aren't much wider than your character, or over pits that you barely have enough ability to clear.  If you don't execute your two jumps and a flutter exactly how the game wants you to then you'll die as you graze your head or toe on some spikes or fall into the abyss.  Speedrunning is less about finding the ideal, skillful way through a level then just being able to pull off the one right solution on your first try.\n\nThe jumping controls are tight and responsive, but your character still moves in a fairly clunky way.  Super Meat Boy is fun to control for his own sake.  He can go fast, jump really far, alter his direction in mid air, and jump off or slide up walls.  Once you master the controls you can zoom through the levels and feel like a badass.  Vi runs slowly and all she can do are the already-mentioned standard short jumps and a hover.\n\nThe platforming challenge is fair for the most part.  It's tough, but if you die it's usually your fault.  There are a few semi-cheap bits where you'll have to jump blind between screens, or get hurt upon entering a new room, but they're easy enough to handle.  A few obstacles have overly large hitboxes.  Some platforming bits require you to dodge enemy projectiles, but the timing of the shots isn't always consistent between retries.\n\n\nCOMBAT\n\nYour character has a melee weapon that soon gains the ability to fire projectiles when your enemies are farther away.  There are several hidden weapons you can find, but they're just slight variations on your starting one.\n\nCombat against the game's bosses is excellent.  They're all really well-designed and just challenging enough.  They're the highlight of the game for me, and I often found myself seeing the platforming as something I had to put up with in between the bosses.\n\nCombat against regular enemies doesn't feel as well designed.  For one, it feels pretty inconsequential.  Often you'll be fine with playing sloppily and taking some hits on them because another checkpoint is never far away, and who cares if you have a little less health when you're probably going to die soon on a platforming bit anyway?  Many enemies just quickly fly straight at you and can't be hitstunned, and you'll find yourself mashing the attack button to kill them when they get in range, taking a hit in the process.  Your weapon has flashy effects which often keep you from seeing what's going on.  They especially hinder you from spotting small proectiles.\n\n\nEXPLORATION\n\nWings of Vi isn't a Metroidvania title, though I've read it being referred as one once or twice.  Progression through the game is linear, with one spot where you can choose which order to do two levels in, and a few places where you can pick in what order you want to tackle the small branches of an area.  There are lots of, mostly cosmetic, secret items to collect, but they're all found just off the main path.  There's an item that lets you re-visit previous areas, but when you do so you can only use the moves you had at the time.   There are only one or two spots in the game where you can midly re-explore an old area once you've found a new movement power up.\n\nGRAPHICS AND VISUAL DESIGN\n\nI like the game's graphics.  They've got a simple, clean SNES quality to them.  I really like the visual design of the enemies and bosses.  The good guys all have an anime big-boobed angel thing going on.  That's not my style personally, but your mileage on that will vary.  I did find the ability to dress up your character to be a fun distraction.\n\nMUSIC\n\nSome of the tracks are really good and catchy, some are a bit forgettable.  No complaints.  The boss tracks do a good job of speeding up as the battle progresses to increase the tension.\n\nSTORY\n\nBarebones, but it gets the job done and is fine for a platformer.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nI heard this game had a ton of bugs soon after it launched.  I bought it a few months after that and didn't run into any gamebreaking issues.  I was still affected by a bug that prevented me from playing in fullscreen mode though.  Not a huge deal.  I'm sure that will be fixed in time.","February 6, 2015","false","11.2"," 59 of 81 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","59","81","2","0"

All it offers is an extremely challenging platformer with a little bit of combat involved. Like I said, it does this very well but it really depends if you like games like this or not. It is very very hard, and it will make you very very frustrated.\n\nWith all that being said, I did find the combat to be a little clunky, the way the attacks work and how you direct them just feels a bit... Off. In order to attack in a certain direction you must first have moved in that direction, and it makes no sense to move towards a a creature which damages you on contact... It takes a while to get used to and in honesty I still don't enjoy that much... The boss fights are awesome though so it's got that going for it which is nice.\n\nThe platforming in this game is incredible, there are many different mechanics that you need to get used to and as you progress through the game you are introduced to yet even more mechanics to get used to. This keeps the platforming fresh which, with a game like this; is an extremely good design choice.\n\nThe graphics are pretty basic in all honesty, they are just your typical SNES style 8-bit pixel art... It's really nothing special at this point and it's getting pretty old... Saying that though the animations of this game are amazing so it balances it out at an overall 'Good Graphics' remark.\n\nI'll repeat myself once again, this is extremely well made and is a great game, but you need to be sure this is absolutely the type of game you enjoy because - like I've already said - it's very very difficult and very very frustrating.\n\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","April 15, 2015","true","3.1"," 67 of 96 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","67","96","3","12"

I'd thought it would be a metroidvania style game and bought the tagline of "no arbitrary difficulty". It's a game meant for a very different playstyle, appealing to fast paced frustration bullet-hell games and platformers. If that's you're bag, then it's an easy recommend. But if it's a metroidvania style game or something akin to Cave Story, save yourself the cash and heartache.\n\nThat being said, I can't think of a game I wanted to like more than this one. The asthetic and art style were really captivating, but even on easy mode it was a god awful nightmare to play. Games like Dark Souls and Super Meat Boy are challenging but fair, but I didn't quite get that from WoV. It did feel artificially difficult and the level design and color pallet choices made it hard to tell what was and what wasn't a wall or ledge to fall through or pass through. It must appeal and do well for the gamers it aims at, I think I must have just gotten caught in the crossfire. Loved the style, but gameplay was frustrating to the point of being unplayable for me.\n\nMy only regret is that it was given to me as a gift, and I feel like my friends money was wasted thanks to my own lapse in judgement before looking over reviews and gameplay before adding this title to my wishlist.","January 1, 2015","false","2.1"," 71 of 104 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","71","104","0","0"

But it doesn't have cheap deaths!\n\nI'm playing on the Angel difficulty (easiest difficulty) and even so I'm raging so hard and even had to retry certain parts of the level well more than 50+ times, and I think I've only reached a quarter of the game! My friend who was watching me play at the time commented "I would never play this game, ever."\n\nYou play as the angel, Vi, and after screwing up and accidentally set a powerful demon free, it unleashes hell onto heaven and everywhere and you must fix everything back to normal.\n\nAs you progress you will unlock more and more actions that you can perform (double jump, hover, new attacks, etc.), and the game will test you to the very limit with your new actions. The more actions you unlock, the harder the game is. Some jumps looked IMPOSSIBLE but you have to be really precise with your jumps, hover and attacks, use your head and you will make the jump.\n\nThe controls are tight, responsive and precise, you really feel like you're controlling Vi's exact movements and that is a huge plus since the platforming difficulty in this game is unforgiving. If you fail, it is purely your fault. So keep practicing!\n\nThe game also rewards you for exploring! You'll unlock vanity items that you can use to customize Vi's appearance like hats, wings, tails, pets, outfits and such. They have no boost or benefit to Vi whatsoever, they're just vanity items. A really nice touch tho!\n\nFor people that loves HARD platforming challenges and 2D pixelated goodness, this game is for you!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sp1nz/recommended/318530/","sp1nz","sp1nz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sp1nz/","1721 products in account","Disclaimer: I beat the game on Mortal difficulty - it took 5000+ deaths and 30+ hours by in-game tracking and that's not counting couple uses of back-up saves, due to issues which should be ironed out by now but backing saves is definitely recommended for this game even if the game seems stable.\n\nThe Review\nThe game is a real treat for challenge seeking platformer fans. A few cheap shots and brainteasers are present, and you do have to die a lot to get better at many areas but in my opinion the action is very rewarding, well varied and accompanied by pleasing aesthetic and sound. The controls feel excellent but the protagonist's large hitbox might take some time to get used to.\n\nBoss fights are very fun and offer a good balance of offense and dodging to be beat but some of them might make you experience fits of rage after hundred(s) of deaths; you probably still appreciate their design and the feeling of accomplishment you had after finally taking them out. Normal enemies do serve a purpose too and you usually have to learn how to fight each enemy type to progress.\n\nThe game gives you new major / minor abilities as the game progresses, so if you are dissatisfied with the original single jump you might want to keep going a bit further before judging the game for lacking movement options. The abilities are fun and you will have to get increasingly better at using them as the game progresses.\n\nThe fact that you have a health bar is also a nice thing as you are afforded to make some mistakes without taking the fun out of the game for a less elite player. It's still unlikely that you can easily breeze through the game even on Angel mode if challenge is not your usual cup of tea.\n\nThe story is run of the mill wishy washy stuff to work as a basis for the action and to give the heroine a motive - not that story is of great importance in a game like this but it does its job. Secrets are pretty fun as they provide minor exploration possibilities and you get to play dress up. The game (sans secrets) is pretty much linear but couple deviations do occur and maybe a place or two where you might wonder where to go next.\n\nThe price point is fair, if you are part of the supposed audience - people thinking they were getting a relaxed platformer might feel robbed though. The supposed audience will have their money's worth and then some because the game provides multiple difficulties and even modifiers that make the game even harder (if you so choose), so you can assume that only handful people in existence might beat the game with the hardest configuration possible. The amount of content in the game is more than sufficient and the challenge only elongates it.\n\nDon't expect the game to be coding perfection however; some bugs and glitches are more than possible and backing up saves is highly encouraged. The developers seem to be quite quick to act on reported issues though and may even fix saves if something goes horribly wrong, so that's another plus.\n\nIn closing: It's refreshing to play a game that doesn't guarantee your victory - you have to earn it.","December 10, 2014","true","56.1"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

Even the Angel Mode, the game's "easy" mode, is far from a casual experience. It's definitely not a game everyone will enjoy. If you are a fan of this genre, however, oh boy is this a treat. The game's incredible gameplay mechanics and level design are complemented by beautiful pixel art and a fantastic soundtrack.\n\nAlmost every level and every boss in the game is brilliantly designed to be challenging but fun and fair. Hardly ever is there a situation where you end up dying of random chance - death is frequent, but it's your own fault. This makes progression extremely satisfying, and every new checkpoint you reach feels like an achievement. The difficulty also curves up as you progress in the game, so that every new area and every new boss will force you to improve your skills and learn something new. The controls are tight and the combat system is satisfying.\n\nIn addition to the solid mechanics and brilliant level design there are also tons of secrets to find, more difficult modes to challenge yourself with and speedrun leaderboards where you can compare your performance with other players. The replay value is through the roof, but even if it wasn't, the experience of beating the game once is well worth buying it for.\n\nThere are some annoying glitches and lag issues that can affect gameplay in some cases, but for the most part the game runs fine. The developer is also a cool guy who listens to feedback, and he's already fixed a lot of things. Even with the occasional technical problems I would rate Wings of Vi a solid 9.5/10. It's already one of my favorite games of all time and I wholeheartedly recommend playing through this masterpiece at least once.","December 25, 2014","true","214.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","1"

This is a red flag already.\nThis game was made by Grynsoft, the same guy who made I Wanna Be the Boshy, a ridiculously difficult mod for the hardest game of all times, I Wanna Be the Guy.\nI hope you already know where I'm going with this. This isn't any platformer. This is, most likely, one of the top five hardest platformers ever made.\n\nAnd that's why it's so good.\n\nWings of Vi is a refreshing change, amongst a sea of mind-numbingly EASY games. And its the good kind of hard game - the kind that doesn't cheat. The rules are there, very clearly for the player. No save-zones that were traps all along, no pay-to-win DLC to beat a tough boss. Its you, the deathtrap-filled stage, and a massive boss at the end that will eat days of your time. But hour after hour of persistence, progress comes. Slowly, you git gud. And finally, the massive boss is defeated, and the hours of frustration reward you with happiness and pride. You won because you are skilled, and you are skilled because you are persistent. It feels good, and its a feeling I haven't felt in a long time with games.\n\nChallenging Platformer Isn't All of It, However\nThe story is simple, but enough to keep you going. You are Vi, an angel, on a journey to fix a mistake you made that put the world at severe risk. Along the way, you'll defeat all sorts of bizarre, twisted demons and monstrosities, and meet other characters, which you can talk to and learn about the lore.\n\nIn addition to the platforming and story, there is also the exploration - Wings of Vi puts just a foot over the Metroidvania genre, rewarding the player that goes beyond the beaten path with secret chests. These chests contain unlockable cosmetic items for your character, that can be customized at any time.\n\nSo, the result is two parallel challenges at the same time: To finish the tremendously difficult campaign, and to get 100% exploration and acquire all the customization pieces. The collection of unlockable pieces is quite big, and after some time it begins feeling like a dress-up game - on top of the platforming and exploration.\n\nI am very impressed with Wings of Vi, being one of my best purchases in the last Summer Sale, and I must say that I recommend it. Its an obscure indie game, and its tough as nails, but I feel its definitely worth it.\n","June 28, 2015","true","48.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinBrett/recommended/318530/","JustinBrett","Justin_Brett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinBrett/","786 products in account","So one of the selling points for this game is that it rewards skill and doesn't punish the player arbitrarily. Another is that its made by the creator of an I Wanna be the Guy-style game. You might wonder if this might contradict the first, and unfortunately it sort of does.\n\nI haven't played I Wanna be the Boshy, but in this game at least the developer has done away with the gotcha moments of I Wanna be the Guy; what you see in the platforming segments is mostly what you get. Bosses do get extra moves later on in their fights, but that's reasonable, although there is a problem with it I'll get to in a bit.\n\nBut those of you who have played I Wanna be the Guy and other games like it know those moments aren't the only ways in which it was difficult. You often had to make precision jumps between spikes or other hazards which you wouldn't get the first or even fifth time, and sometimes under a time limit from another hazard. In that game this was helped by the Kid being a very small target.\n\nVi, meanwhile, is fairly large for a platforming protagonist compared to say, Meat Boy, and her hit box is quite big as a result. She's also feels clumsy to control in parts, with enemies often hitting you because there's no reliable method of avoiding them besides mashing attack to kill them before they damage you.\n\nThe game's certainly difficult, but the difficulty and skill it requires is mostly about figuring out what the developer expects you to do here. Generally each section only has one way of completing it, and you have to figure out what combination of Vi's abilities (as of this review, I have a double jump, a glide move, and a slide) will let you do that. I wouldn't mind ordinarily, but this game is stated to be inspired by Mega Man, Castlevania, and Cave Story, all of which allow the player a lot of experimentation and freedom for problem solving.\n\nI found the first two areas generally simple enough, but in the Grotto area the difficulty spikes massively, with a few areas nearly requiring pixel perfect movements to get past instant kill traps (of which the game has many), which often just barely clip you due to Vi's size. I'm on Mortal mode, and it doesn't really feel like 'Normal' difficulty, especially so early in the game. The easy mode isn't much help there either, since getting hit by a hazard in that will still send you back to the last checkpoint, just with some damage.\n\nI do like a lot of aspects to the game - customizing your character with stuff you get from achievements is a neat idea, and the game really shines during its boss battles, which are pretty well-designed so far. But I don't think it expects skill of its players in a reasonable manner. If you want a platformer with a female hero that does that, give They Bleed Pixels a try. But bottom line, if you don't like these kinds of games where your death count is guaranteed to go above a hundred, I'd probably give this one a pass.","January 9, 2015","false","16.2"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","33","50","0","2"

As the game progresses Vi gains more and more abilities that you have to master and combine to progress further into the game. Then she learns new abilities and the game becomes more complex.\n\nThe platforming is really challenging but since the controls are so tight, it's almost always the players fault when Vi dies. And she dies often. Extremely often. Specially in Boss battles. Those are all about pattern memorization, good RNG and muscle memory. All the good stuff.\n\nThe only complaint I am having is that the game sometimes starts lagging for 30 seconds or so in fullscreen mode. But that's probably an MMF2 issue and can't be fixed completely.\n\nI can fully recommend Wings of Vi to people who can chill and relax to challenging gameplay. ;)\n\nUpdate 18.12.2014: No framedrops in the past 15 hours of playing.

Being pixel perfect isn't good game design, its the lazy way to make your game diffacult.\n\nThier are still some bugs in the game that needs some fixing but nothing major though that needs to be done. The creator of this seems to be done with this game now.\n\nAs I said you have to be pixel perfect and with that comes a lot of trial and error. I managed to beat many diffacult games like the first ninja gaiden for NES, many of the touhou series and still had fun with it. I only beat half of this game and hating every bit shows thats something is wrong with this game.\n\nLazy game design all around. If you want it just for the cute angel girl you can find better games with cute characters. If you want to boost your ego by beating a game thats only diffaculty is poor game design then this is it.","May 10","false","39.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shishkebab09/recommended/318530/","shishkebab09","Dash Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shishkebab09/","133 products in account","Watch my VIDEO REVIEW here!  https://youtu.be/DMhcURH5rDo\n\nAfter watching the PAX Prime coverage of The Binding of Isaac Rebirth six months ago, I only recently was compelled to check out the host's Twitch stream, MANvsGAME.  I tuned in to him on his 1500th-or-so attempt to defeat "Supreme Jeh'Oul" in some game I had never heard of called Wings of Vi.  What I saw floored me.  The perfect pixel art and smooth animation with video-game-♥♥♥ presentation, the fast-paced action of a true boss battle, the kickass sound design matching the sound effects to the boss theme... I was blown away.  "What game IS this?" I said, "I see the name, but WHAT IS THIS GAME?"  I could only watch for a few minutes before I had to buy the game on Steam and play it for myself.\n\nTurns out, Wings of Vi was created by a fellow by the name of Solgryn.  He is well known for his insanely difficult parody game, I Wanna Be the Boshy, and appears to be an affable fellow who is very in-touch with the community.  In fact, he was actually tuned into MANvsGAME's stream at the time I was, watching MAN be slaughtered by his creation along with everyone else.  From my little research, Solgryn has created several small games, mostly parody games that garnered attention through insane difficulty paired with legitimately wonderful game design, and Wings of Vi appears to be his first official, original, on-Steam-shelves, pay-money-for-this game-♥♥♥ game.\n\nSo what IS Wings of Vi?  It's a side-scrolling action platformer.  It took me a long time to write that sentence, because I kept trying to add phrases like "simply put" or "basically" to try to somehow make "action" sound more actioney.  But no, that's what it's genre, so allow me to expand upon it.  This is an adventure game with light Metroidvania-type elements in that it's not entirely linear and you can return to old parts of the world at will.  It is a platformer with insanely nuanced controls, and it has tons of action-packed combat mixed with its platforming and kickass boss after kickass boss.\n\nBASICALLY...SIMPLY PUT... this is a capital V, capital G, mother ♥♥♥♥ing Video Game.\n\nThis is a rare case where I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this game.  Every part of it is second to none in quality, so let me hone in on a couple key things that particularly strike my fancy.\n\nGraphically, I enjoy pixel art quite a bit, but a lot of artists screw it up by rotating sprites smoothly on a high resolution.  The biggest offender to me is Hotline Miami, but even my beloved Binding of Isaac Rebirth pulls this from time to time.  I also dislike when sprites are stretched, causing pixel size not to be uniform.  Wings of Vi, on the other hand, practices rotating sprites, but keeps the pixel art's resolution intact, so it doesn't look out of place.  This is how pixel art looks best.  All pixels are the same size, and they don't rotate and de-align with the rest.  Nothing looks weirdly out-of-place or pasted on.  THANK YOU, WINGS OF VI!\n\nLet's talk about the controls.  I had a very strange experience because of this game.  This game's controls are so tight that after playing it for several hours, Rogue Legacy's controls felt sluggish by comparison.  Mafukin' ROGUE LEGACY, a game whos controls are universally applauded for how tight they are, feels slightly sluggish in comparison to Vi.  That is insane.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is incredible.  It is composed by Ashton Morris, and I've been listening to it non-stop during my work hours, over and over again.  There are four or five tracks I can't decide between as my favorite, and not a single one I'm even tempted to ever skip past.  At certain times where this game is most difficult, part of what drives me to press on is my desire just to hear the next song, similar to how I felt about Hotline Miami.\n\nThe overall presentation of the game I find fantastic as well.  I love the characters, the bright and varied color pallete, each boss having its own theme song... the pacing between platforming, combat, platforming and combat, boss battles, and story elements feels perfect.\n\nAnd to finish off my gush-fest, I gotta talk about where this game stands out most: the boss battles.  This game was clearly designed by someone who loves video games, and it stands out most during these parts.  Each boss is super unique in their look, has distinct attack and counter patterns that make them feel unique, I mentioned they have their own theme songs, they feel like they're part of the world even without having their backgrounds explained to you.  When you enter their arena, they're introduced by name in cool pixelated Gothic text, and a big health bar appears across the bottom.  Also, these aren't fake health bars.  You know those dumb bosses that run through and attack and then stay dizzied or stunned while you hit them down to a pre-designated amount of health?  None of that ♥♥♥♥ here, you have to figure out how you're going to dodge these attacks, and then figure out how you're going to deal damage WHILE you do that.  Chip away health points at a time until they're defeated.  This is how bosses are supposed to feel.  Each boss also has its own gimmick that makes them feel suuuper different and awesome, making each boss even more special, but I don't want to spoil any of them.\n\nThe only part of this game that isn't above and beyond is the story, which is understandable being from a single designer.  What I like about this, though, is that the story isn't trying to be anything more special than it's capable of.  It's not ending on a fade-out-to-gunshot or any dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that.  It's a simple set up where we accidentally let the bad guy loose, so let's go get him! It's short and to-the-point and that perfectly serves this type of game.  I also tend to like stories that heavily favor female characters and portray guys as drooling idiots...  I find it charming, and I'm not gonna pretend I don't like playing as extremely attractive female characters.\n\nIs that the note we're going to end on?  I guess so!  Let's sum this up!\n\nAs I mentioned before, there is really absolutely nothing negative to say about this game.  I would recommend this game to almost anyone.  If you enjoy video games, buy this game!!  Many people will be scared off by its notorious difficulty, but there is something to be said about that.  There are many gamers who prefer slower-moving games, or just a different type of game, and I mean no disrespect; Picross kicks ♥♥♥.  But this is one of those games that I would recommend even to you.  You might not be able to beat it, but it's so well-designed that you'll still enjoy it.  You'll still appreciate it, and jumping into the deep end may even expand your gaming horizons, making something like Dark Souls seem more managable.\n\nThis game earns a five out of five with flying colors.  I absolutely recommend it.  It is available on Steam for $15, and there is a demo available for free.  Check it out, you owe it to  yourself.  For being a gamer, you have earned the opportunity to enjoy one of the best experiences any medium of entertainment can offer.\n\nI love this game.","April 2, 2015","true","126.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","1"

The jump mechanic used in this game will you put you in danger for almost every intricate jump you need to do. Boss fights are trial and error as well as RNG you'll feel as though you're making no progress and I feel that none of these bosses could be beaten within your first 10 tries excluding the first. The difficulty curve is at a 90 degree angle and though I love hard games I absolutely hated almost every level and boss in this game. The music feels out of place in a lot of the areas, and is very forgettable there's only one track I can remember off the top of my head. The art is actually pretty unique and beautiful. The controls are ridiculous, because later on you will get new abilities one of which is a projectile which is mapped to the same key as your melee you need to be close to an enemy to use your melee but the distance is messed up in situations and you'll end up pulling out melee and attacking obstacles rather than enemies. Usually even with these types of games you feel some kind of rewarding feeling in beating a new boss or gauntlet for the next save. In my experience I felt no reward whatsoever. It also feels like the game wasn't tested properly as if bosses, enemies, obstacles, segments were just tweaked to make it worse on the player. The game is still constantly updated and it's mostly to make things even more unforgivingly difficult. Finally the Final Boss....I got it down to 1 HP after 22 hours of attempts it throws so many ridiculous brutal  unrelentless mechanics at you that to learn to even start fighting the boss you probably need about 5 hours of attempts or more. I can safely say I will no longer be buying games from this company as there are too many bugs, too many issues, every thing feels rushed and untested, and I was very disappointed with this game.","March 22, 2015","false","57.8"," 40 of 67 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","40","67","3","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinfulSorcerer/recommended/318530/","SinfulSorcerer","Sinful Sorcerer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinfulSorcerer/","631 products in account","This is an absolutely lovely game, and by far one of the best platformers I've played here on Steam. I'd even go as far as say it's one of the best platformers of recent times, up there with classics like Super Meat Boy. The reason I bring up Super Meat Boy is that, like that game, this game is also very difficult. As stated in the game's description "Wings of Vi is a challenging 2D platformer...", and it means it. Do not pick this game up expecting some walk in the park that you can simply breeze through. It takes quiet a while to get into the game's mechanics, mainly the drop-jumping and floating which you get a little later on. For me it took maybe 2 hours or so of platforming before I got anywhere near decent, and once I thought I had got aquainted with it, the game handed me another powerup and gave me a bunch of new challenges to overcome. It does a good job of showing you what you can and cannot do with said abilities, and does its best to ease you into it which it also does a decent job of. Some rooms may seem impossible at first, but if you experiment with which order you use your abilities in, be it dropping down from a ledge, then floating a bit and finishing it off with a doublejump, or maybe dashing at the start for some extra momentum and instead jumping early for some good height before you begin floating, it's really fun trying your way forward until you find that one combination which seems to work and perfecting it until you complete the task at hand and may continue onward.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous with beautifully drawn and well animated pixel art, an interesting array of characters and from what I've seen so far a fairly good set of enemies as well. The game also features massive bosses which may feel like yet another huge difficulty spike, and may get you stuck on them for a while, but never in such a way that it feels unfair. You simply need to try again and again until you figure out what to do and how to do it, and when you succeed it feels great!\n\nFor people who are accustomed to the platformers of today, this might seem like an impossible, cruel and downright idiotic experience. But to those who enjoy the challenge of older platformers, or those who simply are willing to give the game a chance and aren't too afraid of a challenge, I recommend this game whole heartedly. It has got what seems like quiet a lot of content, several difficulty modes, (Yes you can play on an equivalent of Easy, I have not tried it yet so I cannot say if it is still difficult but the option is there at least), Unlockable accessories which you can customize your heroine with; ranging from wings, hats and dresses to tails, glasses and hairstyles. (You can even unlock different companions who follow you around.)\n\nThe game is, so far at least, straightforward so it's not really a Metroidvania type game, but the upgrades you obtain help you progress in new and cool ways and help keep the game refreshing. Exploring a bit and jumping off where the game doesn't seem to lead you often awards you with a chest filled with collectibles. The devs weren't sure exaclty how long the game could be, which is understandable since it is a very skill focused game, and someone who learns fast and is a master at platforming will beat the game much faster than someone who takes a few tries to get it right (That's me), but somewhere around 20 hours could be expected. So far I am 5 hours in and only 20% complete from the looks of it, so seems pretty much spot on.\n\nThe game's soundtrack isn't extremely outstanding in my opinion, but it makes every stage feel different and keeps you going despite how frustrating some of the rooms can be at times. A few of the tracks are really nice to listen to by themselves as well, so I do hope the soundtrack makes it way to Steam. I would likely pick it up.\n\nIf you aren't afraid of a challenge, and feel you could fancy a bit of oldschool platforming, pick this game up! It is definitely worth the price and will likely be worth replaying more than once!","November 28, 2014","true","5.5"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

If you can't beat it on at least Mortal before giving up in frustration, your "hardcore" card is officially revoked.\n\nDon't let the angel boobs, gorgeous retro graphics, or lighthearted-yet-awesome soundtrack fool you. This is easily the most difficult game I've ever played, and yet it manages to still be fair while being ridiculously hard. I've seen piles of angry rants about how stupidly unfair this game is and how Solgryn needs to die in a fire or something for being a terrible developer... and yet there are plenty of speedrunners out there who can beat it with double-digit deaths or fewer.\n\nNo, this game isn't "cheap" or "unfair". You're just BAD. And you're going to stay bad until you bite the bullet and pick up that controller (trust me, you want a controller) and start grinding away at the cursed castle in the sky until you figure out how to navigate all the flying demons and mounted chompers that seem to exist solely to make your gaming life miserable, then manage to execute the precise series of jumps and flutters that will get you from point A to point B without being devoured.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is that this isn't one of those games that's nice to people who mess up. Sure, you can take a few hits from the enemies (even fewer on Demon mode), but fall into a chomper pit or black hole or even just jump-flutter instead of flutter-jump and you're instantly dead.\n\n(Unless you're playing on Angel mode. You wimp.)\n\nYou're probably used to games that only kill you if you do something seriously wrong. This isn't one of those games. Even the simplest of platforming errors will get you sent back to the nearest checkpoint, which become scarcer and scarcer the higher you crank the difficulty. Speaking of checkpoints, they do fully heal you, but only if you aren't tagging the same one you just tagged. No "move forward, kill an enemy, go back to heal, repeat" nonsense here.\n\nIf you can survive the dastardly gauntlet of jumps and flutters and flying demons long enough, you'll get to try your hand at one of the several boss battles this game has to offer. Bosses in this game are incredibly well-done. You'll employ the same grinding away until you learn the pattern, then grinding again until you manage to execute the moves you need to execute in order to survive the varied attacks and whittle the bosses' health down... and then you hit the 40% health mark and the boss gets angry and the next attack wrecks you. Back to square one!\n\nSome bosses are more focused on this repetitive grinding to defeat, whereas others are more RNG-based. The RNG ones are probably my least favorite, mainly because the sense of progress you get from learning the grindy bosses' patterns and seeing their health bars get lower and lower with each successive attempt isn't there when your progress on a boss is mainly determined by how long it takes for the boss to hit you with an unavoidable attack pattern... even though you'll quickly find that most unavoidable attack patterns stop being unavoidable as soon as you stop being BAD. Only a few truly unavoidable patterns exist in this game, and they're rare enough that if they do screw you over, you'll get another 10 tries or so at least before they happen again. Hopefully you'll beat the boss by then.\n\nThere isn't much of a story, but then again, this isn't exactly the kind of game you play for the story. It's the kind of story where you'll watch the cutscenes the first time through, go "oh, cool", then skip on every playthrough after the first.\n\nThe graphics are great. If you're a fan of the 16-bit style, you'll love Wings of Vi, and even if you aren't, you'll probably still be able to admit that its graphical presentation is of pretty good quality.\n\nThe soundtrack is done in the same 16-bit style as the graphics, and is equally impressive. You can buy the whole thing on the developer's website if you want, and IMO it's worth the purchase as far as video game OSTs go.\n\nOverall score: 9.5/10","June 12, 2015","true","37.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Do you enjoy spending multiple hours and hundreds of deaths on a single level or boss? Do you hate life and all it stands for?\n\nWell, you're in luck, because Wings of Vi is probably the best contender for the "Most infuriating game of the year 2014" award! I guarantee you'll be screaming obscenities at the screen and waking your neighbours when you pound the wall in anger multiple times throughout the game!\n\nThat said, the platforming and controls in Wings of Vi are great. The bosses are unique and creative, and the music is sweet. The developer of the game has also gone to great lengths to make the game as fair as possible, if you see a difficult platforming segment, you can rest assured that that's what you're gonna get. No unfair hazards like enemies suddenly popping in from offscreen, or that seemingly stationary objects like spikes or apples suddenly fly straight at you that the "IWBTG"-games are infamous for.\n\nSo yes, if you do enjoy challenging platformers, Wings of Vi is a very recommended buy from me.

As of this moment, I had to receive a save file from a developer twice to progress beyond points that were impossible in the current build of the game due to poorly thought out architecture in the game's "easy" mode known as Angel Mode.\n\nThe game, as of this moment is a bit crippled by launch day blues which, let's be honest, it can happen to the best of us. In it's current state, however, the game is completely unbeatable. That battle I'm on, as well as another one, seem to be impossible in their current states.

Well, the boss softlocks, and what I mean by that is upon defeating it it's collision box vanishes and no more damage can be done to it while it simply floats doing nothing.\n\nI tried several times defeating the boss in numerous ways, and none of them worked rendering it impossible for me to clear the game. While I'd like to say those are the only oversights, that's not true. I've run into other odd things like becoming stuck inside the architecture at numerous points in the game and, horrifyingly enough, an endless death loop that requires restarting the entire game to avoid.\n\nIn it's current state, even for fans of hardcore platformers tailored to make you tear your hair out, the game just isn't quite there. If you're truly into these style of games, I'd strongly suggest waiting a week or two for all the bugs and kinks to be patched out. On the other end of the spectrum, I can't recommend this for anyone that's looking for a fun nor fair challenge as even on the easiest difficulty, dying to 3-4 attacks from any given enemy is common, and many segments feel pinpoint pixel precise rather than offering new and exciting challenges for the player to tackle.\n\nAgain, the latter complaint is just my humble opinion, but coupled with the other issues that are occuring I'd advise staying away from this game, at least for a little while until all the kinks are hopefully worked out.\n\nEDIT: As of this moment, the bugs have indeed been fixed. A lot of optimizations have come into play, there are still some issues here and there. I have indeed finished since, however I still can't recommend the game on personal principles. Many of the complaints on design stand from a personal standpoint and my opinion stands that I personally wouldn't recommend this game. However, fans of pixel precision and spending hours gleefully hitting the R key will now find a lot to enjoy!","November 29, 2014","false","17.0"," 178 of 329 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","178","329","2","13"

Super Meat boy, Rogue Legacy, Dark Souls, and Castlevania 1 and 3 are some of my favorites of all times. I wouldn't say I'm an expert at hard games, because I always spend a lot of time dying, but I can enjoy the challenge enough to pull me through to the end if I feel that the challenge is fair.\n\nThat said, Wings of Vi was a disappointment for me. I beat the boss of the second world, but after that, there wasn't anything to keeping me motivated to continue playing. It's hard, but there's nothing satisfying about it. The difficulty seems to me like it comes from bad, or downright lazy design rather than an honest challenge.\n\nEnemies either drift randomly through walls where the player can't reach and shoot ranged attacks, or hurl themselves straight at the player, often in enclosed spaces where you have little room to maneuver.\n\nThe range of Vi's attack is just a little bit too short, and obscures what you're aiming at. Without the knock back that most games have, this leads to a lot of accidental bumping into the enemies. The hitboxes in general are awkward. It's difficult to hell how close to something you can get before being hurt, and with such a short attack, that's very important to understand. With all the options for customizing Vi's appearance, I'm surprised "no wings" isn't one of them. I know she's an angel, but you can turn the halo off, so why not the wings?\n\nPlatforming segments are bearable due to their short length, but require annoyingly precise movements. There were several times where I became stuck because I wasn't sure if it was even possible for me to make a particular jump, or if I had missed an upgrade I needed. Also, the background and foreground are often unclear, leading to a lot of confusing of what I can and can't pass through.\n\nBosses are definitely the high-point of the game. I fought three, and though they were each pretty creative, the problems with Vi's attack tarnished what would have otherwise been great fights for me.\n\nYou won't miss much by skipping this one.","December 31, 2014","false","3.2"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","21","34","0","0"

That's a pretty good description but there's quite a bit of combat, too. At first, you'll only be able to use a melee attack that has short range, but a wide attack radius. It's pretty easy to use and works well. Eventually you'll acquire a ranged attack as well. It uses the same button as the melee attack. The melee attack will activate automatically if there is an enemy in range, otherwise, you'll fire your ranged attack. At first I was skeptical of how well this would work, but it actually works very well, so I applaud the dev for doing a good job on this. The combat is relatively straightforward, you just need to hit things until they die, and not get hit yourself. Running into enemies hurts you, as usual. Obviously, combat can sometimes get more complicated when you fight bosses, but it never gets over-the-top convoluted. Speaking of the bosses, they're very unique. All of them are very different from each other and fun to fight (usually). Additionally, the intro to the boss is automatically skipped when you re-fight it, so you don't have to watch the same intro over and over again when you die over and over again. Another thing the dev did right is balancing hazards from enemies and the environment. In many games, such as the Mega Man games, the environment will often pose a much more serious threat to the player than enemies. Thankfully, they're balanced in Wings of Vi, so enemies are never a joke.\n\nAnother thing I liked in Wings of Vi was the amount of secrets to find. If you go out of your way to explore every nook and cranny, you can find treasure chests that contain items that you can use to customize Vi, the angel you play as. Most of the items seemed pretty distasteful to me, such as turning Vi's head into a giant eyeball or giving her a bony tail, but there were a few that seemed nice. The items don't actually change the way Vi controls; they're purely cosmetic alterations.\n\nThe music is nice as well. I particularly like the Amethyst and Dark Annihilator tracks. All of the tracks are at the very least decent, and the music is a real treat.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good things end.\n\nPixel perfect is no exaggeration in some parts. Don't get me wrong, I love hard games. I've beaten Spelunky the special, extra hard way at least 7 times, gotten golden god on Super Meat Boy, beaten Super Ghouls n Ghosts... the list goes on. But Wings of Vi, without a doubt, is the hardest game I've ever played; sometimes for the wrong reasons.\n\nAs said before, there's the pixel-perfect precision. The timing required for some jumps is ridiculous, and you may die hundreds of times just trying to clear one jump. There's only so many times I can smash my face against a brick wall before it stops being fun. Dedication is one thing but actually enjoying this is another.\n\n"But you can change the difficulty to an easier mode if you're having a hard time!"\n\nThis would be a valid argument, except there are still parts that require pixel perfect precision, even on easy mode. Easy mode makes checkpoints more frequent, and makes bosses have less health and attacks,  and adds platforms to some areas that require precise midair navigation. This is very appreciated, but it doesn't alleviate all of the issues, and some parts still require ridiculous precision.\n\nThis problem is compounded by the fact that the hit detection is wonky. If you're going to make a game that heavily relies on precision, then having wonky hit detection is an absolute no-no. One part requires you to wait until the absolute last moment to execute a jump over a hazard; too late and you'll touch spikes, too early and you'll  collide with an overhang. The thing is, Vi would sometimes be killed even if her sprite did not intersect the spikes' sprite. It would be very clear that she wouldn't be touching the sprites, because Vi freezes when she dies. Several parts requires you to do a mid-air dash past a one-hit-kill hazard. Quite often, Vi would dash past it, only to teleport backwards and have her death animation play over the hazard.  On one occasion I actually fell THROUGH a hazard and off the map. It's completely unacceptable.\n\nAnother problem with the platforming is that sometimes, the game doesn't respond to button input. This seems to be particularly bad with the action button; a button used for sliding, dashing, and fluttering. Probably about 1 out of 20 times I would try to do something like dash multiple times in a row it would flutter instead, or when I tried to flutter after dashing, it simply wouldn't do anything at all.\n\nThis is a little bit of a nitpick, but I found it to be annoying. One hazard will cause Vi's death animation to play directly over it; it's a sort of mouth in the ground that eats Vi. The thing is, if it's located at the edge of a platform, and you brush the side of the platform, you'll teleport on top of the mouth thing and die. Obviously this makes no sense, and should be changed.\n\nAnother thing I didn't like is the art style. Too many indie games adopt a pixel-art style. I don't have a huge problem with it, but I would prefer game developers to just add their art in normally. Better yet, add the option to use filters in the game.\n\nDespite the fact that the game is a 2D platformer with a pixel-art style, this game has performance issues. My PC isn't the best, it's just a FX8320 and a 260X, but it's at least decent, and should be more than enough to handle a game like this. But it isn't. The frame rate drops to as low as 15 FPS frequently in later areas. You shouldn't need an elite PC to play an indie game with a pixel-art style. The poor optimization is completely unacceptable. The developer did try to fix the frame rate issues- by breaking one of the big areas into several parts. But it still lags badly. Again, completely unacceptable.\n\nI think I've mentioned everything. At it's core, it's not a bad game. It doesn't require any major revamp, it just needs some polish. If the hit detection, button input, and optimization were fixed, I would definitely recommend this game. As it is now, though, I can't recommend it. Until further updates are released, I'd recommend you stay away.","May 23, 2015","false","27.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I absolutely loved the first 2/3 of the game. The graphics and controls are great (though this game made me realize how terrible the D-pad on 360 controllers is), the music is mostly good, and more importantly the gameplay is terrific. The platforming sections are all very challenging but fair, and to be honest really enjoyed the platforming segments all the way through to the final boss.\nHowever, the last 1/3 of the game was a huge disappointment due to the later bosses. Suddenly, the bosses become so challenging that you must not just be technically excellent at platforming and know their patterns well, but you must learn such extreme subtleties of boss location/movement prediction and also have a fair bit of luck that the experience suffers dramatically. I don't mind replaying a difficult boss for a few hours if the experience remains fun throughout and I feel I'm getting better and better with each try. But some of the last few bosses felt like an hour or so of learning the general patterns, and then another hour or more of boring repetition until I know exactly where they will be two steps ahead. It's no longer fun, but rather seems like an annoying chore.\n\nI'm conflicted leaving a negative review because if the latter third of the game had stayed similar to the first two-thirds, then this would have been one of my favorite games of all time! Instead, I will probably not replay it and the overall opinion was spoiled. As a disclaimer, I played through the game on "mortal" which is the normal difficulty. The latter third may be more enjoyable if played on the easiet difficulty.\n\nIf you are the type of person who doesn't mind leaving well enough alone and stopping a game once it's worn out, then maybe give this game a try and play until it's too frustrating. For most players though, I wouldn't recommend the game, as I think it's too niche and there are other difficult platformers out there that remain fun from start to end by being a bit more forgiving.","May 16","false","43.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I highly recommend downloading the demo version from the developer's website so you can try it out before commiting to the $15 price tag. That said, this is a perfect game if you want to be challenged. Even on the easiest difficulty setting, Wings of Vi is immensely challenging, and I can't even imagine trying to play it on the hardest setting... yet ;)\nIn Wings of Vi, you take control of an angel named Vi who must fight demons to rescue her friends and save the world. It's a simple and engaging plot, and it's very rewarding when you make it from one checkpoint to the next, and very frustrating while you're trying to get there. It's the kind of game you love to hate, similar to the old NES games like Contra, Castlevania, and any others where you die a lot. And yes, you will die A LOT.\n\nPros:\n-Great graphics\n-Rewarding gameplay\n-Interesting plot\n-Good controls, which are also customizable\n-Great soundtrack\n-Scantily clad angels\n-Fun customization options\n\nCons:\n-Very difficult (but this isn't really a con, considering it's intentional)\n\nThere is no multiplayer, but I personally don't think multiplayer would add anything to this game.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun game that's hard to put down. I played the demo several times before commiting to buy the game, as it's hard to bring myself to spend $15 on anything, but this one is definitely worth every penny. I especially enjoy the way this game incorporates achievements, as most of them will give you new items to customize Vi, such as new wings and outfits. Try the demo, and then buy this game and never put it down :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

If you're not a tryhard nerd or you need to ease into the game there's always a very forgiving easy mode called Angel Mode which will allow you to make more mistakes and have access to more checkpoints. But unless you're a softy you will probably go with the normal difficulty (or Mortal Mode) which will be really hard, but so very rewarding when you progress through the game. Then if you one day feel that the normal difficulty just doesn't cut it anymore, step it up a notch to Demon Mode. Just promise me you won't cry.\n\nAs a huge fan of platformers this is my game, I can play it over and over in order to try and improve my time on the leaderboard. There's also a variety of modifiers to make the game more interesting if you don't think just playing it the "plain old way" is fun anymore. You can speed the game up, make it so that a single hit kills you or even try and run the game in a single life.\n\nSo.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/luparax/recommended/318530/","luparax","Luparax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/luparax/","271 products in account","Alright. Let's try this.\nReview of Wings of Vi\nGeneral Info:\nI started the game today (as of the writing of this review) and am currently about three hours into the game. I am really glad my controller is worth more to me than my sanity, otherwise I would need a couple new controllers now. Someone hold my salt, my aquarium is ringing.\n\nThis game is the hardest and most infuriating game I have every played. That said, I actually enjoy it, to a certain degree. The controls feel nice and direct and are actually customizable for both keyboard and controller, the sound design is appropriate and ties in well with the game world and the pixel-y art style looks surprisingly good. A well animated, well designed platformer. So much for (game-) design choices.\n\nI may attempt a description of what the gameplay is actually like further down in the review, but it really comes down to whether you are a perfectionist or just looking for some relaxing platformer. So instead I will list a few things that I found make this game stick out from the crowd of platformer games.\n\nPros:\n+ Addicting straightforward gameplay. There is few "random" deaths. Everything you do feels earned and every deaths is something you as a played screwed up. The game actively challenges you to try harder.\n+ Sound design. I was not sure whether to put this under Pros or not, but it is really solid work and ties in well with the gameplay and game world.\n+ Art Style. I am a sucker for good pixel art and this is certainly one of the better ones.\n+Angel Boobs. Seriously, the only way the main Protagonist called "Vi" is walking straight is because she has wings to support herself. ;)\n+ Decent progression. Every couple of levels you get a new weapon or move. Every achievement gets you a new customization option for Vi.\n+ Customization. There are games calling themselves RPG that are featuring less. No boob sliders though. ;)\n+ Insanely hard difficulty. I enjoy the challenge.\n+ Customizable Controls. For a platformer like this an absolute must-have.\n\nNeither Pro nor Con:\n* Story. It gets the job done and that is honestly all I ask for in a platformer like this.\n* Same with dialog. Solid work, got a few chuckles out of me.\n\nCons:\n- Insanely hard difficulty and you can crank that up even higher. If you don't enjoy learning every single move of a boss battle to neigh perfection in order to beat him while dying repeatedly you will not have fun playing this game.\n- Frustration level: Over 9000. Again, I value my controllers more than my sanity or this would have been a very expensive game.\n- No pause. You can not pause the game. That is mostly okay since checkpoints are usually safe, but in levels where you start in an unsafe spot, that can get really annoying.\n- Prepare some object you can punch in case of the inevitable death. Try and keep your pets out of range while playing.\n- I spend about half and hour trying to find actual Cons apart from the difficulty level.\n\nAllergy warning: This product may contain traces of puns.\n\nSo, on to the question that has been burning on the tip of your tounge for the last minute:\n"Is this game actually worth 15 bucks?".\nIf you can relate to any of the folling statements, the answer to that question is "yes".\n"I enjoy hard challenges"\n"I want to play a platformer game that is not over after an hour"\n"I enjoy playing games to beat highscores"\n"I am a masochist"\n\nThe game is well made and I can imagine a developer actually putting enough resources into this game to justify 15 bucks, and the time I will spend with this game is long enough to justify that as well. It really just comes down to whether or not you will be playing this game or just put it aside after the first hundred deaths or so.\n\nDisclaimer: Neither me nor the game's developer are responsible for any physical or mental damage to you, your pets or people in your immediate vicinity. All grammatical mistakes you find in this text are subject to adoption.\n\nThis is Luparax, signing out.","March 30, 2015","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","1"

But not for most.  I have been playing platformers such as Megaman X, Battletoads and Super Meat Boy my entire life, and I think they are great.  I have also played I Wanna be the Guy.  This game is very much like the latter.\n\nVery much trial and error.  Life is often trivial, as mcuh of what I have seen of the game is based on one-hit kill spike platforming.  I love a good challenge and tend to think games that many call too hard, a bit too easy, particularly when it comes to side-scrollers, but I like a bit of variety and memorable sequences in the game, which I have not seen.\n\nThe combat in the game is minimal.  I will say that the boss fights are fun and intense.  The areas between the boss fights are not.\n\nLast of all, I really enjoy "Metroidvania" style games, which was a big attraction for me with this game.  Unfortunately, this isn't really how the game works.  There isn't much exploration.  You usually follow the direct platfrom path, sometimes taking leaps of faith to where you hope there is a platform, often making it impossible to return to previous areas.  Any secrets to reward exploration are cute items to change how your character looks (not interesting enough to keep me looking).\n\nOverall, it had some good ideas.  I think with significantly less emphasis precision, trial-and-error platforming and more focus on combat, this could be a great game.","April 7, 2015","false","1.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"

Make no mistake, Wings of Vi is a difficult game and it knows it, its precise platforming and intense (yet unique) boss battles being the main attraction here. There are three modes; Angel, Mortal and Demon. On your first time through the game, I would recommend Angel Mode as the game is very relentless, even in this mode. The platforming is top notch, and the controls feel smooth. The music is incredible, and ranges from peaceful sounding tracks to very intense, blood-pumping tracks. Regardless, each track perfectly fits the area that it plays in and you will quickly find yourself humming along to the memorable tracks. The boss battles are incredible, each one being completely unique, having unique abilities, and tough as nails attacks. The world is full of all sorts of secrets in this game, there being a ton of collectibles and extra weapons, should you know where to look.\n\nDespite the game being sold as a difficult platformer, however, I would not say there was even a single point - outside of purposely hard to get collectibles - where I felt actively angry at the game. Every time that I died, I felt like it was my fault and not some ridiculous difficulty mechanic. Very much a trial and error game, you WILL die until you learn how to complete a section. Nonetheless, it does not feel unfair.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who loves platformers, and to everyone who loves a good challenge. It is worth every second of your time.","January 12","true","31.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It instead teaches you, tutorialization through playing. Like, finding a gap, you cross it, find an enemy, learn its pattern, maybe die once or twice, beat it, then it throws both at you and forces you to react to the situation. Andso  the process continues. It's a rage game that prefers to teach you everything, then sit back and watch as you rage at your own incompetence.\n\nIt has its own quirks and unique power ups which it wastes no time making you use. You have to think quick and use all tools at your disposal. Overall, any deaths you have will always be your fault. The game will give you all of the knowledge and power you need to complete the game, it all relies on player skill - It even lets you customize your own controls.\n\nA great game with a good, distinct visual style.

It's lot like the latter-day Sonic games (you know, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones) in that regard. The scrolling is pretty janky too, with quite a few points where you have to leap off an edge of the screen to progress and hope it pans to something you can land on. Overall, level design just feels too busy for its own good; you're constantly dodging through one spiky helltrap after another without any relatively simple stretches to give you a breather, and believe me, that will wear on you. I, for one, have been playing video games too long to put up with that ♥♥♥♥ anymore.\n\nOne last thing, and I guess this goes out to indie developers in general: if you're not just crowing about it and actually do care about "balanced difficulty", consider swapping out your testers sometimes, assuming you have any besides yourself (in which case recruit family or friends, just anybody willing to suffer for you); someone who's played through a thumb-breaking, deathtrap-ridden hellfest a thousand times in debug mode is bound to lose perspective of how frustrating the experience really is for everyone else.","June 13, 2015","false","3.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

I don't suggest this game to the easilly frustrated, unpatient and the people who has the habbit of trowing the controlers everywhere.

The game is extremely well designed, and it very rarely seems "unfair", and is instead legitimately difficult. There are 3 difficulties: Angel (easy), Mortal (normal), Demon (Hard). The difficulties change how many save points are available, how much health and damage enemies/bosses do, as well as having more/less attacks, and nerfing/buffing enemy/boss attacks, so difficulty isn't just "you have to grind more", it legitimately changes the difficulty of the game, and is a big selling point. Angel is better for a more casual experience (if you have little experience with platformers), mortal is a bit tougher, and demon is extremely difficult, and i would only recommend it to experienced platformers. If you want a fun, albeit difficult, platformer then i highly recommend this game.","April 22, 2015","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Little did I know this would take a little longer than I thought, clocking in today at 4,038 deaths and just over 36 hours for my first playthrough on Mortal (normal) difficulty.\n\nKeep in mind that Wings of Vi is straight-up difficult and challenging all the way through, getting progressively harder and harder. If you're looking for something you can breeze through effortlessly on your first try in a few hours or so, you might need to prepare yourself for something a bit different. It's very rewarding if you stick with it, and getting that one step closer towards progressing through a level or almost killing a boss feels very rewarding.\n\nWings of Vi is pretty awesome in all aspects. The controls feel responsive with various mechanics being introduced to the player as they progress, often teaching the player to make use of these properly before throwing them into the deep end. The gameplay never becomes stale or uninteresting, level designs are each unique and challenging in different ways and you get a great sense of satisfaction when you finally down a boss or get past that one room that you've been stuck on for a while. The art is pretty impressive too with some crazy good boss designs, and the music and sound effects blend in with the world and mechanics really nicely, with the Terrestrial Vale BGM probably claiming my favourite music track in the game alongside a couple of the boss themes.\n\nIf you're a fan of platformers or generally really challenging games, give this a shot without hestitation. If you're not a fan of either of this, still give it a shot because it's just really damn good.","May 26, 2015","true","405.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

You start out with nothing but a wimpy attack and a single jump that can be executed at any time, on the ground or falling. You then gain more abilities as you progress through the game, and instead of getting easier as a result, the dev's use this to add continually harder sections. It has a very megaman feel in both difficulty and how it controls. Like megaman you're quite heavy and this took some getting used to as I generally play games like They Bleed Pixels which is very floaty. Some of the boss fights also have a cadance much like megaman boss fights, both in their timing and in memorizing their abilities. Unlike megaman though the bosses in Vi use their attacks randomly making each attempt different enough that you can't memorize the pattern of their attacks.\n\nThey also let you customize your appearance, which I'm a total sucker for. These are unlocked throughout the game either through story events or finding secret chests.\n\nDying is pretty painless aside from a solidly difficult checkpoint system. It doesn't respawn you automatically, but you can respawn at will with the press of a button. So while you have to quickly tap the button every time you die, there's no waiting around for death or respawn animations.\n\nThe devs are also really awesome. Back when they were having trouble with save corruptions, one of them added me on steam and gave me a new save file at the exact checkpoint I was at! Seriously good people.

Also, I don't like how large Vi's hitbox is, it is easy to tell where it is, i just don't like how tall it is.\n\nI personally like the level design, the music is wonderful, and really like everything except for the problems above. But, the no "easy" mode could be considered a feature, since instead of going through easy mode and getting used to the game, the game constantly throws you into obstacles that are really hard for you to get past, so you have to take a lot of tries, and when you finallly get to the next save point, it feels amazing. This game is also great to speedrun if you know the game and have played through it a few times.\n\nOverall, I would say this game is a great game to rage at while looking at nice art/graphics and listening to nice music.","April 8, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

You get to play as a cute, sexy angel on a mission to kill an evil demon, save the world, and collect all of the pieces you need to make the perfect outfit.  There is a system to save, name, and load outfits you make from different pieces, and you collect pieces by beating bosses, beating bosses without getting hit, and finding chests which are usually hidden and/or hard to get to.  The difficulty curve keeps me feeling accomplished whenever I make it to a checkpoint or beat a new boss.  Vi will also amuse people who like references whenever you find a chest with a sectet.  There are leaderboards for speedrunners and people who like to compete for the best score, but if you just want to play for fun you aren't pressured to be competitive.  The OST and aesthetic are also pretty nice.\n\nThe issues I have are pretty minor.  The bigger problem is a bug which sometimes allows the player to fall out of the world.  It doesn't happen very frequently and can be "fixed" by pressing the respawn key, but it is kinda annoying.  I also don't see much reason to switch from the default weapon in most cases.  Lust is good before you can shoot the orbs of purity, but everything but the default weapon feels weak or awkward after that.  And my most minor complaint is that I would really like to Have Fiola's dress.  I always liked how a blue dress looks with black cat ears.\n\nOverall, I would say this game is worth your time if you enjoy challenging platformers, interesting boss fights, and unlocking items to play dressup with the character you control.","May 15, 2015","true","64.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is very difficult right from the start but isn't really unfair, the use of movement abilities is thought out and the levels are designed accordingly. It has a decent variety of levels, mechanics and enemies that follow with them. Boss fights are intense and difficult in that you actually have to understand and learn the patterns to win. Also the ability to revist earlier parts of the game to pick up missed items is definitely a plus. The game also has three difficulty levels as well as modifiers that can effect how the game is played, A easy mode is available for people who might not want some frustrations of the difficult platforming and bosses. The soundtrack and artwork is pretty awesome as well.\n\n\nI would definitely recommend this as a fan of difficult platformers.","December 21, 2014","true","52.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There once was a man called GamerGuy500. He loved boshy, and found Wings of Vi, which became his peak interest. This is his story.\nI've played the alpha version and immediately fell in love with this game. Later played the older "beta" prototype, and it was quite the experience. I was very interested what went on behind the curtains and the whole development cycle.\nI tried what I have never tried to do before: make friends with a popular game developer.\nI failed. Badly. SOLGRYN PLS :C\nThat being said, I still like this game despite its butt-ripping difficulty while being kept motivated by the lovely art assets.\nIt's a game of hot angels and scary demons.\nToo bad I have a mac. So I had to download the game and run it through WineSkin to make it work with my mac. it runs great aside a few minor graphics bugs. Don't let that 5 hours on record fool you, I've been playing it outside steam on my mac for over 30 hours beyond that.\nI don't know what else to say about it. It has made me some good twitch highlights, laugh at the awesome references from secrets, question my existence, wake up everybody, and much more.\nSolgryn your game is broke good.","February 5, 2015","true","22.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","2","4","3","0"

It's unclear where you should be going at times and not in that "Cool, I'm exploring" kind of way. An early boss fight is revealed after falling into what seems like a bottomless pit. After another encounter, you have to backtrack without direction.\n\n- Controls are not refined. If you've played a number of platformers you know what a good jump feels like. Vi's jump feels like it falls short, even after you eventually unlock the double jump and float.\n\n- Levels are set up to do very precise and very specific moves. It's common to run into a scenario where if you fail to fall, then jump, and then float on pit X, you'll die. This is ok but it makes the game more about memorization than reaction.\n\n- Making the above complaint 10 times worse, the art is poor enough that it's not clear what you can and cannot pass through. This means trial and error because you thought something was in the background instead of blocking you as a wall (or falling to your death because you thought you could stand on something you could not).\n\n- Check points feel poorly placed. It's not fun to redo the same 12 jumps I had no problem with just to redo the jump I died on because I thought I could stand on something that turned out to be in the background.\n\n- Level design in general is poor. In one area, you literally Donkey Kong your way up the screen left, right, and then left again without any good reason other than clumbsily taking up screen space. As a result, the world is not engaging.\n\n- Combat is incredibly poor. Enemies do nothing to reflect that they've taken damage except pop out numbers and eventually die. In many places, it's ignorable altogether and others it's just a time waster. Worse, when you hit an invincible enemy a series of 0's and 1's pop out (suggesting that at least a little damage is taken) when in fact none is.\n\n- There's no back button for menus. You have to cycle through all the options until you hit the end of the list and select previous menu.\n\n- Progression is strictly linear. There's no level select or replaying levels to get a better score (there are a couple of secrets, but they are poor at best). If you don't like an area, you are stuck with it. If you do like an area, you can't really get anything for spending more time on it.\n\nSkip this game.  Play Super Meat Boy if you want challenge.  Play Rayman Legend if you want a good platforming experience.","April 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

As previous reviewers have stated it is about getting the exact right combo of jumps, not about building the skill needed to intuitively understand a course.\n\nThat combined with the fact that the monsters behaviour is rediculously RNG-dependant and that there is almost no way to avoid taking damage results in a lack of satisfaction upon completing a level. You don't so much feel you're getting better as that you were lucky to get it on that try. Super Meat Boy, Super Hexagon etc. were consistant in that you would understand the mechanics and get better. This is just about giving it enough tries and eventually succeeding.\n\nI don't recommend this game on the basis that there are better ways to spend your time, which include both a better story and more skill progression. In the end the game is rediculously short in content and it feels like the difficulty is there to mask the lack of polish rather than being a real selling point in and of itself.","July 10, 2015","false","1.8"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","1"

It's a hard game that's for sure, but two things about it are just enough to keep me interested in the difficult and frusterating gameplay. Female protagonist because that's always interesting (the female aesthetic can be appreciated if done respectfully) and unique theme and design. If there's a criticism to be had though it would be that it's a tad on the corny side with the almost adolescent design of Vi and the other "sexy women" featured here (jiggling anyone?) but I guess it can be overlooked as a toungue in cheek sort of thing. It's not like they are trying to hide it, but maybe the game could have benefited from a bit more creativity in the clothing department. Art's not perfect though so we have to take the ability of the developers into consideration and respect and appreciate what they have done with that.\n\nAnyway here are some key points for those of you looking to purchase it.\n\nDon't play it if you have problems with these gameplay points.\n\n1. Precise (and I do mean precise) manuevering is REQUIRED. Wasted movements will kill you. The controls are tight and fluid so it will likely never be the games fault that you died.\n\n2. Every part of the game is hard. You'll probably find yourself stuck just on the obstacles for awhile before getting the hang of it. Same thing goes for bosses.\n\n3. Some of the bosses have tells but they tend to be unpredictable; within reason sometimes and others not, this will depend on you.\n\n4. This game  isn't for casuals even if you play on easy mode. Be prepared to die a lot either way. You won't get by often by taking damage to complete a portion so don't expect to.\n\n5. Although the developers claim this games difficulty is skill based as opposed to creating arbitrary difficulty I would have to disagree if you're the type of person to struggle with timing and precision. It does get seemingly random and unfair at times but nothing at all really changes about the way things work. So if you are struggling it isn't likely from what I have observed that this is the games fault.\n\nIf you decide to purchase the game then good luck. It's interesting and rubs off on you immediately with a bit of patience. It's hard not to like Vi and her friends.\n","December 11, 2014","true","12.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a hard game that's for sure, but two things about it are just enough to keep me interested in the difficult and frusterating gameplay. Female protagonist because that's always interesting (the female aesthetic can be appreciated if done respectfully) and unique theme and design. If there's a criticism to be had though it would be that it's a tad on the corny side with the almost adolescent design of Vi and the other "sexy women" featured here (jiggling anyone?) but I guess it can be overlooked as a toungue in cheek sort of thing. It's not like they are trying to hide it, but maybe the game could have benefited from a bit more creativity in the clothing department. Art's not perfect though so we have to take the ability of the developers into consideration and respect and appreciate what they have done with that.\n\nAnyway here are some key points for those of you looking to purchase it.\n\nDon't play it if you have problems with these gameplay points.\n\n1. Precise (and I do mean precise) manuevering is REQUIRED. Wasted movements will kill you. The controls are tight and fluid so it will likely never be the games fault that you died.\n\n2. Every part of the game is hard. You'll probably find yourself stuck just on the obstacles for awhile before getting the hang of it. Same thing goes for bosses.\n\n3. Some of the bosses have tells but they tend to be unpredictable; within reason sometimes and others not, this will depend on you.\n\n4. This game  isn't for casuals even if you play on easy mode. Be prepared to die a lot either way. You won't get by often by taking damage to complete a portion so don't expect to.\n\n5. Although the developers claim this games difficulty is skill based as opposed to creating arbitrary difficulty I would have to disagree if you're the type of person to struggle with timing and precision. It does get seemingly random and unfair at times but nothing at all really changes about the way things work. So if you are struggling it isn't likely from what I have observed that this is the games fault.\n\nIf you decide to purchase the game then good luck. It's interesting and rubs off on you immediately with a bit of patience. It's hard not to like Vi and her friends.\n","December 11, 2014","true","12.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean, I started out with the regular difficulty, but ended up starting a new game in angel mode and I'm still dying 20,30,40 times to move to the next checkpoint. Definitely Megaman style alright. Not that there's an issue with that, but it's not necessarily my coup de foudre.\nThe only flaw in my opinion is this: despite what the description said, there ARE pixel perfect jumps. A lot of the time, I'm dying a lot just to get past one certain jump because you have to time your flutter just right.\nAll in all, good, but a little over the top.","December 11, 2014","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antroid/recommended/318530/","antroid","therealantroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antroid/","433 products in account","Note: the whole opinion is based on playing on the hardest difficulty, "demon mode". I believe that if a designer can't balance the hardest difficulty of his or her game right, they don't actually know how to make a good challenge, so I judge every game by how it plays on one of the hardest difficulty settings it offers.\n\n\n\nI can't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have a ton of free time and literally nothing else to do.\n\nThe game's store page says it's skill based. That's a humongous lie that makes people think that being good at this game is something to be proud of and strived for, when instead it's just a sign of how much time you wasted banging your head against a steel wall until the steel wall gave out. Which is why it's simply funny when people brag about just how difficult this game is, as if sheer difficulty automatically makes the game better.\n\nLet me explain. The challenge of the game is two-fold, different for combat (mostly bosses) and platforming.\n\nThe bosses have a set of moves which they choose from in a random way (with some patterns here and there), and the way to beat a boss is basically play against them enough so that you know how to dodge each move reliably, or maybe most of them, and executing it afterwards. It can be satisfying and I think the bosses might be the better part of the game (admittedly I haven't faced that many before quitting the game). There's maybe actually some skill involved because you do sometimes need to think quickly and react and adapt to what the boss is doing just because of the randomness and how it can sometimes give you arrangements you can't prepare for or predict.\n\nThe platforming is basically a puzzle game mixed with muscle memory training. You get a bunch of movement abilities and before anything you need to figure out exactly how to apply them to every obstacle. Some of them can be sort of interchanged sometimes but it's still precise as all hell, which means you just have to make yourself "feel" it: the correct timings of pressing all the buttons, etc. While better games rely on actual skill, maybe reaction time and quick thinking, this game makes you figure out and then memorize a sequence of inputs with ridiculous precision. Don't know about everyone else, but to me that's not what makes a challenge fun.\n\nI personally enjoy it when you can sort of "master" the game as a whole and then, hypothetically, if it threw more levels at you you wouldn't die even once since you're good enough. With this game it's practically impossible, because it's very dependent on trial and error. Essentially, in my opinion, it's taking the exact wrong things from challenging games it seems to have been inspired by and multiplies them tenfold. A good game rewards being adaptable, attentive, thinking quick, etc. This game rewards only the time you put in it, which manifests in you knowing how to pass every single obstacle. Sure, they might get easier and quicker to figure out and master if you're "good" enough at this "game", but is that really a skill you want to spend so much time developing?\n\nI'm not gonna touch on the art and music. Some of the music was nice, some of it extremely unmemorable. Some of the art is pretty, some is ugly and garish. Personally I'm not a fan of the main chatacter's sprite and animations, for example, but I'm not minding that when I give out my general opinion on the game.\n\nAnd the opinion is as follows: when it comes to challenging platformers, I think you should do yourself a favor, not buy into the idea that you need to prove something by overcoming this game's ridiculous challenge, and avoid it in favor of better indie platformers that might not quite demand as much but give back much more.\n\nOf course, if you read this review and got very excited for this game from my descriptions, by all means go ahead and get it. Although I urge you to reconsider and instead do something productive!","September 4, 2015","false","15.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If you want a good example of what you will be buying, google Cat Mario and you will have a remarkably similar experience. Bosses are incredibly random at times and can stand around doing nothing for 5 seconds or throw 2-3 mechanics in your face at once.  By far the most clunky aspect of this game is Vi's attacks after you get the ability to shoot three orbs and 'melee detection' comes into play. Regardless of your timing orbs will continue to shoot even in if the enemy is an inch in front of your face. I have no idea what the developer was thinking here but it absolutely does not function correctly.  The second half of the game is so buggy you will find yourself falling through platforms and enemies will continue attacking you after they are killed. This is particularly true with melee enemies where if you kill them there is still a few seconds where they can attack you despite their model being invisible.  Bosses will not spawn forcing you to commit suicide to reset the area and one boss can clip completely out of their area making the fight significantly more "difficult." Its like the game is half finished.\n\nSound is what you would expect from this sort of title. Certainly nothing special but it is probably the least criticizable part of the game.

Checkpoint? OH GODS YES A MEANINGLESS SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT.\n\nWelcome to Wings of Vi a game which claims to take out the arbitrary difficulty and install a system of skill based gameplay.\n\nHowever last I checked battering your head off a brick wall was not a skill valued outside of a mental institute.\n\nThere seems to have been somewhat of a surge of games claiming to be skill based after the rise of the "souls" series. Wings of Vi seems to be the latest iteration of games in this series taking the tired formula of platforming and smearing a paste of overly tuned jumps and puzzles at you. Then claiming that these mentally simple but executionally hard puzzles are something only the skifull one wil be able to beat when in reality the age old formula of hitting rocks withe other rocks again and agains until one is vaguely wheel shaped works far better. Expect puzzles that can be mentally solved by your second try but you are unable to beat for hours on end because of the precise requirements and oh every complaint about checkpoint systems being validated ever.\n\nComplaining about the puzzles so far I've found said puzzles sadly linear. Far from the open spaces of They bleed pizels mid levels a series of tight spaces prevails here which can only be beat by a series of sequentially input in time button combinations. Oh look, we're learning button combos? May as well go play Street fighter, Blazblue, guilty gear, Mortal Kombat, Persona 4 Golden Arcade or any other fighting game because at least you will get internet famous playing those.\n\nThat said the boss fights(one of them at this point but i've heard good things browsing the forum) have been entertaining so far to say the least. They give a face to the repeated grindfest giving you a desire to punch Myougis Chortling face in with your angel stick that combined with the dialogue gives you a good reason to get invested in the characters. These are the skillful areas we were promised with a difficulty level that can be beaten first time if you're good but probably won't be. Really this is what I would like to see more of with smoother less frustrating filler levels ( or more puzzle based seeing as the game is already basically a series of execution based puzzles) to prepare us for each boss.\n\nIn addition the customization in this game is pretty extensive with secrets abound for obsessives definatly a stength of the game with which i can find few flaws beyond the get item immediately equip it cycling you can expect from such a system that doesn't really give you time to play dress up properly. The music doesn't seem to be anything to write home about, monotonous and repetitive it serves it's purpose but rarely excites me and is more there it seems to blend the minutes into hours into days.\n\nFinally those Angels are damn adorable and this is why I'm giving it a thumbs up. Sure it's not my type of game beyond Adorable Angels, playing dress up and a platformer style but for those who enjoy the mega hard "look mama I got masochist of the year award...again!" gameplay theres definatly a solid game here at a good price point with a nice aesthetic.","December 15, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It's just a game made to appeal to a very specific niche of people: gamers who don't care for a story and want to play a frustratingly hard platformer.\n\nWhile this game is not without its redeeming qualities (for a specific audience)  I found that within 15 minutes of buying the game I was regretting the purchase, and will likely be requesting a refund. So what's wrong with the game? For me, it was three main things:\n\n1) Very weak story. The game starts off with a 10-second story in which you walk into Jeh Oul's prison, throw rocks at him, he's freed, makes the expected generic threat, and escapes. You step outside and everything's gone to ♥♥♥♥. That's all the story you get. If you actually take time to explore the houses at the start of the game, you'll find just a little more backstory, but it's still not much. After that, you're dumped into the game without any real objective than "rescue my friend". While I understand the story is not the selling point of this game, I still found the lack of effort put into world building off-putting, as I wasn't inspired to try to beat this game, or to find out what comes next. For me, this was one of the main things that killed the game for me, as from moment one the game felt less like an adventure and more like something I was doing just to say I did it.\n\n2) Difficulty. As I mentioned, the game is made to appeal to masochistic, platformer-loving gamers. While I have no issue with playing a difficult platformer, this game doesn't ease into the difficulty, which I felt was a huge issue. Within a minute of freeing the demon king, I found myself having to execute very difficult maneuvers that left less than a few milimeters for error, which quickly led to me getting frustrated as it took me an average of 2-3 minutes to move from checkpoint to checkpoint (the checkpoints, on normal at least, are not very far apart at all). The most irritating part is that it wasn't just one maneuver at a time, it was often a series of 2-3 jumps that needed perfect execution or you'd die. Given that the game had literally just started, and it likely only gets harder from the beginning onward, I found myself wondering what I was doing playing this game.\n\n3) I got lost. As I mentioned in the first point, there's no real objective in this game. There's no arrow that says "go this way", there's no context to follow, you're literally just standing outside the prison and given a weapon. I decided to keep moving forward, a strategy which worked until the second miniboss (20 minutes in). After that, I encountered a dead end, with no indication as to where I should go next. It was at that point that I decided that this game wasn't for me. I don't mind mazes, but the other two points mentioned above, paired with the fact I was lost left me entirely uninterested in progressing further.\n\nThat's pretty much it. As far as mechanics, art, music, and gameplay go, I would say that it's all pretty good. Were the game executed better, I might be writing a positive review as it has the potential to be good. Unfortunately however, I'm not.","July 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It is an extremely difficult game. I do enjoy these games, but not when the controls become a hindrance to the playability. I also had a really horrible experience after receiving the time travelling device. After playing with the device a bit, I decide to return to where i was and continue the game. After I "time travelled" to the exact same place i was currently at in the game and after dieing over 100 times on that section, the game wouldn't let me continue because I was  in "time travel" mode and found out you need to select the travel to current time option to continue the game. This completely ruined it for me. I don't enjoy being required to redo everything over especially in a game like this.

Seriously... This game is BEYOND frustrating, and I could swear the developer HATES gamers. That's literally the only explanation I can come up with as to why this game is so infuriatingly hard, and I MEAN that in the WORST way possible. The only redeeming factor of this game is its art design, and story, which are both interesting and appealing in more ways than one (if you catch my drift). However, I do feel like this game could benefit from being a LOT easier and accessible. So, as a personal favor to Grynsoft, PLEASE make the sequel, or your next game easier. I WANT to LIKE Wings of Vi, but, I just can't...\n\nThis game is harder than Shin Megami Tensei IV, and that game is only hard because of its poorly designed map, and lack of clear instructions for side quests. I feel like Wings of Vi is extremely cheap in its difficulty, but I wouldn't be as frustrated if I DIDN'T like the game. I do. It's addicting, and the controls are tight and responsive, and again, that art style. I love the retro aesthetic; it's something I am drawn to, even if... the actual game itself is kind of a piece of garbage.\n\nGrynsoft, baby, I love ya, but dammit, this ♥♥♥♥'s gotta stop!\n\nLet me reiterate my point.

I must admit that it's my fault for not looking into the game or playing the demo (which I highly suggest you should do before considering this game) more by doing research and stuff but I don't like doing so because I feel that doing research on a game will ruin the surprises and plot that lie ahead.\n\nBut anyways, I saw a lot of negative reviews about this game being hard as hell but I was kinda okay with that if it's gonna be hard but rewarding I would definitely go for it. Bottom line: Fun? Kinda. Rewarding? No. For some reason I was actually expecting a Binding of Isaac kinda gamestyle. As in, random power-ups which made BoI such a kickass game. But keep in mind that this is not an arcade style game but rather a story-based. Imagine playing Binding of Isaac with maps that won't change everytime you die (which of course is what most story-based games do) [And trust me you WILL die A LOT] only a few fixed (fixed meaning the power-ups are always the same ones at the same place) power-ups. This creates a zero or minuscule replay value. I could play BoI over and over again but Wings of Vi? Not a chance.\n\nThat's basically what I thought would make the game much more fun and exciting. Power-ups and change of environment. But of course it's just my opinion and maybe you would like these types of games.\n\nIn conclusion, the:\n\nGood side of this game:\n1. Nice retro looking graphics and music.\n2. Smoothish controls.\n3. BOOOOOOOOOBS.\n\nBad side of this game:\n1. Hard as ♥♥♥♥. (even on the easiest mode)\n2. A story-based game. (the story which is rather meh so in my opinion should've been focused more on putting in more fun elements)\n3. Lots of repetition due to dying a lot.\n4. Has pretty much zero replay value due to lack of variation each time it's played.\n\nAs I've said this is just my opinion and you might like the game so I'd say give the demo a try and if you're some kinda masochist for death, enjoy replaying the same and exact mediocre stories over again then this is your game ;) Peace","January 27, 2015","false","9.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","4"

This isn't quite a bullet hell but it feels somewhere in between to me.\n\nI used to be heavy in the competetive dustforce racing community. This game is as if I were to make a map for the dustforce racing community, where you need to know perfect timing and your character super well, but then I released it as a game. The enemies are faster, more nimble than you in general and they have too much health, imo. One good slash should end some of them but it doesn't and, since they're so fast they just swing around you chipping away at you. There's little flow to prepare you for different enemy types or platforming challengings. The sprites DO have boobs, but I think that's to ease the pain of how freaking hard the game is.

Actually I do reccomend this game to any avid hardcore platform gamer. Its a great challenge and has some very unique mechanics I've never seen used in a game before. It does bring a lot of new things to the table, and I think it does it fairly well. If you are an experienced platformer, this is a very good title to try out!\n\nWhy do I choose to overall not reccomend you might ask? I find this game to have some balance issues, and overall challenge of the game is something that the everyday gamer might find impossible to get through.\n\nPros:\n-Visually beautiful game. The artist did a great job on everything, and the animation is very satisfying.\n-Character customization. Usually games like this have little to no customization, and it gives it a bit of a personal feel to the game when you can spruce up a character.\n-Very challenging. The game keeps you at a constant challenge, giving the player much satisfaction when you complete a level. (At the same time, this is also the game's greatest weakness)\n-The game mechanics. They are extremely unique, there so many creative combinations of movesets for you to use to progress. It really makes you think at times, and its not always obvious how to overcome an obstacle.\n\nCons:\n-No pause button. I have no idea if this was a bug or not. But when I pressed start, the pause menu popped up but the game kept going in the background. This may or may not have been just me or been patched. So take it with a grain of salt.\n-Occasional camera issues. The game sometimes had poor placement of camera, where you couldn't see what you were about to jump into. Even times where there was no implied direction, so you had to jump off a platform in a leap of faith and hope its the right direction.\n-Learning the game. This game brings a lot of unique mechanics to a platformer game, that really challenges everything you know about platformers, and I like that. However I didn't really see much of an opportunity to learn the mechanics very much. Its good that the game has challenge, but I think that challenge comes too quickly. I would have liked to see dumbed down levels in the beginning to help me better understand the game's use of it's mechanics.\n-The difficulty. Now this is like I said the greatest part, and the worst part of the game. The game has difficulty settings that are for the most part pointless. I feel that easy mode is still far too challenging for being easy. It feels like medium and hard, with more checkpoints, and maybe health. I feel the game doesn't do enough to make an entry level platformer feel welcomed into this title. I think thats what sets this game apart from a "recommended" to "not recommended" simply because I think this game caters to a very specific gamer.\n-Sometimes its punishing for no reason. If there is one thing I don't like about some games, is that they are punishing, for the sake of being punishing. There are times in this game where the game will just throw you off with no warning. I like to at least have a chance to correct any mistakes I make. Even if I die in a game, I would only want to blame my lack of competence. Not the game itself\n\n==Summery==\nOverall this is a solid title, but it caters to a specific audience with little to no appeal to the average or beginner platform gamers. If you are experienced this is a great title to pick up and have at it. It has a lot of repetition, very unique mechanics, and requires creative thinking.\n\nIf you are the developer reading this, I hope you found something useful in my feedback! I wish you luck on future projects, I look forward to what else you have to offer :)\n\nP.S. I did have a issues syncing my logitech controller. It was not being read by the game, and I had to setup xpadder to use my controller. Model # f310. This controller works with all other games. Not sure if this was just me or not, but if you're the developer, this could be useful information to know <:","December 8, 2014","false","3.1"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Janguinia/recommended/318530/","Janguinia","Anlysia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Janguinia/","442 products in account","An exercise in frustration from a designer that's just not very good.\n\nNo, I didn't get very far because having my time wasted is just tiresome.\n\nThe primary mechanic is a drop-jump, where you can jump anywhere in midair, but only once. This means basically every jump you think you MIGHT be able to make...you can't. Unless you run off the ledge, then jump in midair for that extra foot of boost. So every time you just approach a jump like any sensible game, you're going to be short. And die. And forced to replay a section.\n\nThen you get a flutter-feather item that allows you to hover briefly, and immediately are forced to use it to snake between instant-kill traps on the top and bottom. If you mess up? Yes, you're replaying a section again.\n\nThe instant-kill traps are chained in succession immediately after you get the flutter item, meaning you're going to be forced to replay the same bits over and over right when a powerup should be FUN: When you get to play around with it and see how your skillset has expanded. Instead any enjoyment you'd derive from a new item and new exploration/manoeuvre ability is killed by immediately being told you have to be an expert with it, or else you're going to hit your head against the wall.\n\nEven in the short amount I played, I ran into three seperate enemies/obstacles that were invulnerable, but still reacted and appeared to take damage when attacked...only displaying a "0" showed me they weren't taking damage. This is honestly unacceptable. If you can't damage an enemy MAKE THAT PLAIN via another type of reaction. If they're never killable, make them not able to be hit at all. If you can do it, later, somehow...use some kind of "bounce off" where it's plain you're hitting but just unable to injure.\n\nAdd to this enemies that fly around rapidly, take multiple hits, and who aren't hitstunned so they simply run through your attacks and hit you...and you have a recipe for tremendous frustration at the designer.\n\nAt this point I just became frustrated and quit, I'm unwilling/unable to force myself through the bad design any more in order to try to find the "good" in the game.\n\nCould have used actual playtesting from someone not interested in how "hardcore" they are. I'd recommend it to no-one.\n\nAddendum: All the comments I'm receiving are "You suck at this genre, so get good." Maybe I do. But maybe people would like to know beforehand what the game is like, for people who don't excel in this particular genre of game. It isn't noted anywhere in particular that the game is extremely difficult in a particularly genre-specific manner. It just looks like a 2D platformer with some well-done visuals.\n\nIf you know you like this type of game, my review isn't going to be useful. If you aren't aware what sort of game this is, and you don't like that type of game? It's probably going to be useful. That's why this review is here.","November 28, 2014","false","0.4"," 46 of 174 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","46","174","0","5"

It is tons of fun and it's excrutiatingly hard on every mode. I suggest you buckle up because you will want to punch everything while playing this game. It puts you in situations of impossibility and expect you to figure out the near-impossible solution. And the only thing hard than that is actually doing it.

It's not that bad of a game at all, it's just extremely unforgiving, even on the easier difficulties.\n\nI did experience a few frustrations. There's no tutorial, as far as I could tell.  I do find it strange there's no attack animation, even though you're given a physical weapon.\n\nThe jumping in this game, as far as my computer would allow me to go, was so irritating. I found myself smashing R to reset more often than any other key on my keyboard because a tiny microscopic difference between jumps means life or death. That's extremely frustrating, especially when you're playing with less checkpoints.\n\nThe game menu that's normally assigned to the Escape key is bound to Enter, which also exits any menu.\n\n9/10, I suggest the author standardizes the keybindings, or allows the editing of them in-game.\n\nZ to jump, and C for movement abilities is fine, but having the attack key as X confuses the fingers. I'd suggest remapping to spacebar for the jumping, and Shift for movement. This allows the hand to rest on the keyboard in a natural way. The other keys can then be bound along the ASD or QWE line.\n\nDespite the controls issue, this is a really great game. I'm not a platformer type of person, so I wont be playing much of this anymore, but I do suggest to others to purchase it as I did.\n\nYou can also get this game through the HumbleBundle website, if you'd like to also support charities as well.","April 17, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite that, it's quite fair to the player. The rules, i.e. the hitbox, enemy types and so on remain consistent throughout the game, making your personal skill the only thing that matters. Most of the difficulty lies in the platforming sections, often requiring quick reflexes, precise movement and occasionally creativity. The platforming is broken up with a variety of colourful bosses, requiring sound strategy and endurance to outlast them. Wings of Vi is a good pick for platforming enthusiasts, because its brutal difficulty will likely deter all but the most persistent of players.","April 1, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Doomed mode gives you 1 life but 400% health)\n+Boobs?\n\nCons\n-May induce a rage that causes you to throw and break things that are near you\n-Some FPS issues (will bounce between 60 and 30 sometimes but a minor issue)\n-Some minor bugs (I had some issues with v-sync)\n-Story is meh (not that you would buy it for story anyway)\n-Not keyboard and mouse friendly, not that it needs to be, but I wouldnt suggest playing this without a controller.\n-Price might be too much for some people (it was worth it to me but may not be for you.)\n\nThere is a lot of things that can be said about this game but the biggest factor of wether or not you should buy it and will enjoy is its difficulty. This game is incredibly challenging and difficult, but is heavily skill based and very rarely unfair, meaning if you die its your fault. You will find yourself falling to death again and again just to finally make it and hit the spikes at the next jump. Bosses are 100ft walls that laugh at your futile attempts to climb over them while crushing you everytime you fail. But the feeling you get when you finally get past those tough sections is very rewarding indeed. To put that in a bit more perspective, here are my stats (roughly off the top of my head) for my first run though the game, my second run, and my best run.\n\nFirst run\nTime:~25 hours      Deaths:~2500     Difficulty:Angel (easy mode)\n\nSecond run\nTime:~3 hours       Deaths:~250      Difficulty:Angel (easy mode)\n\nBest\nTime:~57 min     Deaths: ~50-60      Difficulty:Angel (easy mode)\n\nI think those numbers say a lot about the games difficulty and fairness considering the differences between my first and second runs. Each death will teach you something and you will get better because of it. There are also save points (more will apear on lower difficulties) that are well placed so progressing isnt impossible, but still difficult. All in all the game is very rewarding to play when you finally beat that boss or get past a tricky jump/trap. If you want a challenge with rewarding platforming and fantastic boss fights this game is for you. If you rage easy I'd recommend having a nice stock of controllers on hand.\n\n10/10 would die again.\n","May 5, 2015","true","164.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3147/recommended/318530/","3147","Arsonist Cow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3147/","1058 products in account","Let's just start out by saying that I adore challenging games, a la' Dark Souls and Super Meat Boy (both of which I've played through several times and clocked hundreds of hours in).\nBut this game goes beyond that. This game is so challenging, so picky in what it wants you to do that it actually becomes detrimental to the experience in my opinion. The platforming oftentimes requires pixel-perfect precision, resulting in tens of deaths per jumping puzzle.\n\nThe game is remarkably arbitrarily difficult for a game that takes pride in removing said difficulty.\nThere are occasionally off-screen enemies or traps that leave you with very little room to react. This is partially a result of the character being too big in relation to the environment. This adds unnecessary trial and error difficulty.\n\nMovement is nice and fluid and the flutter mechanic is quite clever, but hitboxes are poorly defined.\nFlutter and slide are bound to one button and the flutter is affected by physics, meaning it doesn't always respond the same way.\nThe attack is controlled with the same directional pad/stick as the movement. This issue is exacerbated a little ways into the game when you gain a ranged attack, making moving and attacking really clunky and unintuitive. It also automatically switches between ranged and melee depending on the distance to your enemies. Let's just say that this doesn't work flawlessly.\n\nNew abilities are introduced at a nice pace and obstacles are scaled up with every new ability you gain.\nBut the difficulty curve is really inconsistent, sometimes throwing in one or two jumping puzzles that take as much time as the rest of the level combined.\n\nSome bosses are nicely designed with clear attack patterns and clever variations on previous attacks when enraged (loved the Dark Annihilator), but others simply do a one-time set of attacks when enraged, adding extra trial and error that feels rather cheap.\nSome also have wonky angular enemy shooting patterns, which becomes a problem when paired with a large ill-defined oblong hitbox.\n\nThe pixel art is a mixed bag. Some things look great, others look plain bad.\nDistinction between foreground and background can be questionable at times and there are occasionally foreground objects that obstruct the view, which is a clear case of putting form above function.\n\nThe music is great. It's varied and unique, although occasionally unfitting for the scenes presented.\nStory is barebones and of little interest.\n\n\nConclusionI really wanted to like this game, but with all these flaws I just can't recommend it.\nIf you want a good, challenging platformer I would recommend looking at Super Meat Boy, Electronic Super Joy, Cave Story+ or Megaman X4 instead.","April 13, 2015","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I beat it, I'll update the review.\n\nWings of Vi is a platformer.  It's super cute and has customization of your main character, with secrets and cheevos that unlock new stuff to do that with.  It will also jackhammer your cervix until you're just like "no, get off me, that's too hard."\n\nThe controls are super tight and responsive, but this game is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficult.  They say they're aiming for skill-based gameplay instead of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and I guess in a way that's true.  But you should expect pixel-perfect jumping and difficult combat being required of you IMMEDIATELY, and it never lets up.  Every new movement item you get is followed by a platforming section that tests the limits of what you can now do, usually with some enemies sprinkled in on top of it.  Your sense of timing often has to be near-perfect to get through, and it only gets harder as you go.  I really recommend that you start on Angel difficulty until you get used to things.  Keep in mind when I say this stuff that I've beaten Super Meat Boy and They Bleed Pixels.\n\nI think part of the difficulty comes from subervsion of expectations when it comes to movement.  The way the jumping and moving works in this game, you can actually get to places that, in most other platformers, you really just couldn't.  The level design tests the limits of sliding, fluttering, and double jumping.  You'll see a screen and be like "what the ♥♥♥♥, how am I supposed to get up there?" but you totally can.  Also, some of the difficulty comes from your first weapon being really short ranged, kinda like a crappier crissaegrim (from SOTN), and enemies moving really fast, so you have to position yourself such that you can hit them as you're dodging them by a hair.\n\nIt's a lot of fun, but just come prepared with lots of lube and be ready to restart a lot.","February 22, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd end up switching back and forth between different save files, Angel / Mortal (the lesser difficulties) for solving "puzzles" the first time (figuring out the timings for jumps / mine carts / gliding / hitting switches / etc), and then back to Demon (the harder difficulty) so I could actually enjoy the boss fights rather than annihilating them.

If I were to compare it to anything its more like the super dungeon in Cave Story, or star levels in Mario, only stretched out to an entire game. This games difficulty is FIRM but FAIR, and I love that.\n\nEvery zone/level has a unique gimmick to it making every area different, and getting new powers does not make the game easier, instead, levels adapt to your new powers and introduce challenges and platforming segments that test them and your ability to use them. The level design is absolutely wonderful in this regard, and it always keep you on your toes. The game definitely gets more fun as soon as your first power is introduced.\n\nEnemies and bosses remind me of dark souls, in that they attack in a way and in patters where everything can be dodged and dealt with in a fair manner, you will take damage because you were too slow to dodge, or because you got greedy and tried to get extra hits in when you should have run away. The combat has it's own little rhythm and dance to it, and thats great too.\n\nVisually the game is nice and stylized, bosses look good, animations look good, and everything runs buttery smooth. The games' music is fantastic, every boss has a unique theme, every level has playlist worthy music in it, its great.\n\nOn the negative side however, there seems to be a bug where when you slide your character will stand up randomly, and when you're dodging attacks this can lead to some unfair deaths, but it doesn't happen too often. The main problem is that everything I praised about the game, doesn't apply very much to the first level. Now, the platforming is still strict and well thought out, however every enemy type in the first level moves in a sporatic and chaotic fashion and do not have stun frames or knockback when you hit them. This leads to very cheap feeling opponents that deal damage to you in very unfair manners. With only a jump the platforming isn't very creative, so it does feel kind of dull jumping through levels in that regard, the music is nothing to write home about either. The boss fight is still good, but definitely the weakest out of all the bosses.\n\nOverall, if you love super difficult platformers and want to test your skill this is the game for you, I highly recommend it, but beware, you have a rocky start before any of the real fun begins.","March 27","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are fairly good, the music is meh, story is simple ect. This game lives and die by its dificult gameplay.

It’s outright frustrating, because it demands top-notch precision in almost every jump you make. So, basically, if you make one small mistake, if you are one bit slower or faster than required - you fail and start from the last checkpoint.\n\nI like challenging games, but only when the challenge makes some sense. The idea of a nice platformer with a cute customizable protagonist with gradually opening abilities seems solid, but this game is so much more tiresome than entertaining.","June 4","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
