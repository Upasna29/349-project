Heartwarming story I cried so hard I ♥♥♥♥ myself, the best gameplay I have ever seen with top of the notch graphics even my alienware gaming laptop couldn't handle it. Forget Fallout 3 or Halo, buy this game, you're not wasting money, you're investing in your future, because once you play 10 minutes of this game you WILL have the equivalent of a veterinary doctorate.","July 27, 2014","true","0.2"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","52","16","31","14","0"

At first I had problems getting it to work, but after I fixed the screen resolution, there were no more problems. Lovely, fun, a bit time consuming. I would totally recomend it to other people.

Kids will love it for sure xD I love it too. But it needs a button for skipping time. The time between appointments is a drag :( But once you get all sorts of animals in the pen, you get bussier.
