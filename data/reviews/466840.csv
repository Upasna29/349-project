NOT FUNNY! NOT INTERESTING! I like side scrolling shooting games, and I am happy with fairly basic graphics. You would be better off opening notepad and moving the mouse around an assembly of characters you have placed on the screen than playing this game. There is not even the most basic 'physics simulation'; move your mouse and the sprite will be there immediately. The author of this game seems to have the most infantile sense of humour I have encountered. If you want a good side scrolling shooting game, please search for Stargunner and you will find it can be downloaded for free. If you want a quick and easy side scrolling shooting game, please search for Alpha Bounty and play it in your browser; it is many times better than this feeble attempt. This game is cheaper than a bar of chocolate, but I am going to request a refund anyway because I object to the fact that this rubbish can be placed on Steam, a platform for games, when it is more like a scribble on a piece of paper while somebody was bored during a telephone conversation than anything resembling a game.","June 4","false","0.1"," 43 of 67 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","43","67","6","0"

The hitboxes are absolutely atrocious and will cause you to get hit by things you shouldn't have actually been hit by. There's pickups, but you'll find yourself getting hit by miles away objects trying to get them. The pug moves far too fast for being "in space". The description does mention that this is a "speedy bullet hell", but I would describe this as being too fast and not enough bullet hell.\n\nThere are no unlockables to get, leaving you with a black pug on a black background shooting at dark coloured objects (since, you know, you're in space). There's no options menu, and the leaderboards will take you out of the game (and, in one case after a level, trying to cancel out of submitting my score closed the game).\n\nI cannot recommend Super Space Pug at all. If you're in the market for bullet hell games, there are far better ones out there on Steam.","June 4","false","0.2"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","19","29","2","0"

This is a poorly made game, hence the price. Even so, there are better games for a dollar and under, so go buy those, or even trading cards, because the 3 seconds of enjoyment you'll gain from hitting the "buy" button on the market for the trading cards will be better and longer lasting than the enjoyment you will gain from this game.","June 4","false","0.1"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","12","21","4","0"

I can barely tell whats going on, and I just die randomly. Save your soul, never play this "game".  I only got this game through the pug bundle because it was cheaper than the original price of super mega neo pug, which isn't a bad game. Never buy this game.\n\nI have made this review after I played for 1 minute, so I had to go back and play more.
